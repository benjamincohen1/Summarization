p53, a critical regulator of cell proliferation, transmits signals
to genes that control the cell cycle and apoptosis (or programmed cell
death) when cells are under stress (1-2). These functions are
principally controlled by the ability of p53 to bind to DNA with
sequence specificity and activate transcription.
