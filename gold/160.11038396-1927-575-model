Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are often propagated by extracerebral inoculation. The mechanism of spread from peripheral portals of entry to the central nervous system (neuroinvasion) is complex: while lymphatic organs typically show early accumulation of prions, and B-cells and follicular dendritic cells are required for efficient neuroinvasion, actual entry into the central nervous system occurs probably via peripheral nerves and may utilize a PrPC-dependent mechanism.
