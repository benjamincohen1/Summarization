For example, promiscuous binding of HNF4, RXR, COUP-TFI, ARP-1 and PPAR-RXR to DR1 elements present in the promoters of several genes can alter their gene expression patterns in different tissues (4 to 21). Liver is an ideal tissue to study cross-talk amongst DR1-binding nuclear receptors since a majority of such receptors are expressed in liver and are implicated in the regulation of several hepatic genes (34).
