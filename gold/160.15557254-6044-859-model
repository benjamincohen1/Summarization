Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) such as Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease (CJD) and its variant form (vCJD) in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and scrapie in sheep are invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. The agents that cause TSEs are widely believed to represent a unique biological principle of infection. According to the prion hypothesis (Prusiner, 1982, 1998), TSE agents (so-called proteinaceous infectious particles or prions) consist essentially  to  if not entirely  to  of a misfolded form of the prion protein (PrP)
