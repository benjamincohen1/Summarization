Alzheimer s disease (AD) is characterized clinically by progressive dementia and neuropathologically by neuronal loss, formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Senile plaques have deposits primarily composed of a 40 to 42 amino acid peptide called ss-amyloid peptide (Ass), which is derived from the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Three genes [APP, presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2)] have been identified as harboring pathogenic mutations that affect APP processing (1).
