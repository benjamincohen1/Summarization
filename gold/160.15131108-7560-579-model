The human PrP gene (PRNP) exists in two major allelic forms that encode either methionine or valine at codon 129, with allele frequencies of 0.63 and 0.37 in western European and American populations, respectively (8, 9). This polymorphism is a key determinant of susceptibility to sporadic (10) and acquired (8, 11) prion diseases and may affect age at onset (12 to 14).
