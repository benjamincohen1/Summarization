antibodies against Ass generated in response to vaccination slowed the rate of cognitive decline in patients with AD (Hock et al., 2002<IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"

Along with Ass generation, intramembraneous proteolysis of APP also liberates the APP intracellular C-terminus (AICD) from the membrane. AICD was described long after the initial identification of APP (Passer et al., 2000<IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
