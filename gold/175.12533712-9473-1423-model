We have previously demonstrated that HPV L1 VLPs obtained by self-assembly of L1 protein lacking the last nine C-terminal amino acids had lost their capacity to bind DNA and transfer genes into target cells (Touze et al., 2000). Moreover, addition of this sequence at the N terminus of the major capsid protein of an RNA virus, the rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), allowed the production of chimeric VLPs that could encapsidate DNA and transfer reporter genes into cells (El Mehdaoui et al., 2000). These experiments suggest a central role for this short sequence in DNA binding, interacting with the cell surface of target cells and facilitating the nuclear import of complexes owing to the presence of an NLS. In order to verify the role of this positively charged sequence, we investigated the possibility of using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 14 C-terminal amino acids of the HPV-16 L1 protein in DNA transfection experiments. The study was then extended to positively charged sequences of the HPV-16 L2 protein and the L1 protein of four other HPVs.
