Scrapie is an infectious neurodegenerative fatal disease of sheep and goats belonging to the group of transmissible subacute spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), along with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), chronic wasting disease and Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease. All TSEs are characterized by long incubation periods, disturbances in behaviour and movement, degeneration in tissues of the central nervous system (CNS) and accumulation of an abnormal isoform of the host-encoded cellular prion protein in tissues of the CNS.
