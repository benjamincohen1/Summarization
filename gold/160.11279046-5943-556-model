Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
(TSEs)1 are a group of fatal
neurodegenerative diseases that include scrapie in sheep and goats,
bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, chronic wasting disease in
deer and elk, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The pre-eminent
neuropathological feature of TSEs is the accumulation of the
disease-specific, protease-resistant isoform of prion protein,
designated as PrP-res or PrPSc, in the central nervous
system.
