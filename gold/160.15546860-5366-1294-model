The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Staussler-Scheinker disease, and fatal familial insomnia of humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy of cattle, and naturally occurring scrapie of sheep and goats. Scrapie in rodents is the commonly used model system for the study of these disorders. By light microscopy, these diseases are characterized by neuronal loss, astrogliosis, vacuolar degeneration, and variable degrees of amyloid plaque formation (1). Ultrastructural examination has shown vacuolar degeneration results from synaptic deterioration, cytoskeletal disruption, membrane dissolution, and membrane fusion (2). Quantitative studies suggest a progression from synaptic loss to neuritic degeneration and neuronal death (3). A wealth of data indicate these diseases are due to prions (4). Prions are self-propagating proteinaceous infectious particles composed of an abnormal conformer of a normally expressed protein known as the prion protein (PrP)
