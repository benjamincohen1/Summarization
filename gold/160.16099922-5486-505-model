Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders and include (among others) familial, sporadic and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and scrapie in sheep. TSEs (or prion diseases) are characterized by the formation and accumulation of protease-resistant prion protein (PrPSc) mainly in tissues of the central nervous system.
