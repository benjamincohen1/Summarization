The prion diseases, which include Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, and scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in animals, are a group of fatal, transmissible, neurodegenerative conditions. The human prion diseases are unique in that they may have a sporadic, inherited or transmitted aetiology (Collinge, 2001), and there is evidence that BSE-like prions have infected humans (Collinge et al., 1996; Bruce et al., 1997; Hill et al., 1997). A common feature of all prion diseases is the post-translational conversion of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC), a host-encoded, glycosylphosphotidylinositol (GPI)-anchored sialoglycoprotein (Stahl et al., 1987), into an abnormal isoform termed PrPSc
