Support for this amyloid hypothesis of AD came from several lines of experimental evidence. In particular, mutations in familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) genes, such as -amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, have been shown to regulate the processing of APP and result in increased production and aggregation of A-(1-42) (14-20).
