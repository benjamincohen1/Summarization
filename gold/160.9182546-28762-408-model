35S-PrPC derived from two PrP
genotypes associated with high susceptibility to scrapie were converted
to 35S-PrP-res in the cell-free conversion reaction with
much greater efficiency than PrPC from a scrapie-resistant
PrP genotype, indicating that this in vitro assay closely
parallels important aspects of TSE pathogenesis.
