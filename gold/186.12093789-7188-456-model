The presence of mutant genes that encode presenilins (PSs) PS1 and PS2 have been linked to early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) (Rogaev et al., 1995; Sherrington et al., 1995), and an increased deposition of Ass in plaques has been associated with these mutations (Sherrington et al., 1995; Scheuner et al., 1996).
