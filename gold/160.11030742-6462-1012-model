Prion protein (PrP) is associated with an unusual class of neurodegenerative diseases, which includes scrapie in sheep; bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle; and kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familiar insomnia (FFI) in humans (Prusiner, 1996<IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
