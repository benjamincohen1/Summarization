Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs)1 are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, scrapie, and chronic wasting disease in animals. Intraneuronal vacuolization, severe neuronal cell death, astrogliosis, and microglia activation are the main hallmarks of TSEs (1). At the molecular level, TSEs are characterized by progressive cerebral accumulation of a misfolded protease-resistant isoform (PrPres) of the host-encoded cellular prion protein
