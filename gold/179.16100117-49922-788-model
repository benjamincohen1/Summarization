Synergistic stimulation was noted with HNF-4 and with RAR/RXR, but COUP-TF 1 and 2 inhibited both the basal level of gene transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter and the activation for transcription by HNF-4 when co-transfected together with HNF-4 (Fig. 5, a and b). In agreement with these results, De Martino et al. (53) recently reported that COUP-TF either cooperates or inhibits GR-mediated induction of transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter (among others) in HepG2 cells.
