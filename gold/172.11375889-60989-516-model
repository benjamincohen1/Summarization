p53 protein has been found to be associated with XPB, XPD and CSB. Inhibition of the helicase activities of these proteins by association with p53 suggests that enhancement of DNA repair is not the mechanism by which p53 maintains genomic integrity, at least not through the association with these repair proteins. Since DNA repair is not necessary in cells committed to apoptosis, these associations may be primarily involved in apoptosis
