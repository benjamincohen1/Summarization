Is the association of the PRNP locus with human long-term memory related to the susceptibility for prion diseases? In humans, but not in any other mammalian species (16<IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif">), PRNP displays the common methionine/valine polymorphism at codon 129. Approximately 40% of our population was heterozygous for this polymorphism, which is in line with reports in middle European populations (17<IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
