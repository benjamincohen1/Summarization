PS1 gene, which is linked to the majority of early-onset FAD located on
chromosome 14 (2), and PS2 gene (3), which is responsible for a subtype
of FAD linked to chromosome 1, encode homologous polytopic membrane
proteins that predominantly localize to endoplasmic reticulum (4-6)
and span the membrane 8 times (7).
