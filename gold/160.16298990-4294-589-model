Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a group of fatal, neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of an abnormal (aberrantly folded) isoform of a cellular host protein (PrPC), denominated prion protein (PrPSc) (Prusiner, 2001). Ovine and caprine scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and human variant Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease (vCJD) are all caused by this infectious agent.
