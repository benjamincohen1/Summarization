The study by Campion et al
 (1999) analysed DNA from 34
 families with FAD (obtained from all over France) for causative mutations.
 Probably pathogenic mutations were found in the PSEN1 gene in 19 families,
 mutations within the APP gene in another 5 and no mutations in the PSEN1,
 PSEN2 or APP genes in the remaining 10 families.
