Prion diseases form a group of fatal neurodegenerative
disorders including Creutzfeldt Jakob disease in humans and Scrapie and
bovine spongiform encephalopathy in animals (1). Most prion diseases
are characterized by the accumulation of an abnormally folded isoform
of the cellular prion protein
(PrPC)
