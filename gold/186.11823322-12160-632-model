Families carrying
 mutations in the PS-1 gene have the earliest ages of onset, which fall largely
 within the range 35-55 years, although one such family member has recently
 been recorded with onset at 24 years
 (Wisniewski et al,
 1998). These mutations are largely associated with early-onset
 familial Alzheimer's disease, but at least two of these mutations (Ala79Val
 and His163Tyr) have been observed with late-onset Alzheimer's disease and may
 be non-penetrant (Cruts et al,
 1998).
