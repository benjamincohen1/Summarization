It has been reported previously that mitochondrial dysfunction may have a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD (21 to 25), Alzheimer s disease (AD) (51 to 53) and Huntington s disease (HD) (33,54). Mutations in presenilin-1 increase the vulnerability of neural cells to mitochondrial toxins (52), and lymphoblasts from HD patients are abnormally susceptible to the induction of mitochondrial depolarization and apoptosis induced by apoptogenic stimuli (33).
