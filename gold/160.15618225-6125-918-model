Prion diseases, also called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs),1 are a group of neurodegenerative disorders including bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, chronic wasting disease in cervids, scrapie in sheep and goats, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) in humans. These diseases are closely associated with the conversion of the normal -helix-rich and protease-sensitive cellular isoform of prion protein (PrPsen or PrPc) into a -sheet-rich disease-related form (PrPres or PrPSc) that possesses abnormal physicochemical properties such as protease resistance, insolubility, and propensity to polymerize into amyloid-like fibrils
