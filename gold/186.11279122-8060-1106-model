Genetic analyses of diverse
familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) kindreds indicate biosynthesis of
the amyloid -peptide (A), generated by secretase-mediated endoproteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), is a common denominator in inherited forms of the disease. In the case of chromosome 21-linked FAD kindreds, mutations in APP are found in close
proximity to the endoprotease sites where A is excised by the action
of - and -secretases (2-6). Mutations in presenilins 1 and 2 are
thought to enhance cleavage of APP at the -secretase site (7-9).
