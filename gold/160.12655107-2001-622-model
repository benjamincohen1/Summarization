Scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) are transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases affecting domestic and exotic ruminants. In previous immunohistochemical studies, we have shown that different sheep TSE sources may be distinguished by both the proportion of disease-specific prion protein (PrPd) accumulation relative to different cell types in the brain (the  PrPd profile ) and by different labelling patterns for PrP peptide sequences within phagocytic cells.
