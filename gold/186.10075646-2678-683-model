The two homologous presenilins are
key factors for the generation of amyloid -peptide (A), since
Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated mutations enhance the production
of the pathologically relevant 42-amino acid A (A42), and a gene
knockout of presenilin-1 (PS1) significantly inhibits total A
production.
