Our analyses addressed interactions with APOE*4, the major known genetic determinant of Alzhei-mer s disease. Interactions with other genetic or environmental factors have not been studied. The trend for a stronger effect of APOE*4 in the presence of T allele carriage is interesting in the light of data suggesting that T carriage may affect the general intelligence (5).
