Several studies demonstrate that protein to protein and protein to DNA interactions of the nuclear receptors binding to the DR1 element result in positive or negative regulation of several hepatic genes (5,6,11). For example, HNF4, ARP-1 and COUP-TFI compete for binding to a DR1 element within the apolipoprotein CIII promoter and while HNF4 stimulates transcription, ARP-1 and COUP-TFI function as transcriptional repressors (5,6).
