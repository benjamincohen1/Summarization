More dramatically, the BSE agent may have also crossed the species barrier towards man, causing 44 cases of new variant Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease (Will et al., 1996  ; R. G. Will, personal communication; Chazot et al. , 1996 ), and there is little doubt that these patients have been contaminated through food. These diseases are characterized by the  accumulation of a pathological isoform of the host-encoded prion protein, called PrPres because of its enhanced resistance to proteolysis, which is the only specific marker. This protein  accumulates in the central nervous system (CNS) (Prusiner, 1982 ; Prusiner et al., 1982 ) and in some organs of the lymphoreticular system (LRS) (Doi et al., 1988 ; Farquhar et al., 1994 ). In stabilized experimental models, PrPres copurifies with infectivity and thus can be used as a marker for the presence of the infectious agent
