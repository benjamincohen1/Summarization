The larger proportion of 
familial AD patients (50-70% of all cases  > 50 families) 
have mutations within the PS-1 gene, which has been 
shown to be a hot spot for missense mutations, as greater than 35 different mutations have been identified so far (for 
review see Cruts et al., 1996; Haass, 1997).
