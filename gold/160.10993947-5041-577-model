The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a group of unusual neurodegenerative diseases that include Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, Gerstmann to Straussler to Scheinker syndrome and kuru in humans, as well as scrapie in sheep, transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. These diseases are characterized by the accumulation of abnormal aggregated isoforms of the prion protein (PrPSc) in affected animals.
