insulin-degrading enzyme and neprilysin have been argued to be
major proteases involved in the degradation of secreted A (5, 9).
However, with the data available at this time, it is impossible to
determine which, if any, of the identified proteases contributes most
to A degradation in the intact brain. It is likely that multiple
proteases, both intracellular and extracellular, may play a role in
determining A concentration. The relative contribution of
A-degrading enzymes and other mechanisms of A removal may vary in
different regions of the brain and may also differ for A40 and
A42. A decrease in the activity of any of these mechanisms, whether
they are major or minor, may potentially result in increased A
accumulation and the development of AD pathology
