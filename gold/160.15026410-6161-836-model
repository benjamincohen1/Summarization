Prion diseases are transmissible neurodegenerative disorders that include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE),1 scrapie in sheep, chronic wasting disease (CWD) of deer and elk, and human Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD). While the detailed mechanism of prion propagation remains to be determined, considerable evidence argues that prions are devoid of nucleic acid and are composed largely, if not entirely, of the scrapie isoform of the prion protein (PrP), referred to as PrPSc. During the disease process, PrPSc acts as a template for conversion by imposing its conformation on the normally benign host-encoded version of the prion protein
