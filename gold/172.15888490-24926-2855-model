there is now accumulating evidence that simply preventing the apoptotic response to p53 is not the same as losing p53 function completely. For example, the PUMA knock-out mice do not resemble p53-null animals with respect to tumor development, despite showing profound defects in their apoptotic response in many tissues (17,18). These observations therefore suggest that other activities of p53, such as the induction of cell-cycle arrest or senescence and the contribution to the maintenance of genomic stability, also play an important role in tumor suppression. As with apoptosis, pinning down the contribution of the cell-cycle arrest response to p53 tumor suppression has been complicated. Although the deletion of p21WAF1/CIP1, one of the key mediators of the proliferative block induced by p53, can enhance susceptibility to cancer development in some models (52), loss of p21WAF1/CIP1 is not equivalent to loss of p53. Indeed in some systems, loss of p21WAF1/CIP1 may even impede tumorigenesis, possibly as a reflection of tissue and system-dependent pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic activities of p21WAF1/CIP1 (53). However, notwithstanding this complexity in the contribution of p21WAF1/CIP1, it seems clear that the proliferative block induced by p53 in the shape of cell-cycle arrest or senescence may be as important in preventing cancer development as the induction of cell death. Some of this evidence has come from a reexamination of specific tumor derived p53 mutants that dissociate p53's apoptotic and cell-cycle responses. Initial tissue culture studies indicated that while these mutants remain competent in the induction of cell-cycle arrest, they fail to induce apoptosis (54). Interestingly, these p53 mutants function to enhance the transformation of cells in culture (55), adding further weight to the suggestion that apoptosis is the key tumor suppressor function of p53. More recently, however, a knock-in mouse expressing one such mutant p53 was created and interestingly, despite showing a complete loss of p53-mediated apoptosis and a reduced p53-induced cell-cycle arrest, these mice retained some ability to resist tumor development (56). Although clearly more susceptible to cancer than their wild-type littermates (suggesting apoptosis
