Alternative 5'UTRs have not been observed in sheep, which may point to a subdivision of PrP regulation into species with 5'UTR-directed control (hamster, cattle) and 3'UTR-directed control (sheep, goat). Considering that it is currently not clear to which of these groups the human and mouse PrP gene belong, it may be advisable to approach the use of mice for modelling of molecular mechanisms involved in ruminant and human prion disease pathogenesis with caution.
