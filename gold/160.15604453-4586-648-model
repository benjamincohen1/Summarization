Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a group of infectious diseases that include scrapie of sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), chronic wasting disease and various forms of Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease in humans. A series of TSE strains have been derived from these and other sources, which have been characterized by their incubation periods in inbred strains of mice carrying different genotypes of the PrP gene (originally identified as the Sinc gene) and by the amount and distribution of pathological lesions.
