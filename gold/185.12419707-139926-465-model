OX2 receptor gene abnormalities are not
considered to be responsible for human narcoleptic cases, and the 26 single-base changes (11 aa changes) found in healthy and narcoleptic
human subjects (Refs. 139, 142; see also
Genetics and Chemistry of Orexins) both in introns and all
over the coding regions are supposed to represent benign polymorphisms.
