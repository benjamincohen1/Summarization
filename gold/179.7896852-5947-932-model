Within the 
enhancer, three sites (sites A, -214 to -192; B, -169 
to -146; and C, -134 to -119) (5) are 
predominantly occupied by transcription factors present in liver 
nuclear extracts. Sites A and C are cognate sites for members of the 
nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (11) including RXR  (6, 8) and 
HNF-4(9, 10, 12) , which activate apoAI gene 
transcription, and ARP-1(7, 9) , Erb 
EAR-2(), and Erb EAR-3/chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter 
transcription factor(9) , which repress it.
