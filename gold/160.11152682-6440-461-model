Prion diseases, such as scrapie in sheep and goats and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, are transmissible
neurodegenerative disorders (spongiform encephalopathy). A  major
component of the infectious agent responsible for these diseases is
thought to be a post-translationally modified form of a host-encoded
membrane glycoprotein
PrPC,1 termed
PrPSc (1).
