Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that include Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease in humans, mad cow disease in cattle, and scrapie in sheep. The infectious agent in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies is a proteinous infectious particle or "prion," which is devoid of nucleic acid. It is believed that these spongiform encephalopathies are caused by the accumulation of an abnormally folded isoform of the cellular prion protein (PrPC)
