Study of one of these large
 pedigrees revealed the transmission, from generation to generation, of a
 single point mutation in the gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP), found
 on chromosome 21 in family members developing early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
 Further studies of these families led to the discovery of other point
 mutations in the same gene and later the presence of mutations in two other
 genes, encoding presenilin-1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2 (PS-2), found on
 chromosomes 14 and 1, respectively.
