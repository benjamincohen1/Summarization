Several key proteins involved in pathways regulating transcription, growth, and apoptosis are the substrate for proteasomal degradation, like IB, p53, c-myc, and JNK (21, 38, 39). Proteasome inhibition also down-regulates various transcripts involved in cell growth/survival pathways and up-regulation of molecules implicated in proapoptotic pathway
