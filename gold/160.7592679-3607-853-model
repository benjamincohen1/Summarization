The spongiform encephalopathies are a group of transmissible 
neurodegenerative disorders which are characterized by dementia, motor 
dysfunction, and in some cases by the presence of cerebral amyloid 
plaques (reviewed by Gajdusek, 1990; Prusiner and DeArmond, 1994). 
These fatal disorders include Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD), ()Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome, kuru, 
and fatal familial insomnia in human beings, and scrapie and bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy in animals. The infectious agent responsible 
for these diseases has been called a prion, to distinguish it from a 
conventional virus (Prusiner, 1982). The major, and possibly only, 
component of prion particles is a 35-45-kDa glycoprotein called 
PrP
