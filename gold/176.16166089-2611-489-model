Using in vitro and Xenopus oocyte expression systems we show that, during and immediately following synthesis, nascent CFTR polypeptides associate with large, heterogeneous, and dynamic protein complexes. Partial-length precursors were quantitatively isolated in a non-covalent, puromycin-sensitive complex ( > 3,500 kDa) that contained the Sec61 ER translocation machinery and the cytosolic chaperone Hsc70.
