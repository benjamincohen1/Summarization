Familial 
studies, especially in early-onset cases, indicate molecular heterogeneity and have linked AD to mutations in at least 
three genes: the -amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) 
located on chromosome 21 (for review see Mullan and 
Crawford, 1993) and the presenilin 1 and 2 (PS-1 and PS-2, 
respectively) genes located on chromosome 14 and 1, respectively
