The sib-pair group estimated the effect of this locus to be equivalent to that of ApoE, suggesting that it was likely to be a major risk factor for LOAD. A third group found linkage in a more downstream region of chromosome 10 and focused on the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) as a possible candidate gene in this region
