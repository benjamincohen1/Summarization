an increased amount of sA has been reported in AD and Down's syndrome brain tissue in comparison to control individuals (7). Although the primary structures of deposited A and sA are indistinguishable, the circulating peptide is predominantly 40 residues long, whereas sA42, the major species in parenchymal deposits, is only a minor component of the circulating pool. To the present, it is not clear whether circulating sAs reflect systemic production, brain clearance, or both. The blood-brain barrier has the capability to modulate sA brain uptake and clearance by controlling the uptake of circulating sA, either in its free form or bound to its transport apolipoproteins, as well as the elimination of brain-derived A via transport-mediated clearance mechanisms (reviewed in Ref. 8). Experimentally determined transport rates indicate that the receptor for advance glycation end products mediates the influx of free A into the brain (9), whereas low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 (LRP-2, also known as gp330 or megalin) is the receptor involved in the uptake of A-apoJ complexes (10). In contrast, brain clearance of A at the blood-brain barrier occurs through different receptors, it is largely mediated by LRP-1 and modulated by the LRP-1 ligands apoE and 2-macroglobulin (11). Different proteases (i.e. neprilysin, endothelin-converting enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme, plasmin, and insulin-degrading enzyme) have been implicated in proteolysis-related clearance of A from the central nervous system (12 to 15), although their final contribution to the mechanisms of A homeostasis still remains unclear.
