TSEs are fatal degenerative brain diseases that are characterized by rapidly progressive dementia and a spongy macroscopic appearance of brain tissue. The infective agents appear to be misshapen prion proteins. It is thought that the misshapen prion proteins (PrPSC) can cause further distortion of the normal form of the prion protein (PrPC), leading to a chain reaction that propagates the disease and generates new infectious material.
