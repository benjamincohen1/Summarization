While a 6-h exposure of camptothecin or etoposide induced apoptosis, actinomycin D (a topoisomerase inhibitor in the nanomolar range) almost exclusively induced G1 arrest (Fig.
3B). Concomitantly, p53 became
detectable in the mitochondrial fractions of ML-1 cells treated with
camptothecin or etoposide
