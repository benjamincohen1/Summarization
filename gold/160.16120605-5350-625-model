Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders including scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease in humans (1). In prion diseases, the normal cellular form of the prion protein (PrPC)4 undergoes a conformational conversion to the -sheet-rich scrapie isoform (PrPSc)
