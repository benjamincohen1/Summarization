Although prion diseases can be transmitted between mammalian species by inoculation, in practice it is difficult to do so, and typically transmission occurs in only a small proportion of inoculated animals and then only after prolonged incubation periods on primary passage. On second and subsequent passage of infectivity into animals of the same species, incubation periods are typically much shortened, relatively synchronous as compared with primary passage, and all inoculated animals succumb to disease. A key component of this so-called `species barrier' is the degree of homology between the PrP in the donor and recipient species.
