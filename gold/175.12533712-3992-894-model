Papillomaviruses are non-enveloped DNA tumour viruses that persistently infect squamous epithelia. Their viral capsids are 50 to 55 nm in diameter and contain 72 pentamers of the major structural L1 protein (capsomers) centred on the vertices of a T=7 icosahedral lattice (Baker et al., 1991). The minor structural protein L2 is present at a ratio of about 1/30 of L1 (Kirnbauer et al., 1993). The L1 protein can self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) in the presence or absence of the L2 protein (for a review see Schiller  and  Roden, 1995).
