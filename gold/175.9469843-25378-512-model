In contrast with results obtained by others (41,42), our findings indicate that HPV L2 protein is not required for efficient encapsidation of DNA. However, two recent publications indicated that L1 alone had the capacity to interact with DNA (43,44) and thus it could be speculated that the encapsidation of foreign DNA is at least partially due to the DNA binding property of L1 protein.
