The molecular strain characteristics of new variant CJD closely resembled those seen in BSE itself and BSE transmitted to mice, domestic cat and macaque, consistent with BSE being the origin of new variant CJD (62 ). Such PrPSc markers are detectable in tonsil (63 ), which may allow pre-mortem diagnosis of new variant CJD without brain biopsy
