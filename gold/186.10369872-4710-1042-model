The mechanisms through which mutations of PSs lead to AD are  unknown. Plasma, fibroblasts and brains from patients with PS mutations  have been shown to contain increased amounts of the A[beta]1-42/43  peptide, the amyloidergic form proteolytically released from the  amyloid precursor protein (APP) by [beta]- and [gamma]-secretases (26-27). Similar increases have been observed in  transfected cells lines and transgenic animals that express human  mutant PSs (28,29).  In neuronal cells derived from PS1-/PS1- mouse embryos,  there is an inhibition of APP cleavage by [gamma]-secretase  (30). Human mutant PS1 alleles,  which rescue PS1-/PS1- mouse  embryos from lethality, also lead to an increase of A[beta]1-42  peptide production (31,32).
