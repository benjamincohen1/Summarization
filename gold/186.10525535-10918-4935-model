pt for the G209V PS1 mutation (Levey et al. 1997 ), all missense mutations studied to date do not influence endoproteolysis significantly (Thinakaran and Sisodia 1998 ). The deletion mutant PS1exon 9, in which exon 9 encoding the cleavage site is deleted, prevents endoproteolysis and also causes FAD, indicating that the clipping by itself is not a prerequisite to develop the disease (Thinakaran et al. 1996 ). At least one common effect of the clinical mutations is an increased secretion of the highly amyloidogenic ssA4(1-42) peptide as compared with the ssA4(1-40) peptide. This effect has been demonstrated in cells derived from affected individuals (Scheuner et al. 1996 ) as well as in transfected cells and brains of transgenic mice (Borchelt et al. 1996 ;  Duff et al. 1996 ;  Citron et al. 1997 ). The amyloid peptides are derived from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP) through consecutive clipping by two, hitherto unknown, proteinases called ss- and -secretase. A third enzyme, -secretase, cleaves the protein in the amyloid region, precluding the formation of these amyloid peptides (Haass and Selkoe 1993 ). PS1 is directly involved in -secretase processing of APP, as was demonstrated using knockout models. Targeted deletion of the PS1 gene resulted in a greatly diminished production of ssA4(1-42) as well as (1-40) peptides. As ss- (and -) clipping was virtually normal in neurons derived from those animals, the effect on APP processing is confined to -secretase activities (De Strooper et al. 1998 ). This observation was recently considerably extended by the demonstration that site-directed mutagenesis of either one of two aspartic residues in the transmembrane domain 6 or 7, respectively, of PS1 results in a dominant negative form of the protein (Brockhaus et al. 1998 ;  Steiner et al. 1999 ;  Wolfe et al. 1999 ). In cells overexpressing these mutant forms, a similar inhibition of -secretase processing is observed as in the PS1-deficient cells (Wolfe et al. 1999 ). These results are compatible with a catalytic role of presenilin. However, it remains difficult to explain how presenilin, which is predominantly located in the early compartments of the biosynthetic pathways, can influence the processing of APP, which is thought to occur mainly in the late compartments of this pathway, at the cell surface, and endosomes (Sambamurti et al. 1992 ;  Sisodia 1992 ;  De Strooper et al. 1993 ;  Koo and Squazzo 1994 ;  Haass et al. 1995 ;  Selkoe 1998 ).
