Prion diseases are rare fatal neurodegenerative disorders, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)2 in cattle and scrapie in sheep. The molecular hallmark of these disorders is the accumulation of abnormal prion protein conformers (PrPSc) derived from normal cellular host prion protein (PrPC)
