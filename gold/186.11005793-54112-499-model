Several lines of evidence indicate that PSEN1 is closely linked to the -secretase processing of APP and that decreased expression ( < 50%) and mutations in PSEN1 lead to increased secretion of Ass42 (20,192). Small changes in PSEN expression levels can have major implications for APP processing and AD pathology.
