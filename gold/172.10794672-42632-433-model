mechanism by which hypoxia induces apoptosis is postulated to involve
mitochondrial pathways, as opposed to ligand-receptor stimuli mediated
by cytokines such as TNF- or Fas ligand. In the former pathway,
stimulation of death signals occurs through modulation of the
expression of specific genes such as p53
