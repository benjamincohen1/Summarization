Proteases, including cathepsin D (1), serine
protease-2-macroglobulin complex (2) and
insulin-degrading enzyme (3), were purified and identified as
A-degrading enzymes in vitro. Several other recombinant
or purified peptidases have also been shown to degrade A in
vitro (4-14). We focused on the in vivo catabolism of
A42, because this specific form, rather than A40, is considered
to be the primary pathogenic agent in AD.
