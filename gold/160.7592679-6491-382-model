Prion diseases are unique in having both a 
genetic as well as an infectious origin. 
Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome and fatal familial 
insomnia, and about 10%  of the cases of CJD, are inherited in an 
autosomal dominant fashion (Prusiner and DeArmond, 1994). These 
inherited forms have been associated with specific mutations in the 
chromosomal gene that encodes PrP.
