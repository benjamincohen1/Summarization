PVs are nonenveloped 8 kb double-stranded DNA viruses with a T=7 icosahedral symmetry and a diameter of approximately 55 nm (Baker et al., 1991 ). The capsid consists of 60 hexavalent and 12 pentavalent capsomers, with each capsomer being a pentamer composed of 5 L1 major capsid proteins. The second viral structural protein, the minor capsid protein L2, is required for genome encapsidation and the generation of infectious virions
