Prion diseases, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), include Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease (CJD) and Gerstmann to Straussler to Sheinker (GSS) disease in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in animals. All of these diseases are defined by the accumulation of an abnormally folded, protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc) of a normal host protein, the prion protein (PrPc), in the brains of infected individuals.
