Five experimentally maintained strains of scrapie and BSE agents have been passaged in two PrP genotypes of mice. Brain macerates were autoclaved at 126  degrees C and the levels of surviving infectivity were measured by titration. There was a large difference in the survival properties of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) infectivity between TSE strains. PrP genotype had little effect.
