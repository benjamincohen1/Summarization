Clinical durations between disease onset and urine collection were 1.5 to 72 months in prion diseases. 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid was frequently positive in sporadic CJD (93.5%, 29/31) and dural graft-associated CJD (100%, 3/3). Abnormal high intensity signals in the cerebral cortices or basal ganglia were observed in the majority of patients with sporadic CJD (75.0%, 15/20). Most patients carried methionine homozygosity at codon 129 in the prion protein gene (PRNP),
