To determine which population of CFTR interacted with Sec61, gradient fractions prepared with nondenaturing detergents were similarly cross-linked with DTSSP and immunoprecipitated with Sec61 antisera. Co-immunoprecipitated CFTR was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography after cross-linker cleavage (Fig. 3B). These experiments confirmed that CFTR associates with Sec61 during early stages of its biogenesis and that complexes containing translocation machinery are recovered primarily at the bottom of the gradient.
