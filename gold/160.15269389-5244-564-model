Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that include Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in animals. Prion diseases are characterized by their prolonged incubation periods and distinctive neuropathology, which includes an accumulation in affected brains of an abnormal isomer (PrPSc) of host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrPc).
