Efforts to identify the genetic causes of certain rare familial forms of AD, representing a small fraction of all known AD cases, have been largely successful. By the use of linkage mapping methods, mutations in the genes for amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1) and presenilin-2 (PSEN2) have been found to underlie the majority of familial cases (1 to 3).
