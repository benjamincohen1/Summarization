A hypothetical final common pathway in the pathogenesis of the genetic
and sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease has been postulated, based
on the invariable occurrence of the amyloid deposits, the
neurofibrillar tangles and the neurodegeneration in all affected
brains. The central question is thus how mutations in the presenilin
genes can cause this typical neuropathology.
