progress has been achieved towards development of a prophylactic HPV vaccine to prevent genital HPV infection and associated benign and dysplastic lesions (Kirnbauer, 1996 ; Schiller  and  Okun, 1996 ). Capsid protein(s) L1 alone, or L1 plus L2, expressed in eukaryotic cells self-assembles into virus-like particles (VLP) which are morphologically and antigenically similar to native virions, but lack potentially oncogenic DNA. Immunization with L1 or L1/L2 VLP generated sera containing neutralizing antibodies that conferred type-specific and long-lasting protection in several animal models (Bell et al., 1994 ; Breitburd et al., 1995 ; Christensen et al., 1996 ; Kirnbauer et al., 1992 , 1993 , 1996 ; Rose et al., 1998 ; Suzich et al., 1995 )
