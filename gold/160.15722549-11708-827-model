In order to determine the individual involvement of the codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms in disease and the mechanism by which they control TSE incubation time in mice, 108F and 189V have been introduced separately into the murine Prnpa gene by gene targeting. These new alleles are designated Prnpa[108L_189V] (PrnpLV) and Prnpa[108F_189T] (PrnpFT). Inoculation of mice that were homozygous for Prnpa, Prnpb, PrnpLV or PrnpFT and their heterozygous crosses with mouse scrapie have demonstrated the involvement of both polymorphisms in the control of incubation time.
