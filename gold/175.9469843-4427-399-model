The papillomavirus virion capsid consists of two proteins, L1 and L2. L1 is the major capsid protein and when expressed in eukaryotic expression systems is able to self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) (27,28). The L2 protein has been reported to be involved in DNA binding and encapsidation (29).
