Prions are the causative agents of fatal neurodegenerative diseases, among them Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease (CJD) of man, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie of sheep (see reviews by Prusiner, 1998 , 1999 ; Fisher et al., 1998 ; Brown  and  Bradley, 1998 ). They are defined as proteinaceous infectious particles, and so far the prion protein (PrP) is the only component that correlates unequivocally with infectivity.
