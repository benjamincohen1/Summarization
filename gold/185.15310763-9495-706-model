Two orexin receptor subtypes OX1R and OX2R have been cloned (15). They are serpentine GPCRs that bind both orexins with poor selectivity and are coupled to Ca2+ mobilization (15). Orexins were initially characterized as neuropeptides restricted to hypothalamic neurons that project in the brain to nuclei involved in the control of feeding, sleep-awakeness, neuroendocrine homeostasis, and autonomic regulation (17). Genetic or experimental alterations of the orexin system have been shown to be associated with narcolepsy
