We recently published our findings of significant association in two other genes on chromosome 10 (31<IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"

SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif">), IDE and VR22. When we tested the key variants in all three genes, we did not find evidence of LD. Joint analysis of the key variants demonstrates separate, independent effects. Of all of the variants, only those in VR22 account for the linkage on chromosome 10. PLAU variants are different from the other two in their age-related effects that manifest themselves more strongly after age 50. Thus, each of these genes appears to act independently of one another via apparent separate mechanisms. While the unequivocal effects of these genes in the pathogenesis of AD await the identification of all of the functional variants
