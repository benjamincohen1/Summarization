The recent emergence of a variant form of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the United Kingdom and France has raised
widespread concern that human beings can be infected by consumption of
beef from cows afflicted with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, a prion
disease of cattle (1). The chemical nature of the infectious agent that
causes these diseases has also been the subject of intense interest.
Current evidence indicates that this unusual agent, which has been
called a prion to distinguish it from a conventional virus, consists
primarily of a single kind of protein molecule designated
PrPSc
