Genetic studies demonstrate that AD is a heterogeneous, multigenic disorder with several distinct etiologies (2) including: dosage imbalance for chromosome 21 as occurs in Down syndrome (DS); mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21, the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene on chromosome 14 and the presenilin 2 (PS2) gene on chromosome 1 in early-onset FAD; and inheritance of distinct apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene alleles on chromosomes 19 in late-onset FAD.
