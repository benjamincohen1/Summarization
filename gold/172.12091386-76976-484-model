indicate that p53 is not required for NO-induced apoptosis in certain
cell types including alveolar macrophages (51) and vascular smooth
muscle cells (52). However, our recent observation that the
potentiation of SNP induced apoptosis and caspase activation in
p53-transfected cells and that inhibition of apoptosis by the ectopic
expression of mutant p53
