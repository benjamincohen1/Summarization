Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs)1 represent a group of fatal, neurodegenerative diseases including e.g. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, scrapie in sheep and goats, chronic wasting disease in deer, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle. The etiology of the diseases can be sporadic, hereditary, or infective. According to the "protein-only" hypothesis (1), the basic infectious mechanism is thought to be a conformational change of the normal (cellular) prion protein (PrPC) into the pathogenic (scrapie) PrPSc catalyzed by PrPSc itself.
