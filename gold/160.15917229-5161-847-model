Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE),1 chronic wasting disease, and scrapie are fatal infectious diseases of the central nervous system with an unusual etiology. Many biochemical and biophysical experiments have shown that the infectious agents of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, termed prions, lack informational nucleic acids (1). Furthermore, the replication of infectious prions in vivo and in cultured cells is generally accompanied by the transformation of the normal cellular isoform of a neuronal membrane protein (PrPC) into a protease-resistant state
