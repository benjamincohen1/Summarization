Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases are fatal  neurological disorders that afflict both animals and humans. The best known  animal forms of the disease are scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform  encephalopathy in cattle, and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk, whereas  the human variants include Creutzfeld-Jacob disease,  Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, fatal familial insomnia, and kuru  (1 to 3).  The main histopathological marker of these diseases is the accumulation in  brain of a misfolded form of the prion protein.
