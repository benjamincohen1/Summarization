Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), also named `prion
diseases', are fatal neurodegenerative diseases including Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease in humans, scrapie in sheep and goats, and bovine spongiform
encephalopathy in cattle (Prusiner et al.,

the accumulation in the central nervous system of a protease-resistant isoform
(PrP-res or PrPsc) of the host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrP-sen or
PrPc).
