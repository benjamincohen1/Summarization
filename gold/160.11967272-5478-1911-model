SIZE=-1>CRAPIE of sheep and goat, like bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, belongs to the family of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). These neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the presence in the brains of affected animals, of gliosis, neuron death without inflammatory lesions and, more particularly, vacuolation in neuron and status spongiosis (Holman and Pattison 1943 ;  Wells et al. 1991 ). The greatest concentrations of these vacuolar lesions are located in the brainstem, especially at the level of the obex, which contains the specific areas used for the histological diagnosis of TSEs: principally the spinal tract nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, the solitary tract nucleus, and the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve. Autolysis resulting from postmortem and fixation delays, tissue processing, and handling conditions can give rise to artifactual vacuolation, which may be confused with pathological vacuolation (Fix and Garman 2000 ). Regrettably, these conditions of tissue preparation are not always under control, resulting in a smaller number of brains suitable for histological examination. In these cases, accumulations of PrPsc, an abnormal isoform of the host-encoded prion protein, in specific areas of brain during TSEs (Bolton et al. 1982 ) can still be detected
