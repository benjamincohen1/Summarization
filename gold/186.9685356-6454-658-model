Familial forms of AD are linked in a few cases to mutations of the APP
gene, probably directly affecting the processing of APP and therefore
A generation. In other cases, mutations of presenilin 1 and 2 genes
occur, which produce a phenotype that includes A
overproduction and deposition (4, 5) and, as suggested by recent
results, could be a consequence of a direct interaction between APP and
PS2 (6).
