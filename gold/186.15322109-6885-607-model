Conversely, clinical missense mutations in PS1 and PS2 that are associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (11, 12) and selected experimental missense mutations in nicastrin (6) can all alter presenilin-dependent -secretase cleavage of APP, leading to overproduction of longer proteolytic derivatives of APP termed amyloid -peptide (A).
