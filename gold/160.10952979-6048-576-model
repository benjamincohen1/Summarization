The group of spongiform encephalopathies covers a series of
transmissible neurodegenerative diseases that includes among others human pathologies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and
Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (1-3). The infectious
agent thought to be likely responsible for these lethal diseases is
closely associated with a host protein particle called prion (4), a
33-35 kDa polypeptide displaying a widespread distribution in mammals
(5).
