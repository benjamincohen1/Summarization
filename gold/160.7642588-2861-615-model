Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders 
afflicting humans and other mammals. Manifest as sporadic, inherited, 
and infectious illnesses, they seem to be the result of a 
conformational transition in the normal, cellular prion protein 
(PrP) ()whereby the aberrant, diseased protein 
isoform (PrP) is formed
