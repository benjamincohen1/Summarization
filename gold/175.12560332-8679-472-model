The papillomavirus capsid comprises the major capsid protein L1
arranged as 72 pentamers, or capsomers, in a T=7d icosahedral surface lattice (15, 16) and a minor capsid protein, L2 (17), one
molecule of which may be located at each vertex (18). Overexpression of
L1 alone is sufficient to form empty capsids, termed virus-like particles (VLPs)
