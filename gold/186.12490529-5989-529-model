Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder of late life 
with complex inheritance. A rare Mendelian subform with early onset exhibits 
autosomal dominant inheritance and both locus and allelic heterogeneity. This 
form can be caused by any of over 120 mutations in three known genes 
(reviewed in 1): the amyloid precursor 
protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and presenilin 2 
(PSEN2).
