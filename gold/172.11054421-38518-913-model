To further demonstrate that p53 is involved in neuronal apoptosis, we
used a strategy of adenovirus infection to transduce the expression of
p53 protein in cultures of hippocampal neurons from p53-null mice.
Western blot analysis revealed that cultured neurons deficient in p53
gene and infected with Ad5CMVp53, which expresses human wild-type p53
protein under control of the CMV promoter, displayed increased levels
of p53 protein at 24 h after infection that was dependent on the
multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) as compared with uninfected cells or
with cells infected with a control virus, AxCANLZ (Fig. 1B,
a). Infection with Ad5CMVp53 (50 and 100 m.o.i.)
also increased neuronal death, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3-like
activity
