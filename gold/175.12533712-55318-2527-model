In conclusion, using synthetic peptides we have confirmed that the DNA binding of the HPV-16 L1 protein is due to the last C-terminal amino acids. We also confirmed the binding properties of N- and C-terminal amino acids of the HPV-16 L2 protein. In addition, we determined that a second positively charged sequence located upstream from the previous L1 sequence is able to bind DNA for some HPV types (HPV-33 and -45), but not, or not significantly, for other types (HPV-16, -31 and -58). The interaction between these DNA-binding peptides and DNA induced protection from DNase degradation and was sufficient to obtain gene transfer in COS-7 cells. However, the level of gene transfer with a peptide was around 150 times less efficient than that observed with the corresponding sequence within the VLPs. It was also shown that gene transfer is mediated by binding of DNA/peptide complexes to heparan sulfate receptors, as for VLPs, confirming that positively charged DNA complexes can enter cells after binding to membrane-associated sulfated proteoglycans (Mislick  and  Baldeschweiler, 1996; Mounkes et al., 1999; Kichler et al., 2000). In addition, our findings are in agreement with reports that the inclusion of L2 protein in the constitution of HPV VLPs increases their gene transfer capacity (Roden et al., 1996; Unckell et al., 1997; Kawana et al., 1998; Stauffer et al., 1998; ElMehdaoui et al., 2000; Giroglou et al., 2001) and thus suggests that L2 participates in DNA encapsidation and could play a role in binding to cells.
