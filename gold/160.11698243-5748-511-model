Prion diseases are characterized by neurodegeneration, gliosis, and
accumulation of plaquelike, extracellular deposits in the brain. These
diseases include scrapie (in sheep), bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(in cattle), and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (in humans). Collectively,
these disorders are referred to as transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies and arise from infection with the protease-resistant
scrapie form of prion (PrPsc).
