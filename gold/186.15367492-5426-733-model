Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common illnesses of modern society, affecting 10% of population over 65 years, molecular bases of the disease remain unclear. Familial forms that account for  < 5% of the total number of cases have been linked to mutations in three different genes: the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21 (1), the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene on chromosome 14 (2,3) and the presenilin 2 (PS2) gene on chromosome 1 (4,5).
