PrPSc types 1 to 3 are seen in sporadic and iatrogenic CJD, while type 4 PrPSc is exclusively associated with variant CJD (vCJD) and is associated with a di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc pattern on a Western blot (Collinge et al., 1996; Hill et al., 2003). This characteristic glycoform ratio is also seen in BSE-infected cattle brain and these observations, together with bioassay data from wild-type and transgenic mice and non-human primates, have proved critical in establishing a link between BSE and vCJD
