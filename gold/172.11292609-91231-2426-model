p53 gene serves as a critical regulator of the cell cycle and of apoptotic mechanisms in normal and malignant cells (51). The
important contribution of p53 to the apoptotic process has been
well documented in various cell types and under different conditions
(45, 51, 69). We (27) recently reported that
polyamine depletion by DFMO significantly increases expression of the
p53 gene in IEC-6 cells. The remarkable parallelism that exists between
the stimulation of p53 gene expression and the increased susceptibility
to apoptosis elicited by NF-B suggests the possibility that
activation of NF-B after polyamine depletion sensitizes intestinal
epithelial cells to apoptosis in association with its ability
to regulate p53 gene expression. This contention is supported by recent
publications that indicate that activated NF-B plays a role in
p53-mediated programmed cell death (49) and that NF-B
mediates bcl-2 suppression in hypoxia-induced endothelial
apoptosis (35). In addition, other signaling
pathways may also be involved in STS-induced apoptosis. Polyamines have been shown to regulate intracellular Ca2+
concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) through
K+ channels, and depletion of cellular polyamines reduces
[Ca2+]cyt in IEC-6 cells (65).
Because [Ca2+]cyt has been implicated in
apoptosis through the regulation of bcl-2 expression and
protein kinase activity (8), the increased susceptibility
of polyamine-deficient cells to STS-induced cell death may result, at
least partially, from the decrease in
[Ca2+]cyt. It is possible that STS induces
apoptosis synergistically with the reduction of
[Ca2+]cyt.
