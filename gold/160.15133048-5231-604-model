Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs)1 are progressive neurodegenerative diseases that include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, and Kuru in humans as well as scrapie in sheep and goats, chronic wasting disease in mule deer and elk, transmissible mink encephalopathy, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). A prerequisite for TSE infection is the expression of the protease-sensitive host prion protein (PrP-sen)
