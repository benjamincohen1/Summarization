The structure of the causal agents, specifically the molecular mechanisms by which the diverse phenotypic properties of TSE agents are encoded, have yet to be determined (Somerville, 2002). Because of the range of interactions between different TSE strains and hosts of differing PrP genotype, the virino hypothesis proposes a model of the causal agent in which a host-independent informational molecule interacts with, and is protected by, a host protein, probably PrP
