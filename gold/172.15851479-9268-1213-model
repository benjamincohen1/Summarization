s report, we presented data indicating that the serine 47 polymorphic variant is a poorer substrate for phosphorylation by p38 MAPK. Consistent with this, we showed that in multiple clones of stably transfected cells containing equivalent levels of p53, the S47 variant has up to 5-fold decreased ability to induce programmed cell death, compared with wild type p53. This decreased ability to induce programmed cell death is accompanied by a decreased ability to transactivate p53AIP1 and the pro-apoptotic p53 target gene PUMA (p53-up-regulated mediator of apoptosis), but not other p53 target genes. PUMA is known to be a critical mediator of p53-dependent apoptosis. Down-regulation of PUMA using short interfering RNAs reduces the ability of wild type p53 to induce apoptosis to levels roughly equivalent to the S47 variant. The combined data indicated that the codon 47 polymorphism in p53 is functionally significant and suggested that the influence of this polymorphism on altered cancer risk in African Americans should be assess
