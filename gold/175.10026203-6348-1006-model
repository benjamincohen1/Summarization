Papillomaviruses are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses
containing a circular genome of approximately 8,000 base pairs. The
viral capsid is composed of a major and minor capsid protein, both
products of late gene expression and termed L1 and L2, respectively (1). The L1 protein has a molecular mass of 55-60 kDa by
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and is well conserved across types.
In the virion it accounts for 80-90% of total viral protein (2, 3). The viral capsid is built up from pentameric capsomers of L1, with 72 such structures arranged in a T = 7 icosohedral array (4, 5). The localization of L2 in this ordered structure is not known
at present nor is the mechanism of assembly, although recent reports
suggest disulfide bonding may play a role
