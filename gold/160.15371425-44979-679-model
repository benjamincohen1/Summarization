The bovine spongiform encephalopathy epidemic (40) and the subsequent emergence of a new variant of the equivalent human disease (41) has prompted a massive worldwide effort to understand the prion phenomenon (15). The finding that prions also exist in fungi (14) has contributed significantly to establishing the viability of the prion concept (42). To understand the molecular mechanism of prion formation requires characterization of the structural and folding properties of the prion proteins.
