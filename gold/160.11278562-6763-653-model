Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are fatal
neurodegenerative diseases that include Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, kuru, fatal familial insomnia, and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker
(GSS)1 syndrome in humans, scrapie in sheep and
goats, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle (1). A major characteristic of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy diseases is the accumulation of an abnormal partially protease-resistant prion protein (PrPSC), which
is derived from the normal protease-sensitive prion protein (PrPC).
