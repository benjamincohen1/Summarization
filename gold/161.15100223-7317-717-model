proteases, such as neprilysin (4), insulin-degrading enzyme (5, 6), and endothelin-converting enzymes 1 and 2 (7), have been identified as A-degrading enzymes in the brain by reverse genetic studies. Deficiencies of these proteases were associated with an elevation of brain A levels in each case, demonstrating that a reduction in the catabolic activity will also contribute to AD development by promoting A accumulation
