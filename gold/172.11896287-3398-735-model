Examination of mRNA levels of p53-regulated genes involved in cell cycle control (p21, gadd45, and cyclin G) or apoptosis (bax and bcl-2) showed that during chronic genotoxic stress, bone marrow cells from p53+/+ mice expressed significantly higher levels of a majority of these genes compared to p53+/ to  bone marrow cells. Our results indicate that p53 heterozygosity results in a haploinsufficient phenotype in p53+/ to  bone marrow cells as evident by significantly altered mRNA levels of key genes involved in the p53-regulated DNA damage response pathway.
