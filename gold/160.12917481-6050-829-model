Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders with long incubation periods and an invariably fatal outcome. They include Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, scrapie in sheep and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle. The neuropathological changes observed in these diseases are restricted to the CNS and classically consist of spongiosis, neuronal loss and astrogliosis (Fraser, 1976). From a biochemical point of view, TSEs are characterized by the accumulation in the brain of an abnormally folded isoform (PrPres) of the host-encoded prion protein
