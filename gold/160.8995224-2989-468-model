Prions are proteinaceous infectious agents that cause
transmissible and genetic neurodegenerative diseases, such as scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in animals and kuru and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans (for review see Ref. 1). The
cellular form of the prion protein (PrPc),1
which does not cause disease, can be converted into a pathogenic form
(PrPsc)
