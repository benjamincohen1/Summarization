Overall the results show that the degree to which PrPSc is glycosylated can vary with strain of agent within the same PrP genotype after passage in either SV or VM mice (Fig. 2). The strains 79A and 139A, derived from the  drowsy goat  source (Dickinson, 1976), were least glycosylated, while 301C and 301V which are derived from BSE were most heavily glycosylated.
