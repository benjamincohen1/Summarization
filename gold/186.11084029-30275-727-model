Several families were identified by
Houlden et al. (38) with autosomal dominant early onset AD
with spastic paraparesis. Here we present the detailed pathological,
biochemical, and functional analysis of one of these families.
Neuropathological examination of a large Scottish family (Fig.
1A) revealed the presence of large cotton wool plaques (see below) similar to those seen in the
Finnish family (30, 39). Sequencing revealed the presence of an exon 4 deletion (ATC-ATG; isoleucine-methionine) of codons 83 and 84 of the
PS1 gene.
