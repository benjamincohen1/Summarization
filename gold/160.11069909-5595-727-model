Prion diseases, or transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies, comprise a group of fatal neurodegenerative
disorders that can arise sporadically or can have an infectious or
genetic etiology (1-3). The best known animal forms of the disease are
scrapie in sheep and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle. The
human versions include kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome. These disorders are characterized by vacuolation of neurons, astroglyosis, and cerebral
accumulation of an abnormal (scrapie-like) form of prion protein,
PrPSc.
