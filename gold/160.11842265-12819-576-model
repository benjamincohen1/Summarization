we crossed our two inbred lines of PrP null mice which either express (Rcm0) or do not express (NPU) the Prnd gene in the CNS, with mice expressing two copies of the Prnpa[108F189V] allele (Moore et al., 1998 ) of the PrP gene (BB mice). This PrP targeted line of transgenic mice was chosen because of the relatively short incubation period observed when BB mice are challenged with the TSE agent 301V.
