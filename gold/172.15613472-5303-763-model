p53 tumor suppressor gene encodes a 393-amino acid transcription factor that is activated in response to cellular stress such as oncogenic activation (1), DNA damage (2), and hypoxia (3) leading to induction of downstream effects including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis, thus preventing the proliferation of damaged cells. Wild-type p53 protein has four well characterized functional domains that are responsible for regulation of function: (i) the acidic, highly protease-sensitive N-terminal transactivation domain, which is responsible for interaction with the transcriptional machinery
