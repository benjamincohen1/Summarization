To better understand the role of PrP cleavage in prion disease, we analyzed PrPC and PrPSc cleavage events in brain extracts from prion-inoculated mice and prion-infected cells in culture. Consistent with previous studies (1, 26), we determined that production of C2 results from endoproteolytic cleavage of PrPSc by a cellular protease in vivo. We used a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches to ascertain the nature of the cellular protease responsible for PrPSc cleavage and to address the role of the C2 cleavage product in the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc and prion pathogenesis.
