Recent interest in insulysin stems from its ability to
degrade the amyloid peptides A 140 and A 1-42 (5, 14-16) and
its possible role as an enzyme involved in the clearance of amyloid peptides in the brain. Decreases in insulysin activity in the brains of
Alzheimer's patients have been suggested to contribute to the
progression of this disease
