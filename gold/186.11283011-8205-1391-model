Deposition of -amyloid is considered to be
closely related to the pathogenesis of AD because (i) deposition of
A is a neuropathological change relatively specific to AD; (ii) the
diffuse type of senile plaque composed of highly aggregable A42
species (6, 7), as opposed to A40 that comprises the major portion
of the secreted form of A (8, 9), is the initial lesion of AD
pathology; and (iii) mutations in genes coding for APP (10-14) or
presenilin 1 (PS1) (15) or 2 (PS2) (16) are linked to some pedigrees of
autosomal dominantly inherited familial AD (FAD), and these mutations
increase the production of A42 species (12-14, 17-20).
