There are a number of peptidases that have been implicated in A clearance. Those that have received the most attention and are supported by in vivo studies in peptidase-deficient mice include neprilysin (16, 17), insulysin (IDE) (18, 19), and endothelin-converting enzyme (20, 21). Genetic studies have further suggested a linkage between late onset AD and IDE. A linkage of a region of chromosome 10q to late onset Alzheimer disease has been reported by several groups (22 to 25). This region of the chromosome is within 195 kilobases of the IDE gene. However, to date this analysis has not been refined to the point where the linkage to IDE can be unequivocally established.
