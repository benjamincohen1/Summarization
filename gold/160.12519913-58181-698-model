More than 20 amino acid replacements have been observed in inherited prion diseases (fig. 2, "prion mutations") (Prusiner 1998; Collinge 2001; see also SWISSPROT entry P04156). All mutations with pathological significance occur either within or adjacent to regions of secondary structure, notably associated with the second and third -helix (Krakauer, Zanotto, and Pagel 1998) and in most cases appear to destabilize the PrP structure
