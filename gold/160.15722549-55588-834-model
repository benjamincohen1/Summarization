Previous experiments have shown that the introduction of 108F_189V into the murine Prnpa gene had a major effect on TSE disease, producing incubation times similar to those in Prnpb mice for both Sinc s7-derived (ME7, 139A, 79A and 301C) and Sinc p7-derived (301V and 22A) strains (Moore et al., 1998; Barron et al., 2003; Barron  and  Manson, 2004). These results showed that amino acids 108 and 189 in murine PrP exert the major control over scrapie incubation time
