n view of the established link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and variant Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease and of the susceptibility of sheep to experimental BSE, the detection of potential cases of naturally occurring BSE in sheep has become of great importance. In this study, the immunohistochemical (IHC) phenotype of disease-associated prion protein (PrPd) accumulation has been determined in the brain of 64 sheep, of various breeds and PrP genotypes, that had developed neurological disease after experimental BSE challenge with different inocula by a range of routes.
