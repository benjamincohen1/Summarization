A fundamental question raised by the present study is whether PrPSc accumulation in aggresomes is accompanied by concomitant accumulation of a distinct neurotoxic PrPL species. Detailed physico-chemical characterization of PrPSc aggresome formation will be required to pinpoint the neurotoxic PrP entity. The neurotoxic intracellular mechanism suggested by the present study is likely to be part of a multifactorial prion disease pathogenesis
