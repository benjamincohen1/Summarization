Genes encoding the
polytopic presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 (PS1 and PS2), found on
chromosomes 14 and 1, respectively, were later identified as major loci
for FAD (17, 18), and mutations in the presenilins were likewise found
to increase A42 production in transfected cell lines
(19-21), transgenic animals (19, 20, 22), and human plasma (23).
