Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases, which include scrapie in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease (CJD) in humans (Prusiner, 1997). These disorders are characterized by a post-translational conversion and brain accumulation of an insoluble, protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc) of the host-encoded prion protein (PrPC).
