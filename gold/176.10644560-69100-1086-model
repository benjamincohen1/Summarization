The
retrograde translocation mechanism in which substrates are transported
from the ER lumen or membrane through the Sec61p translocon has
received the most attention. Substrates in mammalian systems, such as
major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (14, 38),
CFTRF508 (1), TCR subunits (40, 41), apolipoprotein B (8, 16, 42),
and RI332 (9), and substrates in yeast, such as mutant
Ste6p (17), mutant carboxypeptidase Y (7, 26), and mutant
pre-pro-alpha factor lacking carbohydrate side chains
(25) have been found to interact with Sec61p and are then released into
the cytosol when the ubiquitin system or the proteasome is inhibited.
