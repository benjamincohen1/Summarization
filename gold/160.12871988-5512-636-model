T SIZE=-1>RANSMISSIBLE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHIES (TSEs) are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease in humans, and scrapie in sheep and goats. Naturally occurring in sheep and goats, scrapie demonstrates the pathological changes typical of the TSEs such as vacuolar damage, neuron loss, astrogliosis, and abnormal deposition of the disease-specific form of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPc).
