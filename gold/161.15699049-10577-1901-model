insulin-degrading enzyme has been shown to digest the longer A peptides (40 to 42 amino acids) into smaller soluble fragments (14). Moreover, the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by - and -secretases produces the A1 to 16 fragment of amyloid precursor protein (15). These soluble fragments and intra-membrane spanning fibrils still possess possible metal binding sites such as histidines, glutamate, aspartate, and tyrosine within the 1 to 20 fragment of A in the sequence 1DAEFRHDSGYEVHHNKLVFF20. Redox chemistry of A has been previously reported, wherein Met35 was suggested as a "built-in" reducing agent required for the redox cycling hypothesis (16). The lack of sufficient data on the redox chemistry of and the oxidative stress caused by metallo-A and the discrepancies in previous studies such as the presence or absence of free-radicals and the nature of the metal-A interaction seem often to be the shortcoming in A research. Understanding of the chemical processes associated with metallo-A may provide insight into the upstream and/or downstream regulatory processes that lead to AD
