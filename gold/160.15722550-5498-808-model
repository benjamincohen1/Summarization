Prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease (CJD) and kuru in humans and scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in animals are transmissible by inoculation with, or dietary exposure to, infected tissues (Cuille  and  Chelle, 1936; Gajdusek et al., 1966; Gibbs et al., 1968). According to the protein-only hypothesis, the transmissible agent, or prion, is composed principally or entirely of abnormal isoforms of a host-encoded glycoprotein, prion protein (PrP)
