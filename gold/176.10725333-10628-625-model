Recently, it was shown that degradation intermediates of the major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain (Wiertz et al. 1996 ) and of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Bebok et al. 1998 ) were associated with the Sec61p complex, suggesting that the Sec61p complex might be involved in the transfer of degradation substrates from the ER to proteasomes.
