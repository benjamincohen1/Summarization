Much evidence argues that prions causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)1 have been transferred to humans by ingestion of tainted beef products (3, 4). The resulting disease in humans has been designated variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which occurs primarily in teenagers and young adults. Compared with sporadic CJD that accounts for 85% of all prion disease in humans, vCJD seems to be caused by a strain of prions that is much more lymphotrophic. Evidence for the lymphotropism of vCJD prions comes from studies of the tonsils and appendix, both of which contain readily measurable levels of the disease-causing isoform (PrPSc) of the prion protein (PrP)
