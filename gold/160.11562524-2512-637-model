The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases which include Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease (CJD) and kuru in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, chronic wasting disease (CWD) in mule deer and elk, and scrapie in sheep and goats. Although the precise nature of the infectious TSE agent is uncertain, an abnormal, detergent-insoluble, relatively proteinase-resistant isoform of a host cellular prion protein (PrPc) co-purifies with infectivity in diseased tissues
