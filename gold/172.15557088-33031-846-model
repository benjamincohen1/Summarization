e of p53 in silica-induced apoptosis, we tested the induction of apoptosis induced by silica using the p53+/+ and p53 to / to  fibroblast cell lines. These cell lines were derived from mouse embryos as reported previously (16). The results of TUNEL assay showed that apoptosis (12%) was observed in p53+/+ cells treated with 75  microg/cm2 silica for 24 h (Fig. 5A), whereas this response was significantly reduced in p53 to / to  cells ( < 1%). Similar results were obtained in the DNA fragmentation assay (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that p53 is required for silica-induced apopt
