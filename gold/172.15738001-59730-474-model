In wild-type p53-expressing cell lines, i.e. in MCF-7, T47-D, and LNCap cells, curcumin asserted apoptogenic insult in 30 to 40% cells (Fig. 6). On the other hand, in p53-mutated breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), p53 knock-out skin fibroblast (MDA-H0-41), or prostate cancer (PC-3) cells, curcumin induced apoptosis in only 12 to 18% cells
