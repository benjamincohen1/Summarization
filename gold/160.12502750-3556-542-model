PrPsc accumulation was observed by immunocytochemistry in all cases that were positive by either immunohistochemistry on the corresponding filtrates or by Prionics Western blotting, showing an excellent agreement between the methodology assessed and these routine techniques. The results of this study demonstrate immunocytochemistry as a useful tool for diagnosis in liquid-state samples, solving a most relevant problem in BSE and scrapie epidemiology.
