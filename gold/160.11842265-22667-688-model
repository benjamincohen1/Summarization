The levels of Prnd and Prnp mRNA were determined by Northern blot analysis on total RNA prepared from three 301V i.c. challenged terminal brains of BORCM and BONPU mice and one each from normal brain challenged controls. This revealed two RNA species of approximately 3 5 and 2 0 kb in both the 301V infected and the normal brain challenged BORCM mice (Fig. 1a). No difference in the levels of mRNA were detected between the TSE infected and uninfected BORCM mice
