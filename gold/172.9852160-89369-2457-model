p53 levels are increased with a timecourse 
that is consistent with it playing a role in the "commitment" to apoptosis. The magnitude of this increase is similar to that required to induce sympathetic neuron apoptosis using adenovirus-mediated transduction of p53 (Slack et al., 1996). Second, levels of two p53 transcriptional targets, p21 and Bax, are also increased; the latter of these 
two, Bax, has already been shown to be essential for sympathetic neuron apoptosis after NGF withdrawal (Deckwerth et al., 1996). Third, p53 levels are also increased when 
sympathetic neuron apoptosis is induced by p75NTR activation, with a similar timecourse to that observed after 
NGF withdrawal. Fourth, a decrease in levels of p53 mediated by the E1B55K protein is sufficient to inhibit sympathetic neuron apoptosis induced either by NGF withdrawal or by p75NTR activation, indicating that increased 
p53 levels are both necessary and sufficient (Slack et al., 
1996) for sympathetic neuron apoptosis. Fifth, NGF withdrawal and p75NTR activation may induce apoptosis via a 
pathway involving MEKK-JNK-p53-Bax (Fig. 7) since (a) 
expression of activated MEKK1, which is sufficient to 
cause sympathetic neuron apoptosis, leads to elevated levels of p53 and Bax, (b) expression of p53 leads to elevated 
Bax levels, but does not affect JNK activation, and (c) elevated p53 is essential for MEKK-induced apoptosis. Finally, the physiological relevance of these observations is 
indicated by our findings that, when p53 is reduced or absent, naturally occurring sympathetic neuron death is inhibited in vivo. Thus, our data indicate that p53 is a common, essential target during developmental sympathetic 
neuron death that is downstream of the MEKK-JNK pathway and that may well integrate apoptotic signals deriving 
both from p75NTR activation and from a lack of NGF/
TrkA receptor activation.
