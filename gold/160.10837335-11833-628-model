In addition, there is some evidence that
molecules of similar activity may be involved in "autocytotoxic"
conditions, where the body produces peptides that act against its own
cells, causing disease. Possible examples include the role of amylin in
type II diabetes and apoptosis (11, 65), the prion peptide in the mad
cow disease (58), and AP in Alzheimer's disease (6-9, 66, 73)
