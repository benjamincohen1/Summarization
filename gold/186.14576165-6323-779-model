The presenilin (PS) 1 and PS2 proteins are critically involved in -secretase activity (4) and might represent members of a family of aspartic proteases that catalyze cleavage of proteins within their transmembrane domains (5 to 7). Pathogenic mutations in the PS genes that cause familial forms of early onset Alzheimer's disease lead to increased production of the 42 amino acid form of A that aggregates much faster than A40 to form insoluble fibrils (8).
