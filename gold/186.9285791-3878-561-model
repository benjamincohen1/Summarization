Genetic investigations have identified several etiologies for AD (reviewed in 1 ), including: a dosage imbalance for chromosome 21, as occurs in Down syndrome (DS); mutations in the [beta]-amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) on chromosome 21, the presenilin 1 gene on chromosome 14 and the presenilin 2 gene on chromosome 1 in autosomal dominant early onset familial AD (FAD); inheritance of the apolipoprotein E4 allele on chromosome 19 as a genetic risk factor for both late onset FAD and sporadic AD.
