Interestingly, FAD patients with 
mutations in presenilin genes and transgenic mice expressing mutant human PS genes have elevated levels of A42-43 
peptides (Duff et al., 1996; Scheuner et al., 1996; Borchelt 
et al., 1996; Tomita et al., 1997), which have been documented to induce apoptosis (LaFerla et al., 1995).
