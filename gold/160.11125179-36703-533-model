Western blotting has also been carried out on goat and sheep experimental BSE and scrapie brain samples using the three other antibodies described for icc (BG4, FH11, 1A8). With 1A8, PrPSc detection levels were similar to those revealed by 1B3; however, non-specific background staining levels were much higher with 1A8. BG4 was slightly less sensitive, especially on scrapie PrP, whilst FH11 detection of proteinase K-treated PrP was very poor.
