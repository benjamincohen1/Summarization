The surface expression of many normal and misfolded membrane proteins such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) is controlled by ubiquitylation (Ward et al., 1995<IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif">). The degradation of misfolded proteins relies on their recognition by chaperones in the lumen of the ER. They are then retrotranslocated by the SEC61-SEC62/63 complex to the cytoplasm, where they are ubiquitylated by the transmembrane E3 Hrd1p/Der3p and the E2 Ubc7.
