Bax mutations associated with microsatellite instability, which inactivate its function, enhance tumorigenesis in human hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancers (9) and increase the resistance to apoptosis in cell lines derived from hematopoietic malignancies (10,11). The expression of Bax has been reported to be under the transcriptional control of p53
