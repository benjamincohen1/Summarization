Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases combine the molecular genetics and epidemiology associated with non-infectious, genetic disorders (gene mutations, familial forms of disease) with the characteristics of virus diseases (transmissibility, strain variation). The natural hosts of these fatal, neurodegenerative diseases are ruminants (i.e. scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE) and man (i.e. Creutzfeldt to Jakob disease), but TSEs have also been found in captive carnivores and in rodents after experimental exposure (Bruce et al., 1991 ; Prusiner et al., 1996 ). No TSE virus or agent genome has yet been identified; however, the host protein PrP has been consistently found to be associated with infectivity
