Prion diseases, also called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are  fatal neurodegenerative disorders that have attracted enormous scientific  attention because they exemplify a novel mechanism of biological information  transfer based on the transmission of protein conformation rather than on the  inheritance of nucleic acid (1,  2). There is now considerable  evidence that these diseases are caused by conformational conversion of  PrPC,1 a  cell surface glycoprotein of uncertain function, into PrPSc, a  -rich and protease-resistant isoform
