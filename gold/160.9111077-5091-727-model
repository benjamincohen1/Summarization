Prion diseases can have an infectious, familial, or sporadic
origin. The infectious etiology is exemplified by kuru, which was
spread among members of an aboriginal tribe by ritual cannibalism (2),
and by "new variant" CJD which may have arisen by consumption of
beef from cows afflicted with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (3).
Familial forms, which include Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome,
fatal familial insomnia, and 10% of the cases of CJD, show an
autosomal dominant mode of inheritance linked to insertional and point
mutations in the gene encoding the prion protein (PrP)
