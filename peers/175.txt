   Residues 25-45 of HPV16 L2 bind to a non-viral component of the cytoplasm.  (  ) Enhancement of capsid gene expression: preparing the human papillomavirus type 16 major structural gene L1 for DNA vaccination purposes.  The results were normalized by quantitation, using SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) and immunoblotting with anti-MVM antiserum, of the amount of viral capsid proteins present in extracts of the transfected cells .  2 to 6) a large part, or all, of the nucleic acid component is invisible, because it is randomly oriented within the viral particles that form the crystal.  Most important, we have confirmed binding of dynein (RP3) to VP26 in its biologically relevant form as part of a recombinant viral capsid bound to VP5.   To determine whether mutant viral DNA is packaged into capsids, thin sections of BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 and RK13/UL25+ cells as well as BHV-1-infected RK13 cells, collected at 18 h p.  The L1 major capsid protein of human papillomavirus type 16 variants affects yield of virus-like particles produced in an insect cell expression system.  Coincident with these events, the immature viral particles undergo a maturation process, involving proteolytic processing of the precursor structural proteins and condensation of the capsids into collapsed, electron-dense cores (for review see Gelderblom, 1991; Wills and Craven, 1991).  The L1 major capsid protein of human papillomavirus type 11 recombinant virus-like particles interacts with heparin and cell-surface glycosaminoglycans on human keratinocytes.  Flow cytometric analysis showed that HPV16 L2 residues 1-128 bound to both HPV-positive cervical carcinoma-derived cell lines HeLa (data not shown) and SiHa (Fig.
