  Analysis of the Stability of the Empty Capsid Most of the side chains involved in interactions with the viral DNA and analyzed in this study either do not interact with neighboring capsid residues, or establish with the latter a few van der Waals contacts only (Table III). However, the side chains of Tyr-270 and Trp-60 are each involved in multiple hydrophobic intrasubunit contacts and a hydrogen bond, and Lys-278 and Asp-474 interact with each other through an intersubunit salt bridge (Table II). Truncation of some of these side chains could potentially affect the stability of the viral particles, not by disruption of DNA-capsid interactions, but because of the disruption of intracapsid interactions. Thus, the contribution of the mutated residues to the stability of the protein shell was estimated using empty capsids, as follows..
