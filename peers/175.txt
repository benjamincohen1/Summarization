   INTRODUCTION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Cervical cancer, the second most frequent cause of death by cancer amongst females worldwide, is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and represents one of the best examples of a human cancer preceded by a well characterized preneoplastic period (Richart  and  Barron, 1967; Richart, 1987). Despite the evidence that specific types of HPV are strongly implicated as causative agents in the aetiology of cervical cancer and its precursors, designated squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs), HPV alone is not sufficient for cancer development (Chen et al., 1993). The role of the intrinsic immunity in controlling HPV infection and the subsequent development of SILs is shown indirectly by the increased frequency of HPV-associated lesions in patients with depressed cell-mediated immunity (Petry et al., 1994; Calore et al., 1998; Ellerbrock et al., 2000). Initiation and progression of HPV-associated cancer of the uterine cervix have been shown to be related with functional alterations of Langerhans cells (LC) within the cervical epithelium (Giannini et al., 2002). LC are immature dendritic cells (DC) of myeloid origin resident in squamous epithelia, including skin and genital mucosa. The normal function of LC is to survey cell surfaces for pathogens, capture antigens by micropinocytosis or mannose receptor-mediated uptake, process captured proteins into immunogenic peptides, emigrate from tissue to lymph nodes and present peptides in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to T cells, thereby initiating antigen-specific immune responses. LC are the only cells that constitutively express MHC class II molecules, CD1a (Fithian et al., 1981) and langerin (CD207) (Valladeau et al., 1999) at their cell surface. In addition, LC differ ultrastructurally from other DC through the presence of a unique pentalamellar cytoplasmic organelle, the Birbeck granule..
