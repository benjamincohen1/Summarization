Cell 98:437 to 451[Medline] Lin L, Faraco J, Li R, Kadotani H, Rogers W, Lin X, Qiu X, de Jong PJ, Nishino S, Mignot E 1999 The sleep disorder canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene.    The sleep disorder canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the Hypocretin (Orexin) receptor 2 gene.    The sleep disorder canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene.   The sleep disorder canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene.   The sleep disorder canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene.   The sleep disorder canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene.   The sleep disorder canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene.   The sleep disorder canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene.   For example, an intronic SINE insertion within the Hypocretin-receptor-2 in Doberman pinschers induces exon-skipping, leading to narcolepsy .   One mutation, Leu16Arg, found in the 5'-signal peptide region of the human preproorexin gene probably results in early-onset, severe narcolepsy .   The 10 other reported mutations in preproorexin or OX2 receptor genes are thought to represent benign polymorphisms .   Mignot's group  identified, through linkage analysis and positional cloning, mutations in the orexin 2 receptor gene as the cause of canine narcolepsy, an animal model of human sleep disorder narcolepsy.
