   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   IN MAMMALS, neurons located in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) are important controllers of both feeding and behavioral arousal. Animals with lesions of the LHA exhibit hypophagia, increased metabolic rate, decreased arousal, and extreme weight loss (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). They also fail to respond with appropriate adaptive behavioral and physiological responses to homeostatic challenges such as fasting (6). Because electrical stimulation of the LHA results in a vigorous feeding response as well (see review in Ref. 2), the LHA was historically regarded as the hypothalamic feeding center and was considered to be an important integrating site for the somatic and autonomic controls over ingestion. Related to these functional observations, the LHA has extensive anatomical projections within the hypothalamus as well as throughout the entire neuroaxis, facilitating its coordination of metabolic, motivational, motor, autonomic, and arousal processes important in energy homeostasis (6)..
