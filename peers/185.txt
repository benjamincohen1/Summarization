In dogs, narcolepsy is mainly a familial disorder. Recently, familial canine narcolepsy of Doberman pinschers and Labrador retrievers was shown to be caused by mutations in the OX2 receptor gene . In both cases, the mutations cause premature amino acid chain termination. When expressed heterologously in HEK293 cells, the mutant receptors mainly remain in the intracellular compartments and neither bind orexin A nor activate Ca2+ mobilization . Point mutation Glu54Lys at the NH2 terminus/first transmembrane segment junction of the OX2 receptor also leads to reduced orexin A binding and 400-fold reduced potency for Ca2+ elevation when expressed in HEK293 cells . The 10 other reported mutations in preproorexin or OX2 receptor genes are thought to represent benign polymorphisms . Sporadic cases of canine narcolepsy have been suggested to be caused by lack of orexins ..  In dogs, narcolepsy is mainly a familial disorder.
