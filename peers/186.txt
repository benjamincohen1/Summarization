We report a novel mutation in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP I716V) which probably leads to familial early onset Alzheimer's disease with an onset age in the mid 50s. Cells transfected with cDNAs bearing this mutation produce more A[beta]1-42(43) than those transfected with wild-type APP and this effect is additive with that of the previously reported APP V717I mutation thus providing a novel approach for further increasing A[beta]1-42(43) in model systems. INTRODUCTION.  We report a novel mutation in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP I716V) which probably leads to familial early onset Alzheimer's disease with an onset age in the mid 50s. Cells transfected with cDNAs bearing this mutation produce more A[beta]1-42(43) than those transfected with wild-type APP and this effect is additive with that of the previously reported APP V717I mutation thus providing a novel approach for further increasing A[beta]1-42(43) in model systems. INTRODUCTION.  Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) that cause early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) have previously been identified (1 ). Those which lead solely to AD have been reported at two sites: at codon 717 and a double mutation at codons 670/1 (K/M670/1N/L) (for review see ref. 1 ). These mutations, and the presenilin mutations which also lead to FAD, have in common the feature that they increase the concentration of A[beta] ending at A[beta]42(43) (2 -8 ). Here we report the identification of a novel mutation in APP which is associated with an Alzheimer phenotype and show that it too results in an increased extracellular concentration of A[beta]42(43).
