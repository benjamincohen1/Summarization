  Sequence analysis of presenilin-1 gene mutation in Japanese Alzheimer's disease patient.   A mutation in Alzheimer's disease destroying a splice acceptor site in the presenilin-1 gene. 6 The Alzheimer's Disease Collaborative Group  The structure of the presenilin I gene and the identification of six mutations in early onset AD pedigrees.   A novel mutation (V89L) in the presenilin 1 gene in a family with early onset Alzheimer's disease and marked behavioural disturbances.   Genetic association between intronic polymorphism in presenilin-1 gene and late onset Alzheimer's disease.   Alzheimer's disease associated with mutations in presenilin 2 is rare and variably penetrant.   Mutations of the Presenilin-1 gene in families with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Mutations in the highly homologous presenilin genes encoding presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 (PS1 and PS2) are linked to early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Analysis of a number of large data sets have revealed that missense mutations in the presenilin I (PS-1) gene are a frequent cause of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), accounting for perhaps as much as 50% of all cases of early onset FAD (1 ,2 ,4 -6 ). , et al  Incomplete penetrance of familial Alzheimer's disease in a pedigree with a novel presenilin-I gene mutation.   Genetic association between intronic polymorphism in presenilin-1 gene and late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Missense mutations in the presenilin 2 (PS-2) gene on chromosome 1 were sought by direct nucleotide sequence analysis of the open reading frame of 60 pedigrees with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD).   Early-onset Alzheimer's disease caused by mutations at codon 717 of the [beta]-amyloid precursor protein gene.
