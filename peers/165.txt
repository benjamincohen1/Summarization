  Neuropathological changes in Scrapie and Alzheimer's disease are associated with increased expression of Apolipoprotein E and Cathepsin D in astrocytes.    Neuropathological changes in scrapie and Alzheimer's disease are associated with increased expression of apolipoprotein E and cathepsin D in astrocytes.    Neuropathological changes in scrapie and Alzheimer's disease are associated with increased expression of Apolipoprotein E and Cathepsin D in astrocytes.  Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a plasma protein with known functions in cholesterol transport and metabolism and Alzheimer's disease.    Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) genetic variants and risk of Alzheimer's disease: evidence of effect modification by apolipoprotein E (APOE).    Increased plasma apolipoprotein E (apoE) levels in Alzheimer's disease.    Apolipoprotein E in sporadic Alzheimer's disease: allelic variation and receptor interactions.    Gene dose of apolipoprotein E type 4 allele and the risk of Alzheimer's disease in late onset families.    Interactions of apolipoprotein E genotype, total cholesterol level, age and sex in prediction of Alzheimer's disease: a case-control study.  The presence of at least one apolipoprotein E (APOE) [epsis]4 allele is a major genetic susceptibility factor for late-onset familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD).    Gene dose of apolipoprotein E type 4 allele and the risk of Alzheimer's disease in late-onset families.    APOE epsilon 3/epsilon 4 heterozygotes have an elevated proportion of apolipoprotein E4 in cerebrospinal fluid relative to plasma, independent of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.    Apolipoprotein E: high avidity binding to beta-amyloid and increased frequency of type 4 allele in late-onset familial Alzheimer's disease.    Gene dose of apolipoprotein E type 4 allele and the risk of Alzheimer's disease in late-onset families.
