1 The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; RT, reverse transcriptase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ALLN, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney.  More than 800 distinct mutations in the CFTR gene have been associated with clinical diseases characteristic of cystic fibrosis .  The absence of CFTR-mediated electrodiffusional ATP movement may thus be a relevant component of the pleiotropic cystic fibrosis phenotype. The F508 mutation leads to retention of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the endoplasmic reticulum and rapid degradation by the proteasome and other proteolytic systems. THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) supports ATP-dependent Cl channel activity (3, 14).  Defective CFTR function disrupts ion transport, which is believed to contribute to the clinical sequelae characteristic of cystic fibrosis (CF) (49, 58, 67, 74). THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated Cl channel and is responsible for regulating ion transport in many tissues where it is expressed, including the airways and airway submucosal glands, sweat glands, gastrointestinal tract, pancreatic and bile ducts, and the reproductive tract (58, 74).    Ado activation of halide efflux in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-expressing COS-7 cells (A and B) and Calu-3 cells (C-E). Abbreviations used in this paper: BFA, brefeldin A; BHK, baby hamster kidney; CF, cystic fibrosis; CFTR, CF transmembrane conductance regulator; COPII, coat complex II; endo H, endoglycosidase H; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; GAP, guanine nucleotide activating protein; NBD1, nucleotide binding domain 1; VSV-G, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein.   Is congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens a primary form of cystic fibrosis? Analysis of the CFTR gene in 67 patients.
