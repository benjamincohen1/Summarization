   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   HNF4, a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily , is one of the first liver-enriched transcription factors (LETF) to be expressed during the course of development. Indeed, transcripts are observed in the mouse at embryonic day (E)4.5 in primitive endoderm, at E5.5 in the extra-embryonic visceral endoderm and in embryonic tissues in the liver and gut primordia at around E8.5 . A somewhat earlier and overlapping expression pattern characterizes HNF3ss and HNF1ss, respectively, the only other LETF to have such precocious expression (3 to 6). Each of the three factors is essential for normal embryogenesis: targeted mutation of the corresponding genes causes an early embryonic lethal phenotype (3 to 7), due in the cases of HNF4 and HNF1ss to disruption of visceral endoderm function, essential for the progression of gastrulation (4,5,8). In addition, HNF4 is required for the expression of a number of essential liver functions of differentiated hepatocytes . Alteration of some of these functions may be involved in maturity-onset diabetes of the young 1 (MODY1), linked to HNF4 insufficiency (10,11). HNF4 mutations linked to MODY1 affect the coding region of the protein. However, mutations in regulatory regions of the gene may yet be identified (reviewed in 12), providing a strong impetus to locate and characterize these sequences. In view of the importance of HNF4 for execution of the hepatocyte differentiation program, as well as its early expression pattern, the search for regulators of the HNF4 gene should inform us of the factors that are critical not only for hepatocyte differentation and function, but for endoderm formation as well..
