 Recently, multiple binding sites for liver-specific or ubiquitous transcription factors and several hormone response elements (HRE) have been identified in the core promoter region, including Sp1 (7, 8), TATA-binding protein , HNF3 , HNF4 , C/EBP , and other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, such as the retinoid X receptor (RXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), COUP-TF1, and ARP1 .  5-kb core RNA, COUP-TF1 suppresses the expression of both the pre-C RNA and C RNA, and TR2 preferentially represses the expression of the pre-C RNA .   Although the DBD and hinge region functions as a dimerisation interface in COUP-TF II, we also observed that the presence of the E-region strengthens the specificity of the interaction (G.   C: PGC-1 interacts with HNF4, and rifampicin-activated PXR disrupts HNF4 interaction with PGC-1.   To further confirm this interaction in liver cells, we co-transfected TR4 and HNF4 into COS1 cells and used a co-immunoprecipitation assay to immunoprecipitate the TR4 and HNF4 complex by an anti-TR4 monoclonal antibody.   The functional relevance of this phosphorylation event in vivo remains unclear because the deletion of the amino-terminal region to residue 57 does not affect the subcellular distribution, DNA binding activity and transactivation function of the receptor, or the MAPK-mediated regulation of the COUP-TFI-dependent transcription.   COUP-TFII has been implicated to interfere with the function of the orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) .   Further binding analysis demonstrated that COUP-TF II interacted with the N-terminal 149 aa residues of p300 which encoded the receptor interaction domain of the coactivator.   In fact, HNF1 was shown to be a direct transcriptional target of HNF4 in liver .
