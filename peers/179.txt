In adult mammals, the insulin gene is expressed exclusively in the beta cells of the endocrine pancreas (1-3). This selectivity is controlled primarily at the transcriptional level through well defined promoter elements (4-6). Although a number of transcription factors have been defined that interact with the insulin promoter and activate it in synergistic fashion (7-10), the action of these factors alone is not sufficient to explain the remarkable degree of cell specificity observed in vivo (9). Most likely, additional transcription factors participate in achieving specificity..  In adult mammals, the insulin gene is expressed exclusively in the beta cells of the endocrine pancreas (1-3).
