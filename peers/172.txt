As "guardian of the genome," p53 is activated by a number of genotoxic and stress signals such as ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, ribonucleotide depletion, hypoxia, oxidative stress, heat shock, and exposure to nitric oxide (reviewed in Ref. 8). Critical to the tumor-suppressing function of activated p53 is its ability to bind sequence-specific DNA sites and induce the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. This is illustrated by the fact that most p53 mutations occur in its DNA-binding domain and affect its sequence-specific DNA binding ability . Such mutations (called "hot spot" mutations) can be divided into two categories; class I mutations affect residues that make direct contact with DNA, whereas class II mutations occur at residues crucial for maintaining the conformation of the DNA-binding domain ..     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   The tumour suppressor protein p53 induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, and is thus pivotal in suppressing cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. Cell cycle arrest is mediated by transcriptional induction of genes, the products of which inhibit proteins involved in cell cycle progression. The molecular events that lead to p53-dependent apoptosis are less clear. Transactivation of target genes may be involved but there is growing evidence that transrepression and transcription-independent functions are central to p53-dependent apoptosis (15,40). However, the physiological relevance of these apparently redundant pro-apoptotic properties and the determinism of choice between them are poorly understood. In the absence of caspase activity, p53 can induce a Bcl-2-insensitive cell death program (22,23). Here, we report that, in this Bcl-2-insensitive pathway unmasked by ZVAD, one or more ZVAD-sensitive caspases regulate p53 apoptotic functions by modulating activated biochemical properties of the protein..
