In the response to various stresses, such as ionizing radiation, UV and hypoxia, p53 is activated, stabilized, and imported into the nucleus, where it promotes transcription of several genes whose products induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis (14). In a non-stress situation, the level of p53 in the cells is mainly regulated at the post-translational level by MDM2 (12, 15 to 17)..
