In many models, the transactivation function is not essential for p53-dependent apoptosis (8 to 10) but the transrepression function may be important (11,12).   Cells were assessed for p53 protein levels after 3 hours of incubation and for apoptosis (annexin/PI staining) after 6 hours of incubation.   The p53 stabilizing compound CP-31398 induces apoptosis by activating the intrinsic Bax/mitochondrial/caspase-9 pathway.   Certainly, p53 also shows transcriptional repressor functions that are strongly correlated with apoptosis (21 to 23).  Biological Significance of p53-mediated Apoptosis Induced by Transcriptional Blockade The induction of DNA lesions by high doses of UV radiation results in the ubiquitination and degradation of pol II LS, transcriptional collapse, and recruitment of DNA repair proteins (16, 17).   Although p53 phosphorylation on key serine residues appears to be dispensable for transcriptional activation, it may play a role in functions of the tumor suppressor in specific tissues or perhaps in proposed transcription-independent mechanisms of apoptosis (36, 37).    Apoptotic Activity of Phosphorylated and Unphosphorylated p53 Next, we examined the effect of p53 phosphorylation on its ability to induce apoptosis, since this function is critical for suppression of tumor formation in several mouse models (34, 35).   We examined the effect of TPA upon DNA damage-induced apoptosis in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, which also has wild type p53 .   The stabilized p53 is functional in inducing expression of downstream target genes and has been shown to contribute to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis response after heat shock (13, 15).    We have previously demonstrated that Ser-15 on latent p53 is a target of DNA-PK immediately following DNA damage and that this residue plays a role in IR-induced apoptosis of MEFs .
