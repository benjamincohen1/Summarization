 One wonders what caustic comments would have come from Shaw s critical pen about the factors that led to  mad cow disease  or even sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which may be a byproduct of an expanding animal to human interface in a setting of unhygienic livestock breeding for commercial purposes.  Here we studied 32 subjects, with definite sCJD of all genotypes at PRNP codon 129 and with different PrPSc types, to characterize C-terminal PrPSc fragments in distinct disease phenotypes and host genotypes.  Analysis of LV/LV and FT/FT transgenic mice has therefore shown that amino acid polymorphisms at both codons 108 and 189 in murine PrP are involved in the control of scrapie incubation time, and that distinct regions of PrP may play different roles in the disease process.    Sporadic but not variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is associated with polymorphisms upstream of PRNP exon 1.   The SARS epidemic and mad cow disease confronted us with new, potentially lethal diseases and with the dangers of forcing nature in order to increase food production [2].  Despite the clear importance of the polymorphism at codon 129 in the PRNP gene and its link to disease susceptibility and pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms by which these effects are mediated remain unclear.   In scrapie transmitted to mice, the most extensively studied TSE, the strain of the agent and the host genotype variability determined by polymorphisms in the coding region of PRNP are the major determinants of disease phenotype .
