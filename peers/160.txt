Prion diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), which include scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), result in fatal neurodegenerative conditions . In prion disease, it is thought that the pathogenic process is related to transformation of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPc) into a protease-resistant and readily aggregated isoform, called PrPsc (scrapie prion protein) . Evidence is mounting that copper may play a role in PrPc biology . The Prnp to / to  mouse has decreased copper levels in the brain and liver, whereas copper levels in their serum were increased . In addition, cell lines from Prnp to / to  mice are more sensitive to copper exposure . The prion protein may therefore represent a potential copper-transporting or -sequestering protein that may prevent copper toxicity ..
