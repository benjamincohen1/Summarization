 Typically, interest in these candidates has diminished as independent replication has not been forthcoming, and little evidence now remains for an important role for genetic variation in the VLDL receptor, PS-1 or 1-antichymotrypsin genes in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.    Role of elevated amyloid ss protein in patients with typical late onset Alzheimer's disease.  , et al  ApoE genotypes in Australia: roles in early and late onset Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome.    Genetic variants in a haplotype block spanning IDE are significantly associated with plasma Ass42 levels and risk for Alzheimer's disease.  , et al  A 24-week, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil in patients with Alzheimer's disease.   Those taking anticholinesterase drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease or other psychotropic medication (such as antidepressants) had to be clinically stable on these medications for at least 2 months prior to study entry.    The role of oestrogen in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.  , et al  Susceptibility locus for Alzheimer's disease on chromosome 10.   The recently described IDE-null mouse model displays impaired insulin and ss-amyloid degradation, as well as hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, and cerebral accumulation of ss-amyloid, hallmarks of both type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer s disease .   Thus, the evidence is mounting that IDE plays a major role in diseases characterized by amyloid formation.    Heritability for Alzheimer's disease: the study of dementia in Swedish twins.    The role of heredity in late-onset Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia.  , et al  The effects of donepezil in Alzheimer's disease - results from a multinational trial.
