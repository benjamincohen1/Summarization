The ability of Mdm2 to inhibit the activities of a C-terminal truncated p53 mutant, p53-30, which can bind Mdm2 but is resistant to Mdm2-mediated protein degradation was investigated. The inhibitory function of an Mdm2 mutant, Mdm2-(222-437), which can bind p53 but is defective in targeting p53 for degradation was also studied. We have demonstrated that targeting p53 for degradation is the most effective way for Mdm2 to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53. However, we have also shown that Mdm2 can inhibit the transactivation function of p53 without targeting it for degradation, although Mdm2 releases the transrepression ability of p53 mainly by targeting it for degradation. The ability of Mdm2 to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53 was linked to its ability to inhibit the transrepression but not the transactivation function of p53. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the transrepression function of p53 was specific to p53-induced apoptosis and was not simply a result of cell death.     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES
The tumor suppressor gene p53 is one of the most frequently mutated genes found in human cancers (1). Germ line mutations of p53 were found in patients suffering from a cancer-prone syndrome, Li-Fraumani syndrome, illustrating the tumor suppression function of p53 in humans (2). The increased incidence of tumors seen in p53 knock-out mice provided further supporting evidence that p53 is a tumor suppressor gene (3). Biochemically p53 can bind to DNA and transactivate genes involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis. Transcriptional target genes of p53 include p21cip1/waf1, GADD45, mdm2, IGF-BP3, bax, and PIGs (p53-inducible genes) (4). Interestingly, it has also been reported that p53 can transrepress the expression of genes such as Bcl-2 and MAP4, which can inhibit p53-induced apoptosis (5, 6). By contrast, far less is known about the transrepression function of p53. In normal cells, the expression level of p53 is very low. However, in response to DNA damage or other stress signals, p53 levels rise, and the cells undergo G1 arrest or apoptosis (4, 7). This necessitates the tight regulation of the expression level of the p53 protein in cells. Such regulation is achieved mainly at the post-transcriptional level. The cellular levels of p53 may also be regulated by Mdm2, one of its transcriptional target genes and arguably the most important cellular regulator of p53 identified so far. Mdm2 binds to the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 and inactivates the transactivation and transrepression function of p53 (8-10). In addition, the binding of Mdm2 to p53 can also target both wild-type and mutant p53 for degradation (11-13). Thus, p53 and Mdm2 form a very tight auto-regulation loop. The importance of the negative regulation of Mdm2 on p53 was demonstrated genetically by the ability of p53 null mice to rescue the embryonic lethality of mdm2 null mice (14, 15). Mutations in the DNA binding region of p53 result in the loss of p53 transcriptional activity and the reduced expression of Mdm2. This enables such DNA-binding defective mutants of p53 to have a longer half-life and be expressed at a higher level than that of the wild-type protein. All these suggested that the ability to target p53 for degradation is probably the most important mechanism through which Mdm2 negatively regulates the function of p53.
It is known that the transactivation function of p53 contributes to its apoptotic function, and the binding of Mdm2 to p53 can conceal the transactivation domain of p53 inhibiting its transactivation function. However, the observation made by Oren and co-workers (16) demonstrates that Mdm2 can inhibit the transactivation but not the apoptotic function of p53 in HeLa cells. This suggests that inhibiting the transactivation function of p53 may not sufficient for Mdm2 to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53. In addition, there is increasing evidence to suggest that the apoptotic function of p53 can be uncoupled from its transactivation function but linked to its transrepression function (17-19). Thus it may be possible that Mdm2 inhibits the apoptotic function of p53 through its ability to inhibit the transrepression function of p53. If so, would it require the degradation of p53 protein? Using the mutants of Mdm2 and p53 and studying their ability to inhibit or induce apoptosis, we investigated the mechanism through which Mdm2 might inhibit the apoptotic function of p53 and addressed the issue of whether targeting p53 for degradation is the only mechanism through which Mdm2 inhibits the apoptotic function of p53.

Cell Culture, Plasmids, and Antibodies-- SAOS-2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories). Unless otherwise indicated, all the expression plasmids used in this study were driven by the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. For the -galactosidase assay, an SV40 promoter in a lacZ expression cassette was used as the reporter. The luciferase assay reporter construct contains the p53-responsive promoter of human mdm2. The mutants of p53, Mdm2, and E2F1 were described previously (20-23). The DO-13 mouse monoclonal antibody was used to detect p53 and its mutant. SX-118 mouse monoclonal antibody was used to detect endogenous p21waf1. As a loading control, the supernatant from the hybridoma PC-10 was used to blot for PCNA. C-18 and N-20 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used in a mixture to detect Mdm2 and Mdm2-(222-437). CD-20 (Leu-16) is a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody specific to the cell surface marker CD20 (Becton Dickinson, CA). The peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse and swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins used as secondary antibodies were purchased from Dako (Denmark).
DNA Transfection, Luciferase, -Galactosidase, DNA Fragmentation, and FACS1 Assays-- Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method as described before (24). For all the transfection experiments, control vector (usually the cytomegalovirus vector) was used to compensate for total DNA input. For the transcriptional assay, 5  x  105 SAOS-2 cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection in 6-cm dishes and transfected with 100 ng of plasmid DNA expressing p53 or p53-30, 250 ng of plasmid expressing p53-I, proportional amounts of mdm2-expressing plasmids and 1  microg of p53 reporter as indicated. A 2.5-fold excess of mdm2 plasmid was found to inhibit p53 activity and unless otherwise stated, this ratio was used in all experiments. After transfection, the cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega, WI) 24-h postwashed and assayed as before (23, 25) using the luciferase assay kit (Promega, WI). For the -galactosidase assay, the cells were plated and transfected as for the transactivation assay except that 1  microg of plasmid DNA expressing p53 and proportional amounts of the other plasmids were used with 5  microg of SV40-lacZ reporter. Cells were lysed, and 20  microl of lysate were measured with 150  microl of assay reagent (1.25 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM chlorophenol red -D-galactopyranoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and colorimetric changes were measured at 570 nm. Mean values were derived from at least two independent experiments each performed in duplicate.
For FACS analysis, 106 SAOS-2 cells were plated 24-48 h prior to transfection with 3-4  microg of p53 plasmid with 10-20  microg of mdm2 or 3-6  microg of mdm2-(222-437) plasmids and co-transfected with 2  microg of CD20 plasmid as a selectable marker. 24-36 h after transfection, both floating and attached cells were harvested using 4 mM EDTA, stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD20 and analyzed using a FACS machine as described previously (23). A duplicate set of dishes was often set up for detection of protein expression or to perform the transrepression assay where 5  microg of SV40-LacZ reporter was co-transfected per dish and the repression assay performed as described before.
For the DNA fragmentation assay, 20 dishes of 106 SAOS-2 cells were each transfected with 5  microg of p53 or p53-30 with or without 10  microg of mdm2. 72 h after transfection, cell pellets were made. The DNA was extracted, and the assay was performed as described before (23).
Immunoblotting-- Cells were transfected, harvested by scraping, and lysed in 100  microl of radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and a protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein concentration determination was performed using the Bio-Rad protein assay. 10-20  microg of soluble protein extract were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels in SDS sample buffer. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper (Protran, Schleicher and Schnell, Germany), and nonspecific binding sites blocked with 10% (w/v) nonfat milk (Marvel). Primary antibody was added to the blot and incubated for 1 h at room temperature or 4  degrees C overnight. Finally, the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako, Denmark) was incubated with the blot, and the bound immunocomplexes were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method as directed by the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Apoptosis Induced by p53-30 Is More Resistant to the Inhibition of Mdm2-- As a negative regulator of p53, Mdm2 can inhibit the transactivation, transrepression, and apoptotic function of p53. Studies shown recently suggested that suppressing the transactivation function of p53 is not sufficient for Mdm2 to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53 (16, 17). However, the ability to target p53 for degradation provided an attractive mechanism to explain how Mdm2 could abolish the apoptotic function of p53. To understand how Mdm2 inhibits the apoptotic function of p53, we asked the question of whether targeting p53 for degradation is associated with the ability of Mdm2 to inhibit apoptosis induced by p53. To address this issue, we initially used a C-terminal truncated p53 mutant, p53-30, which induces apoptosis but is resistant to Mdm2-mediated protein degradation (26, 27). The effect of Mdm2 on the apoptotic function of p53 and its mutant, p53-30, was investigated by co-transfecting an mdm2-expressing plasmid into SAOS-2 cells that lack endogenous p53. Apoptosis was identified by the characteristic fragmentation of DNA, revealing a DNA ladder (Fig. 1A). To quantify the percentage of apoptotic cells in a transfected cell population, flow cytometry was used to gate the transfected cells that express a cell surface marker CD20. The DNA content of the transfected cells, which were stained with propidium iodide, was then analyzed as described previously (23). As represented in Fig. 1B, wild-type p53 induced 26.5  plus or minus  4.1% apoptosis over a background level of 6.8  plus or minus  2.2% in transiently transfected SAOS-2 cells. p53-30 induced 32.3  plus or minus  5.6% apoptosis. Transfected Mdm2 did not induce apoptosis when transfected on its own. However, when co-transfected with p53 it reduced the apoptotic population of cells to 14.9  plus or minus  4.3%. In contrast to wild-type p53, p53-30 was more resistant to the inhibitory effect of the same amount of Mdm2, and the percentage of transfected cells undergoing apoptosis remained at 30.8  plus or minus  5.6%. The amount of apoptosis induced by p53-I is 14.7  plus or minus  0.7% in the absence and 14.2  plus or minus  0.5% in the presence of Mdm2. The degree of resistance of p53-30 to the inhibition of Mdm2 is similar to a Mdm2-binding defective mutant of p53, p53-I. By comparing the reduction by Mdm2 of the apoptosis induced by wild-type p53, p53-30, or p53-I, it is clear that the mutant p53, p53-30, is more resistant to the anti-apoptotic effects of Mdm2. The slightly lower percentage of apoptosis seen with p53-I was because of the slightly lower expression of p53-I in this case (see Fig. 1C), which is cloned in the pcDNA3 vector, whereas wild-type p53 and p53-30 are in CMV-Bam-Neo vectors.

A, DNA fragmentation of p53 and p53-30-induced apoptosis in the presence or absence of Mdm2 in transfected SAOS-2 cells. The lanes are labeled with the respective transfected plasmids. The control transfected SAOS-2 cells are labeled as vector. B, the graph reflects the percentage of cells determined by flow cytometry to have sub-G1 DNA content (apoptotic cells) in transiently transfected SAOS-2. p53 or p53-30 (4  microg/10-cm dish) or p53-I (10  microg/10-cm dish) was transfected in the presence or absence of mdm2 (10  microg/10-cm dish). The mean values derived were from five independent experiments. The mean values and standard deviations (bars) are referred to in the text. C, Mdm2 promotes the degradation of p53 but not p53-30 or p53-I. 1  microg of p53 (lanes 1 and 2), p53-30 (lanes 5 and 6) or p53-I (lanes 7 and 8) was transfected into SAOS-2 cells in the absence (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7) or presence (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8) of 2.5  microg of mdm2 and were harvested 24 h later.
Recent studies have demonstrated that the Mdm2-p53 interaction is required to target p53 for degradation (11-13). Furthermore, it was shown that the stability of p53 in tumor cells was not determined by mutation in p53 but by Mdm2 binding (27). The anti-apoptotic effect of Mdm2 on wild-type p53 could be explained by the fact Mdm2 rapidly targets wild-type p53 for degradation. Hence, it is possible that the reason why Mdm2 is unable to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53-30 is because Mdm2 cannot target it for degradation. Consistent with this hypothesis and in agreement with the published results, the data in Fig. 1C showed that p53-30 was indeed resistant to Mdm2-mediated protein degradation (lanes 5 and 6). Under the same condition, however, co-transfection of mdm2 promoted the degradation of wild-type p53 (lanes 3 and 4). In addition, similar levels of transfected Mdm2 were detected in cells expressing either wild-type p53 or p53 mutants, p53-30, and p53-I (lanes 4, 6, and 8). Therefore, the results here show that whereas Mdm2 can target wild-type p53 for degradation, p53-30 remains more resistant to Mdm2-targeted degradation. Thus, it seems that Mdm2-targeted degradation of p53 is associated with the ability of Mdm2 to inhibit p53-induced apoptosis.
Mdm2 Inhibits p53-induced Apoptosis Mainly by Targeting It for Degradation-- To further investigate the hypothesis that the ability of Mdm2 to inhibit p53-induced apoptosis is directly linked to its ability to target p53 for degradation, we studied the anti-apoptotic function of an Mdm2 mutant, Mdm2-(222-437). This mutant can bind to p53 but cannot target p53 for degradation (12, 20). On one hand, this Mdm2 mutant, Mdm2-(222-437) was shown previously to be able to inhibit p53-induced apoptosis (20). On the other hand, it was shown recently that the mutant Mdm2, Mdm2-(222-437) is more stable than the wild-type Mdm2 (28). Therefore, it is possible that Mdm2-(222-437) is much less active in inhibiting the apoptosis induced by p53 than that of the wild-type Mdm2. To address this hypothesis, a titration of 10 and 20  microg of mdm2 and 3 and 6  microg of mdm2-(222-437) expression plasmids was performed. Similar expression levels of Mdm2 and Mdm2-(222-437) were obtained when 10  microg of wild-type mdm2 (Fig. 2, top panel, lanes 2 and 7) and 3  microg of mdm2-(222-437) expression plasmids (middle panel, lanes 4 and 9) were used in the transfection experiment. The corresponding ratios of mdm2 and its mutant were then co-expressed with p53 or p53-30. As predicted, the co-expression of mdm2 caused the degradation of wild-type p53 (Fig. 2A, lower panel, lanes 1-3) but not p53-30 (lower panel, lanes 6-8). In addition, co-expression of the Mdm2 mutant, mdm2-(222-437), did not cause any degradation of either wild-type p53 or p53-30 (lower panel, lanes 1, 4 and 5 for wild-type p53 and lanes 6, 9 and 10 for p53-30). Under these conditions, the ability of wild-type Mdm2 and Mdm2-(222-437) to inhibit the apoptosis induced by p53 and p53-30 were then compared, and the result is shown in Fig. 2B. The expression of wild-type Mdm2 clearly reduced the sub-G1 population as quantified by flow cytometry in wild-type p53 transfected SAOS-2 cells (Fig. 2B). However, under this condition the Mdm2 mutant, Mdm2-(222-437), only showed a small inhibition of the apoptosis induced by p53. This result suggested that Mdm2-(222-437) is less effective than wild-type Mdm2 in inhibiting p53-induced apoptosis. Again the apoptosis induced by p53-30 was more resistant to the inhibition by Mdm2. The Mdm2 mutant, Mdm2-(222-437) showed a small inhibition on the apoptosis induced by p53 as well as p53-30. Nonetheless, the effect of wild-type Mdm2 on wild-type p53 showed the most dramatic inhibition. This is consistent with the notion that Mdm2 inhibits that apoptotic function of p53 mainly by targeting it for degradation.

A, titration of expression levels of Mdm2 and Mdm2-(222-437). 10  microg (lanes 2 and 7) and 20  microg (lanes 3 and 8) of wild-type mdm2 and 3  microg (lanes 4 and 9) and 6  microg (lanes 5 and 10) of mdm2-(222-437) expression plasmids were transfected in the absence or presence of 4  microg of p53 (lanes 1-5) or p53-30 (lanes 6-10) in SAOS-2 cells and were harvested 36 h later. B, Mdm2-(222-437) is less effective at inhibiting apoptosis of p53 and p53-30 when expressed at similar levels as wild-type Mdm2. 10  microg of mdm2 and 3  microg of mdm2-(222-437) were transfected with or without 4  microg of p53 or p53-30 or control plasmid (Vector) in SAOS-2 cells and were harvested 36 h later.
Mdm2 Can Inhibit the Transactivation Function of p53 without Targeting It for Degradation-- So far, we have demonstrated that Mdm2 needs to bind p53 to inhibit its apoptotic function, but binding alone is not sufficient; both the Mdm2-binding defective p53 mutant p53-I and p53-30, which can bind Mdm2, were unable to be effectively inhibited by Mdm2. Recently it was suggested that Mdm2 binds less efficiently to p53-30 than to wild-type p53 in vitro (29). This could be the reason why p53-30 is more resistant to the inhibition of Mdm2. To test this hypothesis, instead of using a binding assay, we decided to assay the transcriptional activity of p53. If the Mdm2 binds to p53, its transcriptional activity will be inhibited since it is known that Mdm2 binds to the transactivation domain of p53 and abolishes its transactivation. In the case of wild-type p53 however, Mdm2 also targets it for degradation, and this complicates the issue. So by using p53 mutants that are unable to be targeted for degradation or Mdm2 mutants unable to target p53 for degradation in our assay, it allows us to investigate whether Mdm2 can inhibit the transactivation of p53 without targeting it for degradation. Hence, we could then further investigate whether the inability of Mdm2 to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53-30 was because of the fact that p53-30 was resistant to Mdm2 inhibition of its transactivation.
To address these issues, we initially examined the expression levels of the well known p53 target p21waf1 in a set of cell lysates derived from a FACS analysis experiment as shown in Fig. 1B. From Fig. 3, the transactivation function of p53 is evident as there is a clear elevation of the levels of endogenous p21waf1 protein when either p53, p5330, or p53I is transfected in p53-null SAOS-2 cells (Fig. 3, lanes 4, 6, and 8). This data also showed that although Mdm2 failed to effectively inhibit the apoptotic function of p53-30 (Fig. 1B), it reduced the p53-30-dependent induction of p21waf1 (Fig. 3, lane 7). In contrast to the effect of Mdm2 on wild-type p53 where it targets p53 for degradation (Fig. 3, lanes 4-5), Mdm2 reduced the induction of p21waf1 by p53-30 without targeting it for degradation (lanes 6-7) and did not affect the induction of p21waf1 by p53-I (lanes 8-9). These observations together would argue that Mdm2 must be able to inhibit the transactivation function of p53 by binding to p53 without the need to target it for degradation. Importantly, this also suggested that the transactivation function of p53 could be uncoupled from its apoptotic ability, because Mdm2 cannot effectively inhibit the apoptotic function of p53-30 but inhibits its ability to transactivate target gene p21waf1.
View larger version (20K):    Fig. 3.   Mdm2 inhibits the p53-dependent induction of p21 by binding to and blocking its transactivation. A, lysates from a representative FACS experiment (see Fig. 1) were blotted from the respective proteins as shown. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was used as a loading control. B, Mdm2 and Mdm2-(222-437) inhibited the transactivation ability of p53 and p53-30 with respect to the mdm2 promoter as measured by the transactivation assay as described under "Materials and Methods." 100 ng of p53 or p53-30 or 250 ng of p53-I were transfected into SAOS-2 cells in the absence or presence of proportional amounts of mdm2 (250 ng) or mdm2-(222-437) (75 ng) to that used in Fig. 2. 1  microg of reporter plasmid containing the mdm2 promoter linked to a luciferase expression cassette was co-transfected. (As the fold of transactivation between wild-type p53 and its mutant differs, we set the fold of transactivation function of wild-type p53 and its mutants to unity.) This figure shows the relative fold of inhibition of Mdm2 on p53-, p53-30-, and p53-I-dependent transactivation of mdm2-luc. The mean and S.D. of at least two independent experiments are shown (bars).
To further investigate and quantify the extent of the ability of Mdm2 to inhibit the transactivation function of p53, we used a luciferase reporter assay and transfected SAOS-2 cells with a p53-responsive reporter construct, mdm2-luciferase. We chose the mdm2 promoter as it is widely used to measure the transactivation activity of p53. For this transactivation assay, we used amounts of protein proportional to the amounts used in the flow cytometric experiments and used the Mdm2 mutant, Mdm2-(222-437), which is unable to target p53 for degradation. Thus the transactivation data correlates with that of flow cytometric and Western blotting data shown. From Fig. 3B, wild-type p53, p53-30, and p53-I transactivated the reporter linked to the mdm2 promoter. The transactivation function of both wild-type p53 and p53-30 was inhibited by the co-expression of Mdm2 or its mutant, Mdm2-(222-437). In contrast, Mdm2 or its mutant Mdm2-(222-437) failed to inhibit the transactivation function of p53-I, which is unable to bind Mdm2.
Thus, by using a mutant of Mdm2, Mdm2-(222-437), we are able to demonstrate that Mdm2 can inhibit the transactivation of p53 without targeting it for degradation. The results also demonstrated that Mdm2 and its mutant Mdm2-(222-437) inhibited the transactivation of p53-30 to a similar degree as that of wild-type p53 on the mdm2 promoter but did not inhibit the transactivation function of a Mdm2-binding defective p53 mutant p53-I. These observations thus suggest that both Mdm2 and Mdm2-(222-437) were able to bind both p53 and p53-30 to inhibit their transactivation functions on the mdm2 promoter. Taking into account the earlier observation that Mdm2 is defective in inhibiting the apoptosis induced by p53-30 but not wild-type p53 (Fig. 1), this would argue that inhibiting p53 transactivation function is not sufficient for Mdm2 to inhibit p53-mediated apoptosis.
Mdm2 Releases the Transrepression Function of p53 Mainly by Targeting It for Degradation and This Correlates with Inhibition of Apoptosis-- Recent data suggested that the apoptotic function of p53 was best linked to its transrepression function (17-19). However, very few genes have been identified as the targets to be specifically repressed by p53 during apoptosis. How p53 transrepresses gene expression is also not known because p53 can transrepress many promoters that do not contain p53 binding sites (4). Also not known are the mechanisms by which Mdm2 inhibits the transrepression function of p53. Nevertheless, to be able to target p53 for degradation provided a simple explanation of how Mdm2 might achieve this. To ascertain whether this paradigm might apply here, we performed an assay to test the effect of Mdm2 and Mdm2-(222-437) on the transrepression function of wild-type p53 and p53-30.
It is known that p53 can transrepress promoters of c-fos and large T antigen of SV40 DNA tumor virus (30, 31). Hence, to monitor the transrepression ability of p53, we co-transfected a -galactosidase reporter linked to the SV40 promoter and determined the extent of p53 transrepression by measuring the -galactosidase activity in the same population of cells as that used in one of the FACS analysis experiments (Fig. 1B) using the same lysate as that used in Fig. 3A. As shown in Fig. 4A, there is a clear correlation between the ability of p53, p53-30, and p53-I to induce apoptosis (Fig. 1B), and their abilities to transrepress genes as determined by this assay. Furthermore, the ability of Mdm2 to reduce apoptosis induced by p53 correlates with a relief of p53-mediated repression and targeted degradation by Mdm2; in addition, the inability of Mdm2 to reduce apoptosis and its inability to inhibit the transrepression by p53-30 also correlated with its incapability to target it for degradation. Furthermore, the failure of Mdm2 to affect p53-I in terms of apoptosis and transrepression is consistent with the inability of Mdm2 to bind p53-I.

A, the same population of cells and amounts of plasmids that were used in the FACS assay to measure apoptosis (see Fig. 1) were used except that the cells were transfected with SV40-lacZ as a reporter and the transrepression assay was performed as detailed under "Materials and Methods." B, the transrepression assay with equal amounts Mdm2 and Mdm2-(222-437) protein expressed. For this, proportional amounts to that used in Fig. 3, were employed: 2.5  microg of mdm2 and 0.75  microg of mdm2-(222-437) were co-transfected with empty plasmid (Vector), 1  microg of p53 and p53-30. C and D, transrepression of the SV40 promoter was not simply caused by cell death and is specific to p53-induced apoptosis. FACS data (D) showing the percentage of apoptosis induced by 4  microg of p53 and 5  microg of E2F1-(1-374) in the transfected SAOS-2 cells (1  x  106 cells/10-cm dish) after 36 h. The graph in C shows in parallel transrepression experiments after 24 h, only p53 repressed transcription from the SV40 promoter. SAOS-2 cells were transfected with 1  microg of p53 and 1  microg of E2F1-(1-374). The mean of two independent experiments is shown for the repression assay.
The ability to release the transrepression function of p53 by the Mdm2 mutant Mdm2-(222-437) was also studied. It was evident that in our assay, Mdm2 was clearly able to inhibit p53-mediated repression of the SV40 promoter (Fig. 4B). However, under the same conditions, Mdm2-(222-437) was less effective in inhibiting the transrepression function of p53 than wild-type Mdm2. This is in agreement with the result seen in Fig. 2B that wild-type Mdm2 is a more potent inhibitor of p53-induced apoptosis than its mutant when expressed at similar levels (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the amounts of Mdm2 and Mdm2-(222-437) previously shown to be less able to inhibit apoptosis induced by p53-30 was also less active in inhibiting the transrepression induced by p53-30 (Fig. 4B). These together demonstrate that targeting p53 for degradation remains the most effective way for Mdm2 to produce the full inhibition of p53. In addition, the data also argues that there is a link between the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis and its ability to exhibit transrepression as determined by this assay.
One of the major criticisms of this transrepression assay, which measures the decrease in reporter activity, is that reduction in activity could be a consequence of cell death and hence not specific to p53-induced apoptosis. To address this issue, we used a truncated mutant of E2F1, E2F1-(1-374), which is transcriptionally incompetent (thus cell-cycle independent) but is able to induce p53-independent apoptosis in SAOS-2 cells (23). As shown in Fig. 4D, p53 and E2F1-(1-374) induce apoptosis, with E2F1-(1-374) being more efficient at inducing apoptosis. What is particularly interesting is that using similar proportions of plasmids in transrepression assays done in parallel shows that E2F1-(1-374) does not exhibit transrepression of SV40-lacZ (Fig. 4C), although it induces apoptosis. Hence, transrepression appears to correlate with apoptosis induced by p53 but not by E2F1-(1-374), which can induce apoptosis independent of p53 in SAOS-2 cells (23, 32).     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES
The physical and functional interaction of p53 with Mdm2 has long been known to be involved in the negative feedback loop involving the two proteins. We have demonstrated here that whereas p53-induced apoptosis can be inhibited by Mdm2, a p53 mutant p53-30 remained more resistant to the inhibition by Mdm2. The inhibition of apoptosis and the targeting of p53 for degradation by Mdm2 were dependent on binding to p53; Mdm2 did not target p53-I, which was unable to bind Mdm2, for degradation and hence was also unable to inhibit its apoptotic and transrepression functions. However, binding alone was not sufficient for Mdm2 to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53 and to target p53 for degradation. The p53 mutant p53-30 somehow was more resistant to the negative regulation of Mdm2. The observation that p53-30 was unable to be targeted for degradation by Mdm2 in a similar manner as wild-type p53 agrees that of Kubbutat et al. (26). This was also consistent with the previous observation in an inducible cell system that high levels of p53 expression were required for its apoptotic function (20). Thus targeting p53 for degradation would be the main mechanism through which Mdm2 inhibits the apoptotic function of p53. Corroborating this notion, we observed that the inhibitory activity of an Mdm2 mutant, Mdm2-(222-437), which can bind p53 but is defective in targeting p53 for degradation, was not as effective as wild-type Mdm2 in inhibiting the apoptotic function of p53 when expressed at similar levels. However the mutant of Mdm2, Mdm-2(222-437), had been previously shown to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53 (20). One explanation, which may account for this discrepancy between the data shown here and the one reported previously, may be because of the difference in the expression level of this Mdm2 mutant. In support of this idea, it was previously reported that this Mdm2 mutant is very stable (28). When the same amounts of wild-type and mutant Mdm2 expressing plasmid DNA were transfected to the cells, the expression level of the mutant Mdm2 can be five times higher than that of the wild-type Mdm2. Under such conditions, the overexpressed mutant Mdm2 can then inhibit the apoptotic function of p53 (data not shown). Therefore, it is possible that Mdm2 may inhibit the apoptotic function of p53 by some other mechanism when largely overexpressed. This may account for the modest inhibition of p53-induced apoptosis by the Mdm2 mutant (Fig. 2B). Nevertheless, targeting p53 for degradation remains the most efficient way for Mdm2 to inhibit the activities of p53.
Binding to the transactivation domain of p53, Mdm2 is known to inhibit the transactivation and transrepression function of p53. Using mutants of p53 and Mdm2, p53-30, and Mdm2-(222-437), respectively, both of which are defective in Mdm2-mediated protein degradation of p53, allowed us to investigate whether the anti-apoptotic function of Mdm2 is linked to its ability to inhibit the transactivation or the transrepression function of p53. We observed that Mdm2 inhibited p53- and p53-30-dependent induction of endogenous p21waf1 in the same populations of cells that were used in the FACS assays. This demonstrates that Mdm2 can inhibit the transactivation function of p53-30 without targeting it for degradation or abrogating its apoptotic function. This was further corroborated in transactivation assays showing that Mdm2 was able to inhibit the transactivation function of p53-30 on the mdm2 promoter as effectively as that of wild-type p53. This result demonstrates that the capacity of Mdm2 to inhibit the transactivation function of p53 could be uncoupled from its ability to inhibit apoptosis induced by p53.
Our data shown here suggests that Mdm2 may release the transrepression function of p53 by targeting it for degradation. It also demonstrates that there is a link between the apoptotic activity of p53 and its ability to transrepress gene expression. Consistent with this, similar observations have been reported previously during a screen of p53 mutants (18) and a study of the regulation of p53-induced apoptosis by Rb (17). However, the major criticism for suggesting a link between apoptosis and transrepression abilities of p53 was that repression could be a consequence of cell death. In this report, we specifically addressed this issue and showed that transrepression of the SV40 promoter only occurred during apoptosis induced by p53. E2F1-(1-374) is an E2F1 mutant which is unable to transactivate genes, yet it can induce apoptosis independently of p53 in SAOS-2 cells (23). Under the same conditions, the E2F1 mutant, E2F1-(1-374) could induce apoptosis to levels comparable with or in excess of p53. However, this E2F1 mutant did not exhibit transrepression at the time point tested, whereas p53 repressed the reporter in the assay. This suggested that the transrepression and apoptosis link is specific to p53-dependent apoptosis. Indeed, there are a number of anti-apoptotic genes that have been reported to be transrepressed by p53. Among them, the expression of bcl-2 and MAP4 were able to inhibit apoptosis induced by p53 (5, 6). Recently it was also reported that p53 can act as a general repressor of RNA polymerase III transcription (34). To be able to bind to Sin3 and inhibit the general transcription by the histone deacetylase pathway provided another line of evidence to support the hypothesis that p53 could be a general repressor of many other genes (33). It remains to be elucidated whether p53 is a specific repressor of certain genes or a general repressor of transcription. The unraveling of the molecular mechanisms of how p53 transrepresses gene expression will provide more conclusive evidence to address whether the transrepression ability of p53 is indeed responsible for inducing apoptosis or whether it is triggered by the onset of p53-induced apoptosis.
