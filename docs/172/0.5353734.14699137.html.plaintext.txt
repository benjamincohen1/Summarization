   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In response to DNA damage, signal transduction pathways are activated that result in the increase of p53 protein levels, leading to either growth arrest or apoptosis. Protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated as a tumor suppressor that is down-regulated by tumor-promoting phorbol esters in both mouse skin and cell culture models. We report here that the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate prevents DNA damage-induced up-regulation of p53 by down-regulating PKC . Regulation of p53 in response to stress most commonly occurs by preventing ubiquitination and degradation of the p53 protein. Surprisingly, suppression of p53 expression by inhibition of PKC was caused by the inhibition of p53 synthesis, not increased degradation of p53 protein. Inhibiting PKC blocked both basal transcription of the human p53 gene and initiation of transcription from the human p53 promoter. Therefore, the tumor-suppressing effects of PKC are mediated at least in part through activating p53 transcription.
   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a central role in mediating stress and DNA damage-induced growth arrest and apoptosis (1). The p53 protein regulates normal responses to DNA damage and other forms of genotoxic stress and is a key element in maintaining genomic stability (2). In fact, the p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequently inactivated gene in human malignancy (3). The level of p53 protein is largely undetectable in normal cells but rapidly increases in response to a variety of stress signals. The mechanism by which the p53 protein is stabilized is not completely understood, but post-translational modification plays a pivotal role (4). Mutations in the p53 gene are frequently associated with the formation of human cancer; however, the p53 pathway can also be derailed by numerous oncogenic proteins (5). Mice engineered to have the p53 gene knocked out develop tumors at an increased rate (6). The critical position p53 plays in tumor suppression suggests that many agents may inhibit the p53 pathway as part of the road toward tumor promotion. However, the mechanisms of action of many chemical agents that promote tumor development have not been elucidated. With the central role of p53 in mind, it is logical to presume that agents that promote tumor formation might block the p53 pathway.
The tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)1 promotes tumor formation in a variety of mice and tissue culture models, and this has been associated with the down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) (7). TPA is known to activate but then down-regulate the diacylglyceroldependent PKC isoforms (7, 8). We demonstrated that the tumor-promoting activities of TPA are mediated at least in part by down-regulating PKC (9 to 12). Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing PKC in their epidermis are resistant to tumor promotion by TPA (13). Increasing evidence suggests that PKC is a player in DNA damage response pathways. PKC is activated in the DNA damage response by both tyrosine phosphorylation and cleavage of PKC to a 40-kDa constitutively active catalytic fragment (14, 15). Furthermore, downregulation of PKC expression by inhibitors and siRNA has been associated with attenuation of the DNA damage-induced response (14, 16).
Many chemotherapeutic drugs work by inducing cell death via the p53 pathway (17). Previous studies have suggested that TPA can inhibit the DNA damage-mediated induction of p53 (18, 19). Moreover, other studies with protein kinase inhibitors have suggested that PKC regulates the p53 pathway (20, 21). In this report, we have examined the effect of PKC on p53 protein and gene expression and report that PKC is required for the basal transcription of the p53 gene. These results are discussed in the context of the tumor promotion by phorbol esters.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Reagents Camptothecin, propidium iodide, and the calpain inhibitor N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Norleu-al (LLnL) were purchased from Sigma. Etoposide, rottlerin, and TPA were purchased from Calbiochem. Zeocin was purchased from Invitrogen. RPMI 1640 and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. D. M. Vyas (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.) supplied MC. DMC was synthesized from MC as previously described (22). Trizol reagent was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Bryostatin 1 was purchased from LC Laboratories. Actinomycin D was purchased from Calbiochem and was used at a concentration of 10  microg/ml.
Cell Culture The ML-1 (with wild-type p53) cells were a generous gift from Michael Kastan. K562 (with no p53 expression) and MCF-7 (with wild-type p53) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The H460 and H1299 cells were provided by Arnold J. Levine and were used as another model to compare cells with and without p53 (23). All cell lines (with the exception of MCF-7) were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% CO2 and were seeded at a density of 2.5 x 105/ml, and exponentially growing cells were used in all experiments. MCF-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum.
Flow Cytometry Flow cytometry was carried out on a Becton Dickinson FACScan. Cells were spun down at 2300 rpm for 7 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (136 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM KCl, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, 4.2 mM Na2HPO4), and resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3. Ethanol (9 ml) was then added dropwise while vortexing. Propidium iodide staining and RNase treatment were carried out at 37  degrees C for 30 min 24 h prior to flow cytometry.
Protein Extract Preparation Protein extracts were prepared using a variation on the Dignam protocol (24). Cells were spun down and resuspended in 5 packed cell pellet volumes of buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol). They were then put on ice for 10 min prior to centrifugation for 10 min at 2,000 rpm at 4  degrees C. The pellet was resuspended in 2 packed cell pellet volumes of buffer A (volume prior to the initial wash). The cells were run through a 25-gauge needle twice, and nuclei were then spun down at 2,000 rpm for 10 min at 4  degrees C followed by an additional 20-min spin at 15,000 rpm at 4  degrees C. The supernatant was saved as our cytoplasmic extract. The pellet was resuspended at 109 cells per 3 ml of buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) by running it through a 25-gauge needle twice. The suspension was rocked gently for 30 min at 4  degrees C. The extract was centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 rpm at 4  degrees C, and the supernatant aliquots were stored at  to 80  degrees C.
Western Blot Analysis Protein samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with either a mixture of monoclonal antibodies specific to p53 (1801, 240, and 421 supernatant), a monoclonal anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) antibody (Pharmingen), monoclonal anti-PKC antibody (SC-937) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p21 antibody (Cell Signaling), or anti-actin (Sigma). Signals were visualized after incubation with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).
RNA Extraction and Northern blot Analysis Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer. Total RNA (10 or 50  microg) was resolved on a denaturing formaldehyde gel and electrotransferred overnight on a nylon membrane. The membrane was incubated with 10 ml of prehybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences) for 1.5 h, and radiolabeled probes were added directly to the prehybridization buffer for 24 h. The membranes were then washed twice in 2x SSC buffer at 65  degrees C with shaking for 5 min each followed by another wash with 1X SSC buffer at 65  degrees C with shaking for 15 min and twice in 0.1x SSC buffer at 65  degrees C with shaking for 5 min each. The signal was visualized by autoradiography.
Quantitative RT-PCR For each sample, 3  microg of total RNA obtained with TRIZOL (Sigma) were used for cDNA synthesis using the high capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems). 3  microl of the RT products were used for PCR amplification. The TaqMan primer probes for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and p53 were obtained from Applied Biosystems Assays-on-demand. The manufacturer's conditions were followed for TaqMan PCR with an Applied Biosystems 5700 Sequence Detection System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). One cycle of 50  degrees C UNG incubation for 2 min and 94  degrees C priming for 10 min was followed by 40 cycles of 94  degrees C denaturation for 15 s and 60  degrees C annealing for 1 min. Fluorescence was measured during the annealing step and plotted automatically for each sample.
Transient Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assay The wild type p53-expressing SN3 plasmid was obtained from Bert Vogelstein (25). The GFP-PKC (K-R)-expressing plasmid is a kinase-negative mutant in which the lysine residue at position 378 in the putative ATP-binding site has been substituted with arginine by site-directed mutagenesis and cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). The Renilla luciferase-expressing plasmid pRL-TK was purchased from Promega. The human P1-p53 promoter was a generous gift from David Reisman (26), and the human P2-mdm2 promoter was cloned into pGL2-Basic (Promega), a generous gift from Gareth Bond and Arnold Levine. H460 and H1299 cells were used as model for p53 present and absent cell lines grown as described above, and subconfluent cultures were transiently transfected with the various plasmid constructs using the LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer. For transfection of the various siRNA constructs, 50% confluent cultures were transfected using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's indications (Invitrogen). The siRNA duplexes were obtained from Qiagen (14). siRNA targeting GFP mRNA (Qiagen) was used as a negative control. Transiently transfected cells were harvested and analyzed using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's indications. Luciferase activity was assayed using a Luminoskan reader.
   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   TPA Inhibits Apoptosis in Cells with Wild-type p53 but Not in Cells Lacking p53 We demonstrated previously that TPA, by virtue of down-regulation of PKC , provides a survival signal that prevents apoptosis (12). To investigate whether the survival signals generated by TPA involved p53, we examined the effect of TPA upon DNA damage-induced apoptosis in human cancer cell lines with (27, 28) and without wild type p53 (29). The DNA-damaging agents CPT, MC, and DMC induced apoptosis of the human myeloid leukemia cell line ML-1 (which has wild type p53), as demonstrated by the cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate PARP, which is widely used as an indicator of apoptosis (Fig. 1A, lanes 3, 5, and 7) (30). However, when ML-1 cells were pretreated with TPA for 24 h, PARP cleavage induced by the DNA-damaging agents was almost completely inhibited for CPT and MC (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 6). Similar data were obtained using flow cytometry where the CPT-induced appearance of sub-G1 DNA was also prevented by TPA treatment (data not shown). TPA was also able to inhibit the CPT- and MC-induced apoptosis of a number of other cell lines expressing wild-type p53 including LnCAP, H460, and MCF-7 (data not shown and Fig. 3D). Whereas CPT and MC require p53 in order to mediate significant apoptosis, DMC in addition to activating the p53 pathway is also able to induce apoptosis in the absence of p53 (31). When a similar experiment was performed with K562 cells, which lack p53, the DNA-damaging agent DMC induced significant PARP cleavage; however, TPA treatment had no effect upon PARP cleavage in these cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8). Modest PARP cleavage was also induced by CPT and MC in the K562 cells, and this cleavage was similarly unaffected by TPA treatment (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 to 6). A further demonstration of the lack of TPA inhibition of p53-independent apoptosis is shown in Fig. 1C, where neither the DMC-induced apoptosis of H460 cells (containing wild-type p53) or H1299 cells (without wild-type p53) were rescued by TPA pretreatment. The mechanism of action of DMC is under current investigation. Interestingly, we observed that TPA was able to partially rescue DMC-induced apoptosis in ML-1 cells (Fig. 1A). At this time, we do not know why TPA is able to inhibit DMC-induced apoptosis of ML-1 cells, but this does not detract from our finding that in cell lines that do not have p53, apoptosis is not inhibited by TPA.

A, the effect of TPA upon DNA damage-induced PARP cleavage in ML-1 cells (wild type p53) was determined by Western blot analysis. Cell extracts were prepared from ML-1 cells either left untreated (lane 1) or treated for 24 h with 0.5  microM CPT (lanes 3 and 4), 5  microM MC (lanes 5 and 6), 5  microM DMC (lanes 7 and 8). Where indicated, cells where pretreated with TPA (10 nM) for 21 h prior to the addition of the DNA-damaging agent. 25  microg of nuclear proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-human PARP antibody. Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-actin antibody. B, the effect of TPA upon DNA damage-induced PARP cleavage in K562 cells (lacking p53) was determined exactly as in A. C, DMC-mediated apoptosis was examined in H460 cells (with wild type p53) and in H1299 cells (lacking p53). Exponentially growing cells were either left untreated or treated with DMC (5  microM) for 24 h. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with TPA (10 nM) for 21 h prior to the addition of DMC. Proteins were analyzed as in A. D, kinetics of the TPA effect upon DNA damage-induced PARP cleavage in ML-1 cells was determined as in A. Cells were either left untreated (lane 1) or pretreated with TPA (10 nM) for the times indicated prior to 3-h CPT treatment. DMSO, Me2SO.

Pharmacological inhibition or down-regulation of PKC specifically inhibits DNA damage-induced p53 protein stabilization and protects against p53-dependent apoptosis. A, the effect of TPA and bryostatin 1 upon DNA damage-induced PARP cleavage and p53 levels in MCF-7 cells was determined by Western blot analysis as in Fig. 2. Whole cell extracts were prepared from cells either left untreated (lane 1), treated with 1  microM CPT for 16 h (lane 2), or pretreated with TPA (400 nM) for 24 h prior to the CPT treatment (lane 3) or pretreated with both 400 nM TPA and bryostatin 1 (1  microM) for 24 h (lane 4) prior to treatment with CPT. B, extracts from MCF-7 cells as shown above were also analyzed by Western blot for PKC . C, the ability of rottlerin to inhibit ML-1 cell apoptosis was examined by florescence-activated cell sorting. Exponentially growing ML-1 cells were either treated with 6  microM rottlerin or with 0.5  microM PCT in the presence or absence of 6  microM rottlerin for 4 h. D, the ability of rottlerin to inhibit the DNA damage-induced stabilization of p53 in ML-1 cells was examined by Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts. The level of p21 expression was also monitored as indicated. Exponentially growing cells were either left untreated (lanes 1 and 2) or treated with 0.5  microM CPT (lanes 3 and 4), 8  microM etoposide (lanes 5 and 6), 50  microg/ml zeocin (lanes 7 and 8), or 5  microM MC (lanes 9 and 10) for 4 h in the presence or absence of 6  microM rottlerin. E, the corresponding cytoplasmic extracts were also examined. DMSO, Me2SO.
  Our data implicated that p53 was involved in the TPAmediated rescue from apoptosis. We were interested in the kinetics of the rescue by TPA. We examined the kinetics of the TPA-induced prevention of CPT-induced PARP cleavage in ML-1 cells, and, as shown in Fig. 1D, prevention of CPTinduced PARP cleavage can begin to be detected between 6 and 9 h. This kinetics is important, because TPA treatment is known to initially activate PKC , but over time depletion of cellular PKC levels occurs via the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway (9, 10). Therefore, we went on to examine the relationship between this TPA-mediated inhibition of apoptosis and the depletion of PKC to the ability of DNA-damaging drugs to induce p53 protein accumulation.
DNA Damage-induced Stabilization of p53 Is Inhibited by the Depletion and Inhibition of PKC  To further our investigation of the influence of TPA on the p53 pathway, DNA damage-induced p53 was compared in the presence and absence of TPA. ML-1 cells were pretreated with TPA for increasing times, and the influence on the induction of p53 was observed by Western blot analysis. Treatment of ML-1 cells with 0.5  microM CPT rapidly induces nuclear accumulation of the p53 protein (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Pretreatment of ML-1 cells with 10 nM TPA for 6 h or longer inhibited CPT-induced p53 accumulation in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 to 9). The ability of TPA to inhibit p53 nuclear accumulation was not due to a change in p53 shuttling, since after TPA pretreatment there was no detectable accumulation of cytoplasmic p53 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2B, PKC is largely depleted by 6 h of TPA treatment in the ML-1 cells. The kinetics of PKC depletion slightly preceded the disappearance of p53 induction observed in Fig. 2A (compare lanes 4 to 9 for A and B), consistent with the inhibition of p53 induction being due to the depletion of PKC . Also shown in Fig. 2B is the CPT-induced appearance of the 40-kDa catalytically active fragment of PKC . This 40-kDa fragment is associated with apoptosis, and this catalytic fragment is equally depleted by TPA pretreatment (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 to 5) (15).
View larger version (39K):    FIG. 2. TPA inhibits p53 protein stabilization in response to a variety of DNA damaging agents and depletes cells of PKC . A, the effect of TPA on DNA damage-induced increases in p53 protein was determined by Western blot analysis of p53 protein in nuclear extracts. ML-1 cells were either left untreated or treated with 10 nM TPA for the times indicated, followed by treatment with 0.5  microM CPT for 3 h. 25  microg of nuclear protein were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with a mixture of p53-specific monoclonal antibodies (240, 421, and 1801). B, the effect of TPA on PKC levels was determined by Western blot analysis of the same preparation of extract shown in A. The cytoplasmic extracts of ML-1 cells were resolved by electrophoresis and probed with anti-human PKC antibody and anti-actin as a loading control. C, the effect of TPA upon DNA damage-induced p53 protein levels was performed as in A using 5  microM MC (lanes 3 and 4), 5  microM DMC (lanes 5 and 6), and 50  microg/ml zeocin (lanes 7 and 8). DNA-damaging agents were added for 4 h. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with 10 nM TPA for 21 h prior to the addition of the DNA-damaging agent. D, the influence of TPA on the level of PKC was analyzed as in B. E, the ability of TPA to down-regulate the p53 stabilization and the level of PKC , respectively, was also analyzed in extracts from the H460 cell line (E and F). Cells were either left untreated or treated with CPT (0.5  microM), etoposide (8  microM), or MC (5  microM) for 4 h. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with TPA (10 nM) for 21 h prior to the addition of the DNA-damaging agent. The blots were probed for p53, PKC , and actin as in A and B.
  Pretreatment of ML-1 cells with TPA also inhibited the DNA damage-mediated induction of p53 by MC, DMC, and zeocin (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the effect of TPA on p53 nuclear accumulation was able to block different DNA damage sensor pathways evoked by different drugs. Once again, depletion of PKC correlated with the block of p53 accumulation (Fig. 2D). This was not a cell type-specific phenomenon, since the same correlation between the inhibition of p53 accumulation and PKC depletion was observed when H460 cells were treated with MC, DMC, and zeocin (Fig. 2, E and F).
To further investigate whether the effect of TPA on p53 and p53-dependent apoptosis was in fact dependent on the ability of TPA to down-regulate PKC , we took advantage of the observation that bryostatin 1 can specifically prevent the downregulation of PKC by TPA in certain cell lines under specific conditions (9, 32). We examined the effect of TPA upon DNA damage-induced apoptosis in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, which also has wild type p53 (28). As shown in Fig. 3A, CPT strongly induced PARP cleavage, which was completely inhibited by TPA pretreatment for 24 h. Importantly, the effect of TPA was overcome by bryostatin 1 (Fig. 3A). Bryostatin 1 has been shown to prevent the tumor-promoting effects of TPA in a number of cell lines (9, 32). As can be seen in Fig. 3B, the addition of bryostatin 1 to MCF-7 cells was able to reverse the TPA-mediated depletion of PKC . Additionally, the TPA-mediated inhibition of p53 accumulation was rescued in the presence of bryostatin 1. Thus, the antiapoptotic effect of TPA in the MCF-7 cells was probably due to the down-regulation of PKC .
Rottlerin is a compound that has been widely used to inhibit PKC (14, 16, 33). We examined the effect of rottlerin upon the DNA damage-mediated induction of p53 in ML-1 cells. This inhibition of PKC activity resulted in the inhibition of CPTmediated apoptosis as indicated by the lack of sub-G1 DNA content observed in the florescence-activated cell sorting analysis of cells treated with CPT together with rottlerin (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the hypothesis that PKC was required for p53 accumulation, the specific PKC inhibitor, rottlerin, blocked the accumulation of p53 in response to several DNAdamaging agents (Fig. 3D). This inhibition of p53 accumulation by rottlerin was evident in both the cytoplasmic as well as the nuclear extract (Fig. 3, D and E), demonstrating that the inhibition of p53 accumulation does not result from a change in p53 transport. Treatment of ML-1 cells with the conventional PKC isotype-specific inhibitor GO6976 (11) had no effect on p53 induction by DNA-damaging agents (data not shown), indicating that down-regulation of conventional PKC isoforms does not play a role in the effects observed here. These data suggest that the ability to suppress p53 accumulation is mediated by the inhibition of PKC .
Stabilization of p53 by Proteosome Inhibitors Is Blocked by TPA Treatment and Pharmacological Inhibition of PKC  The increase in the level of p53 after DNA damage has been demonstrated to occur at the post-transcriptional level, although some regulation of p53 at the level of transcription has been observed (34 to 36). The ubiquitin proteosome pathway is involved in the degradation of p53, and after DNA damage the p53 protein is post-translationally modified so that it is no longer targeted for degradation (37). The levels of p53 can therefore be increased chemically by using inhibitors of the proteosome pathway (4, 38, 39). We reasoned that if TPA pretreatment of cells was inhibiting stabilization of p53 through increased degradation of the protein, then chemical inhibition of the proteosome pathway would be able to increase p53 levels even after the cells were pretreated with TPA. However, surprisingly, we observed that TPA pretreatment of ML-1 cells completely inhibited the ability of the proteosome inhibitor LLnL to stabilize p53 (Fig. 4A). Similarly, rottlerin was also able to prevent p53 accumulation induced by proteosome inhibition (Fig. 4B), implicating a requirement of PKC for synthesis of p53. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of TPA and PKC inhibition on p53 protein accumulation was apparently not due to enhanced p53 degradation by a proteosome-mediated proteolysis pathway.
View larger version (36K):    FIG. 4. p53 stabilization by proteosome inhibition is blocked by TPA and inhibition of PKC . A, the effect of TPA upon elevated p53 expression induced by the proteosome inhibitor LLnL was determined by Western blot analysis as in Fig. 2. Nuclear protein was prepared from ML-1 cells left untreated (lane 1) or treated with 20  microM LLnL (lanes 3 and 4) for 4 h. Where indicated, the cells were preincubated with 10 nM TPA for 21 h prior to the addition of LLnL. B, the effect of rottlerin upon elevated p53 expression induced by the proteosome inhibitor LLnL was determined as in A. Nuclear extracts were prepared from ML-1 cells left untreated (lane 1) or treated with 20  microM LLnL (lanes 3 and 4) in the presence (lanes 2 and 4) or absence (lanes 1 and 3) of 6  microM rottlerin. DMSO, Me2SO.
  Basal Transcription of p53 Is Blocked by TPA Treatment and Inhibition of PKC  In light of the proteosome inhibition data, it became clear that the ability of TPA to suppress p53 accumulation was not due to destabilization of the protein as is usually the case for down-regulation of p53 (37). We therefore investigated whether TPA was down-regulating p53 transcription. ML-1 cells were treated with TPA for increasing times, and RNA was extracted. Northern blot analysis using a p53 probe was then carried out. A clear reduction in the basal level of p53 transcript was evident with increasing time of TPA pretreatment, beginning after 8 h (Fig. 5A). The inhibition of p53 basal transcription after 8 h of TPA treatment was quantified using TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 5B). Importantly, the inhibitory effect of TPA on p53 was maintained in cells treated with the various DNA-damaging agents (data not shown). Slightly greater than 50% inhibition of p53 mRNA levels was observed after 8 h of TPA treatment. Down-regulation of PKC expression by siRNA has been associated with attenuation of the DNA damage-induced response (14, 16). We used siPKC as an additional means to confirm the requirement of PKC for the basal transcription of p53 (Fig. 5C). With the siRNA to PKC , we were able to inhibit the level of PKC protein by 38% as determined from the densitometry scanning of Western blot analysis, and the basal p53 message (monitored by quantitative TaqMan RT-PCR) was inhibited by 35%. Significantly, in addition to TPA, the PKC inhibitor also blocked p53 transcription (Fig. 5D). Whereas the proteosome inhibitor LLnL did not affect the level of p53 mRNA, the reduction of p53 mRNA was evident in the presence of LLnL and the PKC inhibitor (Fig. 5D). Inhibition of p53 mRNA by rottlerin was also associated with inhibition of transcription of p53 downstream target genes p21 and hdm2 activated in the presence of LLnL treatment (Fig. 5D, compare lanes 2 and 4). The conventional PKC inhibitor GO6976 had no effect on the level of either p53 or p21 induced by DNA-damaging agents (data not shown), indicating that inhibition of conventional PKC isoforms does not play a role in the effects of TPA observed here. No reduction in the kinetics of message stability in the presence of TPA was observed by TaqMan quantitative PCR of samples from actinomycin D-treated cells (Fig. 5E).
View larger version (33K):    FIG. 5. Basal transcription of p53 RNA is blocked by TPA treatment and inhibition of PKC . A, the effect of TPA upon the level of p53 RNA in ML-1 cells was examined by Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing ML-1 cells either left untreated (lane 1) or treated with 10 nM TPA for various times as indicated. 10  microg of total RNA was resolved on a denaturing formaldehyde gel, transferred electrophoretically to a nylon membrane, and probed for p53. 18 S rRNA was used a loading control. B, the basal human p53 mRNA level was also examined by quantitative RT-PCR analysis using an Applied Biosystems TaqMan Assays on Demand p53 primer set. ML-1 cells were either left untreated (control) or treated with 10 nM TPA for 8 h. C, inhibition of PKC by siRNA and its effect on p53 gene transcription was examined. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of p53 mRNA (histogram) as in B as well as Western blot analysis of the PKC protein level (inset) in the H460 cell line transfected with siRNA against PKC . H460 cells were transfected as described under "Materials and Methods" with either siRNA against the GFP mRNA or PKC mRNA as indicated. The data are representative of four independent experiments. D, the effect of LLnL and rottlerin on p53, p21, hdm2, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA levels as in A. Northern blot analysis of ML-1 total RNA from exponentially growing ML-1 cells either left untreated (lane 1) or treated with 20  microM LLnL for 4 h in the presence (lane 4) or absence (lane 2) of 6  microM rottlerin that was added at the same time is shown. 50  microg of total RNA was resolved on a denaturing formaldehyde gel, transferred electrophoretically to a nylon membrane, and probed for p53, p21, hdm2, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh). E, to determine whether TPA interfered with the stability of p53 mRNA in the ML-1 cells, the cells were treated with actinomycin D. ML-1 cells were either left untreated (control) or treated with TPA (10 nM) for 5 h (time 0 h). Control and TPA-treated cells were then treated with actinomycin D (10  microg/ml), and aliquots were harvested after 2-, 4-, 6-, and 8-h treatment with actinomycin D (data are representative of four independent experiments). Total RNA was extracted and analyzed as in B.
  We next examined the effect of PKC inhibition upon gene expression from the p53 promoter. Studies on regulation of p53 promoter activation are not plentiful; however, it has been demonstrated that numerous transcription factors influence human p53 transcription, including AP-1, HoxA5, YY1, NF-B, and Myc (40). Using a human p53 promoter luciferase construct containing the region previously shown to be regulated by the above mentioned transcription factors (34), we examined the influence of inhibiting PKC activity on p53 promoter activity. Transient transfection experiments were carried out in the H1299 cells that have no endogenous p53. We observed that a dominant negative PKC construct was able to inhibit transcription from the p53 promoter (Fig. 6A), whereas the same construct did not inhibit transcription from the p53 dependent Mdm2 P2 promoter in either the presence or absence of exogenous p53 protein (Fig. 6B). Similar results were observed in K562 cells (data not shown). The expressed PKC was tagged with GFP, allowing us to monitor the transfection efficiency for these experiments, and all were greater than 90%. The data were normalized to Renilla expression. These data indicate that PKC activity plays an important role in the initiation of p53 transcription.

A, p53 promoter activation was investigated by transient transfection of H1299 cells, which lack p53, with p53 HP1-luc plasmid (provided by David Reisman). H1299 cells were transiently transfected as described under "Materials and Methods" with p53 HP1-luc, a luciferase reporter driven by the human P1-p53 promoter. Where indicated, cells were cotransfected with an increasing concentration of a dominant negative mutant of GFP-PKC . PKC (K-R) is a kinase-negative mutant in which the lysine residue at position 378 in the putative ATP-binding site has been substituted with arginine by site-directed mutagenesis. Extracts were prepared according to the manufacturer of the assay system, and firefly luciferase expression was monitored. Data for p53 HP1-luc represent luciferase activity normalized to co-transfected Renilla reporter expression. B, the specificity of PKC (K-R) for the p53 promoter was tested by examining its effect of the mdm2 P2 promoter. H1299 cells as in A were either transfected with human mdm2 P2 (p53-specific) promoter driving luciferase (mdm2-luc) or cotransfected with a wild type p53-expressing SN3 plasmid in the presence of increasing concentrations of the GFP-PKC (K-R) plasmid. Protein extracts were analyzed as in A and presented as luciferase activity relative to Mdm2-luc-transfected cells normalized for Renilla.
     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Agents in the environment are often associated with the promotion of tumor formation; however, none have been shown to directly inhibit transcription of the p53 gene. Here we document that the DNA damage-induced increase in p53 accumulation mediated by CPT, MC, etoposide, and zeocin is dramatically inhibited by pretreatment of cells with the tumor promoter TPA. Additionally, the PKC inhibitor, rottlerin, was also able to block the DNA damage-mediated induction of p53 by these drugs. Most significantly, we show that pretreatment of cells with TPA or treatment with rottlerin results in the inhibition of basal p53 transcription. Therefore, accumulation of p53 could not be achieved by any means, including proteosome inhibition, after TPA or rottlerin treatment, because p53 transcription was blocked.
In agreement with previously proposed models, our results support the idea that PKC is involved in a tumor suppressor pathway that involves p53 (19). Recently a role for PKC in the accumulation of p53 and the induction of apoptosis in bovine endothelial cells has been shown (41). Additionally, it has been shown previously that the tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 4--phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate transiently down-modulated p53 mRNA levels (42). Using siRNA to inactivate PKC , we have demonstrated a direct requirement for PKC in controlling basal human p53 transcription. In addition to demonstrating that TPA treatment does not decrease p53 message stability, we used a dominant negative PKC in co-transfection studies to extend the analysis of PKC inhibition. This extension examines p53 promoter regulation. Our results show that the initiation of transcription from the p53 promoter can be blocked by the inhibition of PKC . Whereas our studies do not rule out an additional effect of TPA and PKC down-regulation upon p53 protein stability, they do reveal a novel mechanism for suppressing p53 expression that probably contributes to tumor promotion by phorbol esters. In fact, our preliminary data show that TPA can increase the level of Mdm2 protein while the mdm2 mRNA remains constant.2 This suggests that an additional mechanism is also present to efficiently eliminate any existing p53.
Our results raise several important questions regarding how tumor promoters might regulate the initiation of p53 transcription and suggest a model in which DNA damage in the presence of such tumor promoters could result in malignant transformation (Fig. 7, A versus B). Repression of the p53 promoter has been suggested as a mechanism for tumor promotion (34, 43). Damaged genes in tumor cells are usually thought to be the mechanistic drivers toward oncogenesis. However, down-regulation of endogenous genes, specifically tumor suppressors, may also be a key regulatory mechanism resulting in tumor promotion. Our data provide a transcriptional repression mechanism for tumor promotion by TPA and predict that agents that interfere with the activity of PKC may inhibit p53 responses. We have begun to compare the DNA binding activity of transcription factors known to bind to the p53 promoter in extracts from cells before and after the inactivation of PKC . Presently, we have not found the DNA binding activity of any transcription factor inhibited and have confirmed the previous finding that NF-B is activated by TPA treatment in most (but not all) of the cell lines tested.3 Continued promoter studies are in progress to search for either a repressor or activator involved in p53 transcription that may be regulated by PKC . One possibility is the Ets-2 protein, because there is a binding site for this protein in the p53 promoter, and PKC regulates the level of Ets-2 protein (44).
View larger version (19K):    FIG. 7. Inhibition of PKC promotes malignant transformation by the inhibition of basal p53 transcription. A, DNA damage activates the pathway to stabilize p53 and thus to initiate growth arrest and apoptosis. B, DNA damage, in the presence of inhibition of PKC , is unable to activate the p53 stabilization, because p53 mRNA is reduced, resulting in no p53 protein, and therefore genomic instability and malignant transformation are the result.
 
Since activating the p53 apoptotic pathway is a checkpoint used by cells to avoid mutations from damaged DNA and is the target of many chemotherapeutic regimes, it is possible that agents with PKC -activating properties may provide synergistic cytotoxic activity. Conversely, agents that have PKC -inactivating potential may drastically reduce chemotherapeutic drug efficacy. In this regard, it is of interest that bryostatin 1, which is in clinical trials for several cancers (45), modulates the activity of PKC isoforms. It may be that the antineoplastic properties of bryostatin 1 are due to effects upon PKC . Our findings demonstrate that focusing on the transcriptional regulation of p53 presents a novel targeted approach in the war against cancer and highlights the possibility that agents in the environment may adversely affect the p53 pathway by inhibiting the transcription of tumor suppressor genes.
