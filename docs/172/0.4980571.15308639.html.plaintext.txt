   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The p53 protein plays a major role in the maintenance of genome stability in mammalian cells. Mutations of p53 occur in over 50% of all cancers and are indicative of highly aggressive cancers that are hard to treat. Recently, there has been a high degree of interest in therapeutic approaches to restore growth suppression functions to mutant p53. Several compounds have been reported to restore wild type function to mutant p53. One such compound, CP-31398, has been shown effective in vivo, but questions have arisen to whether it actually affects p53. Here we show that mutant p53, isolated from cells treated with CP-31398, is capable of binding to p53 response elements in vitro. We also show the compound restores DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in cells as determined by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In addition, using purified p53 core domain from two different hotspot mutants (R273H and R249S), we show that CP-31398 can restore DNA-binding activity in a dose-dependent manner. Using a quantitative DNA binding assay, we also show that CP-31398 increases significantly the amount of mutant p53 that binds to cognate DNA (Bmax) and its affinity (Kd) for DNA. The compound, however, does not affect the affinity (Kd value) of wild type p53 for DNA and only increases Bmax slightly. In a similar assay PRIMA1 does not have any effect on p53 core DNA-binding activity. We also show that CP-31398 had no effect on the DNA-binding activity of p53 homologs p63 and p73.
   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The p53 tumor suppressor protein belongs to a superfamily of transcription factors that includes its homologs p63 and p73. p53 is involved in a wide range of cellular activities that help ensure the stability of the genome, whereas p63 and p73 are involved in ectodermal morphogenesis, limb morphogenesis, neurogenesis, and homeostatic control and are not considered tumor suppressor genes (1). p53 is involved in DNA damage repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis via transcriptional regulation of genes involved in these activities or by direct interaction with other proteins (2 to 4). Mutations that inactivate p53 are present in over 50% of all cancers and are indicative of aggressive cancers that are difficult to treat by chemotherapy or ionizing radiation (2, 5).
The majority of inactivating mutations reside in the central core DNA binding domain (DBD)1 of p53 (2, 5). These mutations can be divided into two main classes, DNA contact mutants, like R273H, where the mutation alters a residue involved in contact with DNA, and structural mutants, like R249S, which result in structural changes in the p53 core domain (6 to 8). These mutations affect the function of p53 by distorting the structure and reducing the thermal stability of the protein (6 to 8). This can alter the ability of p53 to bind to various p53 response elements in a variety of genes, hampering its transcriptional regulation (9). In addition, these mutations may alter p53 structure, so that p53 can no longer induce apoptosis by binding to BclXL, thereby inhibiting its anti-apoptotic function (10).
One potential therapeutic approach to cancer would be restoration of growth suppression activity to mutant p53. Several approaches have been tried, ranging from micro-injection of monoclonal antibody 421, C-terminal peptide of p53 and small molecules (11 to 16). Recently, small molecules and peptides, such as CP-31398, PRIMA1, and CDB3 peptide, have been shown to be effective in restoring p53 function (17 to 25). Both PRIMA1 and CDB3 have been shown to restore p53 DNA-binding activity in vitro (18 to 21), whereas the effects for CP-31398 have been shown primarily in cell-based assays (17, 22 to 25). Both CP-31398 and PRIMA1 have been shown to reduce tumor size in animal models (17, 18). It is postulated that the two molecules perform similar tasks, but by different mechanisms. PRIMA1 has been suggested to work more broadly to restore p53 DNA-binding activity, but the specific mechanism is not known (18). CP-31398, on the other hand, has been suggested to stabilize p53 as a protectant against thermal denaturation and maintain monoclonal antibody 1620 epitope conformation in newly synthesized p53 (17). Recently, CP-31398 has also been shown to stabilize wild type p53 in cells by inhibiting Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation (23). Reports from other studies suggest that CP-31398 interacts with DNA and not with p53 in vitro, and it is proposed to act as a DNA-damaging agent (26). Although it has been shown that the effects of CP-31398 on p53 do not depend on the DNA damage pathway (23), its p53-independent cellular growth suppression effects at higher concentrations and lack of demonstrated binding to p53 protein raise confusion about its mechanism of action (24 to 26). Here we demonstrate that CP-31398 can promote mutant p53 to bind to p53 response elements in vivo using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. In addition, using purified p53 core domain, we clearly demonstrate that CP-31398 can restore DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in vitro. We also show that CP-31398 does not have any effects on the DNA-binding activity of the p53 homologs, p63 and p73. In contrast, PRIMA1 was ineffective in restoring DNA-binding activity to isolated mutant p53 DNA binding domain.
   EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Cell Culture WiDr cells, which contain an R273H hotspot mutation, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium from Invitrogen, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin. H1299 cells were grown in RPMI medium from Invitrogen, supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin and streptomycin. SkBr3 (mt.p53) cells were grown in McCoy's medium from Invitrogen, supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin.
Cell Transfection WiDr cells were transfected with either pSuper or pSuper-p53 (gift of Dr. J. Wischhusen) (24) by electroporation using a Bio-Rad GenePulser.
Flow Cytometry Analysis H1299 (p53-null) and SkBr3 cells were treated for 24 h with either 0 or 2.5  microg/ml CP-31398. After 24 h, the cells were trypsinized, fixed in 70% methanol, and then washed in phosphate-buffered saline. The fixed cells were stained with 50  microg/ml propidium iodide and analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACS Vantage instrument.
Cell Lysis and Western Blotting Cell lysis of WiDr cells was carried out using the method of Foster et al. (17). 40 mg of cell lysate was run either on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (for p53 and actin) or a 4 to 20% polyacrylamide gradient gel (p21 and bax). The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and probed with antibodies to p53 (DO1), actin (Sigma), Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or p21 (Calbiochem).
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay WiDr cells were plated at 107 cells/ml and treated for 24 h with either 1% Me2SO (untreated) or 10  microg/ml CP-31398 in 1% Me2SO final. The ChIP assay was performed as described by Frank et al. (27). Immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence or absence of p53 antibody DO1 (Calbiochem). PCR was performed with 10  microl of DNA, 800 nM primers, and fluorescent probe (28) diluted in a final volume of 30  microl. The accumulations of fluorescence products were monitored on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector. The primer/probe pairs used were as follows. Bax: forward, 5'-TCCCCCCGAGAGGTCTTTT-3'; reverse, 5'-CGGCCCCAGTTGAAGTTG-3'; probe (6FAM): 5'-TCAGAAAACATGTCAGCTGCCACTCGG-3'; p21: forward, 5'-TGGAGACTCTCAGGGTCGAAA-3'; reverse, 5'-GGCGTTTGGAGTGGTAGAAATC-3'; probe (6FAM): 5'-CGGCGGCAGACCAGCATGAC-3'; S9: forward, 5'-GGCTCCGGAACAAACGTG-3'; reverse, 5'-GCGGCCTTGCGGATCT-3'; and probe (6FAM) 5'-TCTGGAGGGTCAAATTTACCCTGGCC-3'.
Cloning, Expression, and Purification The DNA binding domain of p53 (aa92 to 312) was generated via PCR from plasmid pCTK53 (Isabella Atencio, Canji Inc.) using gene-specific primers 5'-ATGGATCCATGTCATCTTCTGTCCCTTCC-3' and 5'-TAAAGCTTTCAGGTGTTGTTGGGCAGTGC-3'. The resulting product was cloned into the BamHI/HindIII site of plasmid pET42a (Novagen), to generate a recombinant GST-5X His fusion protein (GST-His p53DBD wt). A mutant p53R249S was generated by the same method from pCTMR249S and called pGST-His p53DBDR249S. The p53 mutant, R273H was generated by mutagenesis of pCTK53 by polymerase chain reaction. The subsequent mutant was then used to generate the mutated DNA binding domain by the same procedure as for the wild type DNA binding domain. The resulting PCR product was also cloned into BamHI/HindIII site in pET42a to generate the recombinant GST-5X His fusion protein (GST-His p53DBDR273H). The DNA binding domains of p63 and p73 were generated by polymerase chain reaction from plasmids pCUB 412 (p63) and pCUB370 (p73) (gifts of Dr. Charles DiComo) using gene-specific primers 5'-CATGCCATGGCAAGCTCCACCTTCGATGCTCTC-3' and 5'-CCCAAGCTTTCATGTCATCTGGATACCATGTC-3' for p63 and 5'-CATGCCATGGCAAGCTCCACCTTCGACACCATGTC-3' and 5'-CCCAAGCTTACTCTTCTTCACACCGGCACC-3' for p73. The resulting PCR products were cloned similarly into pET42a and expressed as a GST-5X His fusion protein, GST-His p63DBD, and GST-His p73DBD.
The various plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) bacteria for expression. p53 containing plasmid-transformed bacteria were initially grown at 30  degrees C until they reached an A600 of 0.8 to 1.2 and then were cooled to 18  degrees C. After 1 h at low temperature, they were induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl-1-thio--D-galactopyranoside (Sigma) and grown overnight at 18  degrees C. p63 and p73, containing plasmid-transformed bacteria, were initially grown at 37  degrees C, and then shifted to 28  degrees C and induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl-1-thio--D-galactopyranoside. The cultures were grown overnight at 28  degrees C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 10 min and then resuspended in buffer containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM -mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). After resuspension, Triton X-100 (Sigma) was added to 1% in volume, and the bacterial paste was lysed by sonication (Kontes). The lysate was rotated at 4  degrees C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 1 h. The lysate was filtered with a Whatman Puradisc filter and applied to a 20-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (AP Biotech) column, equilibrated with 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 10  microM ZnCl2. The flow-through and the first column wash were collected and applied to an HR16/10 glutathione-Sepharose column (AP Biotech) equilibrated in the above buffer. The protein was eluted with a single step of 40 mM glutathione in 50 mM Hepes, pH 8.3, 100 mM NaCl, and 10  microM ZnCl2. The eluted peak was then applied to a Mono S HR5/5 column (AP Biotech) equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mM NaCl, 10  microM ZnCl2, and 10 mM -mercaptoethanol. The protein was eluted with a salt gradient from 0.1 to 1 M NaCl in the same buffer. The material was then pooled and frozen at  to 80  degrees C for later use in assays.
Nuclear Extract Preparation Nuclear extracts of WiDr cells were prepared according to a published method (28). Cells were grown to 80 to 90% confluence on 100-cm2 plates and treated with either 10 mg/ml CP-31398, in a final concentration of 1% Me2SO, or 1% Me2SO for 24 h. The cells were then washed with 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped off the plate in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 500 x g at 4  degrees C for 5 min. The volume of the packed pellet was estimated and was added to four volumes of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, with protease inhibitor tablet) while the pellet was being vortexed. The resuspended pellet was left on ice for 5 min, followed by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in four volumes of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and re-centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded, and the packed nuclei volume was estimated. Three volumes of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1mM dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor) were added while vortexing. The extract was left at 4  degrees C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 25, 000 x g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and stored at  to 80  degrees C until use.
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay The EMSA (gel shift) assay was done with both nuclear extracts and recombinant proteins. The protein was added to a mixture containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mM MgCl2, 10  microM ZnCl2, 5% glycerol, 1  microg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 ng of deoxyinosine/deoxycytodine, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM spermidine in the presence or absence of CP-31398 and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. A 25-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the p53 consensus DNA binding sequence (5'-AGCTGGACATGCCCGGGCATGTCC-3') and end labeled with either 32P or 33P was added into the reaction, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 15 min. The mixture was loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (1x TBE is 100 mM Tris, 90 mM boric acid, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.4) and run at 150 V in 0.5x TBE (Invitrogen). The gel was dried and exposed on a Fuji Fluorescent Image Analyzer with the image being quantitated with the phosphorimaging software.
DNA Binding Assay To quantitate binding of p53 to either p53 consensus sequence or bax promoter sequence (5'-AGCACAAGCCTGGGCGTGGGC-3'), biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized (Research Genetics and IDT, respectively). First, protein and compound mixtures were incubated in reaction buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mM MgCl2, 10  microM ZnCl2, 1  microg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 ng of deoxyinosine/deoxycytodine, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 10 min at room temperature in a volume of 45  microl. Then, 5  microl of DNA was added to the mixture for a final volume of 50  microl, and the mixture incubated for an additional 10 min. Then 167 fmol of primary antibody (Anti-Penta His monoclonal antibody, Qiagen) and 12.5  microg of streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynal) in antibody buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mM MgCl2, 10  microM ZnCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) were added, and the mixture was shaken for 1 h at room temperature. At 1 h, 333 fmol of secondary goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Laboratories) labeled with Ruthenium oxide (IGEN) was added according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the mixture was incubated with shaking for an additional hour. At the end of the incubation, 75  microl of antibody buffer was added to bring the final volume to 200  microl. The reaction mixture was then assayed on either an M8 analyzer or M384 analyzer workstation (IGEN) using IGEN read and stop buffer. Data were analyzed using Prism 3.0 software from Graph-Pad Software.
   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   CP-31398 Restores p53 Activity to Mutant p53 in Vivo To evaluate the effects of CP-31398 in restoring wild type p53 function to mutant p53, we tested to see if the compound could restore p53-mediated apoptosis to cells harboring mutant p53. We treated both H1299 cells, which are p53-null cells, and SkBr3 tumor cells, which have the p53 mutation R175H, with or without 2.5  microg/ml CP-31398 and assayed for apoptosis via fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (Fig. 1A). Apoptosis is only seen in the SkBr3 cells that are treated with 2.5  microg/ml CP-31398. The H1299 cells show no apoptosis effect when treated with CP-31398 and are similar to the untreated H1299 cells. Previous reports (22 to 25) have shown that CP-31398 can induce p53-mediated apoptosis in mutant p53 tumor cells and that it has maximal effectiveness at 10  microg/ml, which is the concentration that we used in subsequent experiments.

A, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of H1299 cells (p53-null) and SkBr 3 cells (mutant p53, R175H) treated for 24 h with either 0 or 2.5  microg/ml CP-31398, stained with propidium iodide, and assayed by flow cytometry for pre-G1 cells. B, DNA-binding activity of a nuclear extract from WiDr cells treated with 0 or 10  microg/ml CP-31398. 1  microg of nuclear extract was incubated with 33P-labled p53 consensus oligonucleotide in the presence or absence of unlabeled p53 consensuses oligonucleotide and then subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% TBE gel. C, Western blotting of WiDr cell lysates treated with 0 or 10  microg/ml CP-31398, using anti-p53, anti-actin, anti-bax, and anti-p21 antibodies. Cells were untransfected or transfected with either pSuper or pSuper-p53 DNA plasmids. D, quantitative PCR of p21, bax, and S9 ribosomal promoter for ChIP assay of WiDr cells treated with 0 or 10  microg/ml CP-31398 and processed as described under "Experimental Procedures." The assay was performed using an antibody that recognizes p53 (DO1) (closed bars) or with no antibody as a control (open bars).
  Because the effect of CP-31398 seems to be dependent upon the presence of p53, we treated WiDr cells, a colon tumor cell line that harbors an R273H hotspot mutation, with either 0 or 10  microg/ml CP-31398 for 24 h, and then made a nuclear extract, which we then used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using a consensus p53 DNA binding site (Fig. 1B) to see if CP-31398 could restore sequence-specific binding to mutant p53. Treatment with CP-31398 causes a shift of labeled probe that can be competed away with unlabeled p53 consensus oligonucleotide, in the CP-31398-treated nuclear extract, whereas no such band occurs in the untreated extract, indicating that the compound was capable of inducing mutant p53 to bind p53-specific DNA. To further demonstrate that the effect of CP-31398 was specific for p53-responsive genes, we treated WiDr cells with 0 or 10  microg/ml CP-31398 for 24 h, then made a cell lysate, and Western blotted for p53, bax, p21, and actin. Treatment with CP-31398 did not alter the level of either p53 or actin, but it significantly increased the level of both p21 and bax (Fig. 1C). In addition, we transiently transfected WiDr cells either with pSuper-p53, which encodes p53 SiRNA, or with the control empty vector, pSuper, then treated transfected cells with either 0 or 10  microg/ml CP-31398 for 24 h, made a cell lysate, and Western blotted for p53, actin, p21, and bax. The cells transfected with pSuper behaved similarly to the untransfected WiDr cells (Fig. 1C). The level of p53 and actin were unaltered, but there was a significant increase in the levels of both p21 and bax in the presence of CP-31398. With the pSuper-p53-transfected cells, actin levels were unaffected, but p53 levels were significantly decreased with or without CP-31398 (Fig. 1C). In addition, there was no induction of p21 or bax in the pSuper-p53-transfected cells, indicating that the effects of CP-31398 were dependent on the presence of p53.
To prove that the induction of bax and p21 was due to promoter binding of mutant p53 reactivated by CP-31398 in vivo, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay in WiDr cells treated with either 0 or 10  microg/ml CP-31398 for 24 h (Fig. 1D). Treatment with CP-31398 specifically increased the amount of both p21 and bax promoter DNA that was immunoprecipitated with p53-specific antibody DO1, whereas there was no increase in the amount of ribosomal protein S9 promoter DNA, whose promoter does not have a p53 response element. This indicates that the effect of CP-31398 is specific for p53 and promotes the reactivation of full-length mutant p53 into functional "wild type" p53, which is fully capable of binding DNA in vivo.
Characterization of CP-31398 Effects on p53 in Vitro Given that CP-31398 appears to be capable of restoring DNA-binding activity to full-length mutant p53 in vivo, we wanted to see if CP-31398 would be equally effective in a system using purified protein, free of any potential cellular contaminants. Previous reports (19) have indicated that CP-31398 protects the DNA binding domain of p53 from thermo-denaturation in vitro. We then cloned and expressed the DNA binding domain of wild type and mutant p53 as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2A). To see if the recombinant material was capable of binding to DNA, we performed an EMSA using wild type p53 DNA binding domain (GST-His p53DBD wt) (Fig. 2B). The wild type protein bound to a labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a p53 consensus binding sequence. Binding could be competed away with excess unlabeled p53-specific oligonucleotide but not with excess unlabeled nonspecific oligonucleotide. With wild type protein, a doublet is normally seen. The slower migrating band corresponds to the GST dimer of the protein, which is also observed with the mutant protein. The faster migrating lower band is monomeric GSTp53. Similar effects with GST fusion proteins have been previously observed (29).

C, EMSA analysis of R273H recombinant p53 in the presence of p53-C-terminal peptide or CP-31398 using either a p53 consensus DNA binding site oligonucleotide, or an altered p53 consensus DNA binding site oligonucleotide. D, concentration-dependent effect of CP-31398 in EMSA using mutant R273H GSTp53 DNA binding domain protein.
  To see the effect on mutant p53 protein, we tested the binding of mutant R273H GST-His p53 DNA binding domain protein to both a consensus p53 DNA binding site oligonucleotide and an altered p53 DNA binding site (Fig. 2C). Binding was measured in the presence or absence of 500 nM C-terminal peptide or 500 nM CP-31398. Both the peptide and CP-31398 caused specific binding to the consensus oligonucleotide, whereas no binding was seen with the altered oligonucleotide or in the absence of compound or peptide. Next, we titrated various concentrations of CP-31398 with the mutant protein (Fig. 2D). Binding of the protein to the labeled oligonucleotide was very low in the absence of compound. As the compound was increased up to 1  microM, there is an increase in binding activity, demonstrating that CP-31398 can dose dependently restore DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 core domain in an in vitro system. The apparent difference between the concentration used in vivo and the concentration used in vitro is possibly due to the unstable nature of CP-31398 (26), which can not be stored in solution at room temperature for an extended period.
Quantitation of CP-31398 Effects on p53 in Vitro To quantitate the effects of CP-31398 on p53, we have developed a quantitative DNA binding assay based upon an IGEN electro-chemiluminescence detection system, which captures a biotinylated oligonucleotide on a streptavidin-coated magnetic bead. If protein is bound to the captured oligonucleotide, it is detected using an antibody specific to the protein, followed by a secondary antibody labeled with ruthenium. The advantage of the electro-chemiluminescent system is that it is significantly more sensitive than an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and is capable of generating a more robust signal that helps to detect weak interactions.
The assay was validated using GST-His p53DBD wt and a biotinylated oligonucleotide containing the p53 consensus binding sequence (Fig. 3A). The amount of DNA was varied from 0 to 5 nM, and either 2.5 or 5 nM protein was used. To show the specificity of the assay, excess unlabeled oligonucleotide was used to compete with the biotinylated oligonucleotide. GST-His p53DBD wt showed saturable DNA binding both at 2.5 and 5 nM, which could be competed away with unlabeled oligonucleotide. Because CP-31398 was discovered in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based conformation stabilization assay using recombinant wild type p53 DNA binding domain (17), we wanted to see if CP-31398 had any effect on DNA-binding activity of wild type p53 core protein. We assayed wild type p53 at 5 nM protein in the absence and presence of 500 nM CP-31398 (Fig. 3B). The compound does not have any effect on the Kd of the protein for DNA (1.28  plus or minus  0.27 and 1.30  plus or minus  0.29, respectively) but increases the Bmax (129,004  plus or minus  9,302 and 191,645  plus or minus  14,161, respectively), suggesting that the compound increases the number of protein molecules that can be bound to DNA.

The DNA binding assay was conducted as described above with either 2.5 or 5 nM protein and increasing concentration of DNA in the presence or absence of 833 nM unlabeled oligonucleotide containing a consensus p53 binding site. B, effect of compound on wt p53. The DNA binding assay was performed with 10 nM of recombinant wild type p53 DNA binding domain and increasing concentration of biotinylated oligonucleotide in the presence or absence of 500 nM CP-31398.
  Next, we evaluated CP-31398 under similar conditions with two p53 mutants, R273H, a DNA contact point mutant, and R249S, a structural mutant (Fig. 4, A and B). Both the mutants showed little if any binding in the absence of compound. In the presence of 500 nM CP-31398 both mutants showed a dramatic increase in DNA binding, with the Bmax (R273H: 8890  plus or minus  1242 alone versus 108,047  plus or minus  8309 with CP-31398; R249S: 8031  plus or minus  739 alone versus 133,187  plus or minus  12,614 with CP-31398) increasing severalfold. In the case of the R273H mutant, the binding affinity (Kd = 4.7  plus or minus  1.1 and 2.73  plus or minus  0.40) increased by less than 2-fold, whereas the R249S mutant saw an increase of about 6-fold (Kd 3.98  plus or minus  0.61 alone versus 0.65  plus or minus  0.19 with CP-31398).
View larger version (17K):    FIG. 4. Effects of CP-31398 on mutant R273H (A) and R249S (B). The DNA binding assay was performed with 10 nM recombinant mutant p53 DNA binding domain and increasing concentrations of biotinylated p53 consensus oligonucleotide in the presence or absence of 500 nM CP-31398.
  To see if this effect was specific for the p53 consensus DNA binding sequence, the p53 DNA binding site from the Bax promoter was substituted for the consensus site in the assay. The p53 binding site in the Bax promoter (referred to as the bax site) has been reported to have a lower affinity for p53, and it binds p53 to a much lesser extent than the consensus binding sequence (9, 29). First we confirmed the effect of CP-31398 on wild type protein using the bax site (Fig. 5A). As with the consensus DNA the affinity of wild type p53 (Kd) for the bax site did not change in the presence of 500 nM CP-31398 (106.2  plus or minus  27.27 alone versus 104.5  plus or minus  18.71 with CP-31398), but the Bmax did (224,602  plus or minus  19,026 alone versus 353,797  plus or minus  26,649 with CP-31398). We assayed an R273H mutant protein with the bax site (Fig. 5B) and found that, again, the Bmax changed severalfold (5,072  plus or minus  870.5 alone versus 33,115  plus or minus  1,838 with CP-31398). The affinity of the mutant protein for the bax site increased 5-fold (Kd = 576.4  plus or minus  139.5 alone versus 81.20  plus or minus  11.58 with CP-31398). On the contrary, PRIMA1, which also reactivates mutant p53 (18), did not have any effect on Kd or Bmax in the binding assay (Kd = 535.6  plus or minus  100.8, Bmax = 4,121  plus or minus  539.7), indicating that the PRIMA1 compound may not act on the DNA binding domain of mutant p53 and may function by a different mechanism.

The DNA binding assay was performed with 10 nM recombinant protein and increasing concentrations of biotinylated oligonucleotide in the presence or absence of 500 nM CP-31398 with wild type p53 DNA binding domain (A) or in the presence or absence of either 500 nM CP-31398 or PRIMA compound with mutant p53 DNA binding domain protein R273H (B).
  Effects of CP-31398 on p63 and p73 One potential issue with CP-31398 is that it tends to be cytotoxic at doses over 15  microg/ml in a p53-independent manner (17, 23 to 25). Part of this cytotoxicity could be due to effects on the p53 homologs, p63 and p73. To see if CP-31398 had any effect on p63 or p73, we cloned and expressed the DNA binding domains of both proteins as GST fusions (29) (Fig. 6A) and confirmed their activity in EMSA (Fig. 6B). We then evaluated the effects of CP-31398 using the bax site in the binding assay, along with wild type p53 as a comparison. We also tested the peptide CDB3 at similar concentrations as CP-31398 to see if it to would have an effect on p63 and p73 similar to its reported effects on p53 (19 to 21). In the case of p53 (Fig. 7A), CP-31398 and CDB3 altered the Bmax (Table I), but not the Kd of wild type p53 binding to the Bax DNA. With p63 and p73 (Fig. 7, B and C), there was no increase in Bmax in the presence of CP-31398 or CDB3, and the reactions appeared to be similar to reactions done in the absence of CP-31398 (Table I). This suggests that CP-31398 and CDB3 do not interact with either p63 or p73 DNA binding domain, thus excluding a role for activation of p53 homologs in the cytotoxicity of CP-31398.

     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Restoration of wild type function to mutant p53 has recently become a viable and interesting approach for developing cancer therapeutics as more is understood about the mutational defects in p53 protein (2, 4). Recently, several compounds and peptides have been reported to restore growth suppression functions to mutant p53 in vitro. Two of these compounds, CP-31398 and PRIMA1, have been effective in reducing tumor size in animal models (17, 18). CP-31398 was discovered in a random screen of small molecules for their ability to protect wild type conformation (monoclonal antibody 1620 epitope) of p53 core domain from thermal denaturation (17). It has been suggested that p53 is a dynamic protein, an equilibrium exists between conformations, and mutation shifts the equilibrium toward the inactive conformation, promoting thermal denaturation at physiological temperature (6 to 8, 20). Oncogenic mutations change the conformation of core domain thus abolishing binding with cognate DNA molecules (31). Lack of evidence of direct interaction of CP-31398 with p53 core domain and controversy about the potential mechanism of action of this promising class of molecules prompted us to biochemically characterize its effects on DNA-binding activity of wild type and mutant p53 core domain.
Here we show that CP-31398 can promote p53-mediated apoptosis and induce the expression of p53-specific genes such as p21 and bax in cells with mutant p53 in a similar fashion as has been reported (22 to 25). We also show that CP-31398 has the ability to restore sequence-specific DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in the compound-treated nuclear extract in vitro in a manner similar to previous reports (25). In addition, using a ChIP assay, we demonstrate that CP-31398 can promote the binding of mutant p53 to the response elements in p53-regulated genes in cells. The binding of p53 to both p21 and bax promoter, and the failure of p53 to bind the S9 ribosomal protein promoter, indicate that CP-31398 interacts specifically with p53, and not DNA as had been previously suggested (26). CP-31398 can functionally restore mutant p53 to make capable of acting like wild type p53 and interact with both high (p21) and low (bax) affinity promoters (9, 30). The relatively high concentrations of CP-31398 needed for cellular experiments reported here and elsewhere (22 to 26) are indicative of a possible unstable nature of CP-31398 (26).
Our studies with the purified p53 DNA binding domain of wild type and mutant p53 clearly show that CP-31398 restores DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 core domain by increasing both Bmax and Kd values of the reaction. Interestingly, the compound stimulates the DNA-binding activity of wild type protein without having any effects on affinity for DNA. With the wild type protein, Bmax is increased (1.5-fold) but the Kd remains the same in the presence of the compound, whereas with both R273H and R249S mutants, Bmax is more greatly increased than Kd ( > 10-fold). This indicates that CP-31398 acts as a "non-competitive agonist," binding to the proteins, and alters the rate of the reaction and the amount of protein capable of binding to DNA, but not affecting the affinity of the protein for DNA. Such a result suggests an allosteric mechanism, where binding of the compound to a site away from the protein-DNA interface can cause the protein to be placed into a conformation capable of binding DNA (32). As with CDB3, CP-31398 affects mutant protein binding to DNA in a similar way bringing the Kd of the mutant p53 for DNA to a similar level as wild type. The variations in the effect are mainly due to the affinity of the individual mutants for the particular p53 DNA binding site. R273H, which maintains a nearly wild type conformation, has the ability to transactivate from a consensus p53 DNA binding site but has a much reduced ability to transactivate and bind other sites like bax that have a much lower affinity for p53 than the consensus sequence (7 to 9).
This non-competitive allosteric activation fits into the model suggested by Freidler et al. (20), where CP-31398, like CDB3 peptide, functions as a chaperone, enables p53 to fold into an active conformation that is capable of binding DNA. What occurs after DNA binding is a source of speculation. By Freidler's model (20), the compound should be displaced by the structural rearrangement that p53 undergoes once it binds DNA. Recent work by Freidler et al. (33) has shown that CDB3 binds to wild type and mutant (R249S and R273H) in the same manner, at a site that is away from the protein-DNA interface, and away from the site distorted by the R249S mutation. Thus, CDB3 exerting its effect via a long range conformational change and binding to a site that is different than the natural ligand, DNA, is an allosteric mechanism.
In addition, CP-31398 has been shown to inhibit MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53, possibly by blocking Mdm2 interaction with the core domain of p53 (23, 25). Because binding of Mdm2 to the N terminus of p53 causes a conformational rearrangement of p53 and allows for access to its core domain, CP-31398 may prevent such rearrangements. In addition, maintenance of wild type conformation may promote binding of the p53 core domain to BclXL (10).
The major difference between CP-31398, CDB3, and PRIMA1, is that PRIMA1 seems not to bind to p53 core domain. In our assay, PRIMA1 fails to stimulate DNA binding with just the DNA binding domain. Others have reported that PRIMA1 only works with full-length protein and fails to interact with the DNA binding domain (18, 21). A recent report (34) showed that PRIMA1 could induce apoptosis in the absence of new protein synthesis. This suggests that compounds that alter the active conformation of p53 and turn it into a more wild type protein may also exert their influence by making p53 capable of interacting with BclXL and BH3 domain-containing proteins to help mediate mitochondrial depolarization (10, 34, and 35). Given the nature of p53, it is likely that binding somewhere other than the DNA binding domain could exert effects on the DNA binding domain. It has been suggested that binding occurs just outside of the DNA binding domain or in the tetramerization domain (18). One possible effect is that it could promote and stabilize p53 tetramers in a conformation that is sufficient for the protein to function in DNA binding or in mitochondrial depolarization.
CP-31398 and CDB3 appear to be more specific for p53 than p63 and p73. Both p63 and p73 have homologous DNA binding domains as p53, but there are some amino acid differences between the proteins (29). A comparison between models of p53 DNA binding domain and p63 DNA binding domain indicates that p63 has a more thermostable hydrophobic core, making the protein significantly more stable than p53 (29). This is apparent from the fact that p63 and p73 protein can be expressed in soluble form at relatively high temperatures compared with p53 (29). Interestingly, there are second site suppressor mutations that can restore DNA-binding activity to some oncogenic mutants of p53 (36 to 38). Recently, a crystal structure of a quadruple mutant of p53 provides an explanation how loss of hydrogen bonds in V143A, a temperature-sensitive mutant, can be compensated by second site mutation N268D. The suppressor mutation N268D not only increases the overall stability of the oncogenic mutant but also induces local change to the protein initially caused by the loss of two methyl groups of V143A (38). This is a possible mechanism for compounds like CP-31398 and CDB3. Their interaction with the p53 core may provide energetically favorable compensatory hydrogen bonds and increase overall stability of many oncogenic mutants and, by doing so, restore wild type function. Given that the hydrophobic cores of p63 and p73 are stable, there may not be a site where the compounds can bind and act to give additional stability.
We have shown that CP-31398 can affect the DNA-binding activity of both wild type and mutant p53 in vivo and in vitro. We also have observed that DNA binding is restored to both DNA contact mutant (R273H) and structural mutant (R249S) by the compound, and the effect is more pronounced in a structural mutant (R249S). These effects seem to be specific to p53, because both CP-31398 and CDB3 do not affect the activity of p63 and p73. By developing a DNA binding assay with CP-31398 and mutant p53, we can potentially look for compounds that perform similar activities to CP-31398 and CDB3 but do not have the liabilities and side effects of these molecules.
