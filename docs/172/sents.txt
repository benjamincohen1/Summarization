0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Immortalized human fibroblasts were used to investigate the putative interactions of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone with the wild-type p53 tumor suppressor protein. We show that geldanamycin or radicicol, specific inhibitors of Hsp90, diminish specific wild-type p53 binding to the p21 promoter sequence. Consequently, these inhibitors decrease p21 mRNA levels, which lead to a reduction in cellular p21/Waf1 protein, known to induce cell cycle arrest. In control experiments, we show that neither geldanamycin nor radicicol affect p53 mRNA levels. A minor decrease in p53 protein level following the treatment of human fibroblasts with the inhibitors suggests the potential involvement of Hsp90 in the stabilization of wild-type p53. To support our in vivo findings, we used a reconstituted system with highly purified recombinant proteins to examine the effects of Hsp90 on wild-type p53 binding to the p21 promoter sequence. The human recombinant Hsp90 -isoform as well as bovine brain Hsp90 were purified to homogeneity. Both of these molecular chaperones displayed ATPase activity and the ability to refold heat-inactivated luciferase in a geldanamycin- and radicicol-sensitive manner, suggesting that post-translational modifications are not involved in the modulation of Hsp90 activity. We show that the incubation of recombinant p53 at 37  degrees C decreases the level of its wild-type conformation and strongly inhibits the in vitro binding of p53 to the p21 promoter sequence. Interestingly, Hsp90 in an ATP-dependent manner can positively modulate p53 DNA binding after incubation at physiological temperature of 37  degrees C. Other recombinant human chaperones from Hsp70 and Hsp40 families were not able to efficiently substitute Hsp90 in this reaction. Consistent with our in vivo results, geldanamycin can suppress Hsp90 ability to regulate in vitro p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence. In summary, the results presented in this article state that chaperone activity of Hsp90 is important for the transcriptional activity of genotypically wild-type p53..

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor, which regulates cellular response to stress, abnormal cell proliferation, and DNA damage (1, 2). More than 50% of human cancers possess the mutated p53 gene (3), and the inactivation of p53 function leads to cell transformation (4, 5). Most oncogenic p53 mutations are located in its DNA binding domain, inhibiting ability of this protein to initiate transcription (3). However, p53 may also be rendered inactive by other cellular events, such as the sequestration of wt-p531 in the cytoplasm, because of increased nuclear export (6) or the association of p53 to cytoplasmic proteins (7, 8). Recently it was shown that p53 is transported in HEK cells to the nucleus along microtubular tracks by cytoplasmic dynein and the Hsp90 molecular chaperone (9), which is similar to the mechanism described for rapid ligand-induced movement of the glucocorticoid receptor to the nucleus (10, 11). Processes that inhibit p53 nuclear transport and proteolysis also lead to the inactivation of p53 protein (12, 13)..

Additionally, Hsp90 regulates many signaling pathways. Hsp90 is found in a complex with several oncoproteins, including v-Src, c-Erb2, Raf-1, Akt, Bcr-Abl, and tumor suppressor p53 (18 to 22). The Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG) is currently in phase II of clinical trials as a potential anti-tumor drug. Hsp90 inhibitors usually induce ubiquitination and degradation of Hsp90 client proteins (23). In tumor cells, Hsp90 exists in a functionally distinct conformational form that is much more efficiently recognized by 17-AAG. This form of Hsp90, which possesses elevated ATPase activity, is found in a multichaperone complex with cochaperones: p23, Hop, and probably others (24)..

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	12	It has been known for years that genotypically mutant p53 co-immunoprecipitates with members of the Hsp70 and Hsp90 families (19). Such interactions lead to the formation of a p53 multichaperone complex that is responsible for the stabilization and sequestration of p53 in the cytoplasm (25 to 27). Binding of molecular chaperones to mutant p53 inhibits the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in the stabilization of both p53 and MDM2 (28, 29). It also has been shown that Hsp90 directly associates with the MDM2 protein (30). Hsp90 inhibitors can partially disrupt these interactions, which results in the degradation of mutant p53 (31, 32). With the use of highly purified proteins, we have identified intermediate reactions that lead to the assembly of molecular chaperone complex with p53 protein possessing wild-type or mutant sequence. The presence of Hsp90 in a complex with wt-p53 inhibits binding of Hsp40 and Hsc70 to p53. However, the conformational mutant of p53, which possesses low affinity toward Hsp90, can form a stable multichaperone complex in which Hsp90 is bound to mutant p53 indirectly (mut p53-Hsp40-Hsc70-Hop-Hsp90). Several independent methods, such as surface plasmon resonance, immunoprecipitation, ELISA, and cross-linking were used to demonstrate that Hsp90 directly, in the absence of any other co-chaperones, can associate with genotypically wt-p53 but not with mutant p53 protein (33). The accompanying article by Muller et al. (34) supports our findings. Moreover, it has been shown by NMR that Hsp90 associates with a truncated version of wt-p53. It was suggested that the p53 core domain bound to Hsp90 is predominantly unfolded and lacking helical or sheet secondary structure (35)..

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	14	Wild-type p53 is a structurally unstable protein, which undergoes conformational changes at elevated temperatures (36, 37). We have proposed that during heat shock, cytoplasmic p53 possessing the wild-type sequence could temporarily adopt a mutant conformation, subsequently initiating the formation of a multichaperone complex that could partially stabilize wt-p53 (19). Results from a recently published article by Wang and Chen (38) support our hypothesis. They found that heat shock inhibited p53 ubiquitination and initiated the accumulation of p53 at the post-translational level. Two factors influence these events during heat stress: 1) ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53 and 2) formation of the chaperone complex with genotypically wt-p53, which adopts a conformation characteristic to that of a mutant protein (38). The evidence for Hsp90 binding to mutant p53 is conclusive, whereas the exact nature of cellular interactions between Hsp90 and genotypically wt-p53 possessing either wild-type or mutant conformation still remains to be elucidated..

A, time course of total p53 (p53), p53 phosphorylated at Ser-15 (Ser15-P-p53) and p21/Waf1 protein (p21) induction was analyzed by Western blotting.

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	49	  Treatment of K15 cells with 2  microM camptothecin (CPT), a drug which induces DNA damage by inhibition of topoisomerase I, results in a p53 up-regulation as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). When the camptothecin treatment was performed in the presence of specific Hsp90 inhibitors, geldanamycin or radicicol (3  microM), p53 was induced to somewhat lower levels, and the time course of the induction was slower (Fig. 1A and results not shown). Importantly, the relative amount of p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 was not affected by the Hsp90 inhibitors (Fig. 1A). This suggests that Hsp90 might act on p53 directly, rather than through ATR, DNA-PK, or ATM kinases, which are known to phosphorylate p53 at this position (47, 48). To exclude the possibility that the lower p53 levels were caused by a decrease of its transcription, we quantified p53 mRNA by real-time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1B, treatment of cells with geldanamycin or radicicol did not significantly change the level of p53 transcripts, suggesting that those drugs down-regulate p53 at the protein level. By fluorescence microscopy and cellular fractionation we showed that geldanamycin or radicicol do not affect the nuclear localization of p53 (results not shown). These results indicate that Hsp90 might play a role in the stabilization of the wt-p53 protein..
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	50	To test whether Hsp90 indeed can influence the transcriptional activity of p53, we analyzed the binding of p53 to the p21 promoter by ChIP. As shown in Fig. 1C, the camptothecin-induced binding of p53 to the p21 promoter was almost completely disrupted by geldanamycin. The ChIP experiment for p21 promoter was also successfully performed using anti-Hsp90 antibodies, suggesting a functional interaction between wt-p53 and Hsp90.2 Further, we have shown by real-time RT-PCR that geldanamycin or radicicol strongly inhibit the expression of p21 mRNA following the camptothecin treatment (Fig. 1D). This decrease in the p21 level could also be observed by Western blot (Fig. 1A). Taken together, described results suggest that while to some extent Hsp90 stabilizes genotypically wt-p53 protein level, a stronger effect is visible on the transcriptional activity of the wt-p53. These phenomena evidently depend on ATP, since both drugs effectively compete with ATP for binding to Hsp90..

For these tests, we used the human recombinant Hsp90 isoform, and for control experiments, we also purified Hsp90 from bovine brain. Purified recombinant Hsp90 as well as bovine Hsp90 possess the ATPase activity, which is inhibited by geldanamycin (Fig. 2A) and radicicol (results not shown). To test the molecular chaperone activity of purified Hsp90 proteins, we used a modified version of a previously described luciferase refolding assay (45). When Hsp90 or bovine Hsp90 was present during heat denaturation of luciferase (5 min, 50  degrees C), the efficient refolding of luciferase was observed at reduced temperatures in the presence of Hsc70 and Hsp40 (Fig. 2B). This refolding reaction was dependent on the presence of Hsp90 during the denaturation process and was severely inhibited when geldanamycin was preincubated with Hsp90 or bovine prior to heat denaturation of luciferase (Fig. 2B)..

It is possible that elevated temperatures could shift this equilibrium toward a mutant conformation, hence the amount of p53 possessing the wild-type conformation should be decreased. Indeed, purified human recombinant wt-p53 protein loses its wild-type conformation upon incubation at 37  degrees C and higher temperatures (Fig. 3 and results not shown). The immunoprecipitation of the wt-p53 by pAb 1620, specifically recognizing the wt-p53 conformation, is significantly reduced following incubation of wt-p53 at 37  degrees C (Fig. 3A). The same effect was also observed using the modified ELISA test. In this case less p53 was detected by the conformation-specific pAb 1620 whereas comparable amount of the protein was detected by DO-1 at both temperatures (Fig. 3B). Consistent with these experiments, 1-h incubation at 37  degrees C completely abolished the DNA binding activity of the genotypically wt-p53, as tested by the gel-shift assay (Fig. 4A, lane 2). The presence of increasing amounts of Hsp90 during this incubation step at 37  degrees C significantly enhances the binding of p53 to the p21 promoter sequence (Fig. 4A).

B, ELISA wells were coated with anti-p53 antibodies pAb 1620 (50 ng, wild type-specific) or DO-1 (50 ng, pan-specific), and increasing amounts of p53 were added to the wells. Upon incubation at 37  degrees C for 1 h the amount of mutant conformation p53 rises (decrease in pAb 1620 antibody reactivity), which corresponds to the lower curve on the graph (open circles) in comparison with p53 kept at 4  degrees C (filled circles). This effect was not because of decreased antibody accessibility to p53 caused by aggregation, since DO-1 antibody binding did not significantly change after 37  degrees C incubation (open and filled squares). All presented values are means of four repeats. The OD is normalized appropriately to the maximum values for both antibodies..

Human recombinant Hsp90 restores the specific DNA binding activity of the human recombinant p53 after the 1-h inactivation at 37  degrees C in vitro. A, p53 was incubated for 1 h at 4  degrees C(lane 1) or 37  degrees C without or in the presence of the increasing amount of Hsp90 (H90, lanes 3 to 6). All reactions contained 5 mM ATP. The p53/Hsp90 mass ratio is indicated for lanes with the increasing amount of Hsp90. At 1/50 protein mass ratio 0.05  microg of p53 was used (0.22  microM monomer) and 2.5  microg of Hsp90 (5.6  microM monomer). B, p53 was incubated for 1 h at 4 or 37  degrees C, with or without Hsp90, as indicated. The effect of different amounts of ATP has been tested, as shown by bars and by millimolar amounts of ATP used. 5  microg of BSA was added instead of 2.5  microg of Hsp90 in lane 7. At 3 to 5 mM ATP the Hsp90-dependent p53 rescue increases dramatically (lanes 9 to 11). The experiments were performed as described under "Materials and Methods." All EMSA bands in this and the following figures (unless indicated otherwise) correspond to the size of p53 tetramer bound to the DNA, supershifted by the activating antibody Ab421..

Similarly, both Hsp90 and bovine Hsp90 enhanced p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence (Fig. 5A). We also determined whether GTP could substitute for ATP in that reaction in order to rule out the involvement of a second, recently proposed nucleotide binding site on Hsp90 (54). GTP was unable to substitute for ATP during Hsp90-dependent binding of p53 to the promoter sequence (Fig. 5B). In addition, geldanamycin, which blocks the N-terminal nucleotide-binding site of Hsp90, inhibits the Hsp90-dependent binding of p53 to the p21 promoter DNA (Fig. 6).

A, 1.25  microg of human Hsp90 was preincubated for 30 min with the indicated amount of GA (see "Materials and Methods") and used for p53 rescue from 37  degrees C inactivation in the presence of 5 mM ATP (lanes 3 to 8). In all other lanes reactions were carried out identically with 5 mM ATP but excluding Hsp90. Lane 9 is a control confirming lack of the negative effect of GA on p53 binding to the DNA in the absence of Hsp90. B, reactions as in A but bovine brain Hsp90 is used instead of Hsp90. In the case of this isoform less GA was required to fully inhibit Hsp90. For explanation of differences in overall intensity of bands between A and B see "Materials and Methods.".
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	63	  Similar to antibody-activated p53, the DNA binding of CKII-activated p53 was also positively regulated by Hsp90 (Fig. 7). In the control experiment (Fig. 7A, lane 2), we observed that CKII-treated p53 protein appeared to be more resistant to incubation at 37  degrees C as compared with p53 activated by the pAb421 antibody, which is in agreement with earlier suggestions (43). Surprisingly, the nonspecific binding of p53 to dsDNA, for which the unstructured C-terminal part of the protein is responsible (56), is also inhibited after incubation at 37  degrees C (Fig. 7B). However, unlike sequence-specific DNA binding, Hsp90 in presence of 5 mM ATP did not positively regulate the nonspecific DNA binding activity of the wt-p53 (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that the observed Hsp90-mediated enhancement of p53 DNA binding at 37  degrees C is restricted to the p53 core domain that is responsible for binding to specific, promoter-derived DNA molecules. These results fit the domain-specificity of Hsp90-p53 interaction, described in the accompanying article by Muller et al. (34)..

A, specific binding of p53 to the labeled p21 promoter DNA was activated by the antibody Ab421 (lanes 4 to 6; supershifted by the antibody) and CKII-dependent phosphorylation (lanes 1 to 3; not supershifted) and both could be inactivated by a 1-h incubation at 37  degrees C (lanes 2 and 5). Although difference between binding strength at 4  degrees C and 37  degrees C is smaller in the case of CKII than in Ab421 activation (phosphorylation may protect against heat inactivation, see text for reference), Hsp90 rescues p53-specific binding in both cases (lanes 3 and 6). 5 mM ATP was present in all reactions, and in the case of CKII activation an ATP-regeneration system was used to maintain the ATP concentration. B, a 32P-labeled nonspecific DNA sequence, and no nonspecific competitor, was used instead of the specific p21 promoter-derived DNA (see "Materials and Methods"). p53 binding to the nonspecific DNA was also inactivated by 37  degrees C (2), but it cannot be restored by Hsp90 (3). All reactions contained 5 mM ATP. Protein amounts and ratios for A and B are as in Fig. 5A..
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	65	  The Mode of p53-Hsp90 Interaction Suggests Dynamic Mechanism for Positive Regulation of wt-p53 by Hsp90  The ability of Hsp90 to restore p53 binding to the promoter sequence at 37  degrees C cannot be explained by a simple, passive protection of the wild-type conformation of p53 at elevated temperatures, analogous to that described for RNA polymerase protection by DnaK (57, 58). In the mentioned case, the presence of ATP diminishes to a great extent the DnaK-dependent protection of RNA polymerase at elevated temperatures. However, as shown in Fig. 8, the same concentration of ATP that is required for Hsp90-mediated binding of p53 to the promoter sequence (Fig. 4B) also shifts the equilibrium of p53-Hsp90 complex formation toward its dissociation. The weaker effect of AMP-PNP, the ATP analog, indicates that at least nucleotide hydrolysis and probably its exchange is important for this reaction (Fig. 8). Consequently, 5 mM AMP-PNP could not substitute for ATP in the Hsp90-dependent enhanced DNA-binding of p53 in the EMSA assay (results not shown). Hsp90 also did not cause p53 supershifts in the EMSA assay when Hsp90 was present in reactions (Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7), which may suggest a transient nature of the protein-protein interaction. Taken together, these results indicate that the dynamic repeated binding and dissociation of the Hsp90 to p53 is responsible for the positive regulation of p53 DNA binding activity at physiological temperatures of 37  degrees C..

A wt-p53 conformation, recognized by pAb 1620, is essential for this activity. Incubation of the p53 protein encoded by the non-mutated sequence, at 37  degrees C decreases the amount of p53 protein found in an immunocomplex with pAb 1620 as well as the p53 DNA binding. In fact, incubation of wt-p53 for 1 h at 37  degrees C completely abolished p53 binding to the p21 promoter-derived sequence. Interestingly, the presence of increasing amounts of Hsp90 during the incubation of p53 at 37  degrees C can positively regulate p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence, whereas other human recombinant chaperone proteins from Hsp70 and Hsp40 families were not able to substitute for Hsp90 activity. This activity is ATP-dependent and can be inhibited by geldanamycin. These effects correlate with our in vivo results, where geldanamycin inhibited p53 binding to the chromatin as well as transcription from the p21 promoter. In order to examine the possibility that transient Hsp90 interactions are required for positive regulation of p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence at 37  degrees C, we monitored the direct binding of Hsp90 to p53 in the presence or absence of ATP. Similar to Hsp70-substrate complex formation (61, 62), the presence of ATP shifted the binding/dissociation equilibrium toward dissociation. These results suggest that the influence of Hsp90 on p53 DNA binding cannot be explained by the passive protection of wt-p53 conformation, caused by static association with Hsp90. We showed that the presence of ATP, which induces dissociation of Hsp90 from p53, also promotes the ability of p53 to bind to the DNA promoter sequence at 37  degrees C..

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	76	There are at least two possibilities of explaining the mechanism for Hsp90 positive regulation of p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence at 37  degrees C. First, Hsp90 inhibits p53 aggregation or catalyzes the disaggregation of p53 protein at elevated temperatures. Such a mechanism was previously discovered for chaperones belonging to prokaryotic (57, 58) and eukaryotic (63) Hsp70 families; and now is shown for Hsp90 in presence of p53 by Muller et al. (34). Second, the Hsp90 association with wt-p53 could induce the partial unfolding of p53. Following the dissociation of this Hsp90-p53 complex in the presence of ATP, p53 could spontaneously refold back into a wild-type conformation with a high affinity for the p21 promoter sequence. A similar mechanism of molecular chaperone action was proposed in the case of Hsp100 involved in protein folding and proteolysis (64). The unfoldase activity of Hsp100 molecular chaperone was eventually demonstrated by a subsequent study (65). Recent data from the Ted Hupp laboratory (30) suggest that Hsp90 in the presence of MDM2 could indeed partially unfold p53. We propose that partial unfolding of p53 could be catalyzed by Hsp90, and the subsequent spontaneous refolding of p53 back into a wild-type-like conformation may prevent p53 aggregation thus increasing p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence (see Fig. 9). More importantly, these chaperone-mediated actions would decrease the probability for the formation of kinetically trapped, mutant-like intermediates and that would allow a shift in the conformational equilibrium toward the active, wt-p53 conformation. These events would ultimately promote the p53 transcriptional activity and allow for the ubiquitination and degradation of p53 protein. In addition, the retention of p53 in a wild-type conformation by transient Hsp90 interaction would also inhibit the formation of a multichaperone-p53 complex, which prevents p53 degradation and import to the nucleus (Fig. 9)..

0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The extracellular matrix regulates many cellular processes, including survival, and alterations in the matrix or in matrix survival signals can trigger apoptosis. Previously, we showed that an altered fibronectin matrix triggers apoptosis in primary cells via a novel pathway regulated by transcriptionally mediated decreases in p53 and c-Myc levels. Here we report that this apoptotic mechanism is propagated by decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is linked to increased phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and to decreased levels of p53. FAK is physically and spatially linked to JNK and p53, which relocalize from the nucleus to the cell membrane to mediate this interaction. Further, p53 participates in a feedback mechanism with JNK to regulate this apoptotic process and is oppositely regulated by JNK1 and JNK2..

Under these conditions, an altered matrix can result from proteolytic cleavage or alternative splicing of matrix molecules. In inflammation, proteolysis of extracellular matrix molecules leads to the formation of fragments, such as fibronectin (FN)1 fragments, that elicit cellular responses different from those elicited by the intact molecule (1 to 5). For example, disease-associated fragments of FN trigger p53-mediated apoptosis of primary cells, but the intact molecule does not (6 to 8). Similarly, alternatively spliced variants of FN elicit different cell responses, and specific domains of FN regulate cell survival (4, 5)..

To further decipher this apoptotic pathway, we explored the possible connections between integrin/FAK-mediated signals and the down-regulation of p53. We hypothesized that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) might be at the crossroads of this signaling pathway, since FAK and associated focal adhesion proteins (Rac1/Pak1/MKK4/JNK) have been linked to p53 status in the apoptosis of primary cells (9, 10). In addition, JNK can phosphorylate (11) and form a complex with p53 to stabilize it (12 to 16), thereby influencing its activity directly..

Its activation, triggered by increased phosphorylation of Tyr397 and other sites, has been implicated in many cellular processes, including cell survival. The N-terminal domain of FAK directs interactions with integrins and growth factor receptors. FAK also has a central catalytic domain, which contains Tyr397, a major autophosphorylation site and a site of interaction with the Src homology 2 domain. Its C-terminal noncatalytic domain, also known as FAK-related non-kinase (FRNK), contains sites for multiple protein-protein interactions and a focal adhesion targeting (FAT) region. Both FRNK and FAT act in a dominant-negative fashion to inhibit cell spreading and migration and growth factor-mediated signals to mitogen-activated protein kinase (17)..

JNK proteins are encoded by three genes, JNK1 (46 kDa), JNK2 (54 kDa), and JNK3 (54 kDa), each of which undergoes alternative splicing to express various isoforms. JNK is activated by phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (18). Activated JNK1 can modify p53 posttranslationally by phosphorylation.

Actin served as a loading control. B, after immunoprecipitation (IP) of the samples shown in A with an antibody against pJNK, Western blotting with primary antibodies against p53 and pFAK (Tyr397) pulled down p53 and pFAK, respectively, consistent with complex formation between pJNK and p53 and between pJNK and pFAK.

FAK dephosphorylation leads to an increase in JNK1 phosphorylation and a likely suppression (dashed arrow) in JNK2. JNK1 triggers a decrease in p53 protein levels (negative regulator), and p53 can feed back on JNK1 to negatively regulate JNK1 phosphorylation (double-ended arrow). JNK2 positively regulates p53.

In this study, we demonstrate that this signaling mechanism is propagated by decreases in FAK phosphorylation, likely mediated by Tyr397, which are linked to increases in JNK phosphorylation and decreases in p53 protein levels. Furthermore, JNK1 and JNK2 had opposite effects in regulating p53, which appeared to participate in a feedback mechanism with JNK to facilitate this apoptotic process (Fig. 9)..
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	59	Several studies have shown that JNK interacts with (13, 14) and can phosphorylate p53 (11). In fact, p53 and JNK can form a complex, and JNK is a regulator of p53 stability (13 to 16). In one study, sustained activation of JNK1 down-regulated p53 expression during apoptosis (16), similar to our findings. However, we found that JNK1 and JNK2 are opposite regulators of p53. Surprisingly, treatment with antisense JNK2 suppressed p53 levels in controls and under altered FN matrix conditions. JNK1 antisense treatment, however, increased p53 levels. P53 expression was also suppressed in jnk2-deficient cells. These data indicate that JNK2 expression is tightly linked to that of p53 and that JNK1 and JNK2 regulate p53 by different mechanisms. Furthermore, increases in JNK1 expression (or pJNK1) decreased p53 protein levels, and decreases in JNK1 expression (or pJNK1) increased p53 levels. Conversely, increases in JNK2 expression (or pJNK2) may increase p53 levels, and decreases in JNK2 expression (or pJNK2) profoundly decreased p53 levels. Thus JNK1 is a negative regulator and JNK2 is a positive regulator of p53 expression..

For several reasons, however, we are confident that treatment with an altered FN matrix increased JNK1 phosphorylation only and not that of JNK2 or JNK3. First, transfection with a JNK1 construct (Fig. 3A) and a dominant-negative JNK1 construct (Fig. 3B) both showed an increase in the two bands visible in the pJNK Western blots under control conditions, indicating that both bands are JNK1 isoforms. Second, treatment with a JNK1 antisense oligonucleotide decreased both bands, indicating that they are both JNK1 isoforms (Fig. 4A). Third, transfection with a JNK2 construct induced a new higher molecular mass band at 54 kDa for pJNK that was not seen before with any other treatments and likely represents the phosphorylated form of JNK2 (Fig. 5). Fourth, Western analysis of jnk2-deficient cells showed two bands that likely represent two isoforms of JNK1. These bands were not seen in Western blots of cells deficient in JNK1 and JNK2..

At sites of inflammation, the extracellular matrix is degraded by proteolytic enzymes in the inflammatory milieu. Degraded matrix conveys messages that are different from those normally conveyed by an intact or stable matrix, and the degradation increases with the severity of the disease. In periodontal disease and arthritis, FN fragments are most abundant in the most diseased sites (6, 25 to 30). Previously, we found that a proteolytic 40-kDa fragment of FN associated with the most advanced disease also induced apoptosis of periodontal ligament fibroblasts in vitro by down-regulating p53 and c-Myc (6, 7). This 40-kDa fragment, which is comparable with the recombinant FN fragment we tested here, induced apoptosis of fibroblasts via a novel alternative pathway that involves decreases in FAK phosphorylation and down-regulation of p53 and c-Myc. This pathway appears to be triggered by cooperative interactions between integrins and a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (4, 5). From the present findings we can further add that this inflammation-associated apoptotic pathway also involves interactions between pFAK and JNK1 and -2 and their phosphorylated isoforms, which oppositely regulate p53 expression levels..

0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is a serine protease that catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. The plasminogen/plasmin system includes the uPA, its receptor, and its inhibitor (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1). Interactions between these molecules regulate cellular proteolysis as well as adhesion, cellular proliferation, and migration, processes germane to the pathogenesis of lung injury and neoplasia. In previous studies, we found that uPA regulates cell surface fibrinolysis by regulating its own expression as well as that of the uPA receptor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. In this study, we found that uPA alters expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in Beas2B airway epithelial cells in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner. These effects do not require uPA catalytic activity because the amino-terminal fragment of uPA lacking catalytic activity was as potent as two chain active uPA. Single chain uPA also enhanced p53 expression to the same extent as intact two chain active uPA and the amino-terminal fragment. Pretreatment of cells with anti-1 integrin antibody blocked uPA-induced p53 expression. uPA-induced p53 expression occurs without increased p53 mRNA expression. However, uPA induced oncoprotein MDM2 in a concentration-dependent manner. uPA-induced p53 expression does not require activation of tyrosine kinases. Inactivation of protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 inhibits both basal and uPA-induced p53 expression. Plasmin did not alter uPA-mediated p53 expression. The induction of p53 expression by exposure of lung epithelial cells to uPA is a newly recognized pathway by which urokinase may influence the proliferation of lung epithelial cells. This pathway could regulate pathophysiologic alterations of p53 expression in the setting of lung inflammation or neoplasia..

For example, high levels of uPA as well as PAI-1 and uPAR in lung tumor tissue correlate with poor prognosis (6, 7). In addition, increasingly compelling evidence for the involvement of the uPA system in cell proliferation, migration, tumor invasion, and metastasis (8-17) has positioned plasminogen activation as central to the propagation of neoplasms (5). In certain tumors, neoplastic growth can be effectively attenuated by PAI-1, presumably through its interaction with uPA (18)..

Elaboration of these molecules influences two major features associated with lung neoplasia, including excessive proliferation of neoplastic cells and their capacity to invade normal tissues. It is now clear that the pathogenesis of lung neoplasia prominently involves expression of tumor suppressor protein p53 (22-24) as well as extracellular matrix degradation by uPA-mediated plasminogen activation (6, 7, 24). Among the plethora of potentially useful markers of tumor virulence that have been identified to date, both uPA and p53 appear to be promising (24, 25). The prognostic value of uPA and p53 accumulation has been reported in primary breast cancer patients (8-16), supporting their role in tumor progression and overall survival. However, no direct relationship between tumor suppression and extracellular matrix degradation has been established to date..

Expression of growth factor activity has been attributed to uPA stimulation and suggests activation of such signaling processes (8-16). uPA bound to its receptor activates intracellular signaling through protein intermediates that are currently not well understood. Overexpression of either uPA, uPAR, or PAI-1 by tumor cells (19, 25-28) as well as potent growth factor activity of uPA in epithelial cells prompted us to test the possibility that uPA might regulate p53 expression in lung epithelial cells, a possibility that has not been explored previously, to our knowledge. We now report a new paradigm by which p53 expression by lung epithelial cells is regulated by uPA. We also characterize the responsible mechanism. This pathway could influence alveolar p53 expression and thereby modulate uPA-mediated responses of lung epithelial cells in lung injury or neoplasia..

At concentrations of 50 ng/ml, uPA induced MDM2 expression around 3 h followed by a sharp decline to basal level around 24 h (Fig. 4c), whereas at higher uPA concentrations, MDM2 expression was induced, and this elevated level was maintained up to 24 h (Fig. 4d). We next treated Beas2B cells with varying amounts of uPA and found that uPA induces MDM2 expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4e)..

As shown in Fig. 5a, herbimycin A and genistein alone did not induce p53 expression nor did either inhibitor reverse uPA-mediated p53 expression by Beas2B cells. However, pretreatment of cells with sodium orthovanadate (a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor) reversed uPA-mediated p53 expression. In order to determine the protein-tyrosine phosphatase involved in uPA-mediated p53 expression, we infected adenovirus overexpressing catalytically inactive mutants of SHP-1, SHP-2, as well as vector cDNA. As shown in Fig. 5b, both basal and uPA-induced p53 expression was inhibited in the Beas2B cells infected with dominant negative SHP-2 mutants. In order to confirm further the involvement of SHP-2 in p53 expression, we generated stable Beas2B cells overexpressing SHP-2 and determined the p53 expression by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 5c, SHP-2 overexpression induced p53 expression, indicating that protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 regulates p53 expression..

As shown in Fig. 6c, a uPAR antibody that blocks uPA-uPAR interaction alone or pretreatment with uPAR antibody followed by stimulation with uPA inhibited p53 expression. To confirm that uPA-mediated p53 expression involves uPAR, we next treated Beas2B cells with A5 compound (a uPAR antagonist) alone or in combination with uPA. As shown in Fig. 6c, A5 alone did not induce p53. However, A5 in combination with uPA inhibited uPA-mediated p53 expression. In a third approach, we removed uPAR from the cell surface by treating with phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and then tested to see if uPA would stimulate p53 expression. It is known that uPAR is a GPI-linked protein and that PI-PLC removes GPI-linked proteins, including uPAR, from the cell surface (19). PI-PLC treatment inhibited uPA-mediated p53 expression. These data confirm the involvement of uPAR in uPA-mediated p53 expression. In a separate experiment we found that PI-PLC completely cleaved uPAR from the cell surface (data not shown). These experiments provide further evidence that the uPA-mediated induction of p53 is mediated by the association of uPA with uPAR at the cell surface..

The interaction between uPA and uPAR at the cancer cell surface also appears to be a critical event in the pathogenesis of neoplastic growth and metastasis, mediating tissue remodeling and desmoplasia, tumor cell invasion, adhesion, and proliferation of neoplastic cells (1, 5, 10). Binding of uPA to uPAR mediates cell proliferation in several cell types, including nonmalignant lung epithelial cells, lung carcinoma-derived cells, and malignant mesothelioma (12, 39). Tumor cell invasion is often facilitated by a dramatic increase in the production of the plasminogen activators, particularly uPA (39-43).

Activation of p53 following genotoxic damage is achieved by induction of p53 levels and by modifications of the p53 protein such as phosphorylation and acetylation (43-47). DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, UV radiation, alkylating agents, and environmental carcinogens induces p53 through alteration of p53 protein stability (48-54). However, uPA is a serine protease involved in extracellular matrix degradation to which no DNA damage or repair function has been attributed. Altered p53 protein expression because of translation rather than transcription or mutation in the p53 gene has been observed in blast cells obtained from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (55). In the present study we have observed that uPA induces phosphorylation of the Ser-15 residue of p53 in a concentration-dependent manner consistent with the uPA-mediated induction of p53. Activation of p53 can lead either to cell arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis. At low concentrations of uPA, Beas2B cells undergo apoptosis as a consequence of increased p53 accumulation. This is accomplished by two independent mechanisms. First, uPA induces Ser-15 phosphorylation at a concentration of 50 ng/ml, which impairs p53 interaction with MDM2 and its degradation. Second, at a low concentration uPA also fails to maintain elevated levels of MDM2 protein required for p53 turnover.

Based upon our previous observations, the induction of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 by uPA in lung epithelial cells could likewise contribute to altered p53 expression, possibly by influencing the kinetics of internalization of trimeric complexes of uPA, PAI-1, and uPAR. The precise regulatory levels by which uPA induces p53 expression by lung epithelial cells remain to be elucidated in studies that extend this report..
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	79	We found that the induction of p53 by uPA in Beas2B cells requires receptor interaction and that the LMW fragment could not reproduce the effect. Engagement of 1 integrin with specific antibody inhibited uPA-induced p53 expression, indicating the intricate connections between expression of p53 and uPA-uPAR integrin-mediated adhesion. There are precedents for this mode of uPA-mediated induction of cellular responses. uPA is mitogenic for several different cell types. The mitogenic response likewise requires receptor interaction with uPA in pleural mesothelioma as well as epidermal tumor cell lines (8-15). The inhibitory effect of a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor on p53 expression indicates that the process involves cellular signaling mainly through activation of tyrosine phosphatases. Alternatively, uPA stimulation of Beas2B cells may also induce synthesis of growth factors or cytokines that in turn may induce p53 protein. The elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for the prolonged effect of uPA on the p53 protein level remains to be determined. Phosphorylation of serines 15 and 20 following genotoxic stress (25, 43-56) has been demonstrated to impair interaction between p53 and MDM2, resulting in enhanced p53 accumulation (45). In contrast to DNA damage, differential expression of p53 predicated on uPA concentration can act as a selective pressure during tumor growth for the elimination of cells with wild-type p53 and clonal expansion of cells with diminished p53 expression. Induction of p53 by uPA in Beas2B cells clearly is not mediated via generation of plasmin because exposure of cells to treatment with plasmin did not affect p53 expression..

If operative in vivo, this pathway could contribute to the relative local overexpression of uPA and the neoplastic transformation associated with lung cancer. To our knowledge, this newly identified pathway is the first description of the ability of uPA to regulate the expression of p53 in any cell type..

Given that blockade of v-integrins during angiogenesis induces p53 activity, we utilized p53 null mice to elucidate whether loss of p53 can compensate for v-integrin function in neovascularization of the retina. Murine retinal vascularization was inhibited by systemic administration of an v-integrin antagonist. In contrast, mice lacking p53 were refractory to this treatment, indicating that neovascularization in normal mice depends on v-integrin-mediated suppression of p53. Blockade of v-integrins during neovascularization resulted in an induction of p21CIP1 in wild type and, surprisingly, in p53 null retinas, indicating that v-integrin ligation regulates p21CIP1 levels in a p53-independent manner. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time an in vivo intracellular mechanism for compensation of integrin function and that p53 and v-integrins act in concert during retinal neovascularization.

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	6	We previously found that integrin v3 is preferentially expressed on newly forming blood vessels and is functionally involved in controlling angiogenesis stimulated by basic fibroblast growth factor or tumor necrosis factor-, whereas another v-integrin, v5, is functional in vessel formation induced by vascular endothelial growth factor or transforming growth factor- (1, 2). Importantly, antagonists of v-integrins block neovascularization in various animal models with or without exogenous angiogenic stimulation, including chick chorioallantois, in mouse retina, and in human skin trans- plants in SCID mice, causing apoptosis of proliferating, angiogenic vascular cells (3-8). This suggests that during vessel formation, v-integrins promote signaling events ultimately promoting vascular cell survival, thereby facilitating neovascularization. However, whereas 80% of v-integrin null mice die in mid-gestation, 20% of these mice survive until 1 day after birth (9). Similarly, combinatorial gene knockout of integrin 3 and 5 subunits in mice results in enhanced angiogenesis under certain conditions (10). This indicates either that mice lacking integrins v3 and v5 could compensate for the function of v-integrins in blood vessel formation or that a function of vascular v-integrins, once expressed but blocked or unligated, is to inhibit neovascularization. However, at present it is not known whether possible compensatory or redundant mechanisms can mediate blood vessel formation in the absence of functional v-integrins.

Littermates from such matings were used in the neovascularization assay, and genomic DNA from mouse tails was genotyped for p53 by a 3-primer assay as described previously (12). Newborn mice were injected subcutaneously twice daily, starting within 8 h after birth with 40  microg of cyclo-RGDfV (v antagonist peptide 66203) or cyclo-RADfV (control peptide 69601) (lowercase denotes D-amino acids) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The cyclo-RGDfV peptide binds specifically with high affinity to v3- and v5-integrins and blocks their function both in vitro and in vivo, whereas the cyclo-RADfV peptide is non-functional (3, 7, 8, 13). After 2-3 days, the eye globes were taken out, fixed in cold methanol for 10 min followed by 6 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, dissected, stained for collagen type IV, and photographed as previously described (7). The distance from the head of the optic nerve to the edge of the retinal vasculature at 6-8 different representative points was measured for each retina on the photographs, and the mean vascular radius was calculated. The mean vascular area between the two retinas in each animal was then calculated, assuming a circular shape of the vasculature. Without treatment, no difference in vascular areas was observed between p53 heterozygous and p53 null mice, and therefore, to standardize and compare the results from different litters, the mean retinal vascular area in p53 null mice in each litter was considered to represent a fully developed vasculature. All p53 genotyping and measurements of the retinal vasculature were performed in a double-blind fashion to avoid any bias. For measurements of wild type retinas, the mean vascular area of control treated retinas was considered as fully developed and compared with anti-v-treated retinas within the same litters. For Western blot analysis, retinas were fixed only in cold methanol and dissected. Retinas were then lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer and analyzed by Western blot as previously described (5) using 1  microg/ml anti-p21CIP1WAF-1/CIP-1 polyclonal antibodies (ab-5, Oncogene, Cambridge, MA), anti-v cytoplasmic tail polyclonal antibodies (Chemicon), or anti-actin monoclonal antibody JLA20 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa).

The cyclo-RGDfV peptide binds specifically with high affinity to v3- and v5-integrins and blocks their function both in vitro and in vivo, whereas the cyclo-RADfV peptide is non-functional (3, 7, 8, 13). After 2-3 days, the eye globes were taken out, fixed in cold methanol for 10 min followed by 6 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, dissected, stained for collagen type IV, and photographed as previously described (7). The distance from the head of the optic nerve to the edge of the retinal vasculature at 6-8 different representative points was measured for each retina on the photographs, and the mean vascular radius was calculated. The mean vascular area between the two retinas in each animal was then calculated, assuming a circular shape of the vasculature. Without treatment, no difference in vascular areas was observed between p53 heterozygous and p53 null mice, and therefore, to standardize and compare the results from different litters, the mean retinal vascular area in p53 null mice in each litter was considered to represent a fully developed vasculature. All p53 genotyping and measurements of the retinal vasculature were performed in a double-blind fashion to avoid any bias. For measurements of wild type retinas, the mean vascular area of control treated retinas was considered as fully developed and compared with anti-v-treated retinas within the same litters. For Western blot analysis, retinas were fixed only in cold methanol and dissected. Retinas were then lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer and analyzed by Western blot as previously described (5) using 1  microg/ml anti-p21CIP1WAF-1/CIP-1 polyclonal antibodies (ab-5, Oncogene, Cambridge, MA), anti-v cytoplasmic tail polyclonal antibodies (Chemicon), or anti-actin monoclonal antibody JLA20 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa).

Based on this, we hypothesized that loss of p53 might compensate for v-integrin function during neovascularization. To examine this possibility, we analyzed p53 null mice, where the effect of a specific v-integrin antagonist was studied on retinal neovascularization. Mouse retinal neovascularization occurs during the first days after birth, and therefore, newborn mice were treated with an v-integrin antagonist as described (7). The retinal vasculature in wild type newborn mice treated for 3 days with the v-antagonist was significantly less developed than retinas from control treated mice (Table I). When accounting for the retinal vascular area already existing when the treatment started, the inhibition was close to 100%, in accordance with our previous observations after 4 days of treatment (7). Targeted p53 null males were then mated with p53 heterozygous females. This type of mating was not only necessary for sufficient embryonic survival but also allowed for a comparison of p53 null mice with heterozygous mice within the same litter in a double-blind fashion, including animals of exactly the same age receiving identical treatment. No difference in retinal vascularization could be observed between p53 null and heterozygous mice during the first 3 days (data not shown). In addition, no difference in degree of neovascularization between p53 null and heterozygous mice could be observed after control treatment (Fig. 1B and Table I). This indicates that p53 does not influence normal vascularization of the retina. We then treated entire litters of newborn mice of a mixed genotype (see above) with the v-integrin antagonist. Interestingly, p53 heterozygous animals had a markedly less developed retinal vasculature compared with p53 null mice when treated with the v-antagonist (Fig. 1 and Table I). Statistical analysis of measurements performed on the vascular area of these retinas revealed that the vascular development in anti-v-treated p53 heterozygous was suppressed, a suppression that was found to be statistically significant (p = 5.7  x  107) when compared with p53 null animals in the same litters receiving identical treatment (Table I). This result closely resembled the difference seen between retinas from antagonist versus control treated wild type mice (Table I). Taken together, these findings indicate that although p53 expression does not influence normal neovascularization, loss of p53 compensates for the function of v-integrins in neovascularization..

To test this possibility, retinal lysates were analyzed for v protein levels by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, v-integrin levels in p53 null retinas do not differ from that in p53 heterozygous mice. Another possibility for a lack of response to the v antagonist in p53 null mice could be that cells lacking p53 are insensitive to this treatment because of alterations in v-integrin function at the cell surface. To examine this possibility, we examined v-integrin function of mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p53, including their responsiveness to the v-integrin antagonist and compared them to mouse fibroblasts expressing p53. As shown in Fig. 2B, the responsiveness to the antagonist in inhibiting v-dependent attachment to vitronectin was virtually identical in p53 null fibroblasts and the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3, demonstrating that lack of p53 does not cause a general insensitivity to v-integrin antagonists. These findings reveal that loss of p53 does not affect expression levels or general function of v-integrins. Instead, we conclude that intracellular events involving p53 mediate the inhibition of neovascularization by v antagonists, events that may be related to the activation of endothelial cell p53 that we previously observed upon v-integrin blockage during angiogenesis (5)..

In fact, in addition to regulating p53, ligation of integrin v3 in endothelial cells also suppresses p21CIP1 protein levels during angiogenesis (5). In UV-irradiated fibroblasts, p53 exerts its functional effect on cell cycle arrest by transcriptional activation of the Cdk inhibitor p21CIP1 (14). As shown in Fig. 2C, blockade of v-integrin during neovascularization induces p21CIP1 levels in wild type and in p53 heterozygous retinas. Surprisingly, whereas untreated p53 null mice display no detectable p21CIP1, the numeric increase in p21CIP1 levels by anti-v treatment of these mice is similar to what is observed in wild type mice, resulting in a higher relative increase. This indicates that the regulation of p21CIP1 by integrin v during neovascularization is independent of p53. Furthermore, the fact that p21CIP1 is induced in p53 null retinas upon blockade of v-integrins while neovascularization is still active suggests that this induction of p21CIP1 is not sufficient to block neovascularization, although we cannot exclude that the somewhat higher total levels of p21CIP1 in heterozygous animals might contribute to this blockade.

This is particularly surprising for molecules found to play a role in certain in vivo events by previous loss of function studies, including for integrin v and the capacity for at least 20% of v-integrin null mice to form blood vessels (9) and for the capacity of integrin 3 and 5 subunit combinatorial gene knockouts to support enhanced pathological angiogenesis (10). In some cases, combinatorial knockout of two or three related genes has demonstrated compensatory mechanisms by displaying phenotypes missing in single gene knockout mice. However, it is unclear as to how the functions of v-integrins can be compensated for. To this end, although it does not represent the only possible mechanism of v-integrin compensation, our finding that p53 null mice form blood vessels in the absence of functional v-integrins that are critical in wild type mice reveals the first in vivo example of an intracellular mechanism that is able to compensate for loss of integrin function..

Such a function of v-integrins would then lead to enhanced angiogenesis when v3 is lacking as suggested by Reynolds et al. (10). In support of this model, caspase-8 was activated at the cell surface in other cell types by unligated integrin v3, thereby causing apoptosis (15). This mechanism might be related to p53, because caspase-8 plays a role in certain p53-induced apoptosis (16).

In fact, we previously observed that v-integrin antagonists could block the growth of human tumors in animal models (3, 4). In addition, uncontrolled ocular neovascularization is a major cause of blindness in various ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, and age-related macular degeneration. Integrins v3 and v5 may be involved in the regulation of neovascularization of these diseases as systemic treatment with v-integrin antagonists block retinal neovascularization (7, 8). This suggests that v-integrin antagonists constitute a potential therapy for ocular diseases and cancer. Our findings indicate that the molecular mechanism for this potential anti-angiogenic treatment actively involves p53, similar to what was recently indicated for angiostatin and TNP-470 (18-20)..

However, previous studies in other models clearly demonstrate that blocking of v-integrins during neovascularization leads to vascular cell apoptosis (3, 5). This suggests that the inhibition of vessel formation by v antagonists may be caused by induction of apoptosis of the forming vascular cells, and the fact that vascular formation in p53 null mice is refractory to v antagonist treatment suggests that these vessels do not undergo apoptosis (Fig. 3). Whereas p53 may mediate v-integrin-regulated apoptosis in vascular cells, induction of p53 by loss of integrin ligation does not constitute a generic mechanism for regulation of cell survival in all cells and by all integrins. For example, ligation of integrin 31 in an in vitro model of mammary epithelial cells lead to apoptosis only in the absence of functional p53 (21), a mechanism that appears to be the opposite of our findings on vascular cell integrin v3 and p53 during neovascularization. In future studies, it will be interesting to elucidate whether downstream integrin signaling pathways such as activation of ERKs1 might be involved in the regulation of p53, because ERK1/2 signaling was identified as another critical v-integrin-mediated event during angiogenesis (22). In addition, it remains to be elucidated whether the p53-mediated response to v antagonist treatment in vascular cells is functionally related to activation of caspase-8 by unligated v3 (15)..

In neovascularization of wild type animals (left), v3-and/or v5-integrins are activated (1, 2). The v-integrins are then allowed to ligate to their provisional matrix, a ligation that is necessary to keep endothelial cell p53 inactive and cells surviving (vascularization is facilitated (3, 5)). When v-integrins are blocked in wild type animals (middle) and thereby prevented from forming clusters, endothelial cell p53 activity is induced, and the vascular cells undergo apoptosis leading to a block of blood vessel formation (5). However, when p53 is absent during vascularization, inhibition of v-integrins does not affect the formation of viable vessels (right). Taken together, this suggests that p53 and v-integrins are linked into the same pathway in the control of blood vessel formation.

0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase in melanoma tumor cells was recently shown to correlate strongly with poor patient survival after combination biochemotherapy (p  <  0.001). Furthermore, evidence suggests that nitric oxide, a reaction product of nitricoxide synthase, exhibits antiapoptotic activity in melanoma cells. We therefore hypothesized that nitric oxide antagonizes chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Whether nitric oxide is capable of regulating cell growth and apoptotic responses to cisplatin treatment in melanoma cell lines was evaluated. We demonstrate herein that depletion of endogenously produced nitric oxide can inhibit melanoma proliferation and promote apoptosis. Moreover, our data indicate that the depletion of nitric oxide leads to changes in cell cycle regulation and enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. Strikingly, we observed that the depletion of nitric oxide inhibits cisplatin-induced wild type p53 accumulation and p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 expression in melanoma cells. When cisplatin-induced p53 binding to the p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 promoter was examined, it was found that nitric oxide depletion significantly reduced the presence of p53-DNA complexes after cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, dominant negative inhibition of p53 activity enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Together, these data strongly suggest that endogenously produced nitric oxide is required for cisplatin-induced p53 activation and p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 expression, which can regulate melanoma sensitivity to cisplatin..

The prognosis for patients with disseminated disease is invariably very poor. Melanoma is highly resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and therapies for melanoma have generally been ineffective at best and rarely result in sustained responses. Resistance of cancer to therapy is attributable in part to mechanisms such as altered drug uptake or transport, intracellular detoxification, altered DNA repair, and the dysregulation of the apoptotic pathway (1)..

0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	6	The tumor suppressor p53 is a sensor of diverse cellular stresses including DNA damage, oxidative stress, and hypoxia, and helps to direct cell cycle arrest and apoptosis at least in part through transcriptional activation of target genes like p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 (p21),1 GADD45, 14-3-3, and bax (2). Not surprisingly, p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in a broad spectrum of cancers, and its inactivation is frequently associated with tumor progression, resistance to therapy, and poor prognosis. However, the p53 gene is rarely mutated in melanoma (3), and increased expression is associated with tumor progression (4). Results from several studies suggest that the p53 pathway is dysregulated in melanoma cells, which in turn may lead to inactivation or alteration of p53 function (5). For instance, many human melanoma cell lines containing wild type p53 showed abnormalities in the p53 pathway in response to -irradiation (6). In recent years, studies have suggested that the retention of wild type p53 may actually confer resistance to therapy in a number of tumor systems (7). However, the role of p53 function in melanoma remains unclear..

When sufficiently expressed, p21 induces G1 arrest by direct binding of cyclin-dependent kinases (9). Expression of p21 has been implicated as a survival mechanism against therapy (10). For instance, inhibition of p21 by antisense technology sensitized glioblastoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents (11) and to radiation therapy (12). p21 also appears to protect human colon carcinoma cells and prostate cancer cells against apoptosis (13, 14). Additionally, there is evidence that p21 may protect against p53-mediated apoptosis in human melanoma cells (15). The precise involvement of p21 in the resistance of melanoma to therapy remains largely undefined..

0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	10	Nitric oxide (NO) has recently been implicated in the regulation of p53. Specifically, treating cells with NO donors resulted in conformational and functional changes and possible tyrosine nitration of p53 protein (16, 17). In addition, it was shown that NO can regulate the ability of p53 to stimulate radiation-induced cell cycle arrest in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (18). NO is generated as a reaction product of the enzymatic conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by three isotypes of NO synthase (NOS): endothelial (eNOS), neuronal (nNOS), and inducible (iNOS). NOSs are expressed in various tissue types. eNOS and nNOS are typically considered to be constitutively expressed, whereas iNOS, as its name implies, is inducible (19). NO is involved in neurotransmission, vasodilation, inflammation, and immunity (20) and is also believed to play roles in multiple stages of various cancers (21). It exhibits both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic characteristics, depending on concentration and cell type (22, 23). Recently, NO has been shown to covalently modify proteins that can lead to regulation of activity, including caspases (24, 25), retinoblastoma protein (26), c-Src (27), and p53 (17)..

0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	12	Our laboratory observed that the expression of iNOS and the presence of nitrotyrosine in tumor cells of melanoma patients correlated strongly with poor patient outcome (p  <  0.001 and = 0.02, respectively) (28), suggesting an important role for NO in melanoma resistance to therapy. Presently, samples from 103 patients with stage III and 36 patients with stage IV melanoma have been analyzed, and similar results have been obtained.2 Others have correlated NOS activity and iNOS expression with melanoma progression (29). Recently, Salvucci et al. (30) provided evidence that endogenous NO may serve as a survival factor in human melanoma cells..

We present evidence that the depletion of endogenous NO in melanoma cell lines leads to increased sensitivity to cisplatin as a consequence of the inhibition of cisplatin-induced p53 accumulation and p21 expression. Our findings support the hypothesis that NO is required for DNA damage-induced p53 activation, which acts as a protective factor against apoptosis in melanoma cells..

Western blot analyses of cell lysates showed that NO depletion resulted in a substantial reduction of cisplatin-induced p53 accumulation in all melanoma cell lines tested. NO depletion strongly inhibited cisplatin-induced p21 expression in close correlation with decreased p53 accumulation, which suggests that p21 expression is p53 dependent in melanoma cells. NO depletion alone did not alter p53 protein levels or localization, whereas the addition of NO increased p53 accumulation only slightly. Correspondingly, p21 expression remained nearly undetectable with either NO depletion or addition alone. Quenched c-PTIO failed to inhibit cisplatin-induced expression of p53 and p21, confirming that the observed effect is specific to NO modulation.

Moreover, incubation with the pan-NOS inhibitor L-NMMA, the iNOS-selective inhibitor AMG, or the iNOS-specific inhibitor N-(3-(aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine (1400W) prior to cisplatin treatment also reduced p53 and p21 expression, albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 5, A to C). Pretreatment of melanoma cells with doxycycline, which destabilizes iNOS mRNA, prior to cisplatin treatment led to inhibition of cisplatin-induced p53 accumulation and p21 expression (Fig. 5D).

Expression of p53DN enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis by 1.8-fold (Fig. 7A). Basal levels of apoptosis were not affected by p53DN when compared with pMEV empty vector. The p53DN protein, which is tagged with two hemagglutinin motifs, can be seen in p53DN-transfected cells, but not in control cells (Fig. 7B). A 54-kDa hemagglutinin-tagged band is detectible in p53DN transfectants, but not in pMEV controls (data not shown). Wild type p53 is activated in both p53DN- and pMEV-transfected cells after cisplatin treatment. However, p21 expression in p53DN-transfected cells was reduced relative to control cells, suggesting that p53 function is partially inhibited. Transfection of p53 siRNA also reduced p53 expression after cisplatin treatment. However, the level of p53 reduction was not sufficient to enhance cisplatin-induced apoptosis (data not shown)..

Expression of p53DN enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis by 1.8-fold (Fig. 7A). Basal levels of apoptosis were not affected by p53DN when compared with pMEV empty vector. The p53DN protein, which is tagged with two hemagglutinin motifs, can be seen in p53DN-transfected cells, but not in control cells (Fig. 7B). A 54-kDa hemagglutinin-tagged band is detectible in p53DN transfectants, but not in pMEV controls (data not shown). Wild type p53 is activated in both p53DN- and pMEV-transfected cells after cisplatin treatment. However, p21 expression in p53DN-transfected cells was reduced relative to control cells, suggesting that p53 function is partially inhibited. Transfection of p53 siRNA also reduced p53 expression after cisplatin treatment. However, the level of p53 reduction was not sufficient to enhance cisplatin-induced apoptosis (data not shown)..

In this study, we demonstrated that the depletion of endogenously generated NO in melanoma cell lines containing wild type p53 decreases cell growth, enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and inhibits p53 accumulation and the subsequent induction of p21 by cisplatin. Moreover, we showed that the increase in cisplatin-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells is caused by NO regulation of p53 expression, which exhibits a protective role against cisplatin treatment. These findings are consistent with the clinical observation that patients with iNOS-expressing melanomas had significantly poorer survival than their iNOS-negative counterparts. In addition, the findings that iNOS is up-regulated and overall NOS activity is increased in melanoma further suggest a role for NO (29, 39)..

It is now generally accepted that high levels of NO are toxic, whereas lower levels of NO may be growth promoting (reviewed in Refs. 40 and 41), although the threshold between low and high levels of NO is still dependent on the cell type and context within which NO is found..

A number of groups have reported both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic properties of NO, depending on cell type and experimental system (22, 23, 42 to 45). We observed that NO depletion by c-PTIO or oxymyoglobin treatment was capable of enhancing cisplatin-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. However, when NOS inhibitors, including L-NMMA, AMG, and 1400W, were used to block NO production in melanoma cells, they were only minimally effective in enhancing apoptosis after cisplatin treatment. Salvucci et al. (30) found that serum completely suppresses the apoptotic effect of AMG in melanoma cells, so it is possible that serum components interfere with NOS inhibitor activity or complicate its chemistry. Albumin can act as a NO reservoir, and may control NO-dependent processes in the vasculature (46). Various thiol containing proteins and low molecular weight thiols such as glutathione may also act as a NO store and selectively release NO to maintain cellular NO levels (47). Use of a chemical NO scavenger would nullify NO stores by quickly reacting with any newly released NO, whereas inhibition of NO production by NOS does not deplete possible cellular NO storage mechanisms. Another possibility is that c-PTIO possesses some secondary reactivity (48). However, the lack of effect of quenched NO scavenger controls and the similar effects of oxymyoglobin on melanoma cells strongly suggest that NO is the causal agent in our observations..

This sustained G2 arrest was subsequently accompanied by an increase in apoptosis. Cell cycle alterations were also shown to result from NO depletion in pulmonary cells (49). The precise involvement of NO in cell cycle regulation is not known. However, a number of cell cycle regulators appear to be targets of NO, the most prominent of which is retinoblastoma protein (26). Accumulation of melanoma cells at the G1/S boundary after cisplatin treatment and a trend toward the return to a normal cell cycle distribution after 36 h suggest that melanoma cells are capable of responding to and possibly repairing DNA damage. Our data suggest that p53 response to DNA damage is at least partially intact, as evidenced by the stabilization and nuclear accumulation of p53 after cisplatin treatment and by the subsequent expression of p21. NO-depleted melanoma cells did not accumulate at the G1/S boundary after cisplatin treatment. Instead, cells slowly progressed to the S and G2/M phases, which may be explained by the concomitant loss of cisplatin-induced p21 expression..

This appears not to be the case in melanoma, in which iNOS is upregulated and p53 mutations are rare.

In MCF-7 cells, NO donor treatment resulted in possible tyrosine nitration of p53 and improved DNA binding at low donor levels (0.25 to 0.5 mM), but inhibited DNA binding at higher donor concentrations (1 to 5 mM) (16), which alludes to some possibly complex interaction between p53 and NO. Superoxide, known to be up-regulated in melanoma (52), reacts quickly with NO to form peroxynitrite, a potent oxidizing agent capable of nitrating tyrosines (53). A recent study that focused on the influence of superoxide on nitrosylation reactions may add insight to the exquisite edge on which NO is balanced (32). NO may also regulate phosphorylation of p53 in response to DNA damage (55, 56). In addition, cysteines present in the zinc finger DNA binding motifs of p53 may be susceptible to nitrosylation by NO, leading to alterations in p53 function..

Hdm2 (Mdm2 in mouse) binds p53 to inhibit its transcriptional activity, ubiquitinates p53 to regulate its stability, and plays a pivotal role in determining p53 localization. Nitrosylation of cysteine 77 in the hydrophobic p53-binding pocket of Hdm2 is thought to interfere with p53 binding. Hdm2 has also been found to be up-regulated in some melanoma cells containing wild type p53 (58). These findings suggest that NO is involved in the regulation of p53 stability, which may help to explain how the depletion of endogenous NO inhibits cisplatin-induced p53 accumulation in melanoma cells. Whether endogenous NO inhibits Hdm2-p53 interaction in melanoma cells remains to be determined. NO may regulate the activity of p53 upstream effectors such as ataxia telangectasia mutant kinase, AT-mutated and Rad3-related kinase, and DNA-PK. For example, NO was shown to activate DNA-PKc to protect against DNA damage (59). Whether NO regulates the activity of these DNA damage-activated kinases in melanoma cells is not known..

NO is capable of activating p21 via p53 or cGMP pathways (60, 61). We observed that inhibition of p21 expression by NO depletion consistently correlated with reduced p53 accumulation. NO depletion resulted in the near abrogation of p53 binding to the p53-binding site of the p21 promoter. Inhibition of p53 by siRNA or dominant negative p53 expression also reduced p21 expression. p53 and p21 expression, cell cycle distribution, and the level of apoptosis after cisplatin treatment were not altered by either ODQ or 8-bromo-cGMP. Furthermore, melanoma cells frequently do not express the NO-sensitive isoform of soluble guanylyl cyclase, which responds to NO to generate cGMP and subsequently induce p21 expression (62). Taken together, these data strongly suggests that p21 is activated in a p53-dependent manner in melanoma cells with wild type p53 and that the cGMP signaling pathway is not involved.

Our data show that p53 and p21 are upregulated in melanoma in response to DNA damage by cisplatin, which suggests that melanoma cells actively respond to genotoxic insult by inducing cell cycle arrest and possibly carrying out DNA repair, thus avoiding cell death. Transfection of a dominant negative form of p53 into A375 melanoma cells resulted in a substantial increase in cisplatin sensitivity as well as a reduction of p21 expression after cisplatin treatment, confirming that p53 activation following exposure to cisplatin protects melanoma cells from apoptosis. Inhibition of p53 by siRNA only partially reduced cisplatin-induced p53 and p21 expression, which was not sufficient to enhance apoptosis after cisplatin treatment. Transfection of mutated p53 into melanoma cells has a dominant effect, which is not the case in siRNA transfection. Cells transfected with siRNA may still produce low levels of wild type p53, and thus could still be capable of responding to DNA damage. Indeed, we observed that p53 siRNA-transfected cells still expressed p21, albeit at a lower concentration (data not shown)..

In this model, NO is a key factor in the p53-dependent activation of p21 expression after cisplatin-induced DNA damage. Expression of p21 results in a skewing of cellular response toward cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and cell survival, and away from apoptosis. Inhibition of p21 can result in the loss of G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and can lead to the induction of apoptosis. Therefore, the regulation of its expression by NO via the p53 signaling pathway may be of extreme importance in melanoma resistance to therapy. In this case, the ability of p53 to induce p21 would determine whether tumor cells are protected against genotoxic insult. These insights offer several potential pathways to target for future therapies against melanomas containing wild type p53..

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	3	A single dose of Mpl ligand (Mpl-L) given immediately after lethal DNA-damaging regimens prevents the death of mice. However, the mechanism of this myeloprotection is unknown. The induction of p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage signals suggests that immediate administration of Mpl-L may inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis. This hypothesis was tested by administering a single injection of pegylated murine Megakaryocyte Growth and Development Factor (PEG-rmMGDF, a truncated recombinant Mpl-L) to p53/ and wild-type mice immediately after carboplatin (80 mg/kg) and 7.5 Gy total body -irradiation. PEG-rmMGDF was required to prevent the death of wild-type mice, whereas p53/ mice survived with or without the exogenous cytokine. The degree of platelet depression and subsequent recovery was comparable in p53/ mice to wild-type animals given PEG-rmMGDF. Hence, either Mpl-L administration or p53-deficiency protected multipotent hematopoietic progenitors and committed megakaryocyte precursors. The myelosuppressive regimen induced expression of p53 and the p53 target, p21Cipl in wild-type bone marrow, indicating that Mpl-L acts downstream of p53 to prevent apoptosis. Constitutive expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax, was not further increased. Bax/ mice survived the lethal regimen only when given PEG-rmMGDF; however, these Bax/ mice showed more rapid hematopoietic recovery than did identically-treated wild-type mice. Therefore, administration of Mpl-L immediately after myelosuppressive chemotherapy or preparatory regimens for autologous bone marrow transplantation should prevent p53-dependent apoptosis, decrease myelosuppression, and reduce the need for platelet transfusions.

This latter point is evident by marked reductions in granulocyte-macrophage, erythroid, and multipotential progenitor cells in Tpo/ and c-Mpl/ mice,7,8 suggesting that Mpl and Mpl-L play significant roles in both megakaryocyte maturation and in the maintenance of multipotential hematopoietic progenitors.9,10 Signaling by Mpl-L, alone or in combination with other early-acting cytokines, also promotes the survival of primitive multipotent progenitor cells by blocking apoptosis.11-13.

Immediately afterward, half of the animals were injected intravenously with 65  microg/kg PEG-rmMGDF. Bone marrow cells were aseptically harvested from mouse femurs and tibias by flushing the bone marrow cavity with 2 mL -MEM (minimum essential medium: with Earle salts and with L-glutamine; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). A cell suspension was prepared by passing the bone marrow through a 25-gauge needle. The concentration of nucleated cells in the bone marrow cell suspension was determined after dilution in 3% acetic acid to lyse erythrocytes. Diluted cell suspensions and recombinant mouse interleukin 3 (rmIL-3) were mixed with methylcellulose (MethoCult M3230; Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). The cell suspensions were plated in duplicate in 35-mm culture dishes in medium that contained a final concentration of 0.9% methycellulose, 30% FBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mM L-glutamine, and were cultured at 37 degrees C with 5% CO2. For day 1 assays, 1 to 2  x  106 cells per dish were cultured in 20 U/mL rmIL-3. For day 2 assays, due to the lower bone marrow cellularity at this time after treatment, fewer cells (0.4  x  106 per dish) were plated. Colonies were scored on day 13, and colony sizes were classified as large ( >  500 cells/colony), medium (200-400 cells/colony), or small (15-150 cells/colony). Results were expressed as the numbers of colonies per 106 cells plated..

The rationale and hypothesis of our studies was that if Mpl-L was acting to prevent cell death through a p53-dependent pathway, then Mpl-L administration to p53/ mice given a myelosuppressive regimen should provide no further hematopoietic protection over carrier-treated p53-null animals subjected to the same DNA damage. Alternatively, if the cytokine blocks cell death via another pathway, p53/mice treated with DNA-damaging agents and Mpl-L should display less myelosuppression and faster hematopoietic recovery than p53/mice given myelosuppression and carrier alone. In this case, the Mpl-L protective effect should be additive to the loss of p53 function..

WT and p53/ mice treated with PEG-rmMGDF, as well as p53/ animals injected with carrier alone, experienced nearly identical courses of platelet suppression and recovery following carboplatin and -irradiation (-IR), whereas platelet counts of carrier-treated WT mice failed to recover (Figure 2A). These results were confirmed in 2 repeat experiments. In contrast, the declines in WBC and hemoglobin values were significantly less severe in p53/ mice, with or without PEG-rmMGDF treatment, as compared with WT animals given PEG-rmMGDF (Figure 2B-C). Wild-type mice treated with PEG-rmMGDF had appreciably lower WBC counts than did the 2 p53/ groups between days 8 and 22 after treatment (P  <  .02-.001 in 3 experiments). Similarly, decreases in hemoglobin concentration were significantly greater in WT mice given PEG-rmMGDF than in both groups of p53/ mice on day 14 (P  <  .005-.001 in 3 experiments). The hemoglobin levels of WT mice treated with PEG-rmMGDF did recover to a level equal to that of p53/ mice by day 22 (Figure 2B). By contrast, PEG-rmMGDF administration did not enhance hematopoietic recovery in p53/ mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that thrombopoiesis is protected to the same extent in PEG-rmMGDF-treated WT mice and in p53/ mice by conferring survival to c-Mpl-expressing multipotential hematopoietic precursors and committed megakaryocyte progenitors. In contrast, granulopoiesis and erythropoiesis are protected less efficiently by PEG-rmMGDF in WT mice than in p53/ mice because committed granulocyte and erythroid precursors do not express c-Mpl..

Bone marrow obtained from these mice was plated in methylcellulose containing IL-3, and colony number and size were scored after 13 days. Colony formation from marrow of mice treated with PEG-rmMGDF or carrier and collected on day 1 and day 2 after treatment was markedly decreased compared with that of untreated marrow (Figure 3). However, bone marrow cells collected at 24 and 48 hours generated significantly greater colony numbers and sizes when derived from mice treated with PEG-rmMGDF as compared with carrier-treated mice (P  <  .05) (Figure 3, middle and bottom panels). Furthermore, bone marrow from mice given the myelosuppression regimen and PEG-rmMGDF yielded a full spectrum of colony sizes, whereas bone marrow from those mice exposed to the myelosuppressive regimen without PEG-rmMGDF formed predominantly small colonies (Figure 3, middle and bottom panels).

DNA damage is followed by rapid accumulation and activation of p53 that induces the expression of a number of downstream target genes, resulting in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.18 To assess the function of the p53 pathway in response to our myelosuppression regimen, we analyzed the expression of p53 and 2 of its transcription targets (p21Cip1 and Bax) in bone marrow cells at specific time intervals following carboplatin and -IR exposure by immunoblotting (Figure 5). In response to this regimen, levels of p53 protein increased rapidly and were sustained for at least 6 hours before declining; PEG-rmMGDF administration did not significantly alter the magnitude or the kinetics of p53 induction (Figure 5, repeated in 5 separate experiments). Bax, a proapoptotic factor that is up-regulated by p53 in some cell types,19-23 was constitutively expressed in bone marrow cells exposed to the DNA-damaging regimen and unaffected by the administration of PEG-rmMGDF. By contrast, expression of p21Cip1, a cyclin kinase inhibitor,24 was markedly induced following carboplatin and -IR and this response paralleled the induction of p53 (Figure 5). PEG-rmMGDF had no consistent differential effect on the induction of p21 during DNA damage, indicating that the beneficial effect of Mpl-L on hematopoietic cells is not due to a direct disruption of the p53 response; instead, Mpl-L appears to act downstream of p53 to prevent apoptosis (see "Discussion")..

Similar to WT littermate animals, Bax/ mice were highly susceptible to the lethal effects of this DNA-damaging regimen. Assessment of platelet counts, WBC counts, and hemoglobin levels indicated that Bax/ mice died due to hematopoietic failure (Figure 6A-C) (confirmed in 2 independent experiments).

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	60	Atm is a member of the PI-3' serine/threonine kinase family that phosphorylates and activates p53 in response to certain DNA damage signals.25,26 Loss of Atm in mice and humans is typically associated with attenuated p53 responsiveness and impaired cell cycle arrest. Paradoxically, Atm/ mice display remarkable susceptibility to DNA-damaging insults,27,28 which appears to be cell-type specific and largely attributable to increased gastrointestinal sensitivity.29 Since p53-null bone marrow progenitors are resistant to DNA damage, we tested whether loss of Atm would also influence the response of bone marrow-derived progenitors to carboplatin and -IR. To this end, we assessed the responses of WT mice receiving Atm/, p53/, p53+/, or WT bone marrow transplants to DNA damage. Animals transplanted with Atm/ marrow and treated with PEG-rmMGDF succumbed earlier to the myelosuppressive regimen than did similarly treated mice transplanted with p53+/ and WT bone marrow, whereas all mice receiving p53/ transplants survived without PEG-rmMGDF treatment (Figure 7). All Atm/, p53+/, or WT bone marrow-transplanted mice treated with carrier after exposure to the myelosuppressive regimen died (data not shown). The inability of Atm/ bone marrow cells to properly arrest in response to DNA damage presumably overrode the protective effects of Mpl-L, resulting in dramatically earlier hematopoietic death of all Atm/ mice..

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	65	The mechanism by which Mpl-L protects animals from a lethal myelosuppressive regimen has not been previously established. Myelosuppressive agents such as chemotherapy and -IR are known to activate p53-dependent apoptosis.14,15,30 Because Mpl is expressed on multipotential hematopoietic progenitors7-9,31 and its ligand, TPO, prevents apoptosis of these progenitors in vitro,11-13 we hypothesized that Mpl-L protects mice by preventing p53-dependent cell death. If this hypotheses is correct, then Mpl-L administration should not provide greater protection to hematopoiesis in p53/ mice, as compared with carrier-treated p53-null animals, following a myeloablative regimen. Our findings support this hypothesis: when exposed to the same myelosuppressive insult, p53-deficient mice survived without Mpl-L treatment, whereas WT mice died. Furthermore, p53/ mice subjected to the myelosuppression regimen and treated with Peg-rmMGDF had the same degree of myelosuppression and hematopoietic recovery profile as the p53/ mice given the myelosuppressive regimen and carrier alone. These findings indicate that Mpl-L is acting to suppress p53-dependent apoptosis in vivo..

Hemoglobin concentration and WBC counts were reduced to a greater extent in WT mice given PEG-rmMGDF than in p53-deficient mice given PEG-rmMGDF or carrier alone. By contrast, the degree of thrombocytopenia in these 3 groups was virtually identical. We speculate that this difference reflects the disparate patterns of Mpl expression on the various hematopoietic progenitors.9,10 In that case, all p53-null multipotential hematopoietic progenitors and committed precursors would be protected from p53-dependent apoptosis, whereas in the normal phenotype, only hematopoietic cells that express Mpl would be protected by Mpl-L. If this view is correct, then concomitant administration of Mpl-L in combination with erythropoietin and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) immediately after a myelosuppressive insult might optimally reduce the degree of suppression of all 3 committed hematopoietic lineages..

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	73	Our analysis of protein expression provides insight into how Mpl-L prevents p53-dependent apoptosis after the myelosuppressive regimen. The increase in p53 protein levels in bone marrow cells in response to carboplatin and -IR was unaffected by Mpl-L administration, indicating that PEG-rmMGDF did not protect hematopoietic cells by directly suppressing p53 expression. Furthermore, the induction of p21Cip1 expression was not enhanced in carboplatin/radiation-treated WT mice after PEG-rmMGDF injection. These results indicate that Mpl-L does not interfere with the p53 pathway at the level of p53-induction; rather, the cytokine appears to protect bone marrow cells by suppressing p53 function at a downstream step. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that cytokines, such as IL-3 and erythropoietin, protect against p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage by inducing the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, both of which are potent suppressors of cell death.32,33 These findings support the hypothesis that cytokines block p53-mediated cell death by antagonizing downstream target genes, such as Bax or other proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members..

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	75	Because Bax is directly transactivated by p53 and promotes apoptosis,21,34 we also tested the role of this gene by using Bax-deficient mice in our myelosuppression model. We found that Bax is constitutively expressed in mouse bone marrow cells and that Bax levels are not affected by carboplatin plus -IR, or by the administration of PEG-rmMGDF. Consistent with these findings, Bax deficiency did not protect the animals from the lethal dose of carboplatin and -IR. However, when PEG-rmMGDF was given, platelet counts, WBC counts, and hemoglobin levels recovered more rapidly in Bax/ mice than in WT mice, indicating that Bax does play a proapoptotic role in the response of multipotential hematopoietic cells to this myelosuppressive regimen. These findings convincingly demonstrate that loss of Bax is not equivalent to loss of p53 in protecting against lethal myelosuppression and that other downstream factors must mediate p53-dependent apoptosis under these conditions..

Myelosuppression is a toxicity-limiting component of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, and a major clinical problem in autologous bone marrow transplantation regimens. Administration of Mpl-L during these DNA-damaging treatments should suppress the p53 response, thereby alleviating the severity of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia and the need for platelet transfusions..

Mutations of p53 occur in over 50% of all cancers and are indicative of highly aggressive cancers that are hard to treat. Recently, there has been a high degree of interest in therapeutic approaches to restore growth suppression functions to mutant p53. Several compounds have been reported to restore wild type function to mutant p53. One such compound, CP-31398, has been shown effective in vivo, but questions have arisen to whether it actually affects p53. Here we show that mutant p53, isolated from cells treated with CP-31398, is capable of binding to p53 response elements in vitro. We also show the compound restores DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in cells as determined by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In addition, using purified p53 core domain from two different hotspot mutants (R273H and R249S), we show that CP-31398 can restore DNA-binding activity in a dose-dependent manner. Using a quantitative DNA binding assay, we also show that CP-31398 increases significantly the amount of mutant p53 that binds to cognate DNA (Bmax) and its affinity (Kd) for DNA. The compound, however, does not affect the affinity (Kd value) of wild type p53 for DNA and only increases Bmax slightly. In a similar assay PRIMA1 does not have any effect on p53 core DNA-binding activity. We also show that CP-31398 had no effect on the DNA-binding activity of p53 homologs p63 and p73..

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	8	The majority of inactivating mutations reside in the central core DNA binding domain (DBD)1 of p53 (2, 5). These mutations can be divided into two main classes, DNA contact mutants, like R273H, where the mutation alters a residue involved in contact with DNA, and structural mutants, like R249S, which result in structural changes in the p53 core domain (6 to 8). These mutations affect the function of p53 by distorting the structure and reducing the thermal stability of the protein (6 to 8). This can alter the ability of p53 to bind to various p53 response elements in a variety of genes, hampering its transcriptional regulation (9). In addition, these mutations may alter p53 structure, so that p53 can no longer induce apoptosis by binding to BclXL, thereby inhibiting its anti-apoptotic function (10)..

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	10	One potential therapeutic approach to cancer would be restoration of growth suppression activity to mutant p53. Several approaches have been tried, ranging from micro-injection of monoclonal antibody 421, C-terminal peptide of p53 and small molecules (11 to 16). Recently, small molecules and peptides, such as CP-31398, PRIMA1, and CDB3 peptide, have been shown to be effective in restoring p53 function (17 to 25). Both PRIMA1 and CDB3 have been shown to restore p53 DNA-binding activity in vitro (18 to 21), whereas the effects for CP-31398 have been shown primarily in cell-based assays (17, 22 to 25). Both CP-31398 and PRIMA1 have been shown to reduce tumor size in animal models (17, 18). It is postulated that the two molecules perform similar tasks, but by different mechanisms. PRIMA1 has been suggested to work more broadly to restore p53 DNA-binding activity, but the specific mechanism is not known (18). CP-31398, on the other hand, has been suggested to stabilize p53 as a protectant against thermal denaturation and maintain monoclonal antibody 1620 epitope conformation in newly synthesized p53 (17). Recently, CP-31398 has also been shown to stabilize wild type p53 in cells by inhibiting Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation (23). Reports from other studies suggest that CP-31398 interacts with DNA and not with p53 in vitro, and it is proposed to act as a DNA-damaging agent (26). Although it has been shown that the effects of CP-31398 on p53 do not depend on the DNA damage pathway (23), its p53-independent cellular growth suppression effects at higher concentrations and lack of demonstrated binding to p53 protein raise confusion about its mechanism of action (24 to 26). Here we demonstrate that CP-31398 can promote mutant p53 to bind to p53 response elements in vivo using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. In addition, using purified p53 core domain, we clearly demonstrate that CP-31398 can restore DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in vitro. We also show that CP-31398 does not have any effects on the DNA-binding activity of the p53 homologs, p63 and p73. In contrast, PRIMA1 was ineffective in restoring DNA-binding activity to isolated mutant p53 DNA binding domain..

The DNA binding domains of p63 and p73 were generated by polymerase chain reaction from plasmids pCUB 412 (p63) and pCUB370 (p73) (gifts of Dr. Charles DiComo) using gene-specific primers 5'-CATGCCATGGCAAGCTCCACCTTCGATGCTCTC-3' and 5'-CCCAAGCTTTCATGTCATCTGGATACCATGTC-3' for p63 and 5'-CATGCCATGGCAAGCTCCACCTTCGACACCATGTC-3' and 5'-CCCAAGCTTACTCTTCTTCACACCGGCACC-3' for p73. The resulting PCR products were cloned similarly into pET42a and expressed as a GST-5X His fusion protein, GST-His p63DBD, and GST-His p73DBD..

Binding was measured in the presence or absence of 500 nM C-terminal peptide or 500 nM CP-31398. Both the peptide and CP-31398 caused specific binding to the consensus oligonucleotide, whereas no binding was seen with the altered oligonucleotide or in the absence of compound or peptide. Next, we titrated various concentrations of CP-31398 with the mutant protein (Fig. 2D). Binding of the protein to the labeled oligonucleotide was very low in the absence of compound. As the compound was increased up to 1  microM, there is an increase in binding activity, demonstrating that CP-31398 can dose dependently restore DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 core domain in an in vitro system. The apparent difference between the concentration used in vivo and the concentration used in vitro is possibly due to the unstable nature of CP-31398 (26), which can not be stored in solution at room temperature for an extended period..

The advantage of the electro-chemiluminescent system is that it is significantly more sensitive than an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and is capable of generating a more robust signal that helps to detect weak interactions..
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	41	The assay was validated using GST-His p53DBD wt and a biotinylated oligonucleotide containing the p53 consensus binding sequence (Fig. 3A). The amount of DNA was varied from 0 to 5 nM, and either 2.5 or 5 nM protein was used. To show the specificity of the assay, excess unlabeled oligonucleotide was used to compete with the biotinylated oligonucleotide. GST-His p53DBD wt showed saturable DNA binding both at 2.5 and 5 nM, which could be competed away with unlabeled oligonucleotide. Because CP-31398 was discovered in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based conformation stabilization assay using recombinant wild type p53 DNA binding domain (17), we wanted to see if CP-31398 had any effect on DNA-binding activity of wild type p53 core protein. We assayed wild type p53 at 5 nM protein in the absence and presence of 500 nM CP-31398 (Fig. 3B). The compound does not have any effect on the Kd of the protein for DNA (1.28  plus or minus  0.27 and 1.30  plus or minus  0.29, respectively) but increases the Bmax (129,004  plus or minus  9,302 and 191,645  plus or minus  14,161, respectively), suggesting that the compound increases the number of protein molecules that can be bound to DNA..

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	43	  Next, we evaluated CP-31398 under similar conditions with two p53 mutants, R273H, a DNA contact point mutant, and R249S, a structural mutant (Fig. 4, A and B). Both the mutants showed little if any binding in the absence of compound. In the presence of 500 nM CP-31398 both mutants showed a dramatic increase in DNA binding, with the Bmax (R273H: 8890  plus or minus  1242 alone versus 108,047  plus or minus  8309 with CP-31398; R249S: 8031  plus or minus  739 alone versus 133,187  plus or minus  12,614 with CP-31398) increasing severalfold. In the case of the R273H mutant, the binding affinity (Kd = 4.7  plus or minus  1.1 and 2.73  plus or minus  0.40) increased by less than 2-fold, whereas the R249S mutant saw an increase of about 6-fold (Kd 3.98  plus or minus  0.61 alone versus 0.65  plus or minus  0.19 with CP-31398)..

The p53 binding site in the Bax promoter (referred to as the bax site) has been reported to have a lower affinity for p53, and it binds p53 to a much lesser extent than the consensus binding sequence (9, 29). First we confirmed the effect of CP-31398 on wild type protein using the bax site (Fig. 5A). As with the consensus DNA the affinity of wild type p53 (Kd) for the bax site did not change in the presence of 500 nM CP-31398 (106.2  plus or minus  27.27 alone versus 104.5  plus or minus  18.71 with CP-31398), but the Bmax did (224,602  plus or minus  19,026 alone versus 353,797  plus or minus  26,649 with CP-31398). We assayed an R273H mutant protein with the bax site (Fig. 5B) and found that, again, the Bmax changed severalfold (5,072  plus or minus  870.5 alone versus 33,115  plus or minus  1,838 with CP-31398). The affinity of the mutant protein for the bax site increased 5-fold (Kd = 576.4  plus or minus  139.5 alone versus 81.20  plus or minus  11.58 with CP-31398). On the contrary, PRIMA1, which also reactivates mutant p53 (18), did not have any effect on Kd or Bmax in the binding assay (Kd = 535.6  plus or minus  100.8, Bmax = 4,121  plus or minus  539.7), indicating that the PRIMA1 compound may not act on the DNA binding domain of mutant p53 and may function by a different mechanism..

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	48	  Effects of CP-31398 on p63 and p73 One potential issue with CP-31398 is that it tends to be cytotoxic at doses over 15  microg/ml in a p53-independent manner (17, 23 to 25). Part of this cytotoxicity could be due to effects on the p53 homologs, p63 and p73. To see if CP-31398 had any effect on p63 or p73, we cloned and expressed the DNA binding domains of both proteins as GST fusions (29) (Fig. 6A) and confirmed their activity in EMSA (Fig. 6B). We then evaluated the effects of CP-31398 using the bax site in the binding assay, along with wild type p53 as a comparison. We also tested the peptide CDB3 at similar concentrations as CP-31398 to see if it to would have an effect on p63 and p73 similar to its reported effects on p53 (19 to 21). In the case of p53 (Fig. 7A), CP-31398 and CDB3 altered the Bmax (Table I), but not the Kd of wild type p53 binding to the Bax DNA. With p63 and p73 (Fig. 7, B and C), there was no increase in Bmax in the presence of CP-31398 or CDB3, and the reactions appeared to be similar to reactions done in the absence of CP-31398 (Table I). This suggests that CP-31398 and CDB3 do not interact with either p63 or p73 DNA binding domain, thus excluding a role for activation of p53 homologs in the cytotoxicity of CP-31398..

Recently, several compounds and peptides have been reported to restore growth suppression functions to mutant p53 in vitro. Two of these compounds, CP-31398 and PRIMA1, have been effective in reducing tumor size in animal models (17, 18). CP-31398 was discovered in a random screen of small molecules for their ability to protect wild type conformation (monoclonal antibody 1620 epitope) of p53 core domain from thermal denaturation (17). It has been suggested that p53 is a dynamic protein, an equilibrium exists between conformations, and mutation shifts the equilibrium toward the inactive conformation, promoting thermal denaturation at physiological temperature (6 to 8, 20). Oncogenic mutations change the conformation of core domain thus abolishing binding with cognate DNA molecules (31). Lack of evidence of direct interaction of CP-31398 with p53 core domain and controversy about the potential mechanism of action of this promising class of molecules prompted us to biochemically characterize its effects on DNA-binding activity of wild type and mutant p53 core domain..

We also show that CP-31398 has the ability to restore sequence-specific DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in the compound-treated nuclear extract in vitro in a manner similar to previous reports (25). In addition, using a ChIP assay, we demonstrate that CP-31398 can promote the binding of mutant p53 to the response elements in p53-regulated genes in cells. The binding of p53 to both p21 and bax promoter, and the failure of p53 to bind the S9 ribosomal protein promoter, indicate that CP-31398 interacts specifically with p53, and not DNA as had been previously suggested (26). CP-31398 can functionally restore mutant p53 to make capable of acting like wild type p53 and interact with both high (p21) and low (bax) affinity promoters (9, 30). The relatively high concentrations of CP-31398 needed for cellular experiments reported here and elsewhere (22 to 26) are indicative of a possible unstable nature of CP-31398 (26)..

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	57	Our studies with the purified p53 DNA binding domain of wild type and mutant p53 clearly show that CP-31398 restores DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 core domain by increasing both Bmax and Kd values of the reaction. Interestingly, the compound stimulates the DNA-binding activity of wild type protein without having any effects on affinity for DNA. With the wild type protein, Bmax is increased (1.5-fold) but the Kd remains the same in the presence of the compound, whereas with both R273H and R249S mutants, Bmax is more greatly increased than Kd ( > 10-fold). This indicates that CP-31398 acts as a "non-competitive agonist," binding to the proteins, and alters the rate of the reaction and the amount of protein capable of binding to DNA, but not affecting the affinity of the protein for DNA. Such a result suggests an allosteric mechanism, where binding of the compound to a site away from the protein-DNA interface can cause the protein to be placed into a conformation capable of binding DNA (32). As with CDB3, CP-31398 affects mutant protein binding to DNA in a similar way bringing the Kd of the mutant p53 for DNA to a similar level as wild type. The variations in the effect are mainly due to the affinity of the individual mutants for the particular p53 DNA binding site. R273H, which maintains a nearly wild type conformation, has the ability to transactivate from a consensus p53 DNA binding site but has a much reduced ability to transactivate and bind other sites like bax that have a much lower affinity for p53 than the consensus sequence (7 to 9)..

(20), where CP-31398, like CDB3 peptide, functions as a chaperone, enables p53 to fold into an active conformation that is capable of binding DNA. What occurs after DNA binding is a source of speculation. By Freidler's model (20), the compound should be displaced by the structural rearrangement that p53 undergoes once it binds DNA. Recent work by Freidler et al. (33) has shown that CDB3 binds to wild type and mutant (R249S and R273H) in the same manner, at a site that is away from the protein-DNA interface, and away from the site distorted by the R249S mutation. Thus, CDB3 exerting its effect via a long range conformational change and binding to a site that is different than the natural ligand, DNA, is an allosteric mechanism..

In our assay, PRIMA1 fails to stimulate DNA binding with just the DNA binding domain. Others have reported that PRIMA1 only works with full-length protein and fails to interact with the DNA binding domain (18, 21). A recent report (34) showed that PRIMA1 could induce apoptosis in the absence of new protein synthesis. This suggests that compounds that alter the active conformation of p53 and turn it into a more wild type protein may also exert their influence by making p53 capable of interacting with BclXL and BH3 domain-containing proteins to help mediate mitochondrial depolarization (10, 34, and 35). Given the nature of p53, it is likely that binding somewhere other than the DNA binding domain could exert effects on the DNA binding domain. It has been suggested that binding occurs just outside of the DNA binding domain or in the tetramerization domain (18). One possible effect is that it could promote and stabilize p53 tetramers in a conformation that is sufficient for the protein to function in DNA binding or in mitochondrial depolarization..

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	65	CP-31398 and CDB3 appear to be more specific for p53 than p63 and p73. Both p63 and p73 have homologous DNA binding domains as p53, but there are some amino acid differences between the proteins (29). A comparison between models of p53 DNA binding domain and p63 DNA binding domain indicates that p63 has a more thermostable hydrophobic core, making the protein significantly more stable than p53 (29). This is apparent from the fact that p63 and p73 protein can be expressed in soluble form at relatively high temperatures compared with p53 (29). Interestingly, there are second site suppressor mutations that can restore DNA-binding activity to some oncogenic mutants of p53 (36 to 38). Recently, a crystal structure of a quadruple mutant of p53 provides an explanation how loss of hydrogen bonds in V143A, a temperature-sensitive mutant, can be compensated by second site mutation N268D. The suppressor mutation N268D not only increases the overall stability of the oncogenic mutant but also induces local change to the protein initially caused by the loss of two methyl groups of V143A (38). This is a possible mechanism for compounds like CP-31398 and CDB3. Their interaction with the p53 core may provide energetically favorable compensatory hydrogen bonds and increase overall stability of many oncogenic mutants and, by doing so, restore wild type function. Given that the hydrophobic cores of p63 and p73 are stable, there may not be a site where the compounds can bind and act to give additional stability..

The suppressor mutation N268D not only increases the overall stability of the oncogenic mutant but also induces local change to the protein initially caused by the loss of two methyl groups of V143A (38). This is a possible mechanism for compounds like CP-31398 and CDB3. Their interaction with the p53 core may provide energetically favorable compensatory hydrogen bonds and increase overall stability of many oncogenic mutants and, by doing so, restore wild type function. Given that the hydrophobic cores of p63 and p73 are stable, there may not be a site where the compounds can bind and act to give additional stability..
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	67	We have shown that CP-31398 can affect the DNA-binding activity of both wild type and mutant p53 in vivo and in vitro. We also have observed that DNA binding is restored to both DNA contact mutant (R273H) and structural mutant (R249S) by the compound, and the effect is more pronounced in a structural mutant (R249S). These effects seem to be specific to p53, because both CP-31398 and CDB3 do not affect the activity of p63 and p73. By developing a DNA binding assay with CP-31398 and mutant p53, we can potentially look for compounds that perform similar activities to CP-31398 and CDB3 but do not have the liabilities and side effects of these molecules..

Purified fractions of a recombinant IHD miniprotein are active in a set of in vitro assays highlighting its affinity to the N-terminal LXXLL domain of p53 including (i) dose-dependent binding to Ser-20-phosphorylated p53 tetramers; (ii) DNA-stimulated binding to p53 tetramers; and (iii) inhibition of MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. The active component of the IHD miniprotein was localized to a 75-amino-acid fragment corresponding to amino acids 401 to 475 on human p300. This minimal IHD miniprotein can function in vivo as a p53-binding polypeptide in assays including: (i) complex formation with VP16-LXXLL peptide motifs in the two-hybrid assay; (ii) action as a dominant negative inhibitor of p53 from p21 luciferase templates; and (iii) attenuation of endogenous p21 protein levels. Further, we show here that the IRF-1-dependent stabilization and reactivation of p53PRO protein (LXXLL+/PXXP-) can be neutralized by the minimal IHD miniprotein, suggesting that IHD can bind to the p53 LXXLL domain in vivo. Phage-peptide display to the IHD miniprotein gave rise to an LSQXTFSXLXXLL consensus binding site that displays significant homology to the LXXLL transactivation domain of p53. These data validate the IHD scaffold as an independent LXXLL peptide-binding domain within the p300 protein, complementing the known peptide-binding domains including IBiD, C/H1, and C/H3..

The molecular mechanism by which p53 tetramers interact with p300 and how this modulates acetylation are beginning to be defined biochemically. Reconstitution of purified forms of the p300:p53 protein complex in vitro followed by validation in vivo have identified sequential stages in p300:p53 complex dynamics and include: (i) docking-dependent phosphorylation of the LXXLL motif at Thr-18 or Ser-20 by enzymes of the calcium-calmodulin superfamily such as CHK2 and CHK1 (8); (ii) stabilization of p300 binding to the p53 activation domain by phosphorylation at Thr-18 or Ser-20 (9); (iii) anchoring of p300 to the contiguous phospho-LXXLL and PXXP activation domains in p53 (10); (iv) sequence-specific DNA binding by p53, which induces a conformational change in the tetramer, forcing acetylation to be DNA-dependent and PXXP-dependent (10); and (v) acetylation of DNA-bound p53 that in turn stabilizes the p300:acetylated p53:DNA complex (11). How this multidomain scaffold arranges itself onto an "octavalent" substrate such as p53 is not known, nor is it known how acetylation of the native p53 oligomer can be constrained in the absence of consensus site DNA. The ability of IF-1 protein to bind to p300 and stimulate p53 acetylation by a novel allosteric mechanism (see also Ref. 22) further highlights the multifaceted and dynamic nature of the p300:p53 complex assembly. To continue dissecting out how p300 can bind to p53, we have mapped the various Ser-20-phospho-LXXLL and PXXP peptide-binding domains of p300 and have found them to map to regions distinct from the classic C/H1 and C/H3 p53 activation-binding domains (10). These peptide-binding regions in p300, in turn, are distinct from the binding of IRF-1 activation domain interfaces on p300 (see also Ref. 22). Together with mapping data from other approaches, these data identify at least eight peptide-binding minidomains of p300 that can contact p53 including C/H1, C/H3, IBiD,1 IHD, SPC-1, SPC-2, KIX, and Bromo..

Both of these miniproteins can function as dominant negative inhibitors of p300-coactivated stimulation of p53-depednent gene expression in cells (11). However, only the C-terminal IBiD domain has been examined structurally (12). The IBiD scaffold was defined by mapping regions of p300 that bind to phosphorylated activation domain fragments from IRF-3, although the miniprotein can also bind to non-phosphorylated activation domain fragments of other proteins. This apparent lack of "sequence specificity" in IBiD miniprotein binding to activation domain peptides is rationalized by the ability of unstructured activation domain peptides to acquire structure by an induced fit mechanism upon scaffold binding. Thus, it may be the capacity of a peptide to form a helix that makes it a good IBiD-binding motif. The structure and minimal LXXLL peptide binding activity of the N-terminal IHD miniprotein are not known, nor is it known whether the IHD scaffold has intrinsic peptide consensus site for selected polypeptides. Characterization of IHD and determination of whether it has a stringent peptide-docking site consensus site will advance dissection of the p300:p53 complex assembly. In this report, we define the minimal IHD scaffold to a 75-aminoacid fragment with homology to the minimal IBiD region of p300, demonstrate that IHD can contact the LXXLL region of p53 by a variety of assays including inhibition of IRF-1 reactivation of p53PRO, and demonstrate by phage-peptide display that the IHD miniprotein prefers a consensus peptide motif with significant homology to the LXXLL motif of p53. These data indicate that IHD is a bona fide LXXLL-p53 scaffold that promotes the formation of transcriptionally active complex between p53 and the co-activator p300..

Thus, it may be the capacity of a peptide to form a helix that makes it a good IBiD-binding motif. The structure and minimal LXXLL peptide binding activity of the N-terminal IHD miniprotein are not known, nor is it known whether the IHD scaffold has intrinsic peptide consensus site for selected polypeptides. Characterization of IHD and determination of whether it has a stringent peptide-docking site consensus site will advance dissection of the p300:p53 complex assembly. In this report, we define the minimal IHD scaffold to a 75-aminoacid fragment with homology to the minimal IBiD region of p300, demonstrate that IHD can contact the LXXLL region of p53 by a variety of assays including inhibition of IRF-1 reactivation of p53PRO, and demonstrate by phage-peptide display that the IHD miniprotein prefers a consensus peptide motif with significant homology to the LXXLL motif of p53. These data indicate that IHD is a bona fide LXXLL-p53 scaffold that promotes the formation of transcriptionally active complex between p53 and the co-activator p300..

The IHD domain of human p300 (amino acids 401 to 575) was subcloned into the Invitrogen pDONR201 entry vector and shuttled by recombination into the His-tagged destination vector for purification from bacteria. After induction, the His-tagged IHD was purified using nickel-affinity resin, and the protein concentration and purity were determined using the Bradford method and a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-gel. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create 3-' stop codon insertions within the pDONR-IHD401 to 575 vector, with the following primer designs (Table I) to be used to create the specific deletion mutants as follows: IHD401 to 553 IHD401 to 502 IHD401 to 475 IHD401 to 428, respectively.

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	18	Phage-peptide Display Phage-peptide display using purified IHD minidomain was done as described previously for MDM2 (14) and p300 (10). Briefly, a PhD.-12 phage display library kit (New England Biolabs) was used, which contains random 12-mer peptides fused to the coat protein (pIII) of M13 phage. The displayed 12-mer peptides are expressed at the N terminus of pIII and followed by a short spacer (Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser) and then the coding region of wild-type pIII protein. The complexity of the library was defined at 1.9 x 109 different peptide sequences, and the titer was 2 x 1012 plaque-forming units/ml. A Microlite 2 96-well flat bottom plate (Dynatech Laboratories) was coated with 1  microg/ml the anti-His monoclonal antibody by diluting in 100  microl of coating buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.6) and incubated overnight at 4  degrees C. The wells were then blocked with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed extensively with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 followed by incubation of IHD protein (100 ng) in 100  microl of blocking buffer. After 1 h, followed by extensive washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the wells were then incubated for 1 h with 1 x 1011 phage particles in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 followed by extensive washing in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The phage particles were eluted by incubation with 0.2 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.2), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with gentle rocking for 10 min and then neutralized with 15  microl of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.1). Eluted phage particles were then amplified by infection of ER2378 cells for 4.5 h, and the phage were polyethylene glycol-precipitated, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The biopanning procedure was repeated three times, and 1 x 1011 plaque-forming units of the second or third round amplified eluate were used as input phage. In addition, the Tween 20 concentration in the binding and wash buffers was increased stepwise (from 0.1 to 0.5%), with each successive round of biopanning to reduce nonspecific binding of the amplified phage-peptide particles. The third round polyethylene glycol-precipitated phage were titrated, individual plaques were tested for p53-specific-binding activity, and the DNA was amplified and prepared according to the manufacturer's (New England Biolabs) protocol. The Applied Biosytems Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer was used to sequence the DNA with the -96gIII primer. The sequence data from the 12-mer peptides obtained were then analyzed using the e-motif, blast NCBI databases, and ClustalW to identify consensus peptide motifs with homology to known or uncharacterized proteins (see Fig. 8 for summarized examples)..

A to C, purified bacterial expressed histidine-tagged IHD was captured onto ELISA wells with monoclonal anti-His6 antibody. Following an incubation with naive phage-peptide library, elution of the phage with acid, and propagation of eluted phage, three rounds of amplification were carried out to acquire phage that bound with a high affinity to the p300 minidomain IHD. The peptide inserts in each phage were sequenced to determine the insert peptide sequence. Thirty clones were tested, revealing consensus sequences with over 50% homology to the conserved BOX-I motif within p53, and three representative classes of peptides are as depicted. D, an overview of the consensus match identified by phage display when directly compared with the evolutionary conserved transactivation domain of p53. The minimal core LSQXXF(S/T) consensus was screened using the e-Motif search engine data base for domains with homology. The results from this screen suggest that a number of transcription-associated factors and viral oncogenes possess domains with homology to the IHD consensus and thus have the potential to associate with p300 via its IHD region..

The specific activity of the IHD miniprotein was measured using fractions of p53 protein purified from insect cell expression systems in which serine 20 phosphorylated pools of p53 (i.e. fraction 20; Fig. 2A) can be chromatographically separated from serine 20 unphosphorylated p53 (i.e. fraction 16; Fig. 2A). When equivalent amounts of total p53 protein (2.5 to 100 ng; fraction 16 or fraction 20) were adsorbed onto ELISA wells, and fixed amounts of IHD were added, p53-dependent binding to the IHD miniprotein was detected with an anti-His monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2, B and C). The serine 20 phosphorylated pool of p53 (fraction 20) bound more stably to the IHD miniprotein (from 5 to 7 RLU; Fig. 1C) when compared with unphosphorylated p53 (fraction 16), which bound weaker to IHD (from 0.7 to 1 RLU; Fig. 1B). A titration of the IHD miniprotein into ELISA wells containing fixed amounts of p53 in the solid phase also demonstrated more stable complex binding to serine 20 phosphorylated p53 (fraction 20 versus fraction 16, 10 versus 3 RLU, respectively; Fig. 2D). As a control for p53 protein fractions 16 and 20 normalization, the antibody DO-1 (which contacts p53 within the MDM2-binding site (Fig. 3A)) bound to p53 (fractions 16 and 20) to similar extents (800 RLU; Fig. 2E). Further, the antibody DO-1 bound to p53 with a relative affinity 50-fold higher than the IHD miniprotein (compare the RLU at saturating protein levels ( > 40 ng)), which is consistent with the known high affinity of the mAb DO-1 for its epitope. Together, these data indicate that purified forms of the IHD miniprotein show binding to p53 that can in turn be stabilized further by the phospho-serine 20 residue..

These data suggest that DNA binding changes the conformation of p53 to permit a more stable docking of p300 to p53.

We tested whether the purified IHD miniprotein bound more stably to p53 in the presence of consensus site DNA. A titration of consensus site DNA into an ELISA reaction containing fixed amounts of p53 in the solid phase stimulated IHD-p53 protein complex formation (Fig. 2, F and G). These data suggest that the reason DNA stabilizes the p300:p53 complex can be attributed, at least in part, to an enhanced affinity of the IHD miniprotein for the LXXLL activation domain in p53.

MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 (Fig. 3B, lane 2 versus lane 1) is unaffected by a control antibody that binds to denatured p53 (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 to 8). By contrast, a titration of IHD results in inhibition of MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 (Fig. 3B, lanes 9 to 12). In vivo ubiquitination of p53 catalyzed by MDM2 (Fig. 3C, lanes 4 and 5 versus lanes 2 and 3) can also be attenuated by IHD in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D, lanes 2 to 4 versus lane 1). Together, these data identify three biochemical properties of the IHD miniprotein (amino acids 401 to 566), suggestive of its ability to interact with the LXXLL transactivation domain of p53 tetramers: (i) enhanced affinity for serine 20 phosphorylated p53 tetramers; (ii) DNA-stimulated IHD-p53 tetramer complex stabilization; and (iii) sterical occlusion of MDM2 from the p53 transactivation domain and inhibition of MDM2-catalyzed ubiquitination..

This was required to determine which region of the 17-kDa IHD miniprotein was primarily responsible for LXXLL binding activity, especially in comparison with its homology domain in the C terminus, IBiD. The IBiD domain of p300 was localized to a 46-amino-acid fragment that has homology to the extreme N terminus of IHD (Fig. 1B). The GAL4-VP16 in vivo two-hybrid assay was used to evaluate the specific activity of the IHD miniprotein fragments, rather than in vitro-specific activity, since expression of the IHD deletion fragments from Escherichia coli proved relatively difficult (data not shown). In comparing the in vivo-specific activity of the IHD miniprotein and its deletion derivatives for LXXLL-containing peptides, two other peptide-binding domains were evaluated: (i) IBiD, which binds to phosphorylated activation domain fragments from IRF-3 as well as non-phosphorylated fragments of other activation domains (12) and (ii) SPC-1 (site for proline contact (10), a C-terminal minidomain of p300 containing only half of the C/H3 domain and amino acid sequences without the classic C/H3 domain) that was identified previously as having LXXLL peptide binding activity despite lacking the N-terminal 56 amino acids of the standard C/H3 domain (164 amino acids in length). As a control for the two-hybrid assay, MyoD fused to VP16 displayed affinity for its peptide sequence in inhibitor of DNA binding when fused to GAL4 (Fig. 4B), whereas the LXXLL peptide from p53 bound weakly to MyoD (Fig. 4B). Under the conditions used in the in vivo two-hybrid assay, the IHD miniprotein (401 to 566) was the most active under these conditions toward the LXXLL peptide from the entire p53 activation domain (Fig. 4C) and lower activity to the LXXLL peptide in a very short sequence from the LXXLL activation domain of p53 (Fig. 4C)..

The most extreme deletion of the IHD miniprotein (amino acids 401 to 427) well into the motif with homology to IBiD (Fig. 1B) inactivates the LXXLL binding activity associated with the miniprotein (Fig. 4F). Interestingly, this region of IHD maps to the first helix in the IBiD domain required for IBiD activity (12) and suggests that the minimal IHD domain directly overlaps with a similar primary structure in IBiD, despite the fact that the entire 165-amino-acid fragment within IHD and IBiD share homology. The IHD miniprotein that retained the most significant activity was IHD-(401 to 475) (Fig. 4), thus localizing the major LXXLL peptide binding activity to the N-terminal half rather than the C-terminal region of the 17-kDa IHD miniprotein..

In this system, p300 can stimulate maximal p53-dependent transcription (Fig. 5A), which can be attenuated by transfection of increasing amounts of the IHD miniprotein encoding vector (amino acids 401 to 566) (Fig. 5B), consistent with its ability to bind to the p53 transactivation domain. Since IHD-(401 to 566) cannot bind to the proline-repeat domain (Fig. 4C), the ability of IHD to inhibit p53 activity is presumably not due to its binding to the proline-repeat transactivation domain, which can also contact p300 directly. Progressive deletions of IHD (401 to 533, 401 to 501, and 401 to 475) do not neutralize IHD activity as a p53 inhibitor (Fig. 5, C to E). However, deletions of IHD into the region with homology to the minimal IBiD fragment (IHD-(401 to 427)) lost activity as a p53 inhibitor (Fig. 5, G versus H). There were some differences in the specific activity of IHD miniprotein deletion variants as p53 inhibitors; for example, the IHD derivative (amino acids 401 to 501) was not as effective as a dominant negative inhibitor of p53 as other IHD derivatives (amino acids 401 to 475 and amino acids 401 to 553), especially at intermediate levels of gene transfected (Fig. 5D versus C and E). These data suggest that polypeptide fragments encoded from amino acids 476 to 501 can affect the specific activity of IHD as a p53-binding domain and/or that factors in vivo are binding to it in trans to the region and competing it away from p53..

The cotransfection of IHD (amino acids 401 to 566) attenuated p21 induction by co-transfected p300 and p53 (Fig. 6, lane 5 versus lane 4), whereas the IHD deletion derivative (IHD amino acids 401 to 427) that was inactive as a p53 inhibitor when p53 activity was measured from the p21-luciferase promoter (Fig. 5G) was also unable to attenuate p21 protein induction by p300 and p53 co-transfection (Fig. 6, lane 9). The other IHD derivatives attenuated p21 protein induction to different extents (Fig. 6, lanes 6 to 8), with the IHD fragment (amino acids 401 to 501) being the least effective inhibitor (Fig. 6, lane 7).

Interestingly, transfection of increasing amounts of IRF-1 protein is also able to stabilize p53PRO (Fig. 7B, lanes 2 to 4 versus lane 1). These data indicate that p53 activity can be uncoupled from the proline-repeat activation domain, presumably by the ability of IRF-1 to enhance p300 contact with the LXXLL activation domain in p53, which in turn stabilizes and activates p53PRO. This hypothesis can be tested using the IHD miniprotein. If IRF-1 effects on activating p53PRO are due to the stabilization of the p300:LXXLL motif, then we would predict that IHD would block IRF-1 stimulatory effects. Maximal p53PRO activity from the p21-luciferase reporter induced by IRF-1 transfection (Fig. 7C, lane 3 versus lanes 2 and 1) can be attenuated by the 17-kDa IHD miniprotein (Fig. 7C, lanes 4 to 7 versus lane 3) as well as the 8-kDa IHD miniprotein (Fig. 7C, lanes 8 to 11 versus lane 3). The attenuation by IHD of IRF-1-dependent p53PRO activity (Fig. 7C) can also be linked to the destabilization by IHD of p53PRO protein levels in the presence of IRF-1 protein (Fig. 7D). Using fixed amounts of p53PRO and inhibitory levels of the IHD miniprotein (Fig. 7D, lanes 1 to 3), a titration of IRF-1 protein actually destabilizes p53PRO (Fig. 7D, lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 1). Using fixed amounts of p53PRO and the small IHD derivative (amino acids 401 to 475) (Fig. 7D, lanes 4 to 6), a titration of IRF-1 protein similarly destabilizes p53PRO (Fig. 7D, lanes 5 and 6 versus lane 3). These data suggest that the LXXLL activation domain is indeed the target of IRF-1 stabilization of p53PRO and that the minimal IHD miniprotein can contact the LXXLL domain of p53 in vivo..

It is generally held that such small peptides acquire helical structure when bound to the peptide-binding scaffold. Although our characterization of IHD indicates that it can bind to LXXLL-containing polypeptides, it is not yet clear whether the IHD miniprotein displays any sequence preference for the p53 sequence, LXXLL-containing peptides, or other alternate consensus sequences. We have previously used phage-peptide display as an in vitro method for identifying novel protein-protein interfaces in MDM2-p53 and p300:p53 complexes (10, 14). This technique has the advantage of fixing bait protein in a solid phase in a native conformation and incubating with a library containing random 12-mer peptides. The 17-kDa His-tagged IHD miniprotein was captured in the solid phase with an anti-His monoclonal antibody and incubated with phage libraries through three rounds of selection. Identical His-tagged bait capture methods identified proline repeat-containing peptides as preferentially enriched using full-length p300 (10). In this latter study, it was relatively surprising that LXXLL-containing peptides were not selected given the number of LXXLL-binding domains present in p300. When high affinity peptides were enriched after three rounds of selection, three general classes of peptides were identified. In the first class of peptides (Fig. 8A), a striking similarity in the peptides isolated to the p53 activation domain identified critical consensus site contacts for IHD into three small motifs across the activation domain: PLSQ, T(F/Y)S, and SXLXXL. These data suggest that the IHD miniprotein can display some relative specificity for p53 activation domain fragments, although other peptides with a match to this consensus can be identified using an e-motif search engine (Fig. 8D). A second class of peptides (Fig. 8B) showed less of a similarity than class I peptides but did display the retention of a Gln residue (which is critical for full-length p300 to contact the serine 20 phosphorylated p53 activation domain), a core (T/S)(F/W)(S/T)(D/E) motif, and an LXXL motif. The third class of peptides displayed less resemblance to p53 but maintained a Gln residue and a relatively loose consensus of (S/T)QXX(F/W/Y)(S/T)XXXXL.

MDM2 forms a component of a negative regulatory feedback pathway that promotes the ubiquitination of p53 and subsequent degradation of p53 through the proteasome (17). p300 competes for the same binding region as MDM2 present within the N-terminal LXXLL transactivation domain of p53. This co-activator protein forms part of a positive regulatory component that is essential for p53 required for p53 stabilization after DNA damage and induces its transcriptional responses. p300-catalyzed acetylation of native p53 tetramers requires two associated events: p300 docking to the two contiguous LXXLL and PXXP/PXP activation domains of p53 and sequence-specific DNA to function as an allosteric activator by removing conformational constraints on p53 acetylation. It is not known how p300 docks to the p53 tetramer, whether it involves one or more of the peptide-binding domains of p300 including C/H1, C/H3, IBiD, IHD, SPC-1, or SPC-2, and whether a rearrangement of the p300:p53 complex occurs after acetylation to stabilize the p300-bromo domain binding to the acetylated p53 residue. Such a rearrangement or an allosteric mechanism appears to operate since a small peptide derived from IRF-1:p300 interface can bind p300 and stimulate in trans the enzymatic activity of p300 (22)..

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	50	As a means to begin answering these questions, in this report, we have fine-mapped one p53 docking site on p300, named IHD, and provided evidence that this minidomain of p300 is a bona fide polypeptide-binding domain that possesses an intrinsic ability to bind to peptides with homology to the p53 LXXLL activation domain. One key feature of the IHD miniprotein is that it mimics full-length p300 in its stabilization by phosphorylation at the serine 20 residue (Fig. 2). Although serine 20 phosphorylation function was originally thought to be in the reduction of MDM2-binding to p53, biophysical studies have demonstrated that serine 20 phosphorylation has no impact on MDM2 binding (15). Rather, this phosphorylation stabilizes p300-binding to p53, and as an indirect consequence, prevents MDM2 binding to p53 (23). Genetic studies have shown that mutation of the serine 20 residue in cell lines or in mice models attenuates p53 apoptotic activity (24, 25), suggesting that phosphorylation at this residue is important for p53 function. Further mutation of the equivalent serine 20 residue in murine p53 or knockout of the known serine 20 kinase, CHK2, have the same phenotype in mice; p53 protein can still be stabilized by irradiation but has a lower specific activity as transcription factor or apoptotic inducer (21, 25). These genetic data can be reinterpreted to suggest that the role of serine 20 phosphorylation is to stabilize p300 binding based on the following data. (i) p53 activity is attenuated by serine 20 phosphopeptide mimetics that bind to and neutralize p300 (9); (ii) full-length p300 is stabilized by phosphorylation of the p53 activation domain at serine 20 (9); and (iii) serine 20 phosphopeptides can block DNA-dependent acetylation of p53 by p300 (11). In this report, we show that the minimal IHD miniprotein can bind preferentially to full-length p53 tetramers that are phosphorylated at serine 20 and that IHD binding can be further stimulated in binding to p53 by consensus site DNA (Fig. 2). This mimics full-length p300 properties and suggests that the IHD domain may be an important component of p53 stabilization to p300 after DNA damage via CHK2 phosphorylation at serine 20..

One key feature of the IHD miniprotein is that it mimics full-length p300 in its stabilization by phosphorylation at the serine 20 residue (Fig. 2). Although serine 20 phosphorylation function was originally thought to be in the reduction of MDM2-binding to p53, biophysical studies have demonstrated that serine 20 phosphorylation has no impact on MDM2 binding (15). Rather, this phosphorylation stabilizes p300-binding to p53, and as an indirect consequence, prevents MDM2 binding to p53 (23). Genetic studies have shown that mutation of the serine 20 residue in cell lines or in mice models attenuates p53 apoptotic activity (24, 25), suggesting that phosphorylation at this residue is important for p53 function. Further mutation of the equivalent serine 20 residue in murine p53 or knockout of the known serine 20 kinase, CHK2, have the same phenotype in mice; p53 protein can still be stabilized by irradiation but has a lower specific activity as transcription factor or apoptotic inducer (21, 25). These genetic data can be reinterpreted to suggest that the role of serine 20 phosphorylation is to stabilize p300 binding based on the following data. (i) p53 activity is attenuated by serine 20 phosphopeptide mimetics that bind to and neutralize p300 (9); (ii) full-length p300 is stabilized by phosphorylation of the p53 activation domain at serine 20 (9); and (iii) serine 20 phosphopeptides can block DNA-dependent acetylation of p53 by p300 (11). In this report, we show that the minimal IHD miniprotein can bind preferentially to full-length p53 tetramers that are phosphorylated at serine 20 and that IHD binding can be further stimulated in binding to p53 by consensus site DNA (Fig. 2). This mimics full-length p300 properties and suggests that the IHD domain may be an important component of p53 stabilization to p300 after DNA damage via CHK2 phosphorylation at serine 20..
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	52	Based on previous data, it was suggested that p300 minidomains such as IBiD do not necessarily prefer a specific polypeptide primary amino acid sequence. Our work using phagepeptide display suggests that IHD can prefer a specific peptide sequence. To find novel high affinity ligands for IHD domain, we screened phage display peptide libraries for IHD-binding phage and sequenced a series of clones encoding 12-mer peptides. The peptide sequences showed surprisingly good homology with the previously established p300-binding domain on p53 (14 to 25 amino acids), confirming that the peptide PLSQETFSDLWKLLP region is crucial for the interaction between p300 and p53 and that IHD can be responsible for stabilizing p300:p53 complexes that are transcriptionally competent. Underlined residues represent the match of the phasepeptides to the p53 activation domain. The selection for the three submotif-containing peptides (LSQ... FS... L... L) is not common in our experience of this technique and therefore not due to the overenrichment or "stickiness" of this peptide class in the phage library. For example, using full-length p300, we enriched proline-repeat peptides (PXXP), using DAPK3, we enriched p21-like peptides (RKKXT), and using ligand-complexed MDM2, we enriched a variety of peptides with little homology to the p53 activation domain (10, 14, 18). Further, using ligand-free MDM2 as a control, we did acquire peptides with homology to the p53 activation domain but with the consensus TFXXXWXXL that fits with the known contacts in the MDM2-p53 activation domain structure (14)..

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	54	Another advantage of phage-peptide display is that peptide consensus sequences developed can be used to identify novel binding partners. We have used this to identify HSP90 as a novel MDM2-binding protein that controls p53 unfolding and have identified novel cell cycle substrates of the interferon-induced kinase DAPK3 (14, 18). Further, the proline-repeat peptides pulled out using p300 as a bait (10) identified a large panel of LXXLL containing transcription factors that, like p53, have flanking LXXLL motifs of a contiguous PXXP or PXPXP motif in their transactivation domain. In examining the IHD consensus peptides for homology to other proteins in the databases, there are several other interesting transcription factors and viral onco-proteins that possess IHD consensus sites that could potentially interact also with p300 through this docking site domain. These proteins include oncogenic Ras-related Rab 721, cyclin G, CHK2, SV40 large T antigen, DNA and RNA polymerases, Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 6 (EBNA-6), and more (Fig. 8). The result that large T-antigen could potentially bind p300 via IHD is of great interest since p53 responses are abrogated in the presence of T-antigen and SV40 infection culminates in the degradation of p53 and loss of proliferative control (19), thereby supporting the notion that T-antigen has another mechanism of disrupting the critical activities of tumor suppressor proteins. In fact, T-antigen was reported to bind to p300 (20), and this may be mediated in part through the IHD domain..

Gel retardation assays revealed that the three proteins had varying effects on p53 binding to these substrates. HMG-1 did not influence p53 binding to Holliday junctions or 3-cytosine bulges. HMG I(Y) rapidly dissociated p53 complexes with Holliday junctions but not 3-cytosine bulges. Finally, the mismatch repair protein complex, hMSH2 to hMSH6, enhanced p53 binding to both substrates by 3 to 4-fold.

When cells are exposed to UV and X irradiation, there is an accumulation and activation of p53 (reviewed in 1 to 3) which results in the downstream transactivation of several genes whose products assist in the maintenance of genomic integrity (4,5). However, the exact mechanism of p53 activation following DNA damage is not clear. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation appear to play an important role in this process (6,7). Additionally, the transcriptional response of p53 requires tetramerization and this could be influenced by several factors (8). Finally, p53 activity could be altered by interactions with other proteins. Indeed, p53 has been shown to associate in vitro and in vivo with a number of proteins involved in DNA metabolic processes such as repair [XPB, XPD (9) and WRN (10)], replication [DNA polymerase (11) and RPA (12)] and recombination [hRad51 (13)]..

0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	7	Although the p53 response to DNA damage is largely mediated by downstream proteins, there is increasing evidence that p53 can directly interact with DNA lesions. p53 can bind single strand and double strand breaks (14), three-stranded DNA structures (15,16), extra base bulges (17) and several base/base mismatches in DNA (18). Additionally, we have shown that p53 binds with extremely high affinity to Holliday junctions (16). All of these lesions occur as a result of typical recombination, replication and repair processes as well as DNA damage caused by environmental factors. For example, Holliday junctions are natural intermediates of homologous recombination; however, high levels of sister chromatid exchange following irradiation suggests the formation of these structures due to DNA damage (19). Replication of molecules containing thymidine dimers could result in the insertion of additional nucleotides opposite the existing lesion. Additionally, when two similar DNA molecules with a few non-identical bases undergo recombination, regions of extra base bulges and mismatches can be left behind. Replication errors can also lead to the generation of mismatches and extra base bulges in DNA. All of these lesions need to be repaired for cell cycle progression to occur. The high affinity of p53 to several of these lesions strongly points to an important role in damage recognition as well as downstream repair and recombination pathways. Thus, p53 response to lesions in DNA caused by normal metabolic processes and DNA damaging agents may be 2-fold: first, to transactive downstream genes that enable cell cycle arrest or apoptosis and, secondly, to recognize and bind these lesions to signal repair pathways..

0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	9	The importance of p53 DNA binding (both sequence dependent for transactivation and sequence independent for lesion recognition) suggests that this activity is tightly regulated by a number of factors to ensure proper p53 function at the correct times during the cell cycle. p53 DNA binding activity is affected by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation and sumolation (reviewed in 20). Binding by the monoclonal antibody, pAB421 (21,22), as well as interaction with single strand DNA (23) activates sequence-specific DNA binding. The identification of several cellular and viral proteins that associate with p53 suggests that protein to protein interactions play an important role in the regulation of its DNA binding activity. This is further supported by the demonstration that Ref-1 is a potent activator of p53 DNA binding activity (24). Additionally, Jayaraman et al. (25) have shown that the high mobility group (HMG) protein HMG-1 stimulates sequence-specific p53 DNA binding..

0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	11	The HMG proteins are among the largest group of non-histone chromatin proteins. HMG proteins can be classified into three groups: the HMG-1/2, HMG I(Y) and HMG-14/17 families (reviewed in 26). The exact cellular functions of these proteins are not fully understood. They are architectural elements that bind unusual structures in DNA and have low sequence specificity. The HMG-1/2 family is the most abundant of this group of proteins. They interact with DNA through two conserved DNA binding domains known as the HMG boxes (27,28) and preferentially bind DNA structures that contain sharp angles such as cruciforms, four-way junctions (29) as well as cisplatin-DNA adducts (30,31). The HMG I(Y) proteins contain A-T hook domains that serve as DNA binding motifs and can recognize four-way junctions (32). Both groups of proteins can induce bends in linear DNA templates as well as introduce supercoils in topologically constrained molecules (33). There is growing evidence that these proteins may represent a new class of chaperone factors that can facilitate the interactions of other proteins with their respective target sequence. For example, HMG-1 induces a structural change in the target sequence of the progesterone receptor, thus facilitating protein binding (34). Additionally, HMG I(Y) has been shown to regulate long range enhancer-dependent transcription by altering DNA topology (35). Finally, as mentioned above, HMG-1 can enhance sequence-specific binding of p53 (25). Thus, this group of proteins seems to enable the  loading  of other proteins on their target sequences. The ability of the HMG group proteins to recognize unusual DNA structures and their influence on various protein to DNA interactions, as well as the fact that HMG-1 stimulates the sequence-specific binding of p53, makes them good candidates for factors that might affect the lesion binding properties of p53. Thus, it was critical to ask whether any of these HMG proteins influences p53 recognition of DNA damage. In this study, the effects of two HMG group proteins, HMG-1 and HMG I(Y), on p53 binding to DNA lesions were examined. Two different substrates, one containing three 3-cytosine bulges and the other resembling Holliday junctions, were used to monitor the effect of these HMG proteins on p53 DNA binding activity by gel retardation assays..

They interact with DNA through two conserved DNA binding domains known as the HMG boxes (27,28) and preferentially bind DNA structures that contain sharp angles such as cruciforms, four-way junctions (29) as well as cisplatin-DNA adducts (30,31). The HMG I(Y) proteins contain A-T hook domains that serve as DNA binding motifs and can recognize four-way junctions (32). Both groups of proteins can induce bends in linear DNA templates as well as introduce supercoils in topologically constrained molecules (33). There is growing evidence that these proteins may represent a new class of chaperone factors that can facilitate the interactions of other proteins with their respective target sequence. For example, HMG-1 induces a structural change in the target sequence of the progesterone receptor, thus facilitating protein binding (34). Additionally, HMG I(Y) has been shown to regulate long range enhancer-dependent transcription by altering DNA topology (35). Finally, as mentioned above, HMG-1 can enhance sequence-specific binding of p53 (25). Thus, this group of proteins seems to enable the  loading  of other proteins on their target sequences. The ability of the HMG group proteins to recognize unusual DNA structures and their influence on various protein to DNA interactions, as well as the fact that HMG-1 stimulates the sequence-specific binding of p53, makes them good candidates for factors that might affect the lesion binding properties of p53. Thus, it was critical to ask whether any of these HMG proteins influences p53 recognition of DNA damage. In this study, the effects of two HMG group proteins, HMG-1 and HMG I(Y), on p53 binding to DNA lesions were examined. Two different substrates, one containing three 3-cytosine bulges and the other resembling Holliday junctions, were used to monitor the effect of these HMG proteins on p53 DNA binding activity by gel retardation assays..

Both can recognize extra base bulges and Holliday junctions in vitro (16,17,37,38). Both proteins can inhibit DNA recombination when they encounter DNA lesions both in vivo and in vitro (39,40). Additionally, these proteins play an important role in genome maintenance by interacting with other repair and replication factors. The relevance of p53 lesion recognition events within the cell was demonstrated by comparing the effect of the HMG proteins on the DNA binding activity of hMSH2 to hMSH6. Our results indicate that HMG I(Y) can effectively compete with p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 for Holliday junction binding. However, HMG I(Y) had no effect on p53 binding to 3-cytosine bulges while dissociating hMSH2 to hMSH6 complexes with the same substrate. On the other hand, it was found that hMSH2 to hMSH6 had a stimulatory effect on p53 binding to both Holliday junctions and 3-cytosine bulges. Thus, p53 lesion binding activity can be modulated in different ways negative regulation is seen with HMG I(Y) and positive with hMSH2 to hMSH6..

Gel retardation assays were performed using the same conditions as the HMG-1 reactions. p53 was added at a 1:10 ratio of DNA to tetramers and the molar ratio of p53 to HMG I(Y) ranged from 1:0.1 to 1:2. As shown in Figure 2A, in the absence of HMG I(Y), p53 bound with high affinity to Holliday junction probes (lane 2). HMG I(Y) also bound to Holliday junction probes (lane 8) as well as the duplex probe (lane 14) albeit at a lower level than the four-way junctions. HMG I(Y)/Holliday junction complexes have a higher mobility than the p53 complexes, thus allowing clear distinction between the two protein to DNA species. When p53 and HMG I(Y) were incubated together with the Holliday junction probe, there was a decrease in the specific p53/DNA complexes as increasing amounts of HMG I(Y) were added (lanes 3 to 7). Addition of 20 nM HMG I(Y) caused an almost complete elimination of the p53/Holliday junction complexes. As seen in Figure 2A, multiple HMG I(Y)/DNA complexes were detected when higher amounts of this protein were added (lanes 7 and 8). It is likely that at this concentration, the template is saturated by HMG I(Y) making it unavailable for p53. However, when 10 nM HMG I(Y) was added (which represents a equimolar ratio of protein to DNA), unbound probe was seen on the gel, indicating that there was substrate available for binding, yet p53/DNA complexes were reduced by 20%. These results suggest an active dissociation of the p53/Holliday junction interactions by HMG I(Y)..

The presence of three 3-cytosine bulges could result in a severe kink in duplex DNA and it has been shown that the HMG proteins tend to bind distortions in DNA (48). To determine whether HMG I(Y) has any effect on p53 binding to other recombination by-products, DNA molecules were designed such that they contain three 3-cytosine bulges separated by 3 bp on one of the strands (see Materials and Methods). Gel retardation assays were performed using the same ratios of p53 and HMG I(Y) as used with the Holliday junction probe (Fig. 3A). Complexes between p53 and the 3-cytosine bulge were detected in the absence of HMG I(Y) (lane 2). However, upon addition of HMG I(Y), these complexes remained either unchanged or showed a slight increase. The complexes were quantified, normalized to the value that was detected in the absence of HMG I(Y) and plotted as a function of HMG I(Y) concentration (Fig. 3B). These results show that HMG I(Y) did not significantly influence p53 interactions with the 3-cytosine bulge probe and complex formation remained fairly constant across the range of HMG I(Y) tested. In fact, a slight increase was detected at some of the concentrations tested. HMG I(Y) can bind on its own to the 3-cytosine bulge probe (lane 3); however, since this probe is smaller than the Holliday junction template, these complexes do not effectively separate from the free probe. Therefore, it is likely that HMG I(Y) interacts with the 3-cytosine bulges in a manner that does not affect p53 binding to these substrates..
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	37	HMG I(Y) does not affect the interaction of p53 with 3-cytosine bulges We previously showed that p53 binds substrates containing single and multiple 3-cytosine bulges. The presence of three 3-cytosine bulges could result in a severe kink in duplex DNA and it has been shown that the HMG proteins tend to bind distortions in DNA (48). To determine whether HMG I(Y) has any effect on p53 binding to other recombination by-products, DNA molecules were designed such that they contain three 3-cytosine bulges separated by 3 bp on one of the strands (see Materials and Methods). Gel retardation assays were performed using the same ratios of p53 and HMG I(Y) as used with the Holliday junction probe (Fig. 3A). Complexes between p53 and the 3-cytosine bulge were detected in the absence of HMG I(Y) (lane 2). However, upon addition of HMG I(Y), these complexes remained either unchanged or showed a slight increase. The complexes were quantified, normalized to the value that was detected in the absence of HMG I(Y) and plotted as a function of HMG I(Y) concentration (Fig. 3B). These results show that HMG I(Y) did not significantly influence p53 interactions with the 3-cytosine bulge probe and complex formation remained fairly constant across the range of HMG I(Y) tested. In fact, a slight increase was detected at some of the concentrations tested. HMG I(Y) can bind on its own to the 3-cytosine bulge probe (lane 3); however, since this probe is smaller than the Holliday junction template, these complexes do not effectively separate from the free probe.

To determine whether HMG I(Y) affects hMSH2 to hMSH6 binding activity, gel retardation assays were performed using Holliday junction probes and the two proteins. As seen in Figure 4A, hMSH2 to hMSH6 (1:10 molar ratio of DNA to heterodimers) showed strong binding to the Holliday junction probes (lane 2). A low level of binding was also seen with the duplex control (lane 9) which is expected as hMSH2 to hMSH6 has been shown to exhibit some non-specific DNA binding (42). Addition of increasing amounts of HMG I(Y) resulted in a decrease in the hMSH2 to hMSH6/DNA complexes (Fig. 4A) and the dissociation curve of these complexes resembled that seen with p53 (compare Figs 2C and 4B). Complexes were reduced to 50% with the addition of 20 nM of HMG I(Y) at all concentrations of hMSH2 to hMSH6 tested. Further, it was found that HMG I(Y) also caused a dissociation of hMSH2 to hMSH6 binding to the 3-cytosine bulge which is a preferred target lesion for this repair protein (Fig. 4B). hMSH2 to hMSH6/DNA complexes with both probes were quantified, normalized to complex formation in the absence of HMG I(Y) and plotted as a function of HMG I(Y) concentration (Fig. 4B). It was found that the rate of dissociation of the 3-cytosine bulge complexes was slightly slower than those with the Holliday junction probe. Thus, while the HMG I(Y) effect on p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 binding is similar for the Holliday junction template, it is quite different with the 3-cytosine bulge substrate..

These results imply that HMG I(Y) has a higher affinity for Holliday junctions than the other two proteins or places the DNA in a conformation unfavorable for p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 binding. It is also possible that the latter proteins are more labile and readily associate and dissociate with DNA. To further explore the nature of p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 complexes with four-way junctions and 3-cytosine bulges, the interaction between these proteins on the two probes was tested. In gel retardation assays the two proteins show different mobilities, so the respective complexes could be easily distinguished (Fig. 5A, compare lane 3 with lane 6). When both proteins were present, hMSH2 to hMSH6 promoted p53 binding to the Holliday junction (compare lane 3 with 8, lane 4 with 9 and lane 5 with 10).

On the other hand, in the presence of p53, there is a decrease in the hMSH2 to hMSH6/DNA complexes (compare lane 6 with lane 10). Free probe was detected in reactions containing both proteins, indicating that the loss of hMSH2 to hMSH6 complexes is due to dissociation by p53 and not lack of substrate DNA.

Holliday junctions can adopt two different conformations the stacked X structure and the square open form. In the presence of divalent cations, the four-way junctions adopt the stacked X conformation with 60 degrees  and 120 degrees  angles between the arms, whereas in the absence of divalent cations the junctions are in the square open form with 90 degrees  angles between the arms. HMG I(Y) has been shown to preferentially bind the open form of the four-way junction and maintain the junctions in this configuration (50). Previous studies from our laboratory have suggested that p53 may prefer to bind the DNA in the stacked X conformation as opposed to the open form (16). This was determined by electron microscopy where a large percent of the protein bound Holliday junctions adopted a conformation resembling the stacked X structure. HMG I(Y) binding could be causing a conformation change in the Holliday junction making it an unfavorable substrate for p53. Our studies also show that HMG I(Y) can dissociate p53/Holliday junction complexes that have been pre-formed. It is possible that p53 actively associates and dissociates from the junction crossover and, when dissociated, HMG I(Y) could rapidly bind the junction, altering its conformation, thus preventing p53 re-association.

Four-way junction substrates were used to mimic linker DNA near the entrance and exit points of nucleosomes and histone H1 was shown to bind with high affinity to these structures. However, when HMG I(Y) was added there was an active dissociation of H1 from these templates (47). It was suggested that since HMG I(Y) plays an important role in genetic recombination and retroviral integration, it dissociates H1 from these structures to allow recombination events to proceed. This may occur by direct recruitment of proteins for junction resolution or HMG I(Y) may act as a marker to signify the location of the four-way junction. Displacement of p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 from Holliday junctions by HMG I(Y) may occur for similar reasons. In the event of DNA damage by environmental factors there is an increase in the formation of four-way junctions due to illegitimate sister chromatid exchange. In the cell, p53, hMSH2 to hMSH6 and HMG I(Y) can bind to these four-way structures. We recognize that initial recognition of lesions would primarily be carried out by hMSH2 to hMSH6 and p53 interactions with such sites of damage may provide a backup mechanism for signaling repair. The HMG proteins are more abundant in cells, hence, HMG I(Y) dissociation of p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 from certain lesions or structures would be expected to dominate. However, following DNA damaging events the levels and stability of p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 may alter, causing changes in the HMG I(Y) effect. Genetic studies altering HMG protein levels may be complicated to interpret with regard to, for example, p53-mediated genomic stability or hMSH2 to hMSH6 catalyzed repair, due to the multiple pathways that are involved.

The ability of p53 to form more stable complexes with DNA may require the protein to be post-translationally modified. Several studies have shown that p53 binding properties are modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation. Purified p53 used in these studies was obtained from baculovirus-infected insect cells and was determined to be phosphorylated on at least one site. Further phosphorylation and/or acetylation may result in conformation changes in p53 that will enable more stable binding. Indeed, as mentioned above, p53 binding to lesions may function to bring the protein in close proximity to various kinases. Studies are currently underway in our laboratory to test the effect of phosphorylating various serine residues with specific kinases on the lesion binding properties of p53. It should be noted that in the presence of hMSH2 to hMSH6, p53 complexes with lesions is enhanced, suggesting that protein interactions in the vicinity of the lesion dictate DNA binding rather than the lability of p53..
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	58	While p53/DNA lesion complexes form with high affinity it is possible that the protein is quite labile on the DNA, thus HMG I(Y) is readily able to dissociate these interactions. The ability of p53 to form more stable complexes with DNA may require the protein to be post-translationally modified. Several studies have shown that p53 binding properties are modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation. Purified p53 used in these studies was obtained from baculovirus-infected insect cells and was determined to be phosphorylated on at least one site. Further phosphorylation and/or acetylation may result in conformation changes in p53 that will enable more stable binding.

The increase in p53 complexes also results in a concomitant decrease of the hMSH2 to hMSH6 complexes with the same substrate. This reduction was seen even when molar excesses of hMSH2 to hMSH6 were added to the reactions (data not shown). Additionally, when hMSH2 to hMSH6 was pre-incubated with the substrates followed by the addition of p53, enhancement of the p53/DNA complexes was observed (data not shown). Similar effects were seen with the 3-cytosine bulge template that is a preferred substrate for hMSH2 to hMSH6. Hence it appears that hMSH2 to hMSH6 is also able to load p53 on the 3-cytosine bulge substrate. It is possible that p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 interact with each other at the lesion sites. However, if this were the case, we would expect a novel band containing a ternary complex with both proteins to appear on the gel retardation assays. No such complexes were detected in the presence of both proteins with either probe used. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation assays did not reveal any interaction between the two proteins in solution (data not shown). Thus, hMSH2 to hMSH6 appears to be either recruiting p53 to lesion sites or stabilizing p53/DNA interactions in some manner. This may occur to ensure that the lesion is signaled to the necessary downstream proteins and cell cycle arrest or apoptosis pathways are executed..

Here we report the statistical analysis of the effect of PRIMA-1 on a panel of human tumor cell lines using information available in a database at the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). We extracted growth inhibition profiles for PRIMA-1 and 44 known anticancer agents, p53 status of cell lines, population doubling time, and level of p53 protein expression from the NCI database. The data were analyzed by linear regression, Wilcoxon matched pairs test, and cluster analysis. In a subset of human cell lines derived from colon, ovarian, renal, and non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, the level of mutant p53 expression correlated with cell population doubling time, r = -0.53, P = 0.018. The GI50 values for PRIMA-1 correlated with levels of mutant p53, r = -0.75, P = 0.0002. PRIMA-1 showed a statistically significant preference at P = 0.04 for growth inhibition of tumor cell lines expressing mutant p53 as compared with lines expressing wild-type p53. In contrast, none of several known anticancer drugs showed such preference. PRIMA-1 inhibited the growth of cell lines derived from various human tumor types in a mutant p53-dependent manner. This distinguishes PRIMA-1 from known anticancer drugs and supports the idea that PRIMA-1 can serve as a lead for the development of novel therapeutic compounds..

We therefore used mutant p53 levels as a seed in the Compare program to search the diversity set of the NCI library. The variance parameter was set to 0.05. Analysis of GI50 patterns of all mutant p53-carrying cell lines in the database revealed several compounds in the diversity set that showed a correlation between mutant p53 expression levels and sensitivity.

Growth inhibition profiles   The correlation between mutant p53 expression levels and GI50 value for PRIMA-1 was statistically significant (r = -0.75, P = 0.0002; Figure 1). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between PRIMA-1 sensitivity and wild-type p53 expression levels (r = 0.18, P = 0.51). We also observed an association between levels of mutant p53 expression and cell population doubling time (r = -0.53, P = 0.018; Figure 1). Wild-type p53 expression levels did not correlate with population doubling time (r = -0.16, P = 0.57). Since cell proliferation rate correlated with mutant p53 levels, we tested whether there was any association between sensitivity to PRIMA-1 and cell population doubling time. Regression analysis revealed r = 0.26, P = 0.29 for mutant p53-carrying lines and r = 0.07, P = 0.79 for wild-type p53-carrying lines (Figure 1).

In other words, how unique is the observed association between mutant p53 levels and sensitivity to PRIMA-1? The results of the regression analysis are presented in Table II. Although some drugs showed a correlation between mutant p53 expression levels and sensitivity, the correlations were in general weaker than for PRIMA-1. The drug Ftorafur had the highest correlation coefficient with levels of mutant p53 expression after PRIMA-1 (r = -0.64, P = 0.003), but a strong association with cell population doubling time (r = 0.51, P = 0.03) was also observed. Population doubling time could be an important factor determining sensitivity of cells to treatment with drugs that interfere with DNA/RNA synthesis (Table II). Drugs that showed correlation between GI50 value and population doubling time included 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, dichlorallyl lawsone, aminopterin derivative, paclitaxel, dolastatin 10, busulfan and mitomycin C. The correlations between GI50 values and p53 levels were positive for wild-type p53-expressing cell lines but negative for mutant p53-expressing lines. Thus, cells overexpressing wild-type p53 appear to be more resistant to treatment with a variety of drugs as compared with cells expressing low levels of wild-type p53. Statistically significant correlations were observed for cyclocytidine, ara-C, and 2'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine, and for all topoisomerase I inhibitors and mitomycin C. The GI50 values correlated with population doubling time in cell lines carrying wild-type p53. Hence, rapidly proliferating cells with wild-type p53 status were more sensitive to the treatment with drugs such as thiopurine, macbecin II, PALA, dichlorallyl lawsone, deoxydoxorubicin, and N,N-dibenzyl daunomycin..

For the other drugs tested, resistance was associated with activity of the MDR (multidrug resistance) gene and with expression of different growth factors.

In this study, we have analyzed sensitivity to PRIMA-1 in human tumor cell lines using available information from the database at NCI.

However, these compounds did not score in our cellular screening assay (1). There are several possible reasons for this discrepancy. First, our cellular screening assay was designed to identify compounds that were active in the presence of mutant p53 but inactive in p53 null cells. Therefore, compounds whose activity correlates with mutant p53 levels may not necessarily score in our assay. This may also explain why PRIMA-1 did not show the best correlation between sensitivity to treatment and mutant p53 expression levels among the compounds in the diversity set..

This was apparently the case for NSC321206 and NSC150117 that scored at ranking positions 2 and 3, respectively, in our in silico search but were toxic in a mutant p53-independent manner in our cellular screening (V.Bykov, unpublished data).

This is consistent with previous studies showing that some p53 mutants have a growth stimulatory activity (16,17), which might at least in part be due to their ability to induce illegitimate expression of growth promoting genes like c-myc, NF-B, PCNA, and others (18 to 21). It is conceivable that only some mutant p53 proteins stimulate cell proliferation. Therefore, the correlation between mutant p53 levels and growth suppression by NSC117281 and other compounds that showed a similar correlation could simply reflect a preferential effect on rapidly dividing cells. In contrast, sensitivity to PRIMA-1 did not correlate with cell proliferation rate.

Of these agents, cisplatin (22) and 5-fluorouracil (8) have been shown to preferentially affect cells carrying wild-type p53. Only paclitaxel has some specificity towards cells expressing mutant p53 (7). This unusual property of paclitaxel has made it an important component of frontline and adjuvant treatment in a number of chemotherapeutic regimens used in the clinic today (23). Our analysis revealed that PRIMA-1 has an overall selectivity for mutant p53-carrying tumor cell lines. In this respect PRIMA-1 is superior to paclitaxel, which also has such selectivity, but not for all cancer types studied. However, paclitaxel showed a significant selectivity for mutant p53-carrying ovarian and renal carcinoma lines. PRIMA-1 was the only agent that showed a mutant p53-selective effect on lung and colon carcinoma lines. This is of importance in view of the fact that p53 mutations occur in almost 60% of lung carcinomas and around 50% of colon carcinomas (6). A similar selectivity for mutant p53-expressing lines was observed for melanoma, although only around 10% of melanomas carry p53 mutation (6). Finally, our analysis showed that 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin preferentially inhibited the growth of lines carrying wild-type p53, in agreement with previous studies (12)..

There is now a firm body of evidence supporting a transcriptionally independent activity of p53 as a functional, if not structural, homologue of the BH3-only proteins. Although this information adds another nuance to the mechanism by which p53 can induce apoptosis, further studies indicate that the apoptotic function of p53 represents only a part of its tumor suppressive activity. Although complicating our understanding of p53, these new insights may also provide some exciting new targets for the design of therapeutics that can reactivate p53 in cancers..

Although this information adds another nuance to the mechanism by which p53 can induce apoptosis, further studies indicate that the apoptotic function of p53 represents only a part of its tumor suppressive activity. Although complicating our understanding of p53, these new insights may also provide some exciting new targets for the design of therapeutics that can reactivate p53 in cancers..

This interest in p53 is engendered not by an essential role for p53 during normal growth and development, but by the contribution of p53 to tumor suppression. Loss or alterations in the function of p53 have been found in most human cancers, including the major epithelial malignancies that may soon be responsible for most deaths in the Western world (1,2). Understanding and treating these cancers has become a matter of some urgency, and the p53 pathway is an attractive candidate for the development of targeted cancer therapies. But can such therapies be successfully developed? Compared with the kinases, the most popular and successful cancer drug targets to date, p53 remains a more elusive quarry. Many functions have been ascribed to p53 that relate to activities as diverse as transcriptional activation, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, exonuclease activity, DNA repair and regulation of angiogenesis (3 to 6). The ability of p53 to signal a variety of growth inhibitory responses, including the induction of cell-cycle arrest, senescence, differentiation and apoptosis (7,8), establish a central role for p53 as a master regulator of tumor suppression (9). However, despite the efforts of many researchers over many years, the relative contributions of these activities to tumor suppression remain hotly disputed. Over the past few years even the most unassailable  truths  about p53 have been called into question, leaving us with the uncomfortable feeling that the more we learn, the less we know. Two examples of reasonably well-established facts about p53 that have recently become more complicated are the importance of p53 as a transcription factor and the role of apoptosis in tumor suppression, each of which we will discuss briefly in this review..

0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	8	Of all the activities of p53, none is more firmly accepted than the function of p53 as a transcription factor (10 to 12). Assembling into a tetramer, p53 shows sequence specific DNA binding activity through its central domain (Figure 1), and activates the expression of genes that contain p53 binding sites in their promoters by virtue of interactions of the N-terminal domain of p53 with the transcriptional machinery. Almost all tumor derived p53 mutants contain a point mutation within the DNA binding domain that prevents, or in some cases alters, the recognition of p53 binding sites. In general, p53 mutants expressed in tumors lose the ability to activate expression of the target genes that are responsive to wild-type p53 although they may acquire unique transcriptional activities not shared by the wild-type protein and this by itself suggests that the transcriptional function of p53 is likely to be important for tumor suppression. Identification of target genes that are activated by p53 has further supported this concept; of the hundreds of p53-inducible target genes that have been identified so far there is compelling evidence that several of these play a role in mediating the various downstream responses to p53. The p21Waf1/Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor was amongst the first of the p53 targets to be identified, and deletion of p21Waf1/Cip1 in a number of cell systems strongly abrogates the ability of p53 to induce a G1 cell-cycle arrest (13,14). More recently, the products of other transcriptional targets of p53 have been shown to play a role in mediating various p53 responses, including a large group of genes encoding proteins with apoptotic activity (3). Analysis of a number of these genes indicated that knocking out any one individually failed to protect the cells completely from p53-induced death, suggesting that the response reflects the combined effect of a number of targets. However, more recently, the BH3 domain protein PUMA has emerged as a promising candidate for a key p53-inducible apoptotic target (15,16). PUMA was shown to be critical for p53-mediated cell death in a number of cells and tissues, with knock-out or knock-down of PUMA resulting in a severely impeded to apoptosis (17,18) and in some models, enhancing tumor development (19). However, given the all-or-nothing threshold nature of the apoptotic response, it seems unwise to conclude that PUMA is the be-all and end-all to p53-induced apoptosis. Indeed, it is clear that in some cells types inactivation of other p53 target genes, like NOXA, has an equally profound effect on the apoptotic response (18,20). Taken together, it seems most likely that the coordinated activity of many of the p53-inducible apoptotic target genes will play a key role in governing the life and death decision in response to stresses that activate p53..

The p53 protein is a transcription factor that contains several well-defined domains. At the N-terminus are the transactivation domain and a proline-rich region, which is required for apoptotic function. Within the N-terminus are the interaction sites of p53 with components of the transcriptional machinery as well as ubiquitin ligase Mdm2. The central domain harbors the sequence specific DNA binding region, where most of the tumor associated mutations occur. This central region also contains binding sites for interaction with members of the Bcl2 protein family. The C-terminal region contains the oligomerization domain as well as nuclear localisation and export signals. Several sites within the N-terminal region have been shown to be phosphorylated and the C-terminal region contains numerous sites of modification which influence stability, localization and activity of p53..
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	11	  Despite the strong evidence supporting the role of p53 as a transcription factor, there has been consistent debate over whether p53 may also have transcriptionally independent activities. Certainly, p53 also shows transcriptional repressor functions that are strongly correlated with apoptosis (21 to 23). However, a number of early studies suggested that p53 may have an apoptotic function that is completely separate from the regulation of gene expression (24 to 27). An explanation for this activity has been provided very recently with the observation that following stress, a proportion of p53 appears to function outside the nucleus, in the cytoplasm or at the mitochondria, and that p53 can be found in association with several members of the Bcl2 family of proteins (28). The Bcl2 related proteins are the key components of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and fall into three main groups; those that can function to perturb mitochondrial membrane potential directly (Bax and Bak), the BH3-only proteins that directly or indirectly drive the activation of Bax and Bak, and the anti-apoptotic proteins that sequester pro-apoptotic family members and hold them inactive (such as Bcl2, BclxL and Mcl1). The BH3-only proteins are further divided into two groups; those that bind Bax and Bak directly to activate them (the  activators , such as Bim and Bid) and those that bind the anti-apoptotic family members to release the activators (the  enablers  like Bad and Bik) (29,30) (Figure 2). Unexpectedly, it would seem that p53 can function in a manner analogous to the BH3-only proteins, with evidence to support two broad, but not mutually exclusive, models. In the first, p53 functions like an  enabler  BH3 domain protein, interacting with the anti-apoptotic proteins and presumably releasing pro-apoptotic BH3 domain proteins to drive apoptosis (Figure 2A and B) (31). The second model is based on the recent observation that p53 can function in a manner more analogous to the  activator  BH3-only proteins, by directly activating the apoptotic function of Bax or Bak (Figure 2C and D) (32,33). In either case, the remarkable parallels in the function between p53 and the BH3-only proteins is not reflected by any obvious amino acid sequence similarity, although it is possible that parts of p53 adopt a similar structure to the BH3 domain. Interestingly, however, mutations in the DNA binding domain of p53 that are frequently found in tumors also prevent the interaction of p53 with BclxL (31), indicating that the loss of apoptotic activity of these mutants may derive from the concomitant failure to induce transcription and loss of this mitochondrial activity..

On the left, two possible roles for p53 as an  enabler  type BH3-only protein. In these models p53 is able to disrupt the interaction between anti-apoptotic proteins (such as BclxL, Bcl2 and Mcl1) and pro-apoptotic proteins. This could directly relieve the inhibition of Bax and Bak (A), or free  activator  type BH3 only proteins (Bid and Bim), which can then activate Bax and Bak (B). On the right, models in which p53 functions as an  activator  type BH3-only protein. Activation of Bax and Bak might involve binding and releasing them from interaction with the anti-apoptotic proteins (C). Alternatively, p53 itself may be held inactive by interaction with the anti-apoptotic proteins. In this case it is possible that other  enabler  BH3-only proteins like PUMA might be able to displace p53 from the anti-apoptotic proteins, thus allowing it to activate Bax/Bak (D). Note that although there is evidence to support each of the models, not all the interactions indicated in the Figure have been confirmed..
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	14	  Although in experimental systems the mitochondrial activity of p53 alone can be sufficient for cell death, it seems likely that under physiological conditions this function will cooperate with the ability of p53 to activate transcription of genes like PUMA to drive a full apoptotic response. Although it is possible that PUMA and mitochondrial p53 activate independent apoptotic signals that combine to push the cell over an apoptotic threshold, it is interesting to consider a closer relationship between these two p53 activities. One possibility is that the accumulation of mitochondrial p53 is an immediate response to stress, sensitizing the cells to further apoptotic signals like the expression of PUMA. Recent studies have shown that in mice subjected to DNA damage treatment, a rapid p53 mitochondrial translocation (which precedes p53 target gene activation) triggers an early wave of apoptosis, which is followed later by a second wave that is transcription dependent (34). In this study, mitochondrial p53 was found preferentially in radiosensitive organs or in cultured cells that respond to p53 by undergoing apoptosis, rather than a cell-cycle arrest. These results suggest that the ability to accumulate mitochondrial p53 may be a distinguishing feature between radiosensitive and radioresistant organs and a determinant of whether or not a cell will die in response to p53. However, another model has recently been proposed which intertwines the activity of p53 at the mitochondria and the function of PUMA even more closely (35). As mentioned earlier, p53 can interact with the pro-survival BH3 proteins like BclxL, and it is possible that this interaction serves to inhibit the  activator  function of p53. PUMA has a very high affinity for the pro-survival proteins and appears to function like an  enabler  BH3-only protein (36,37). Therefore, when expressed at sufficiently high levels, PUMA may be able to dissociate p53 from the pro-survival proteins and thereby drive the activation of apoptosis (Figure 2D). Clearly, this cannot be the only route through which PUMA functions, since PUMA induces apoptosis in p53-null cells too (15). However, it is likely that the principal role for PUMA is to release the  enabler  proteins (which would now encompass Bid, Bim and p53) from the anti-apoptotic proteins to drive the activation of Bax and Bak. This model nicely ties together the transcriptionally independent activity of p53 with the transcriptionally dependent activation of proteins like PUMA and suggests how the final apoptotic response may require both of these events..

0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	16	The ability of p53 to function at the mitochondria has also led to a reassessment of the consequences of how nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of p53 might be regulated. Rather intriguingly, this brings us back to considering one of the main negative regulators of p53 function, Mdm2. The role of Mdm2 in controlling p53 function is clear from numerous studies in cells and in mice, and stress-induced inhibition of Mdm2 function is key to the activation of p53 (38). Mdm2 binds to the N-terminal region of p53 that also contains the transcriptional activation domain (Figure 1), and this interaction of Mdm2 with p53 can block the binding of other components of the transcriptional machinery and inhibit the ability of p53 to activate transcription. Mdm2 can also directly repress transcription, in part through its ability to function as a ubiquitin ligase (E3) and ubiquitinate histones (39). This E3 activity of Mdm2 is also critically important for the ubiquitination of p53, an activity that leads to the degradation and maintenance of low levels of p53 in unstressed cells. The importance of the negative regulation of p53 by Mdm2 has been demonstrated in many systems, and it is generally accepted that inhibition of Mdm2 will result in the activation of p53. It is, therefore, somewhat heretical to suggest that Mdm2 may also be enabling some p53 functions, but the observation that Mdm2 is required for p53 to export from the nucleus (40,41) suggests that Mdm2 activity might contribute to the mitochondrial or cytoplasmic activities of p53. The mechanism through which Mdm2 drives nuclear export of p53 is not completely clear, although it is associated with ubiquitination of p53 (42,43) and many involve the unmasking of the nuclear export sequences that are present in the C-terminal region of p53 (Figure 1). Ubiquitination of p53 by Mdm2, therefore, appears to have two roles, targeting of p53 to the proteasome for degradation and nuclear export. Differentiation between these two responses depends on the extent of ubiquitination whereas mono-ubiquitination of p53 is sufficient for nuclear export, polyubiquitination is necessary for degradation (43). Interestingly, in support of this model the p53 found at the mitochondria has been shown to be ubiquitin modified (44)..

The Arg72 variant shows an enhanced ability to interact with Mdm2 and Crm1 and is more efficiently exported from the nucleus and localized to the mitochondria than the Pro72 form (44). Consistent with the importance for this localization of p53, the Arg72 variant shows significantly higher apoptotic activity. Interestingly, the apoptotic defect of p53 proteins mutated in the N-terminus that had been ascribed to loss of transcriptional function (45 to 47) may also reflect a failure to bind Mdm2 and so relocalize to the mitochondria..

0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	22	The clarity of our vision of how p53 functions is becoming even more clouded with a growing appreciation of the importance of p53-induced responses other than apoptosis in preventing tumor development. Certainly, the ability to induce cell death has been strongly linked to the function of p53 as a tumor suppressor (48,49). Compelling studies showing that transformed cells are more sensitive to p53-mediated apoptosis, and that under conditions of Myc or E1A driven tumorigenesis in mice, blocking apoptosis by overexpression of Bcl2 (50) or loss of Apaf1 (51) could substitute for loss of p53, strongly suggest that the ability to induce cell death might be key to the success of p53 as a tumor suppressor. In vivo model systems examining Myc-induced lymphomas also provide elegant support for a tumor suppressive role of PUMA in these studies loss of PUMA was as effective at accelerating tumor development as loss of p53 (19). However, there is now accumulating evidence that simply preventing the apoptotic response to p53 is not the same as losing p53 function completely. For example, the PUMA knock-out mice do not resemble p53-null animals with respect to tumor development, despite showing profound defects in their apoptotic response in many tissues (17,18). These observations therefore suggest that other activities of p53, such as the induction of cell-cycle arrest or senescence and the contribution to the maintenance of genomic stability, also play an important role in tumor suppression. As with apoptosis, pinning down the contribution of the cell-cycle arrest response to p53 tumor suppression has been complicated. Although the deletion of p21WAF1/CIP1, one of the key mediators of the proliferative block induced by p53, can enhance susceptibility to cancer development in some models (52), loss of p21WAF1/CIP1 is not equivalent to loss of p53. Indeed in some systems, loss of p21WAF1/CIP1 may even impede tumorigenesis, possibly as a reflection of tissue and system-dependent pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic activities of p21WAF1/CIP1 (53). However, notwithstanding this complexity in the contribution of p21WAF1/CIP1, it seems clear that the proliferative block induced by p53 in the shape of cell-cycle arrest or senescence may be as important in preventing cancer development as the induction of cell death. Some of this evidence has come from a reexamination of specific tumor derived p53 mutants that dissociate p53's apoptotic and cell-cycle responses. Initial tissue culture studies indicated that while these mutants remain competent in the induction of cell-cycle arrest, they fail to induce apoptosis (54). Interestingly, these p53 mutants function to enhance the transformation of cells in culture (55), adding further weight to the suggestion that apoptosis is the key tumor suppressor function of p53. More recently, however, a knock-in mouse expressing one such mutant p53 was created and interestingly, despite showing a complete loss of p53-mediated apoptosis and a reduced p53-induced cell-cycle arrest, these mice retained some ability to resist tumor development (56). Although clearly more susceptible to cancer than their wild-type littermates (suggesting apoptosis does indeed play some role), the incidence of tumor development was far less than that seen in p53-null mice, strongly indicating that the ability to induce a proliferative block, which was matched by a maintenance of genomic stability, is an important weapon in the tumor suppressive armoury of p53. These model systems will encourage us to think again about which p53 activities we should be trying to restore for therapy should we concentrate on apoptosis, cell cycle progression or even senescence (57)? Even if the ability of p53 to induce a proliferative block can inhibit tumor development, will it also be true that reinstating such a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest can help to cure a cancer? More importantly, will attempts to modulate the proliferative block in tumor cells have effects on the apoptotic response? For example, the identification of p21WAF1/CIP1 as a survival factor that might ideally be inhibited as a part of tumor therapy (58) suggests that reactivating this p53 response may have unanticipated and undesirable consequences for tumor cell survival..
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	23	The clarity of our vision of how p53 functions is becoming even more clouded with a growing appreciation of the importance of p53-induced responses other than apoptosis in preventing tumor development. Certainly, the ability to induce cell death has been strongly linked to the function of p53 as a tumor suppressor (48,49). Compelling studies showing that transformed cells are more sensitive to p53-mediated apoptosis, and that under conditions of Myc or E1A driven tumorigenesis in mice, blocking apoptosis by overexpression of Bcl2 (50) or loss of Apaf1 (51) could substitute for loss of p53, strongly suggest that the ability to induce cell death might be key to the success of p53 as a tumor suppressor. In vivo model systems examining Myc-induced lymphomas also provide elegant support for a tumor suppressive role of PUMA in these studies loss of PUMA was as effective at accelerating tumor development as loss of p53 (19). However, there is now accumulating evidence that simply preventing the apoptotic response to p53 is not the same as losing p53 function completely. For example, the PUMA knock-out mice do not resemble p53-null animals with respect to tumor development, despite showing profound defects in their apoptotic response in many tissues (17,18). These observations therefore suggest that other activities of p53, such as the induction of cell-cycle arrest or senescence and the contribution to the maintenance of genomic stability, also play an important role in tumor suppression. As with apoptosis, pinning down the contribution of the cell-cycle arrest response to p53 tumor suppression has been complicated. Although the deletion of p21WAF1/CIP1, one of the key mediators of the proliferative block induced by p53, can enhance susceptibility to cancer development in some models (52), loss of p21WAF1/CIP1 is not equivalent to loss of p53. Indeed in some systems, loss of p21WAF1/CIP1 may even impede tumorigenesis, possibly as a reflection of tissue and system-dependent pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic activities of p21WAF1/CIP1 (53). However, notwithstanding this complexity in the contribution of p21WAF1/CIP1, it seems clear that the proliferative block induced by p53 in the shape of cell-cycle arrest or senescence may be as important in preventing cancer development as the induction of cell death. Some of this evidence has come from a reexamination of specific tumor derived p53 mutants that dissociate p53's apoptotic and cell-cycle responses. Initial tissue culture studies indicated that while these mutants remain competent in the induction of cell-cycle arrest, they fail to induce apoptosis (54). Interestingly, these p53 mutants function to enhance the transformation of cells in culture (55), adding further weight to the suggestion that apoptosis is the key tumor suppressor function of p53. More recently, however, a knock-in mouse expressing one such mutant p53 was created and interestingly, despite showing a complete loss of p53-mediated apoptosis and a reduced p53-induced cell-cycle arrest, these mice retained some ability to resist tumor development (56). Although clearly more susceptible to cancer than their wild-type littermates (suggesting apoptosis does indeed play some role), the incidence of tumor development was far less than that seen in p53-null mice, strongly indicating that the ability to induce a proliferative block, which was matched by a maintenance of genomic stability, is an important weapon in the tumor suppressive armoury of p53. These model systems will encourage us to think again about which p53 activities we should be trying to restore for therapy should we concentrate on apoptosis, cell cycle progression or even senescence (57)? Even if the ability of p53 to induce a proliferative block can inhibit tumor development, will it also be true that reinstating such a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest can help to cure a cancer? More importantly, will attempts to modulate the proliferative block in tumor cells have effects on the apoptotic response? For example, the identification of p21WAF1/CIP1 as a survival factor that might ideally be inhibited as a part of tumor therapy (58) suggests that reactivating this p53 response may have unanticipated and undesirable consequences for tumor cell survival..
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	24	Clearly, there are many questions that remain to be answered, but despite the obvious gaps in our understanding of exactly how p53 works, the role of p53 in tumor suppression is indisputable. This has encouraged the development of numerous approaches to harnessing the power of p53 for tumor therapy, including gene therapy to directly express wild-type p53 (59) as well as the development of small molecules that can restore function to mutant p53 (60) or reactivate wild-type p53 (61). The latter approach depends on the observation that many tumors that retain a wild-type p53 gene show defects in the pathways that allow the activation of p53 in response to stress, in most cases resulting in an inability to turn off Mdm2. In these tumors, targeting Mdm2 would be expected to stabilize and activate p53. One extremely promising approach has been to identify small molecule inhibitors of the Mdm2 to p53 interaction (62). Although inhibition of protein to protein interactions is not usually a favourite target for drug development, in this case, the success of the Nutlin compounds may reflect the extremely tightly defined interaction of a small domain of p53 into a deep pocket in Mdm2 (63). Other approaches include the use of antisense oligonucleotides to inihibit Mdm2 expression (64) and the identification of small molecules that inhibit the E3 activity of Mdm2 (65). Interestingly, although the inhibition of Mdm2 activity should also hinder the mitochondrial function of p53 by preventing nuclear export, the results indicate that p53 activity can be restored with sufficient efficiency to induce an apoptotic response..

Retrovirally mediated expression of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E6 and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) were used to suppress p53 function in HMECs as a model of early breast cancer. p53+ HMEC vector controls grew exponentially in reconstituted ECM (rECM) until day 6 and then underwent growth arrest on day 7. Ultrastructural examination of day 7 vector controls revealed acinus-like structures characteristic of normal mammary epithelium. In contrast, early passage p53- HMEC cells proliferated in rECM until day 6 but then underwent apoptosis on day 7. p53- HMEC-E6 passaged in non-rECM culture rapidly (8 to 10 passages), lost sensitivity to both rECM-induced growth arrest and polarity, and also developed resistance to rECM-induced apoptosis. Resistance was associated with altered expression of 3-integrin. Treatment of early passage p53- HMEC-E6 cells with either 3- or ss1-integrin function-blocking antibodies inhibited rECM-mediated growth arrest and induction of apoptosis. Our results indicate that suppression of p53 expression in HMECs by HPV-16 E6 and ODNs may sensitize cells to rECM-induced apoptosis and suggest a role for the 3/ss1-heterodimer in mediating apoptosis in HMECs grown in contact with rECM..

0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	10	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References   Interactions between extracellular matrix (ECM)*and mammary epithelial cells are critical for the regulation of cellular proliferation, polarity, and apoptosis (Petersen et al., 1992; Strange et al., 1992). These normal interactions may be disrupted during breast carcinogenesis (Petersen et al., 1992; Zutter et al., 1995). It has been observed that although normal mammary epithelial cells undergo growth arrest in culture in the presence of reconstituted ECM (rECM), breast cancer cells and established breast cancer cell lines fail to exhibit similar growth arrest (Petersen et al., 1992). Thus, it is hypothesized that interaction with ECM may serve to distinguish the growth patterns of normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells..

It has been shown that rECM regulates both biomechanical and biochemical signaling events and conversely that alterations in cell morphology can alter the response of cells to rECM (Folkman and Moscona, 1978; Roskelley et al., 1994). It is hypothesized that because malignant cells have an altered response to rECM, ECM signaling pathways may utilize tumor suppressor checkpoints critical for cellular organization and polarity (Petersen et al., 1992; Howlett et al., 1994; Weaver et al., 1997)..

0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	13	Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors that link ECM to structural and functional components within the cell (Hynes, 1992). There is increasing evidence that integrins are important regulators of normal mammary morphology, since mammary carcinoma cells frequently demonstrate atypical patterns of integrin expression including loss, downregulation, or improper localization (Koukoulis et al., 1991; Glukhova et al., 1995; Lichtner et al., 1998). In the normal mammary gland, the 3/ss1 integrin is expressed at the basal surface of luminal epithelial cells (Koukoulis et al., 1991; Glukhova et al., 1995). In contrast, invasive breast carcinomas demonstrate weak staining and redistribution of the 3/ss1 integrin. Recently, the 3/ss1 integrin has attracted considerable interest, since its function appears to be versatile. For example, the integrin 3/ss1 functions as a cell adhesion receptor for laminin-5 (epiligrin), a major ECM protein present in basement membrane (Xia et al., 1996). The 3/ss1-integrin is recruited to focal adhesion contacts in cultured cells and thereby plays an important role in linking ECM to components of the actin cytoskeleton (Carter et al., 1990b; Grenz et al., 1993; DiPersio et al., 1995). Integrin 3/ss1 is a critical mediator of intracellular adhesion (Kawano et al., 2001). Studies in keratinocytes suggest that 3/ss1 plays a critical role in cell spreading and migration and promotes gap junctional communication (Carter et al., 1990b; Xia et al., 1996; DiPersio et al., 1997). Recently, 3/ss1-integrin has been shown to be involved in the initiation apoptosis (Sato et al., 1999). Taken together, these studies illustrate the multifaceted role of 3/ss1-integrin in mediating interactions between ECM and epithelial cells and perhaps in initiating apoptosis..

Apoptosis is considered to be the predominant mechanism of cell death and plays a central role in controlling cell number and eliminating cells sustaining DNA damage (Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998). The role of the tumor suppressor p53 in ECM-induced growth arrest, polarity, and apoptosis is unknown. TP53 is a cell cycle "checkpoint" gene critical for cell cycle regulation, and it is functionally inactivated in human cancer at a high frequency (Hansen and Oren, 1997). Mutations of the TP53 gene are detected commonly in breast cancers and are associated with an increased risk of malignancy (Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998; Levesque et al., 1998). Aberrant expression of p53 in mammary epithelial cells may be a biomarker predicting risk for subsequent breast carcinogenesis. Accumulation of p53 protein in mammary epithelial cells is detected frequently in women at high risk for the development of breast cancer (Fabian et al., 1996) and associated with an increased risk of progression to breast cancer in women with benign breast disease (Rohan et al., 1998)..

These results are similar to what is observed in normal breast sections and consistent with results obtained by other investigators when mammary epithelial cells are grown in contact with rECM (Weaver et al., 1997; Spancake et al., 1999). In contrast, late passage p53- HMEC-E6 cells exhibited punctate dispersed and intracellular staining consistent with a loss of epithelial polarity (Fig. 10 d). These results are similar to what is observed in tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells that lack epithelial polarity grown in rECM (Weaver et al., 1997)..

Early passage p53- HMEC-E6 cells underwent apoptosis when cultured for 7 d in growth factor to depleted MatrigelTM (Fig. 11 a), suggesting that depletion of growth factors present in the MatrigelTM are not critical for the induction of apoptosis. Early passage p53+ HMEC-LXSN controls did not undergo apoptosis when cultured in growth factor to depleted MatrigelTM (Fig. 11 b). When early passage p53- HMEC-E6 cells were cultured in the presence of collagen I/IV, there was no evidence of apoptosis after 7 and 14 d (Fig. 11 c; unpublished data).

0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	103	     Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References   p53 is a critical regulator of cell cycle control, and the high frequency with which p53 is functionally inactivated in human malignancy attests to its key role in preventing the clonal expansion of mutated cells (Hansen and Oren, 1997; Goetz et al., 2001). Although there is extensive experimental evidence demonstrating the importance of p53 as a tumor suppressor and in promoting differentiation, little is known about the fate of normal human cells that acutely lose p53 function in the context of rECM regulatory signals..

Interactions between mammary epithelial cells and ECM play a critical role in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis and are likely to be disrupted during breast carcinogenesis. In this report, we describe an in vitro system for investigating interactions between HMECs with suppressed p53 protein expression and rECM as a potential model of early mammary carcinogenesis..

The combination of these approaches allowed us to utilize both viral and nonviral methods to suppress p53. We observed that early passage p53+ HMEC control cells underwent rECM-mediated growth arrest on day 6 to 7 and formed acinus-like structure (Figs. 3, 4, and 10). In contrast, early passage p53- HMEC-E6 cells and early passage p53- HMEC-AS cells proliferated until day 6 (Figs. 3, 4, and 6) and then underwent apoptosis on day 7 as evidenced by EM and by in situ TdT staining (Figs. 4 and 7; unpublished data). These observations suggest that the acute suppression of p53 function in HMECs by HPV-16 E6 and by AS ODNs may promote sensitivity to rECM-induced apoptosis..

The critical relationship between ECM signaling and p53 expression is highlighted by a recent report that ECM survival signals transduced by focal adhesion kinase suppress p53-mediated apoptosis (Ilic et al., 1998). However, there is significant evidence that growth arrest, differentiation, and survival signals may also promote apoptosis in genetically damaged cells (Seewaldt et al., 1995; Hong and Sporn, 1997; Mancini et al., 1997; Seewaldt et al., 1997b)..
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	107	Our observation that the acute suppression of p53 in HMECs promotes sensitivity to apoptosis is consistent with several reports in human and mouse primary fibroblasts that the acute suppression of p53 results in apoptosis sensitivity (Hawkins et al., 1996; Wahl et al., 1996; Lanni et al., 1997). The mechanism by which the acute loss of p53 function might promote apoptosis is unknown. However, we observe that immediately after suppression of p53 by HPV-16 E6, HMECs exhibited a high percentage of tetraploid cells (14%) and an increased sensitivity to apoptosis. The tumor suppressor p53 is a critical component of the spindle checkpoint that ensures the maintenance of diploidy, and an increase in tetraploidy has been observed in cultured fibroblasts from p53-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (Cross et al., 1995). We speculate that it is possible that a loss in the spindle checkpoint might promote the induction of apoptosis when early passage p53- HMEC cells are exposed to either survival or growth arrest signals. Alternatively, p53 also plays an important role in differentiation, and therefore lack of p53 might result in cellular disregulation that promotes cell death. We observe that early passage p53- HMECs are sensitive to the induction of apoptosis by other agents that only promote growth arrest in p53+ HMECs at equimolar concentrations. For example, we observed that although tamoxifen promotes G1/S-phase arrest in early passage p53+ HMEC controls, tamoxifen promoted apoptosis in early passage p53- HMECs (Dietze et al., 2001; Seewaldt et al., 2001). Taken together, these observations provide evidence that the acute suppression of p53 might promote the induction of apoptosis when cells are exposed to growth arrest or survival signals..
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	108	Although early passage p53 HMEC-E6 cells underwent apoptosis when cultured in rECM, late passage cells were resistant to rECM-induced growth arrest, did not exhibit epithelial polarity, and failed to undergo apoptosis (Fig. 9). Loss of epithelial polarity is based on morphologic appearance by EM and lack of polarized expression of E-cadherin (Figs. 9 and 10). The development of apoptosis resistance correlated with the appearance of complex karyotypic abnormalities. Unlike early passage cells, late passage p53- HMEC-E6 cells continued to proliferate in rECM, formed multilayered aggregates of cells, and subsequently did not undergo apoptosis (Figs. 8 and 9). Based upon observations in our in vitro system, we propose that resistance to rECM-mediated growth arrest and polarity may promote resistance to apoptosis..

Early passage p53- HMEC-E6 cells grown in collagen did not form acinar structures and did not undergo apoptosis (Fig. 11). Based on these observations, we speculate that the presence of collagen I/IV in a 1:1 ratio in our model system is not sufficient to induce apoptosis nor promote an acinar structure. When laminin was added to collagen I/IV gels, early passage p53- HMEC-E6 cells formed organized branched tubular structures that terminated in spherical cell clusters and underwent apoptosis (Fig. 11). Early passage p53- HMEC-E6 cells cultured in laminin suspension, in the absence of a plastic substratum for adhesion, formed similar three dimensional structures and likewise underwent apoptosis. This suggests that contact with laminin is critical for the induction of apoptosis in early passage p53- HMEC-E6 cells..

Recently, 3/ss1-integrin has been shown to play a potential role in the initiation apoptosis in T cells (Sato et al., 1999). Resistance to rECM-mediated apoptosis in late passage p53- HMEC-E6 cells was associated with altered expression of 3-integrin (Figs. 12 and 13). Redistribution of 3-integrin has been seen previously by other investigators in association with loss of mammary epithelial cell polarity in rECM culture and is consistent with our findings (Weaver et al., 1997). Treatment of early passage p53- HMEC-E6 cells with 3- and ss1-integrin function-altering Abs blocked rECM-mediated growth arrest and inhibited the induction of apoptosis (Figs. 14 and 15). Taken together, these observations suggest an important role for 3/ss1 signaling in rECM-mediated growth regulation and apoptosis..
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	112	Previous investigators have tested the ability of 3- and ss1-integrin blocking Abs to mediate growth of breast cell lines in rECM and in collagen and fibrin gels (Howlett et al., 1995; Alford et al., 1998). HMT-3522, a nontumorigeneic breast cell line, demonstrated decreased proliferation in rECM culture when treated with either the inhibitory anti to 3-integrin Ab P1B5 or anti to ss1-integrin Ab AIIB2 (Howlett et al., 1995). In contrast, we observed dysregulated proliferation when we treated HMECs with either the inhibitory anti to 3-integrin Ab P1B5 or anti to ss1-integrin Ab JB1A. The induction of stimulatory or inhibitory functions by Abs directed to defined integrin subunits has been observed previously for both anti to ss1- and anti to 3-integrin Abs (Lenter et al., 1993; Driessens et al., 1995; Lichtner et al., 1998) and is felt to be highly cell type specific. We hypothesize that utilization of nonimmortalized cells with low levels of 6ss4-integrin expression may account for differences between our results and those obtained by Howlett et al. (1995)..

Resistance to rECM-mediated growth arrest and polarity results in resistance to rECM-mediated apoptosis and is associated with altered expression of 3-integrin. Treatment of apoptosis-sensitive early passage p53- HMEC-E6 cells with either 3- or ss1-integrin function-altering Abs results in loss of rECM-mediated growth arrest and resistance to rECM-mediated apoptosis.

Subsequently, the cells were released from flasks by trypsinization, exposed to hypotonic solution, and fixed as described previously (Mrozek et al., 1993). Chromosome preparations were made, and after appropriate aging slides were subjected to SKY, a method that enables simultaneous display of all human chromosomes in different colors (Schrock et al., 1996). Additional slides were also stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) alone. For SKY, the slides were hybridized with the SKY probe mixture containing combinatorially labeled painting probes for each of the autosomes and sex chromosomes (Applied Spectral Imaging) for 42 to 45 h at 37 degrees C. The hybridization and detection procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Spectral Imaging), and chromosomes were counterstained with DAPI in antifade solution. The multicolor hybridizations were visualized with the SpectraCube SD 200 system (Applied Spectral Imaging) mounted on the ZEISS Axioplan 2 epifluorescence microscope using a custom-designed optical filter (SKY-1; Chroma Technology). The DAPI images of all metaphase cells were acquired using a DAPI-specific optical filter. Spectral analysis and classification were performed using SkyView 1.2r visualization and analysis software (Applied Spectral Imaging). The assignment of breakpoints in structural abnormalities was made on comparison of images of SKY classified chromosomes with the images of the same chromosomes stained with DAPI that were inverted electronically and contrast enhanced by SkyView 1.2r software. Karyotypic abnormalities were classified according to the recommendations of the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (Mitelman, 1995)..

In vitro assays measuring the specific activity of MDM2 in the ligand-free and RNA-bound state identified a novel MDM2 interaction site in the core domain of p53. As defined using phage-peptide display, the RNA MDM2 isoform exhibited a notable switch in peptide binding specificity, with enhanced affinity for novel peptide sequences in either p53 or small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-U (snRNP-U) and substantially reduced affinity for the primary p53 binding site in the BOX-I domain. The consensus binding site for the RNA MDM2 complex within p53 is SGXLLGESXF, which links the S9-S10 -sheets flanking the BOX-IV and BOX-V motifs in the core domain and which is a site of reversible conformational flexibility in p53. Mutation of conserved amino acids in the linker at Ser261 and Leu264, which bridges the S9-S10 -sheets, stimulated p53 activity from reporter templates and increased MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53. Furthermore, mutation of the conserved Phe270 within the S10 -sheet resulted in a mutant p53, which binds more stably to RNA MDM2 complexes in vitro and which is strikingly hyper-ubiquitinated in vivo. Introducing an Ala19 mutation into the p53F270A protein abolished both RNA MDM2 complex binding and hyper-ubiquitination in vivo, thus indicating that p53F270A protein hyper-ubiquitination depends upon MDM2 binding to its primary site in the BOX-I domain. Together, these data identify a novel MDM2 binding interface within the S9-S10 -sheet region of p53 that plays a regulatory role in modulating the rate of MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53 in cells.

The biochemical activity of p53 linked with tumor suppression is its function as a sequence-specific DNA binding protein and transcription factor that controls the expression of a large panel of gene products implicated in normal growth control, DNA repair, cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and angiogenesis (2). The stress-regulated transactivation function of p53 is driven by its sequence-specific DNA binding domain and is coordinated by specific protein protein interactions that can in turn be modulated by covalent and non-covalent modifications. The central core domain of p53 from amino acids 90-295 contains the sequence-specific DNA binding domain (3). Inactivating mutations in p53 at over 200 different amino acid positions within this core DNA binding domain have been detected in human cancers (4), and the mutation often results in the unfolding and accumulation of p53 protein in the nucleus of the cancer cell (5). An oligomerization domain from amino acids 320-356 flanks the conserved core sequence-specific DNA binding domain and is required to assemble p53 into its tetrameric structure (6, 7)..

The C terminus of p53 contains a negative regulatory domain whose phosphorylation at Ser315 by cyclin-dependent kinases (9) or acetylation at multiple lysine residues by p300 (10) stimulates the transcription activity of p53 in vivo. The N-terminal regulatory domain of p53 contains the highly conserved BOX-I domain that directs the binding of p53 to proteins, including the positive effector p300 and the inhibitor MDM2, the balance of which regulates the tumor suppressor activity of p53. Phosphorylation at Ser15, Thr18, and Ser20 can either reduce MDM2 binding (11, 12) or stabilize the p53 p300 transcription complex (13), resulting in a net activation of p53 function. Thus, the concerted activation of the sequence-specific DNA binding function of p53 by post-translational modification of its C-terminal domain and the kinase-dependent stabilization of the p53 p300 complex provide a working model to explain the basic mechanism of how p53-dependent gene expression can be activated..

MDM2 protein contains at least four independent functional domains, including: 1) an N-terminal domain that recognizes the BOX-I domain of p53 (14); 2) a central domain that binds to the tumor suppressor protein p14ARF; 3) a putative zinc binding domain (15); and 4) a RING-finger RNA binding domain (16). The original localization of the primary MDM2 docking site on p53 protein in the N-terminal BOX-I domain was defined using small peptide-mimetics (17), crystallographic analysis (18), and mutational studies (15, 19, 36). These studies revealed that a highly conserved hydrophobic series of amino acids within the N-terminal region of p53 from amino acids 14-27 interact with a hydrophobic binding pocket in the N-terminal domain of MDM2 protein. The microinjection of monoclonal antibodies to the p53 binding interface of MDM2 protein can activate p53-dependent expression providing direct evidence that MDM2 is normally a negative regulator of p53 function in vivo (20, 21). Scaffold proteins fused to the BOX-I domain of p53 can activate p53 function by virtue of binding to MDM2 protein (13, 22), providing additional evidence for the importance of this small BOX-I domain as an independent binding motif that is recognized by MDM2 protein in vivo..

These latter data identify the minimal polypeptide fragment that can be modified by MDM2-dependent degradation machinery in vivo, but how MDM2 protein interacts with the native p53 tetramer is undefined. For example, although the BOX-I motif can promote degradation of a heterologous fusion protein in cells (13, 23), monomeric p53 protein, paradoxically, is not degraded by MDM2 (59) indicating that other determinants in the p53 tetramer regulate MDM2 binding in cells. A more recent study has shown that MDM2 protein, when complexed to RNA in vitro, can bind to p53 lacking the BOX-I domain, suggesting that RNA can induce a conformational change in MDM2 that directs its binding to a novel site in p53 (25). The purpose of this study was to use a biochemical approach to begin to reconstitute the MDM2 p53 tetramer complex in vitro and determine whether co-factors can modulate the in vitro stability of the MDM2 p53 complex. We provide direct evidence for a secondary docking site for MDM2 within the core domain of p53 that resides within a conformationally flexible S9-S10 -sheet region flanked by conserved domains BOX-IV and BOX-V. Mutant forms of p53 that contain single point mutations at conserved amino acids within this S9-S10 -sheet region have increased levels of MDM2-dependent ubiquitination in cells. This conformationally flexible motif is interestingly constrained in the wild-type p53 protein DNA complex (3), but the S9-S10 -sheet region is unfolded or denatured in mutant p53 protein within human cancers (5, 35). The denaturation or unfolding of p53 protein defined the first molecular defect of the p53 pathway in human cancer cells, and the refolding of p53 protein by small molecules has been the subject of recent screening programs aimed at reactivating mutant p53 protein function (60-62). Together, these data, identifying the conformationally flexible linker within the S9-S10 -sheet region of p53 protein as a novel MDM2 binding interface, suggest an interplay may exist between p53 protein unfolding and factors that modulate the rate of MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53 in vivo.

For example, although the BOX-I motif can promote degradation of a heterologous fusion protein in cells (13, 23), monomeric p53 protein, paradoxically, is not degraded by MDM2 (59) indicating that other determinants in the p53 tetramer regulate MDM2 binding in cells. A more recent study has shown that MDM2 protein, when complexed to RNA in vitro, can bind to p53 lacking the BOX-I domain, suggesting that RNA can induce a conformational change in MDM2 that directs its binding to a novel site in p53 (25). The purpose of this study was to use a biochemical approach to begin to reconstitute the MDM2 p53 tetramer complex in vitro and determine whether co-factors can modulate the in vitro stability of the MDM2 p53 complex. We provide direct evidence for a secondary docking site for MDM2 within the core domain of p53 that resides within a conformationally flexible S9-S10 -sheet region flanked by conserved domains BOX-IV and BOX-V. Mutant forms of p53 that contain single point mutations at conserved amino acids within this S9-S10 -sheet region have increased levels of MDM2-dependent ubiquitination in cells. This conformationally flexible motif is interestingly constrained in the wild-type p53 protein DNA complex (3), but the S9-S10 -sheet region is unfolded or denatured in mutant p53 protein within human cancers (5, 35). The denaturation or unfolding of p53 protein defined the first molecular defect of the p53 pathway in human cancer cells, and the refolding of p53 protein by small molecules has been the subject of recent screening programs aimed at reactivating mutant p53 protein function (60-62). Together, these data, identifying the conformationally flexible linker within the S9-S10 -sheet region of p53 protein as a novel MDM2 binding interface, suggest an interplay may exist between p53 protein unfolding and factors that modulate the rate of MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53 in vivo.

Bacterially expressed p53 was purified as described previously (24). Full-length human MDM2 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells (25, 27) and MDM2 was induced by addition of 1 mM final concentration of isopropyl-1-thio--D-galactopyranoside. Harvested cells were washed with ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the final pellet was resuspended at 0.66 g/ml in 10% sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), followed by the addition of lysozyme (150  microg/ml final concentration) and NaCl (0.15 M final concentration). The cell suspension was incubated in an ice bath for 45 min, then warmed to 37  degrees C for 1 min and returned to 0  degrees C. The cells were lysed on ice by sonication, after the addition of Pefabloc (2 mM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), DTT1 (5 mM, BDH Laboratory Supplies), and benzamidine (1 mM). The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was fractionated on a 5-ml HiTrap-SP column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with buffer A (15% glycerol, 25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.02% Triton X-100, 5 mM DTT, and 1 mM benzamidine). The supernatant was diluted with buffer A prior to application onto the column, and bound protein was eluted in a linear gradient in buffer A from 0.05 to 1.0 M KCl. Aliquots (1  microl) of the fractions from the column were assayed for the purity of MDM2 by SDS gel and presence of MDM2 by Western blotting. To determine the oligomerization state of p53, purified MDM2 protein was applied onto size-exclusion chromatography (Superose 12 HR 10/30, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) with buffer B (10 mM KCl, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create p53 mutants, with primers designed to change Phe19, Ser261, Leu264, and Phe270 into alanine..

Essentially, 96-well plates (Dynex Microlite 2) were first coated with p53, MDM2, or streptavidin and the indicated biotinylated peptide for 16 h, as described previously (13, 26). Non-reactive sites were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS-Tween 20 (0.02% v/v) to reduce the nonspecific binding. This was followed by titrating increasing amounts of p53, MDM2, peptides, or RNA (polyG) in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS-Tween 20 (0.02% v/v) for 1 h, followed by an extensive wash, and incubation with the indicated IgG. All reactions were carried out at 4  degrees C and detected by the appropriate secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase from DAKO. The signal detection by enhanced chemiluminescence was developed using Fluoroscan Ascent FL. The human p14ARF domain peptide contained the sequence MVRRFLVTLRIRRACGPPRV (27). The BOX-I domain of p53 contains amino acids 14-27, as described previously (13). The DO-12 epitope peptide used contained the sequence SGNLLGRNSFEVRVCACPGRDR. Phage-peptide display, on antibody-captured bacterially expressed MDM2 protein or bacterially expressed MDM2 protein reconstituted with RNA (polyrG), was carried out using three rounds of phage-peptide selection as described previously for purified phospho-specific monoclonal antibodies toward phospho-epitopes of p53 (9, 28)..

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	21	Purification of Full-length MDM2 Protein-- Human MDM2 protein contains an N-terminal domain that binds to the N-terminal BOX-I domain of p53 and C-terminal sub-domains that interact with zinc, RNA, and the tumor suppressor protein p14ARF (30). Although MDM2 protein is known to bind to the N-terminal BOX-I domain of p53, a recent study has shown that RNA binding by MDM2 can promote MDM2 protein interaction with a BOX-I deletion mutant of p53 protein using surface plasmon resonance (25). These latter data suggest that RNA induces a conformational change in MDM2 protein via the RING finger domain and that this promotes an interaction with p53 outside the canonical BOX-I motif. This current study was set up initially to determine in fact whether ligand binding to the C-terminal domain of MDM2 could change its conformation and whether this change directs MDM2 to interact with a previously unidentified motif within the core domain of p53. To begin to address this possibility, full-length human MDM2 protein was first purified in a native state from bacterial expression systems. Following lysis using gentle perturbations that can maintain recombinant protein conformational integrity, a purification of MDM2 protein was developed using standard chromatographic methods. The best purification was obtained using cation exchange chromatography, where MDM2 protein eluted as a triplet of three protein bands at a conductivity equivalent to 0.4-0.5 M KCl (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-4). Immunoblotting of the peak fractions using distinct monoclonal antibodies confirms that the triplet protein bands of interest are MDM2 protein (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-4). It is not known whether the three protein bands stem from alternative translational reading and termination of the mdm2 transcript in E. coli or from proteolysis of MDM2 protein. In addition, because MDM2 protein has a predicted molecular mass of ~55 kDa yet migrates in a denaturing gel at a molecular mass of greater than 90 kDa, altered protein-folding pathways utilized during its translation may produce isoforms that migrate anomalously in a denaturing SDS-gel..

Under these conditions, a decrease in the amount of MDM2 bound to p53 occurs after the addition of 100 pg to 10 ng of RNA (Fig. 2C). These data contrast with the affects of RNA on stabilizing the MDM2 p53 complex (Fig. 2, A and B) and are consistent with the observation that p53 DNA complexes exhibit reduced binding to MDM2 (25)..

For example, RNA may stabilize the MDM2 p53 complex by increasing the affinity of MDM2 protein for the N-terminal BOX-I domain of p53. The specific activity of MDM2 protein was thus subsequently tested in a BOX-I peptide binding assay, because the use of a small p53-derived peptide also minimizes the affects other regions of p53 that bind either RNA, zinc, or p14ARF..

The addition of magnesium/ATP had no affect on the stability of the MDM2 BOX-I domain complex, whereas the addition of either zinc or p14ARF also reduced the stability of the MDM2 BOX-I domain complex (Fig. 3A) but not to the same extent. These data indicate that three distinct C-terminal binding ligands of MDM2 can reduce stability of the MDM2 BOX-I peptide complex and suggest that the ability of RNA MDM2 complexes to bind to p53 protein coincides with a conformational change in the ligand-bound form of MDM2 protein (see below). These data are also consistent with the observation that MDM2 RNA complexes can bind stably to p53 tetramers lacking the N-terminal BOX-I domain (25). The stability of the MDM2 p14ARF complex was not similarly reduced or enhanced by the preincubation of MDM2 with either ATP, RNA, or zinc (Fig. 3B)..

The fact that RNA can simultaneously stabilize the p53 MDM2 protein complex and reduce the stability of the MDM2 BOX-I domain complex is internally consistent. However, the reduced stability of the MDM2 BOX-I domain complex in the presence of zinc (Fig. 3) is not compensated by an increase in the stability of the MDM2 tetrameric p53 complex in the presence of zinc (data not shown). These latter data suggest that RNA or zinc induce distinct conformational changes in MDM2 protein. Partial proteolysis was used to determine whether in fact evidence could be found for a difference in the conformation of the RNA MDM2 protein complex and the zinc MDM2 protein complex. The first analysis was designed to examine the proteolytic cleavage products of MDM2 protein in the absence or presence of RNA using Trypsin (Fig. 4A). A titration of Trypsin into reactions containing MDM2 protein in the presence of RNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 6-8) gave rise to a different pattern of proteolytic products than in reactions without RNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 2-4). Most notable was the resistance of the 27-kDa fragment to proteolysis in the presence of RNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8 versus lanes 3 and 4) and the accumulation of the 23-kDa fragment resistant to proteolysis in the presence of RNA (Fig. 4A, lane 8 versus lane 4). Using the protease Glu-C, a similar resistance to proteolysis of a 53-kDa fragment was observed when MDM2 protein was incubated with RNA (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5 versus lanes 2 and 3). Finally, although RNA and zinc reduce the binding of MDM2 protein to the BOX-I domain, a resistance to proteolysis of a 52- and a 45-kDa fragment was uniquely observed when MDM2 protein was incubated with zinc (Fig. 4B, lanes 6 and 7 versus lanes 1-5). Together, these data suggest that the ability of RNA to stabilize the MDM2 tetrameric p53 complex and to inhibit the MDM2 BOX-I peptide complex (Fig. 3A) may be due to a conformational change in the MDM2 protein that is distinct from that induced by zinc..

Phage-peptide display is a versatile technique that can give rise to high affinity peptide ligands that contain homology to bona fide binding proteins. For example, phage-peptide display analysis using the ligand-free form of full-length MDM2 protein yielded a series of peptides with high homology to the BOX-I domain of p53 (Fig. 5A). The high affinity binding phage were purified and sequenced giving rise to two distinct classes of peptides. The first class was obtained using ligand-free full-length MDM2 protein (Fig. 5A) and had homology to the BOX-I domain of p53 at residues critical for MDM2 binding (Phe19-X-X-X-Trp23-X-X-Leu26) (18). These results are identical to the phage-peptide display performed on the N-terminal fragment of MDM2 protein fused to GST (34), except our analysis also included the Thr18 residue as being an important component of MDM2 binding giving rise to the consensus sequence Thr18-Phe19-X-X-X-Trp23-X-X-Leu26 (Fig. 5A). These latter data are consistent with the pronounced instability of the MDM2 p53 BOX-I domain complex containing a phosphate residue at Thr18 (26). A distinct class of peptides were obtained using the MDM2 RNA isoform (Fig. 5A). A protein sequence with high homology to snRNP-U was obtained and no peptides were obtained with homology to the BOX-I domain of p53. These data are consistent with the observation that RNA changes the conformation of MDM2 (Fig. 4) and that MDM2 RNA complexes can bind to p53 lacking the BOX-I domain (25). When snRNP-U and p53 were scanned for similar sites of homology, a motif with a significant degree of homology was found in between the conserved BOX-IV and BOX-V domains of p53 (Fig. 5B, SGXLLGESXF), thus identifying the putative RNA MDM2 isoform interaction site in the core domain of p53..

MDM2 protein or MDM2 RNA complexes were coated onto ELISA wells (as indicated in Fig. 2) and subjected to phage-peptide display using a 12-mer peptide library as described previously (9, 28). Briefly, native MDM2 protein (SP-Sepharose fraction, Fig. 1) or the RNA MDM2 isoform were captured onto ELISA wells with an anti-MDM2 monoclonal antibody as described in Fig. 2 legend. Following an incubation with the naive phage-peptide library, elution of the phage with acid, and propagation of eluted phage, three rounds of amplification were carried out to acquire phage that bind with a high affinity to the indicated isoform of MDM2. The peptide inserts in each phage were tested for specificity and sequenced to determine the insert peptide sequence. The ligand-free form of MDM2 protein gave rise to the general consensus derived from the BOX-I domain of p53 (as indicated), whereas the RNA MDM2 isoform gave rise to the consensus sequence that matched most closely snRNP-U (as indicated). B, putative consensus site for the RNA-responsive MDM2 binding site. The C-terminal domain of the tumor suppressor protein pRb binds to MDM2 protein at an undefined site (33). This region of pRb and the entire coding region of snRNP-U were both were screened using the E-MOTIF search engine for domains with homology to p53 protein. A motif in the central domain of p53 in between conserved BOX-IV and BOX-V domain from amino acids 261 to 270 was found to have significant homology to pRb, snRNP-U, and WEE1, to give rise to the general consensus site SGXLLGESXF..

A subsequent scan of polypeptides in a protein data base with this consensus motif identified a series of signaling proteins, including Wee1 and MCM5 (data not shown), producing the consensus site SGXLLGESXF (Fig. 5B). Within p53, the SGXLLGESXF motif links the S9 and S10 -strands in the crystal structure of the p53 DNA complex (3) and is intriguingly defined by the DO-12 monoclonal antibody epitope (35). The classic reversible unfolding/folding the p53 tetramer is defined by changes in the exposure of the cryptic epitopes of the monoclonal antibodies DO-11, PAb240, and DO-12, which reside in amino acid ranges 210-215, 224-231, and 255-270, respectively (5, 35). As defined by the crystal structure of the p53 DNA complex (3), these cryptic epitopes are not buried but actually reside constrained on the surface of p53 protein. It is interesting that just as p53 RNA complexes or p53 DNA complexes were reduced in binding to full-length MDM2 protein (Fig. 2C (25)), p53 protein complexed to DNA is reduced in binding to the conformationally responsive monoclonal antibodies, including DO-12 and PAb240 (Fig. 6A). This occlusion is presumably due to the fact that DNA binding by p53 constrains the exposed DO-12 loop into a conformation incompatible with binding to the monoclonal antibody DO-12 or MDM2..

Marked deletion or multiple mutation of this linker region or the S10 -sheet was not performed, because this may unfold the entire subdomain and reduce MDM2 binding through global defects in the core domain structure. In particular, three missense mutants were constructed: two with amino acids that fit the consensus between p53, snRNP-U, and pRb in the S9-S10 linker loop (Ser261 and Leu264) and a remaining one with an invariant amino acid in the SGNLLGRNSF consensus motif that extends into the S10 -sheet (Phe270). Mutating the amino acids that are not in the surface loop may inactivate p53 (in fact mutation of Phe270 does impair p53 activity, see below), so the two surface loop mutants (alanine substitutions at Ser261 or at Leu264) were the first constructed that presumably will have little affect on the internal structure and activity of p53.

The S9-S10 linker mutant proteins displayed a similar activity compared with wild-type p53 after co-transfection with the p21 luciferase reporter constructs into Saos-2 cells (Fig. 7A), and the mutants displayed significantly higher activity from the bax luciferase reporter (Fig. 7B). The increased activity of the mutant p53 proteins cannot be attributed to changes in the half-life, because the wild-type p53 and the mutant p53 proteins have similar reduction in their half-life after transfection with MDM2 (data not shown, see Fig. 13 below). Rather, there is a significant increase in MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of the mutant forms of p53 (Fig. 8, lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 1-4) and a marginal increase in ubiquitination of p53L264A in the absence of transfected MDM2 protein (Fig. 9, lanes 4, 8, and 12 versus lanes 2, 6, and 10). p53 ubiquitination can be uncoupled from its degradation, thus, there is a precedent for situations where increases in p53 protein ubiquitination correlates with increases in its activity. Most notable under physiological situations where endogenous p53 protein is examined, UV-irradiated cells promotes a reduction in the ubiquitination of p53 upon its activation, whereas X-irradiation promotes p53 ubiquitination increases coincident with its activation as a transcription factor (46)..

Although the alanine substitution is a common change made in a protein to bring about a reduction in the stability of a protein protein interaction, there have been instances where stabilization of a protein for its docking site by alanine mutation occurs (58, 63). These data suggest that some protein protein interactions have evolved to maintain a lower affinity, but allowing reversibility in binding, and that binding affinity can be improved artificially. Such an improvement has been reported with the MDM2 p53 BOX-I complex, where mutation has led to the improvement on MDM2 peptide binding affinity by many orders of magnitude (22, 34)..

The hyper-ubiquitination of the p53F270A protein (Fig. 11A, lane 1) was prevented by the additional Ala19 substitution (Fig. 11A, lane 2). Furthermore, the p53F19A/F270A protein was not ubiquitinated after co-transfection of MDM2 (Fig. 11A, lanes 4 and 6), under conditions where the p53F270A mutant protein showed increases in the ubiquitination pattern (Fig. 11A, lanes 3 and 5). MDM2 protein levels were similar after transfection of the p53F270A mutant protein or the p53F19A/F270A double mutant protein (Fig. 11B), indicating that changes in MDM2 protein levels cannot explain the increases in p53F270A mutant protein ubiquitination. It is interesting, therefore, that wild-type p53 requires transfected MDM2 to catalyze its ubiquitination, whereas the p53F270A protein can rely on very small levels of endogenous MDM2 for its ubiquitination..

First, various p53 mutants were synthesized in reticulocyte lysates (Fig. 12) to determine whether MDM2 protein (SP fraction, Fig. 1) binds with a higher affinity due to this alanine substituted mutant p53. The p53F270A mutant protein formed the most stable complex with MDM2 protein of all the mutants tested (Fig. 12A, lane 5 versus lanes 2-4). It was relatively difficult to form a native protein protein complex in vitro between wild-type p53 protein synthesized in crude reticulocyte lysates and bacterially expressed MDM2 (Fig. 12A, lane 2), so it is significant that a MDM2 p53F270A mutant protein complex can be detected at all. Because MDM2 binds with a high affinity to 28 S rRNA (55), which is present in reticulocyte lysates, the lysate was treated after p53 protein synthesis with RNase, and this destabilized the MDM2 p53F270A mutant protein complex (Fig. 12B, lane 5 versus Fig. 12A, lane 5). The MDM2 p53F270A mutant protein complex appeared MDM2-dependent, because the double-mutant protein p53F19A/F270A was not bound by MDM2 (Fig. 12A, lane 6 versus lane 5).

Furthermore, the addition of cycloheximide does not alter the immunoreactive p53F19A/F270A double-mutant protein bands that remain (Fig. 13C, lanes 2-7 versus lane 1) nor can MDM2 promote the ubiquitination of the p53F19A/F270A double-mutant protein (Fig. 13C, lanes 8-14) under conditions where transfected MDM2 has the same half-life as in other transfections (Fig. 13F, lanes 8-14 versus Fig. 13, D and E, lanes 8-14). Together, these data indicate that the hyper-ubiquitination of the p53F270A mutant protein is MDM2-dependent, but because the half-life of the ubiquitinated p53F270A mutant protein is different depending upon whether endogenous or exogenous MDM2 is present, these data point to a novel assay to dissect out physiologically relevant regulatory steps that affect the rate of rate of p53-ubiquitination by MDM2.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	75	P53 protein is a conformationally dynamic allosterically regulated homo-tetramer that has multiple binding sites for regulatory protein co-factors. As such, p53 protein forms that basis for a model oligomeric protein that can give insights into basic mechanisms of protein self-assembly, protein kinase function, transcription, and polyubiquitination mechanisms. P53 protein contains independent sub-domains that direct sequence-specific DNA binding, nonspecific DNA binding, MDM2 or p300 binding, protein kinase binding, and homo-tetramerization. When each domain is linked to the full-length protein, intradomain or allosteric regulation of p53-dependent activity can be observed. For example, the polyproline domain in the N terminus of p53 negatively regulates MDM2 protein binding (29), whereas both the C- and N-terminal domains of p53 can regulate allosterically sequence-specific DNA binding (8, 37-40)..

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	77	MDM2 protein negatively regulates the tumor suppressor activity of p53 by a variety of overlapping mechanisms. The binding of MDM2 to the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 can block p53-dependent transcription through steric mechanisms (41, 42). MDM2 protein also normally promotes the polyubiquitination of p53 (43, 44), by which mechanism MDM2 can modulate the steady-state levels of p53 protein. For example, under some conditions, the ubiquitination is associated with rapid degradation of p53 (45). However, polyubiquitination of endogenous p53 also increases after certain types of DNA damage in normal human fibroblasts, indicating that ubiquitin modification does not always trigger the immediate turnover of p53 (46). Nevertheless, the control of p53's degradation can involve the cytoplasmic transport of p53 protein by MDM2 where p53 is degraded by the proteasome pathway. By contrast to the inhibitory affects of MDM2 on p53 protein levels, MDM2 protein can stimulate TAFII250-dependent expression from the cyclin A promoter indicating that MDM2 protein binding has distinct affects on different pathways (47, 48) and MDM2 can modulate E2F-dependent activity (64)..

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	79	The regulation of MDM2 and p53 polypeptide function has been facilitated historically by first dissecting the proteins into individual functional domains. MDM2 protein contains several independent subdomains that either bind to the N-terminal BOX-I domain of p53, to the N terminus of the tumor suppressor p14ARF, to zinc, or to RNA. This current study addresses the intradomain or allosteric regulation of full-length MDM2 protein and evidence that ligand binding by MDM2 protein switches its affinity and/or specificity from the BOX-I domain of p53 to the conformationally responsive loop flanked by the BOX-IV and BOX-V domains. Three pieces of biochemical data have suggested previously that the MDM2 protein interface with tetrameric forms of p53 involves determinants outside the primary N-terminal BOX-I domain of p53. The first was the observation that MDM2 does not bind to mutant forms of p53 with an altered core domain conformation (25, 49). The second being the observation that full-length MDM2 protein does not bind to p53 DNA complexes in vitro, whereas the truncated N-terminal domain of MDM2 can bind stably to such p53 DNA complexes (18, 25). The final being the observation that MDM2 RNA complexes can bind to p53 protein lacking the N-terminal BOX-I domain (25). The determinants within the p53 tetramer that modulate MDM2 protein binding to the BOX-I domain or that stabilize MDM2 protein binding to sites outside the BOX-I domain were undefined prior to the studies described in this report..

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	81	The first protein that was shown to bind to p53 was the SV40 T-antigen (50, 51), although details about the structure of this complex are lacking. This interaction results in the inactivation of p53 function, and the binding occurs within the central domain of the p53 tetramer. Point mutations that unfold the p53 tetramer destabilize the p53 T-antigen complex suggesting a non-linear binding interaction exists between the two proteins (52). Additionally, classically purified T-antigen does not bind to p53 tetramers unless T-antigen is reconstituted with metal ions like zinc (53). The purification of T-antigen results in the loss of the activating metal ion and the re-binding of zinc induces a pronounced conformational change in T-antigen that restores its binding interface with p53 (53). A cellular protein that shares similar features to viral T-antigen is the p53 binding protein BP2. This latter protein was identified in a yeast-two hybrid screen that attempted to define cellular proteins that interact with wild-type but not mutant forms of p53 (54). Like T-antigen, BP2 interacts with p53 in the central domain and certain classes of mutations that can disrupt the p53 tetramer prevent stable binding of BP2 (52). Thus, T-antigen and BP2 proteins form the precedent for polypeptides that interact in a relatively complex and dynamic fashion within the central domain of the folded p53 tetramer. MDM2 protein interaction with p53 appears to be similarly sensitive to conformational effects..

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	83	MDM2 protein is composed of at least four independent functional domains that in isolation bind to RNA, zinc, ARF14, and the BOX-I domain of p53. We have set out in this report to develop a quantitative biochemical assay that can be used to begin to dissect interdomain or allosteric communication between these domains of MDM2. Three highlights are as follows: 1) MDM2 protein changes its conformation when bound to RNA; 2) this conformational change reduces MDM2 affinity with the primary peptide binding site in the N-terminal domain of p53; 3) this conformational change switches its specificity for a distinct peptide motif in the core domain of p53, pRb, and RNP-U. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a protein in a ligand-free and ligand-bound state switching specificity for a target protein and underscores the dynamic nature of MDM2 protein conformation control. It is not yet clear how ligand binding by MDM2 into possible permutations (i.e. MDM2 p14ARF, MDM2 RNA, MDM2 zinc, MDM2 RNA/zinc, etc.) is modulated in cells due to the difficulty in quantitating such MDM2 ligand complexes in living cells. As such it is not yet clear how RNA binding to MDM2 will regulate p53 protein transactivation, polyubiquitination, nuclear export, or degradation. However, these data demonstrate the dynamic nature of a hetero-oligomeric protein protein interaction where multiple ligand binding sites can direct the docking site specificity and identify an important MDM2 ligand to study for further insights in the p53 pathway. For example, although the homopolyribonucleotide polyrG was used as the RNA ligand that binds MDM2, the steady-state levels and accessibility of classes of cellular RNA that can bind to MDM2, like L5 ribosomal protein and its associated 5 S ribosomal RNA (16) or 28 S ribosomal RNA (55), will presumably regulate the pools of MDM2 in a cell that prefer to bind to the BOX-1 domain of p53 or to the S9-S10 linker region of p53. In addition, because the RNA binding RING finger domain is required for p53 transport, the MDM2 28 S RNA complex may, for example, be an important mediator of p53 regulation in vivo (55). Degradation of 28 S rRNA occurs during apoptosis in vivo (56). If this degradation destabilizes the MDM2 RNA complex, this may reduce the ability of MDM2 to bind to and inhibit the activity of p53 protein, thus freeing p53 to induce cell death. Our initial data suggest that a significant pool of MDM2 RNA complexes may exist in vivo, based on the observation that the S9-S10 linker mutant p53 proteins are expressed at higher steady-state levels than wild-type p53 protein (data not shown) and that they exhibit increases in MDM2-dependent ubiquitination in cells (Figs. 9 and 13). More quantitative cell-based assays may reveal subtle changes in the levels of wild-type p53 and the S9-S10 linker p53 protein mutants, providing an indirect measure of the MDM2 RNA isoform and ligand-free forms of MDM2 in cells. Because the RNA-bound form of MDM2 reveals a new peptide binding motif that is present in other proteins like snRNP-U, a protein complex involved in the assembly and/or export of ribosomal RNA particles (57), these data suggest first that the amount of RNA complexed to MDM2 may modulate the stability of other cellular proteins and second that therapeutic agents may be developed that discriminate between the ligand-free and RNA-bound forms of MDM2.

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   hGTSE-1 (human G2 and S phase-expressed-1) is a cell cycle-regulated protein mainly localized in the cytoplasm and apparently associated with the microtubules. hGTSE-1 is able to down-regulate levels and activity of the p53 tumor suppressor protein: it binds the C-terminal region of p53 and represses its ability to induce apoptosis after DNA damage. Here we report that, after DNA damage, hGTSE-1 becomes stabilized in a p53-independent way and accumulated in the nucleus. Further characterization of hGTSE-1 localization revealed increased nuclear staining in unstressed cells after treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B, or when a nuclear export signal (NES) located in its C-terminal region was mutated. Finally, we provide evidence that hGTSE-1 ectopic expression, in addition to p53 protein levels down-regulation, is able to enhance cytoplasmic localization of p53. Interestingly, NES-mutated hGTSE-1 accumulates in the nucleus, binds p53 but looses its ability to enhance cytoplasmic redistribution of p53 and to regulate p53 protein levels. Similarly, when wild type hGTSE-1 functions on p53 were analyzed in cells lacking Mdm2, it failed in regulating both p53 localization and protein levels, thus indicating that hGTSE-1 requires an intact NES and functional Mdm2 for the regulation of p53. Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of hGTSE-1 function, whereby its characterized nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling ability is required to regulate p53..

The tumor-suppressor p53 protein is a nuclear transcription factor that transactivates a variety of genes involved in growth arrest and apoptosis (1). Failure of p53 function can be attributed to the following: (a) inactivation of p53 by mutations altering its DNA binding capability (2), (b) deregulation of proteins that control p53 levels or activity (i.e. cellular or viral oncogenes) (3-5), and (c) nuclear exclusion that interferes with its role as transcription factor (6)..

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	7	Regulation of WT-p53 protein is based on a strict physiological turnover including ubiquitination and degradation in the cytoplasm. Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of p53 depends on nuclear export signals (NES)1 and nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) located in the N and C termini of the protein (7). The main regulator of p53 is Mdm2, which interacts with the N-terminal of p53 thus blocking p53 transcriptional activation and promoting its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (8). Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of p53 seems to be essential for its degradation by Mdm2 (9, 10). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that Mdm2 expression is a key factor that efficiently promotes nuclear export of p53 (11, 12). Important stimuli leading to p53 activation and stabilization such as DNA damage, which causes phosphorylation of the N-terminal NES (13), or p14ARF expression, which interferes with Mdm2 activity (14), efficiently inhibit p53 nuclear exclusion. On the contrary, proteins like E1B55k (15), Mot-2 (16), Parc (17), or PSF-TFE3 (18) are able to down-regulate or destabilize p53 by cytoplasmic sequestration, thus emphasizing the importance of p53 relocalization as an effective means to control its function..

Three NLSs and one NES are located within amino acids 316 and 384 of p53. It has been proposed that p53 localization is mainly regulated by the NES masking/NES exposition switch (21). Mdm2-driven ubiquitination or certain mutations of the p53 C-terminal region enhance p53 relocalization to the cytoplasm (22, 23)..

By studying hGTSE-1 subcellular localization we found that it is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein containing an active NES in its C-terminal region. We also demonstrate that in addition to decreasing p53 levels, hGTSE-1 expression promotes p53 localization to the cytoplasm. Finally, we show that shuttling activity of hGTSE-1 as well as Mdm2 are both required for the regulation of p53 localization and levels..

As shown in Fig. 1A, no differences in hGTSE-1 protein levels were observed between WT or mutant p53 conformations, indicating that the expression of hGTSE-1 protein is not induced by WT-p53. This observation is supported by the fact that p53 failed to increase hGTSE-1 mRNA levels in Northern blot analysis in the same cellular system (data not shown)..

As shown in Fig. 1B, hGTSE-1 expression increased after -irradiation (400 rads) in all tested cell lines. Similar results were obtained using 100  microM ET (data not shown), suggesting that hGTSE-1 protein levels increase after genotoxic stress independently of p53 status. A time course experiment after ET treatment was performed to study the behavior of endogenous hGTSE-1 protein upon DNA damage in U2OS cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, Western blot analysis revealed that the hGTSE-1 protein increased 15-18 h after treatment with ET. Furthermore, analysis of p53 response in this context showed that hGTSE-1 becomes accumulated with a slower kinetic compared with both p53 and the p53-induced protein p21Waf-1 (32), detected 3 and 6-9 h after ET treatment, respectively, indicating that hGTSE-1 increases in a late phase after DNA damage..

Overexpression of hGTSE-1, however, revealed a small subpopulation of cells that, in addition to cytoplasmic staining, displayed nuclear staining (data not shown). This observation prompted us to analyze whether a change in hGTSE-1 localization could be associated to a DNA damage response. To this purpose, endogenous and ectopically expressed hGTSE-1 localization were analyzed in U2OS cells 24 h after ET treatment. As shown in Fig. 2A, ET treatment evidenced a significant fraction of cells with nuclear-localized hGTSE-1. Scoring hGTSE-1 localization in cells treated with ET, as well as its localization in cells treated with other DNA damaging agents as methyl methanesulfonate (100  microM) or UV irradiation (20 J/m2) (see "Experimental Procedures"), indicated that DNA damage efficiently relocalized hGTSE-1 to the nucleus (Fig. 2B). Finally, the kinetics of hGTSE-1 relocalization were monitored in U2OS cells ectopically expressing hGTSE-1 at different time points after ET treatment. As shown in Fig. 2C, ET treatment strongly enhanced hGTSE-1 relocalization to the nucleus 13-18 h after damage, coincident with the previous information related to the accumulation of the endogenous protein (Fig. 1C). Altogether these observations indicate that hGTSE-1 becomes stabilized and relocalized to the nucleus in response to DNA damage signals..

We generated human and mouse GTSE-1 constructs with a double-point mutation within the putative NES (hGTSE-1 NES- and GTSE-1 NES-, respectively) by changing isoleucine 628 and leucine 630 to alanine in hGTSE-1, and leucines 648 and 650 to alanine in GTSE-1 as indicated in Fig. 3B. hGTSE-1 NES- and GTSE-1 NES- constructs were transfected in U2OS cells and 24 h later their localizations were assessed by immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3C, both NES mutants displayed an enhanced nuclear localization, thus identifying the presence of an active NES within GTSE-1 proteins. This result is in accordance with the enhanced nuclear localization of hGTSE-1 and GTSE-1 observed after LMB treatment, because such a drug inhibits nuclear export pathways that require the CRM1 receptor for leucine-rich NESs (34-36). Accumulation of GTSE-1 proteins to the nucleus could imply another control at the level of nuclear entry, in addition to the described regulation of nuclear export. However, point mutation of two putative NLSs starting on amino acids 235 and 542, failed to completely abolish nuclear localization of hGTSE-1 (data not shown), indicating that other signals or other factors could be involved in such activity..

We chose the GFP-tagged p53 construct because it represents a sensible and broadly used method to detect p53 localization (10, 12, 19) and is poorly sensitive to hGTSE-1-induced degradation (see Fig. 5C). 24 h post-transfection cells were fixed and GFP-p53 localization was analyzed by GFP fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 4A hGTSE-1 overexpression markedly increased cytoplasmic localization of GFP-p53. To further control this effect we performed the same experiments in p53-knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF p53-/-), GFP-p53. Importantly, mouse GTSE-1 induced similar effects on p53 cellular distribution (Fig. 4B), strengthening the relevance of these proteins on p53 function. To quantify their ability to induce cytoplasmic localization of p53, three independent experiments were performed considering at least 200 cells coexpressing GFP-p53 and hGTSE-1 or GTSE-1 per assay. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, hGTSE-1 and GTSE-1 expression significantly correlate with cells displaying increased cytoplasmic p53, thus suggesting that GTSE-1 proteins are able to promote cytoplasmic localization of p53. This result was confirmed by nucleo-cytoplasmic cell fractionation followed by Western blot (see Fig. 5C, hGTSE-1 WT). When hGTSE-1 and GFP-p53 were transfected in mouse cells, p53 relocalized to the cytoplasm as efficiently as observed in human cells, indicating that the observed effect is not cell- or species-specific (data not shown)..

To address this point we transfected hGTSE-1 or its NES mutant together with GFP-p53 in MEF p53-/- similarly as performed on Fig. 4. As indicated in representative images shown in Fig. 5A, hGTSE-1 NES- displayed an impaired ability in enhancing cytoplasmic relocalization of p53.

A, GFP-p53 localization on MEF p53-/-, Mdm2-/- overexpressing hGTSE-1. The image shows hGTSE-1 (upper panel) and GFP-p53 (lower panel) staining on the same field. B, MEF p53-/-, Mdm2-/- were transfected with hGTSE-1, Mdm2, or their combination as indicated together with GFP-p53 expressing vector. p53 localization was then determined by fluorescence microscopy as described. C, WT-p53 or 22.23-p53 were transfected together with GFP or GFP-hGTSE-1 as indicated in MEF p53-/-. p53 was stained using a specific polyclonal antibody. p53 localization was then determined in cells expressing GFP or GFP-hGTSE-1 by fluorescence microscopy. D, determination of p53 protein levels in MEF p53-/-, Mdm2-/- cotransfected with WT-p53 together with an empty vector or hGTSE-1 WT (WT). DO-1 monoclonal antibody was used to detect p53, GFP was used as transfection control..

MEF p53-/- cells were transfected with WT-p53 or 22.23-p53 in combination with GFP-hGTSE-1 or GFP vectors and analyzed by staining with a specific anti-p53 polyclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 6C, whereas GFP-hGTSE-1 expression enhanced WT-p53 nuclear export, it failed in relocalizing 22.23-p53 to the cytoplasm in MEF p53-/-, supporting our previous results indicating that hGTSE-1 enhances p53 cytoplasmic localization through a Mdm2-dependent mechanism..

To this purpose cells were transfected with vectors expressing WT or NES- hGTSE-1 and p53, together with an empty GFP vector used as transfection control as performed in Fig. 5E.

We provide evidence that hGTSE-1 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein that becomes stabilized and accumulates in the nucleus after DNA damage, independently of p53 status. We show that hGTSE-1 nuclear export depends on a C-terminal NES that, when mutated, increases its nuclear localization.

Under stress conditions, p53 is activated by a variety of post-translational modifications that altogether lead to its rapid stabilization and accumulation in the nucleus (7). These modifications are usually necessary for the association of p53 with factors involved in its stabilization and activation, such as Pin-1 (40) and/or for dissociation from factors that negatively regulate p53, like Mdm2 or JNK (41, 42). On the contrary, during post-damage recovery, negative regulators play a critical role in down-regulating p53 levels and activity to restore its steady-state function. It can be hypothesized that such a recovery phase requests for other regulators, like hGTSE-1, in addition to the most established ones..

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	67	In this report we show that hGTSE-1 protein levels increase in response to several DNA-damaging agents. Because we have recently demonstrated that hGTSE-1 expression attenuates DNA damage-induced apoptosis by controlling p53 function (27), increased levels of hGTSE-1 protein after DNA damage may be involved in negative feedback regulation of the p53 signaling pathway. Consistent with this model, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of hGTSE-1 sensitizes cells to p53-dependent apoptosis upon DNA damage (27). Thus, hGTSE-1 may play an important role in DNA damage response, by preventing prolonged p53 activation. Further analysis of the behavior of hGTSE-1 allowed us to show that, after DNA damage, hGTSE-1 is clearly relocalized from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Time course experiments performed to dissect the kinetics of hGTSE-1 enhanced expression and nuclear accumulation after DNA damage, indicate that both occur with a slower rate when compared with p53 stabilization, activation, and p21Waf-1 induction. This observation could imply that, at early time points after DNA damage, hGTSE-1 should not interfere with the p53 response, rather, it could play a critical role in controlling a later phase in the p53 response, most likely in the post-damage recovery phase..

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	71	Shuttling activity of hGTSE-1 therefore emerged as a potentially critical mechanism for controlling p53 localization and stability. In line with this hypothesis, coexpression of hGTSE-1 and p53 (used as GFP-tagged protein) resulted in increased cytoplasmic distribution of p53 when compared with localization of p53 alone. hGTSE-1 is known to interact with p53 in a region mapped between amino acids 355 and 393 (27), where two NLS are located (7). Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination of lysine residues found within these NLSs results in enhanced cytoplasmic localization of p53 (23), suggesting that modification to this region could lead to p53 nuclear export. In this context, physical interaction of hGTSE-1 with p53 could affect this region, enhancing p53 cytoplasmic localization. Importantly, hGTSE-1 shuttling activity is required to promote p53 localization to the cytoplasm. Our results clearly demonstrate that NES defective hGTSE-1 failed in enhancing p53 distribution to the cytoplasm, although its ability to associate p53 was comparable with WT hGTSE-1. It is therefore conceivable that cytoplasmic redistribution of p53, as enhanced by hGTSE-1, is not merely because of alterations or modifications of the C-terminal domain of p53 caused by this interaction, rather, our data also indicate the requirement of hGTSE-1 shuttling activity. Interestingly, Mdm2, known to efficiently promote p53 nuclear exclusion (11, 12) is also required for the hGTSE-1 effect on p53 localization, because we observed that hGTSE-1 WT shows an impaired ability in relocalizing p53 in Mdm2-deficient cells..

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	73	Similarly to that observed for p53 relocalization, an intact NES and functional Mdm2 seem to be required by hGTSE-1 in regulation of p53 protein levels, indicating a relationship between the ability of hGTSE-1 to relocalize p53 to the cytoplasm and to regulate its stability. Moreover, inhibition of proteasome activity prevents p53 protein down-regulation by hGTSE-1 expression, indicating that cytoplasmic localization of p53 could be accompanied by proteasome-dependent degradation. The Mdm2 ring finger domain and its ability to ubiquitinate p53 have been shown to be critical in promoting p53 nuclear export (11, 12) and degradation in the cytoplasm (10, 38). The possibility that hGTSE-1 could promote p53 nuclear export by enhancing Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination of p53 does not seem to be consistent with our data, because no detectable increase in p53 ubiquitination was observed in the in vivo ubiquitination assay (data not shown). We thus favor the hypothesis that hGTSE-1 accelerates the p53 nuclear export process after Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination..

Therefore, we could hypothesize that nuclear accumulation of hGTSE-1, in response to DNA damage, could be because of the phosphorylation-dependent mechanism-inactivating NES function. Subsequently, in the post-damage recovery phase, reactivation of hGTSE-1 NES activity through dephosphorylation could be required for the efficient regulatory function of hGTSE-1 on p53..

Moreover, p53 localization was reported to change during the cell cycle, with increased cytoplasmic distribution during S and G2 (43, 44), coincident with hGTSE-1 highest expression.

In fact, the ability of hGTSE-1 to regulate the cell cycle progression is p53 independent (27). Other proteins such as JNK (42), Pin-1 (40), or p38 kinase (45) play a role in p53 signaling although their regulation does not depend on p53, thus suggesting that p53 function is tightly controlled by independent signaling pathways..

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	4	Precisely how mutant p53 exerts a dominant negative effect over wild type p53 has been an enigma. To understand how wild type and mutant p53 form hetero-oligomers, we studied p53 biogenesis in vitro. We show here that p53 dimers are formed cotranslationally (on the polysome), whereas tetramers are formed posttranslationally (by the dimerization of dimers in solution). Coexpression of wild type and mutant p53 therefore results in 50% of the p53 generated being heterotetramers comprised of a single species: wild type dimer/mutant dimer. Using hot spot mutants of p53 and a variety of natural target sites, we show that all wild type/mutant heterotetramers manifest impaired DNA binding activity. This impairment is not due to the mutant dimeric subunit inhibiting association of the complex with DNA but rather due to the lack of significant contribution (positive cooperativity) from the mutant partner. For all heterotetramers, bias in binding is particularly pronounced against those sequences in genes responsible for apoptosis rather than cell growth arrest. These results explain the molecular basis of p53 dominant negative effect and suggest a functional role in the regulation of p53 tetramerization.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	6	The importance of p53 as a tumor suppressor has been well documented. Over half of all human cancers are mutated in the gene encoding p53, and many viruses can induce transformation of the host cell through p53 inactivation (Ref. 1; reviewed in Refs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, inheriting a germline p53 mutation characteristic of Li-Fraumeni syndrome confers a strong predisposition to cancer because 50% of those afflicted acquire cancer by age 30 (4, 5). The role of p53 in tumorigenesis was also demonstrated in an animal tumor model, in which p53/ mice were found to be more prone to cancer development (primarily lymphomas) compared with their wild type (p53+/+) and heterozygous (p53+/) littermates (6, 7). Loss of p53 or its function is therefore clearly linked to tumor formation..

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	8	As "guardian of the genome," p53 is activated by a number of genotoxic and stress signals such as ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, ribonucleotide depletion, hypoxia, oxidative stress, heat shock, and exposure to nitric oxide (reviewed in Ref. 8). Critical to the tumor-suppressing function of activated p53 is its ability to bind sequence-specific DNA sites and induce the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. This is illustrated by the fact that most p53 mutations occur in its DNA-binding domain and affect its sequence-specific DNA binding ability (1). Such mutations (called "hot spot" mutations) can be divided into two categories; class I mutations affect residues that make direct contact with DNA, whereas class II mutations occur at residues crucial for maintaining the conformation of the DNA-binding domain (9)..
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	9	The consensus p53 binding site consists of two or more copies of the 10-bp half-site 5'-PuPuPuC(A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPy-3' separated by up to 13 bp (10). Minor variations to this consensus sequence are found in all p53 target genes. Each half-site consists of two inverted repeat 5-bp quarter sites. p53 binds to this consensus DNA sequence as a pair of clamps, with the two monomers within each dimer binding to two consecutive quarter sites within a half-site (11). The two dimers within the tetramer therefore bind to the two half-sites in juxtaposition to each other, resulting in overall enhanced stability of the p53-DNA complex. The lack of such cooperative binding in a single dimer-half-site interaction accounts for the drastically reduced stability of the dimer-half-site complex relative to that of the tetramer-full site complex. This is also reflected by the observation that in contrast to full sites, half-sites do not confer transcriptional responsiveness to p53.1.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	11	Although there is little doubt that tumors often arise through deletion or mutation of both p53 alleles (the two-hit model) (12), there is increasing evidence that a point mutation or deletion in a single allele could result in increased susceptibility to cancer (13-17). In cases where both mutant and wild type p53 are expressed, it has been suggested that the mutant protein exerts a dominant negative effect over the wild type protein, essentially rendering the latter inactive (reviewed in Refs. 18 and 19). The end result is a drastic decrease in the level of functional p53, which in turn promotes genomic instability and cancer development. That the mere reduction in functional p53 levels may be sufficient to promote tumorigenesis has also been recently shown in an animal tumor model in which heterozygous p53+/ mice containing a single wild type p53 allele develop tumors much earlier than those mice with two functional p53 alleles (17)..

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	13	The fact that many human tumors contain both a mutant and a wild type allele has led to speculations as to how mutant p53 can affect wild type p53 function. It has been proposed (and generally believed) that in such tumors, the mutant p53 protein complexes with the wild type counterpart and drives the latter into a mutant conformation that is nonfunctional (i.e. incapable of binding DNA). This model portrays mutant p53 as being dominant over wild type p53, leading to the so-called "dominant negative" effect. Support for this model has come largely from experiments in which mutant and wild type p53 were found to be coprecipitatable when they are coexpressed (20). More recent data suggest that the C-terminal oligomerization domain of p53 is absolutely required for the manifestation of this dominant negative effect, because p53 mutants without a functional tetramerization domain are not dominant negative and not oncogenic (21, 22). Although it now seems clear that p53 mutants need to interact with wild type p53 to impart a dominant negative effect (23), there is no concrete evidence that this effect is the result of an induced conformational change of the wild type protein. Indeed, it has been reported that mutant p53 proteins that have a wild type conformation (class I mutants) are also able to impart a dominant negative effect (24). In corroboration with the above observation was the demonstration that the C-terminal oligomerization domain alone is sufficient to disrupt normal wild type p53 function (25, 26). In view of the somewhat fragmentary and at times apparently contradictory information obtained thus far pertaining to the mechanistic aspects of the p53 dominant negative effect (reviewed in Refs. 18 and 19), a unifying concept that can accommodate most, if not all, of the observations made to date is badly needed. Such information would provide a better understanding of the role of p53 mutants in tumor development and would lead to the design of more precise and effective therapeutic measures in restoring wild type p53 function..

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	15	We approached this problem by first studying the biogenesis of p53 in vitro. We demonstrate here that dimerization of p53 occurs on the polysome (i.e. cotranslationally), whereas tetramerization (dimer-dimer interaction) occurs in solution (i.e. posttranslationally). Thus, coexpression of wild type and mutant p53 results in only a single heterotetrameric species of p53 (wild type dimer/mutant dimer), representing 50% of total p53. Through the use of hot spot mutants of p53 (none of which is capable of strong binding to DNA) and a variety of natural p53 target sites, we show that all heterotetramers bind poorly to these sites compared with the wild type p53 tetramer. Such impaired binding is not likely due to mutant-imposed conformational change of wild type p53 but rather is due to the lack of complementary binding by the mutant dimeric subunit (positive dimer-dimer cooperativity). We propose this "incompetent partner" model, which reconciles a number of puzzling observations to date, as the basis of the p53 dominant negative effect. The dominant negative effect is more pronounced with sequences linked to apoptotic response than those responsible for cell growth arrest, supporting the notion that the lack of apoptotic cell death likely plays a more important role than does loss of cell growth control in cancer development.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	26	p53 Dimerization Occurs Cotranslationally-- To gain a complete understanding of how p53 monomers reach a tetrameric state, we carried out in vitro experiments to study the biogenesis pathway of p53. It was important to first determine whether p53 dimerization occurs cotranslationally or posttranslationally. To this end, we used transcripts of a dimeric mutant named A344 for in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. This mutant contains a point mutation at residue 344 (from leucine to alanine) that disrupts the dimer-dimer interface and results in the formation of dimeric rather than tetrameric p53 (27). We reasoned that if p53 dimerization was a posttranslational event, then the efficiency of dimer formation would be strictly dependent on the concentration of the translated A344 protein (and hence the concentration of the transcripts) in the reaction. Conversely, the efficiency of cotranslational dimer formation (i.e. on the polysome) would not be affected by transcript concentration. Accordingly, various amounts of A344 transcripts were translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and dimer formation in these reactions was assessed by direct half-site DNA binding analysis using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).2 Because monomeric p53 cannot bind DNA (22), the results should be relatively unambiguous. Fig. 1 shows that regardless of transcript concentration in the reactions (three serial 2-fold dilutions), the dimer/total A344 ratios remained relatively constant. These results are consistent with the notion that p53 dimerization occurs cotranslationally rather than posttranslationally..

A, identical fixed volumes of each 35S-labeled translation mixture were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for total A344 protein expressed (upper panel) and by EMSA for dimeric A344 through its binding to a 32P-labeled half-site (H1) (lower panel). B, similar to A except that the amounts of translation mixture analyzed were adjusted to compensate for the dilution factor such that all samples contained approximately the same amount of translated protein. For EMSA analysis, the 35S signal was blocked such that it did not interfere with film exposure to 32P..
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	29	To further confirm that p53 dimerization is a cotranslational event, we made use of another dimeric construct, A344N (Fig. 2A). A344N is derived from A344 and has a small deletion at the N terminus (residues 2-30), making it migrate faster than A344 upon SDS-PAGE. Like A344, A344N bound the consensus DNA half-site as dimeric p53 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, because of this deletion, A344N was unable to interact with the anti-p53 antibody DO-1, which readily recognized A344 (Fig. 2C, lanes 1-6). Because DO-1 is capable of recognizing a monomer within a dimer (see below), it was used in coprecipitation studies to see whether cotranslation of the two constructs could lead to the formation of A344/A344N heterodimers detectable by this antibody. The results show that under translation conditions using normal concentrations of RNA, where the two constructs formed dimers readily (as assessed by EMSA), DO-1 precipitated A344 but not A344N (Fig. 2C, lanes 7 and 8). These data strongly suggest that p53 dimers form cotranslationally. To rule out the possibility that A344/A344N heterodimers are unstable or undetectable, we cotranslated the two transcripts at high RNA concentrations. Under these conditions, space constraint allowed some nascent polypeptide chains from neighboring transcripts to interact (28), resulting in a small amount of A344N complexing with A344 and precipitable with DO-1 (Fig. 2C, lanes 9 and 10). This shows that the lack of detection of A344/A344N heterodimers under translation conditions using normal concentrations of RNA is not due to instability of the A344/A344N heterodimers. It also demonstrates that the antibody DO-1 is capable of interacting with a monomer within a p53 dimer..

When the two constructs were translated separately, DO-1 precipitated wild type p53 (hp53) but not the truncated construct hp53N (Fig. 4B, lanes 1-6). When the two transcripts were mixed at approximately equimolar ratios and then translated, heterotetramers formed readily as detectable by DO-1 (Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 8). Furthermore, the ratio of hp53 to hp53N following immunoprecipitation with DO-1 was ~2:1 (after normalizing to expression levels), precisely what would be expected for dimers of each species randomly oligomerizing in solution to form tetramers (see below). These results therefore again suggest that tetramerization (dimerization of dimers) is a posttranslational process..

These species should be clearly discernible using the antibody DO-1 for supershift experiments in EMSA. The results of such an experiment are shown in Fig. 4C. When translated separately, hp53, but not hp53N, was supershifted by DO-1 (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 4 and 6). Cotranslation of hp53 and hp53N transcripts yielded a total of three species, two of which could be supershifted by DO-1 (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 7 and 8). These results are again consistent with the cotranslational dimerization/posttranslational tetramerization model. As mentioned above, the molar ratio of the three species should ideally be 1:2:1 (assuming proteins from the two constructs were synthesized in equimolar amounts). However, we consistently found (hp53)4 to be somewhat under-represented (Fig. 4C, lane 8, top band). This was likely due to DO-1 partially blocking the binding of (hp53)4 to the consensus sequence, thereby reducing the level of (hp53)4-bound DNA (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 3 and 4). A similar observation has been previously reported for the antibody PAb246, which recognizes wild type murine p53 (11). The binding of the (hp53)2/(hp53N)2 tetramer to DNA was apparently unaffected by DO-1, possibly because only one of the two dimers interacted with the antibody. Overall, the results from the two sets of experiments involving dimeric and tetrameric constructs, respectively, are consistent with the idea that p53 biogenesis is a two-step process: cotranslational dimerization followed by posttranslational tetramerization. This is in agreement with previous results on the folding of peptides from the tetramerization domain of p53 (29)..

On the other hand, because dimer-dimer interaction (tetramerization) is a posttranslational event, there is a good possibility that dimeric subunit exchange between p53 tetramers can occur with a certain degree of efficiency (30).

After a 2-h incubation period, there was a clear increase of heterotetramer formation. This shows that dimers within a tetramer of p53 can exchange with one another and that they are in equilibrium. This equilibrium strongly favors tetramers over dimers because the vast majority of p53 present following translation and maturation is tetrameric (11). Our demonstration of dimer exchange between tetramers is again congruent with the concept of p53 tetramerization being a posttranslational process involving the dimerization of dimers..

Our present demonstration that p53 tetramers are formed by posttranslational dimerization of dimers suggests that in cells (e.g. Li-Fraumeni cells) containing a wild type and a mutant p53 allele, only a single species of heterotetramers would be generated: (wt-p53)2/(mu-p53)2.

As expected, all five mutant homotetramers manifest extremely low, if any, affinity for the p53 consensus sequence (Fig. 6B, lanes 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17). In contrast, the five heterotetramers manifested significant consensus sequence binding activity, ranging from 40 to 100% that of the control (hp53)2/(hp53N)2 tetramer (Figs. 6B and 7). Moreover, all five DNA-bound heterotetramers were stably bound, with half-lives ranging from 4.7 to 17.5 min (data not shown), which was significantly longer than that of a wild type dimer bound to a half-site (half-life, ~1 s) (11, 31). Therefore, for both class I and class II mutants, the inability of the mutant dimeric subunit to bind CON does not negatively affect the capacity of the wild type dimer subunit to bind DNA. It thus seems unlikely that in a mutant/wild type p53 heterotetramer, the mutant dimer imposes a mutant conformation upon the wild type dimer. This is consistent with observations by others on heterotetramer binding to DNA (32, 33) and our previous demonstration that within a p53 tetramer, the two dimeric subunits are conformationally independent (31)..

These were taken from genes involved in cell cycle arrest (p21 and 14-3-3), apoptosis (cyclin G, Fas, PIDD, IGF-BP3, and bax), DNA repair (gadd45), and p53 stability (hdm2), whose transcription was found to occur in a p53- dependent manner.

As shown in Fig. 7 (left panels), cotranslation of hp53 and hp53N (the wild type control) generated three tetrameric species ((hp53)4, (hp53)2/(hp53N)2, and (hp53N)4), all of which bound to each of the 10 sequences in the approximate ratio of 1:2:1 (the slight variation in migration rates between target sequences was due to size (charge) differences of these sequences). However, cotranslation of the five mutants with hp53N revealed a very different scenario. First, none of the mutant homotetramers were capable of efficient binding to any of the target sites (i.e. the equivalent of the uppermost band shown in the control ((hp53)4) was either weak or not present at all in the mutant/hp53N cotranslations). This was not unexpected because all of the mutants were known class I or class II mutants. Second, and importantly, all five mutant p53/hp53N heterotetramers bind the 10 target sites relatively poorly compared with the wild type p53/hp53N heterotetramer, although the binding to CON was the least affected (Fig. 7, right panels). Reduced binding capacity of the heterotetramer was less pronounced for the mutant H273 but was clearly manifest for the other four mutants (H175, S249, Q248, and W248) (note different scales used). We reason that the reduced binding to these natural p53 target sequences is likely due to the lack of significant input in the form of complementary (and cooperative) binding from the mutant dimeric partner.

In particular, all of the mutant heterotetramers show drastically reduced binding to promoter sequences that govern apoptosis, namely, PIDD, IGF-BP3, and bax, compared with the other promoters, such as p21, that regulate cell cycle progression..

In particular, all of the mutant heterotetramers show drastically reduced binding to promoter sequences that govern apoptosis, namely, PIDD, IGF-BP3, and bax, compared with the other promoters, such as p21, that regulate cell cycle progression..

Heterotetramer DNA binding varies depending on the mutation in one dimer and the target site. hp53N was translated with hp53 or various class I (H273, Q248, and W248) or class II (S249 and H175) p53 mutants in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Samples from each translation reaction were subjected to EMSA analysis by binding to various 32P-labeled target sites as indicated (left panels) (Table I). Radioactivity counts for each 32P-labeled target site were equalized prior to use. After film exposure, the dried gels were used for PhosphorImager analysis to quantify heterotetramer band intensity (right panels). hp53/hp53N bands served as controls, and their intensity was set at 100%. Quantified mutant-hp53N heterotetramer bands are expressed as a percentage of hp53-hp53N band intensity. The experiments were performed three times, and the average band intensity with standard deviation is shown.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	51	It is generally accepted that the p53 tetramer is a dimer of dimers. However, precisely how this comes about has been an enigma. It has been assumed that p53 comes off the polysome as monomers, which then dimerize in solution to form dimers; dimer-dimer interaction in turn leads to the formation of tetramers (34, 35). The present study shows that this scenario is incorrect; we demonstrate that p53 dimerization occurs cotranslationally (i.e. on the polysome), whereas tetramerization occurs posttranslationally (i.e. in solution) (Fig. 8A). In normal cells in which both p53 alleles are wild type, whether dimerization occurs cotranslationally or posttranslationally probably has no major theoretical ramifications. However, this is not the case where the cell harbors a wild type and a mutant p53 allele. Based on a posttranslational dimerization/posttranslational tetramerization mechanism (the currently accepted model), wild type p53 tetramers in such cells would comprise only of total p53. On the other hand, the alternative mechanism (cotranslational dimerization/posttranslational tetramerization) would result in 1/4 of total p53 in these cells being wild type tetramers, a 4-fold difference that may well be sufficient to alter the fate of these cells upon exposure to genotoxic stress. This is an important consideration in view of the recent observation that the mere reduction in p53 levels is sufficient to promote tumorigenesis (17). Our results are compatible with the cotranslational dimerization/posttranslational tetramerization model..

Assembly of two p53 nascent polypeptide chains occurs cotranslationally with the two chains interacting during the final stages of protein synthesis (i.e. close to the 3' end of the mRNA). p53 leaves the polysome as a dimer that eventually interacts with another dimer to form a tetramer (posttranslational tetramerization). B, p53 DNA binding and dominant negative effect. Panel i, wild type p53 homotetramer binds to the target site with both dimeric subunits interacting with the two half-sites of the target sequence. Stability of this binding is further enhanced by positive cooperative interaction between the two dimers. Panel ii, mutant p53 homotetramers are unable to bind DNA (or bind DNA very poorly) because they have mutations either in residues that make direct contact with DNA (class I mutants) or in residues that are crucial for maintaining the conformation of the DNA-binding domain (class II mutants). Panel iii, p53 dominant negative effect: the "incompetent partner" model. In wild type p53/mutant p53 heterotetramers, it is unlikely that the mutant dimer imposes a conformational change on the wild type dimer, which can still bind to a half-site. The inability of the mutant dimer to "properly" bind to the other half-site and to contribute significantly to positive cooperativity results in an unstable heterotetramer-DNA complex. The extent of reduced positive cooperativity varies between target sequences..
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	54	In concluding that p53 dimerization occurs cotranslationally, we are suggesting that neighboring nascent p53 chains on a polysome interact with each other prior to being released into the cytosol (Fig. 8A). Such a dimerization scheme would be highly efficient because it would spare individual p53 subunits the need to search for their "partners" in a soluble pool. Precisely how monomeric p53 nascent chains interact with each other is unclear at present. Based on our current knowledge of the p53 dimerization domain, which is located at the C terminus of the protein (residues 323-356 (30, 36-38)), it would seem logical to deduce that interaction between neighboring chains occurs during the late stages of the translation process, close to the 3' end of the p53 transcript and just prior to release of the p53 chains from the polysome. However, one cannot rule out the possibility that interaction between neighboring nascent chains first occurs at more upstream sites, which then gives way to more a stable interaction at the C-terminal oligomerization domain as soon as this becomes feasible. Considering the highly hydrophobic nature of the oligomerization domain (30, 36-38), cotranslational dimerization would offer an efficient means by which hydrophobic residues from neighboring chains could quickly interact such that protein misfolding would be greatly minimized..
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	55	In light of the model presented for the biogenesis, it is possible that the tetramerization process could represent a form of functional regulation. Assuming that p53 is imported to the nucleus as a dimer, an attractive hypothesis would be that dimeric p53 represents a latent, inactive form of p53 requiring a signal to induce tetramerization and activation. Then, following activation, degradation could be achieved by once again forming dimers to reveal a nuclear export sequence hidden in the tetramerization domain (34, 39, 40). One way of accomplishing this could be through the posttranslational modification of p53. To date, numerous posttranslational modifications have been described (reviewed in Ref. 8). In vitro, phosphorylation of Ser-315 and Ser-392 have been shown to affect p53 tetramerization (41, 42). Others have suggested potential roles for SUMOylation and ubiquitination in p53 activation and degradation by altering its oligomeric state (39, 40, 43, 44). Further experimentation is needed to properly address this issue..

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	57	Perhaps the most important conclusion from these studies pertains to the so-called p53 dominant negative effect whereby a mutant p53 protein somehow negatively affects the function of the wild type counterpart (reviewed in Refs.18 and 19). Our results suggest that in cells possessing a wild type and a mutant p53 allele, there is only one type of heterotetramer produced, namely wild type dimer/mutant dimer. The mutant dimeric subunit within such a heterotetramer does not exert its negative effect by totally abrogating DNA binding of the complex. Based on results from the present study and our previous observation that the two dimers within a tetramer are conformationally independent (31), we favor the idea that the mutant dimer does not cause a conformational change in the wild type dimer. Rather, the lack of significant contribution (positive cooperativity) from the mutant partner leads to the overall weakened DNA binding of the heterotetramer (Fig. 8B). Because such heterotetramers bind DNA stronger than wild type dimers alone, it is likely that some cooperativity still exists and that different target sites require varying degrees of dimer-dimer cooperativity within a p53 tetramer for DNA binding. Our model (the "incompetent partner" model) also explains why small polypeptides corresponding to the p53 oligomerization domain alone could interfere with wild type p53 function (25, 26) (because they block wild type p53 tetramerization but not dimerization) and that mutants without a functional tetramerization domain are not oncogenic (22) (because they cannot interfere with wild type p53 tetramer formation)..
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	58	Although the present study clearly demonstrates that essentially all the wild type/mutant heterotetramers manifest reduced DNA binding affinity compared with the wild type protein, the extent of this reduction varies greatly and depends on both the mutant and the target sequence. Of the five mutants examined, H273 appears to exert the least dominant negative effect over the wild type protein. For example, its presence in the heterotetramer has little or no affect on the binding of the latter to the CON or p21 sequence, whereas the other heterotetramers bind to these sequences with greatly reduced efficiency. This could explain why, unlike other p53 mutants, ectopically expressed mutant H273 is still capable of CON-dependent transactivation (45-47). With the other sequences, however, H273 exerts a clear dominant negative effect on the wild type protein. But here again, this effect is not as pronounced as those manifested by the other mutants. It is interesting that H273, being the second most common p53 mutation in human cancer, is the least dominant negative by most accounts. Our results indicate that mutants W248 and Q248 are the most dominant negative mutants of the five, which could in turn explain why Li-Fraumeni patients with mutations at Arg-248 rarely display loss of heterozygosity (48); apparently Arg-248 mutation in one allele is sufficient to incapacitate wild type p53 from the normal allele..

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	60	Another striking observation pertains to the target sequences. For all the five mutants used, the p21 sequence that regulates cell growth arrest is by far the least sensitive to the dominant negative effects of these mutants. In sharp contrast, sequences that regulate apoptosis such as bax, PIDD, and IGF-BP3 all manifest very low affinity for the heterotetramers. Additionally, we found the half-lives of the p21-heterotetramer complexes to be markedly longer (by 10-30-fold) than those of bax-, PIDD-, or IGF-BP3-heterotetramers (data not shown). This bias was also demonstrable using wild type p53 (data not shown). Such differential binding affinity explains recent transactivation studies showing that p53 mutants were more dominant negative for induction of apoptosis than for growth arrest in human cancer cell lines (49). It also shows why mutants are not dominant negative in vivo when assayed for p53-dependent growth arrest (50, 51)..

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	62	In summary, by studying p53 biogenesis in vitro, we demonstrate for the first time that p53 dimerization occurs cotranslationally, whereas dimer-dimer interaction (tetramerization) occurs posttranslationally. Thus in cells possessing a wild type and mutant p53 allele, only one type of heterotetramers is present: wild type dimer-mutant dimer. These heterotetramers manifest reduced binding affinity for all p53 target sequences tested, not because the mutant dimer necessarily imposes a mutant conformation on the wild type dimer, but because it has low affinity for DNA and therefore cannot significantly contribute to the overall stability of the p53-DNA complex. Reduced affinity was particularly marked for sequences that govern apoptosis rather than cell growth arrest, suggesting that defects in apoptotic cell death probably play an important role in cancer development in Li-Fraumeni patients.

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	5	Prompt reconstitution of hematopoiesis after cytoreductive therapy is essential for patient recovery and may have a positive impact on long-term prognosis. We examined the role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in hematopoietic recovery in vivo after treatment with the cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). We used p53 knock-out (p53/) and wild-type (p53+/+) mice injected with 5-FU as the experimental model. Analysis of the repopulation ability and clonogenic activity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their lineage-committed descendants showed a greater number of HSCs responsible for reconstitution of lethally irradiated recipients in p53/ bone marrow cells (BMCs) recovering after 5-FU treatment than in the corresponding p53+/+ BMCs. In post-5-FU recovering BMCs, the percentage of HSC-enriched Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ cells was about threefold higher in p53/ than in p53+/+ cells. Although the percentage of the most primitive HSCs (Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD34low/) did not depend on p53, the percentage of multipotential HSCs and committed progenitors (Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD34high/+) was almost fourfold higher in post-5-FU recovering p53/ BMCs than in their p53+/+ counterparts. The pool of HSCs from 5-FU-treated p53/ BMCs was exhausted more slowly than that from the p53+/+ population as shown in vivo using pre-spleen colony-forming unit (CFU-S) assay and in vitro using long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) and methylcellulose replating assays. Clonogenic activity of various lineage-specific descendants was significantly higher in post-5-FU regenerating p53/ BMCs than in p53+/+ BMCs, probably because of their increased sensitivity to growth factors. Despite all these changes and the dramatic difference in sensitivity of p53/ and p53+/+ BMCs to 5-FU-induced apoptosis, lineage commitment and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors appeared to be independent of p53 status. These studies suggest that suppression of p53 function facilitates hematopoietic reconstitution after cytoreductive therapy by: (1) delaying the exhaustion of the most primitive HSC pool, (2) stimulating the production of multipotential HSCs, (3) increasing the sensitivity of hematopoietic cells to growth factors, and (4) decreasing the sensitivity to apoptosis..

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	8	HEMATOPOIESIS IS regulated by numerous growth factors, which act in concert to regulate proliferation (including self-renewal), differentiation, and apoptosis, thus generating a relatively constant pool of functionally mature blood cells. However, normal hematopoiesis can be perturbed by a variety of factors such as infection, reduced oxygen concentration, irradiation, and drugs. Cytostatics, which are routinely used as antineoplastic drugs, are toxic to bone marrow cells. In light of the importance of prompt bone marrow repopulation for patient outcome, analyses of the mechanisms regulating this process hold promise in leading to novel therapies that facilitate hematopoietic repopulation after cytostatic treatment or bone marrow transplantation..

After 16 weeks, mice were sacrificed and genomic DNA was isolated from BMCs. The ratio of p53+/+ to p53/ cells repopulating the host bone marrow was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two sets of primers, 1-2 and 1-3, were used simultaneously to detect p53 wild-type and p53 knock-out alleles, respectively14: primer 1 (5): GGGACAGCCAAGTCTGTTATGTGC, located upstream from the deleted region of the p53 gene and therefore common for both mutated and wild-type alleles; primer 2 (3): CTGTCTTCCAGATACTCGGGATAC, located in the fragment deleted in the knock-out p53 allele and specific for the wild-type allele; and primer 3 (3): TTTACGGAGCCCTGGCGCTCGATGT, located in the PolII promoter region of the NEO cassette and present only in the knock-out allele. PCR was performed using 2  microg of genomic DNA and the products were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to a Zetabind membrane (Cuno Inc, Meriden, CT), and hybridized with an internal probe (5 TTCCTCTTCAGCCTGTAGACTGTG 3) specific for intron 1 in the p53 gene, thus recognizing PCR products from both the wild-type and the knock-out alleles.

The number of BMCs in p53+/+ mice decreased dramatically after injection of 5-FU, whereas the drug was markedly less potent in p53/ mice (Fig 1). On day 6 after 5-FU administration, p53/ mice contained fivefold to eightfold more BMCs than their wild-type counterparts. This phenomenon probably reflects the diminished apoptosis in p53/ cells, because injection of 5-FU into the p53+/+ mice resulted in massive apoptosis of BMCs on days 2 and 4, whereas BMCs from p53/ mice became apoptotic only sporadically (Fig 2)..

High levels of PCNA were detected in each sample of p53/ BMCs after 5-FU treatment, whereas in p53+/+ BMCs, PCNA expression was decreased on day 2, undetectable on day 4, but again detectable on day 6 after injection of the drug. p16INK4a levels decreased slightly in p53+/+ BMCs on days 2, 4, and 6. In contrast, p16INK4a expression was low on days 0, 2, and 4, but markedly increased on day 6 in p53/ BMCs. WAF-1 levels increased in both p53+/+ and p53/ BMCs after 5-FU treatment, but the increase was detectable earlier and was more pronounced in the p53+/+ population. Together, these data confirmed that p53/ BMCs regenerating after 5-FU had higher proliferative potential than their p53+/+ counterparts. Analysis of apoptosis-related proteins showed markedly enhanced bcl-2 levels in p53/ BMCs on days 2 and 4, but low level expression at all other time points as in p53+/+ samples.

Both bax and bak proteins were highly expressed on days 2 and 4 in p53+/+ BMCs, but undetectable in other samples including those from p53/ cells.

To compare the ability of p53+/+ and p53/ BMCs obtained from 5-FU-treated mice to rescue animals exposed to a lethal dose of TBI, decreasing numbers of p53+/+ and p53/ BMCs were injected into recipient mice, and long-term survival was scored at 16 weeks postinjection. Lower numbers of p53/ BMCs than p53+/+ BMCs were required to rescue TBI-treated recipient mice (Table 1), suggesting that post-5-FU repopulating p53/ BMCs contain more HSCs capable of reconstituting hematopoiesis in vivo. BMCs from the p53+/+ and p53/ mice not treated with 5-FU showed no difference in their ability to repopulate in TBI-treated recipients (data not shown). PCR analysis to assess the presence of the p53 knock-out and wild-type alleles in the mononuclear fraction of BMCs obtained from mice transplanted with p53/ BMCs showed only the knock-out allele (not shown). Thus, long-term hematopoiesis in the transplanted hosts was caused by p53/ marrow cells and not by normal marrow cells that may have escaped lethal irradiation. Analysis of blood smears and bone marrow sections showed normal hematopoiesis in mice transplanted with either p53+/+ or p53/ BMCs (data not shown). Quantitative PCR followed by Southern blotting to assess the proportion of p53/ to p53+/+ BMCs in TBI-treated recipient mice injected IV with a 1:1 mixture of both indicated a ratio of 10:1 to 100:1 in bone marrow obtained 16 weeks after transplantation (Fig 5). Mice were free of leukemia at the time of BMC collection as confirmed by histological analysis of bone marrow and other organs (blood, spleen, and thymus). These results suggest that the absence of p53 gene expression has a positive impact on the repopulation ability of BMCs after treatment with 5-FU..

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	71	The regeneration of mature blood cells after cytotoxic treatment results from the proliferative activity of a small number of HSCs that have a high, but limited, capacity for self-renewal.22,23 Despite much recent progress in identifying cytokines that regulate the proliferation of HSCs and lineage-specific descendants after cytoreductive therapy, the genetic mechanism responsible for the intrinsic control of self-renewal and differentiation of these cells remains largely undefined. Increasing evidence points to the importance of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in regulating hematopoiesis.2-7 Using marrow cells from p53 knockout and wild-type mice, we found that p53 can have a profound effect on the proliferation and exhaustion of HSCs as well as on the proliferation of lineage-specific precursors in bone marrow regenerating after 5-FU treatment. However, p53 had no measurable effects on lineage determination and differentiation of these cells. Nevertheless, this 5-FU-induced dysregulation of cell growth does not appear to lead to leukemia and is not translated into any altered output of mature blood cells or altered commitment to any specific blood cell lineage, at least during our period of observation (5 months). Our data also suggest that other regulatory mechanisms involving p16INK4a and WAF-1 may compensate the loss of function of p53. The changes that occur in the stem cell population during the recovery from 5-FU treatment seem likely to reflect relevant physiological processes that are important during bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy procedures..

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	73	Randall and Weissman24 reported that after 5-FU treatment, the number of HSCs (Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ Thy1.1low) in p53+/+ mice begins to increase on day 2, and approximately 50% of these cells are in S/G2/M phase on day 6. Thus, BMCs for most of our studies were collected on day 6 after 5-FU injection. The finding that fewer p53/ BMCs regenerating after 5-FU treatment are required to rescue long-term hematopoiesis in TBI-treated recipient mice suggests that these cells contain more HSCs than their p53+/+ counterparts. Indeed, the percentage of Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ cells, which are highly enriched with HSCs,21 was almost threefold higher in p53/ than in p53+/+ BMCs recovering after 5-FU treatment. No differences were observed in untreated mice. However, the pool of HSCs can be subdivided into long-term reconstituting primitive HSCs (p-HSCs), with extensive self-renewal capacity, and transiently repopulating HSCs (t-HSCs) that only self-renew in mice for 3 to 6 weeks.25 Both populations are essential, at different times, for the rescue of hematopoiesis in TBI-treated animals. Recently, the immunophenotype of both populations have been determined15 as Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD34low/ (p-HSCs) and Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD34high/+ (t-HSCs). We found that the percentage of p-HSCs in p53/ and p53+/+ BMC populations is similar after 5-FU administration and also in untreated mice (data not shown). However, 5-FU was responsible for an almost fourfold increase in the percentage of t-HSCs in p53/ BMCs as compared with p53+/+ BMCs. Thus, it seems likely that the long-term repopulating capacity of 5-FU-treated p53/ BMCs results from the increased content of t-HSCs, which are essential for hematopoietic recovery during the critical initial weeks after transplantation until the p-HSC descendants become the major source of long-term hematopoiesis. Moreover, p53/ mice contained five to eight times more BMCs than did p53+/+ mice, so that at 6 days after 5-FU treatment the number of p-HSCs and t-HSCs were five to eight times and 20 to 32 times higher, respectively, in the p53/ mice. Bone marrows in long-term reconstituted animals transplanted with a 1:1 mixture of p53/ and p53+/+ BMCs regenerating after 5-FU contained 90% to 99% of p53/ cells. Thus, even if the percentage of p-HSCs is similar in 5-FU-treated p53/ and p53+/+ mice, the long-term repopulating activity of the former cells is much higher, possibly because of the increased production of t-HSCs. Apparently, p53 plays an important role in BMC regeneration after 5-FU treatment by controlling not only the total number of p-HSCs in the organism, but also the production of their early descendants, t-HSCs, which represent the "functional" subpopulation responsible for the actual repopulation..

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	75	Because the increased production of t-HSCs may reduce the pool of p-HSCs, we investigated the role of p53 in the exhaustion of the HSC pool after 5-FU treatment. Unfortunately, we could not use the in vivo BMC serial retransplantation assay, because most of the mice transplanted with p53/ BMCs developed lymphomas after 5 to 6 months, consistent with previous observations.1,26 Therefore, we used an in vivo pre-CFU-S assay and in vitro LTC-IC and methylcellulose replating assays. Although p53/ and p53+/+ BMCs after 5-FU treatment developed similar numbers of CFU-S only p53/ BMCs regenerated cells forming pre-CFU-S. Thus, p53 expression facilitates the exhaustion of cells forming pre-CFU-S, which are believed to belong to the p-HSC pool.27 LTC-IC assay and methylcellulose replating assay confirmed the longer duration of colony-forming ability in p53/ than in p53+/+ HSCs regenerating after 5-FU. In summary, both in vivo and in vitro assays showed that the absence of p53 in BMCs regenerating after 5-FU treatment not only increases the pool of HSCs, but also delays their exhaustion. The increase of the total number of p-HSCs in p53/ mice after 5-FU treatment may reflect the reduced sensitivity to apoptosis and increased proliferative capacity of p53/ BMCs. The quiescent state of most p-HSC28 may explain the absence of any difference in the percentage of these cells after 5-FU treatment. In contrast, most t-HSCs may represent cycling cells and, because p53/ cells have a proliferative advantage, the total number as well as the percentage of those cells in BMCs regenerating after 5-FU treatment is increased in p53/ mice as compared with p53+/+ mice. In accord with this hypothesis, p53/ BMCs recovering after 5-FU treatment displayed a much higher multilineage clonogenic activity in the presence of growth factors. This effect appeared to rest in the proliferative advantage of p53/ cells rather than the different number of precursor cells, because immunophenotypic analysis showed no significant differences in the content of lineage-specific precursors in p53/ and p53+/+ BMCs. It is also possible that in the absence of p53, the production of t-HSCs from p-HSCs is increased by a different unknown mechanism..

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	77	Our results suggest that p53 is a key regulator of the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells responsible for long- and short-term repopulation, whereas it does not affect lineage determination and differentiation of committed progenitor/precursor cells. These findings raise the possibility that the manipulation of p53 expression might delay the decline of HSCs that occurs after chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation..

0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	2	   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion References   Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessive genomic instability syndrome characterized by developmental defects, progressive bone marrow failure, and cancer. FA is genetically heterogeneous, however; the proteins encoded by different FA loci interact functionally with each other and with the BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM gene products. Although patients with FA are highly predisposed to the development of myeloid leukemia and solid tumors, the alterations in biochemical pathways responsible for the progression of tumorigenesis in these patients remain unknown. FA cells are hypersensitive to a range of genotoxic and cellular stresses that activate signaling pathways mediating apoptosis. Here we show that ionizing radiation (IR) induces modestly elevated levels of p53 in cells from FA type C (Fancc) mutant mice and that inactivation of Trp53 rescues tumor necrosis factor -induced apoptosis in myeloid cells from Fancc-/- mice. Further, whereas Fancc-/- mice failed to form hematopoietic or solid malignancies, mice mutant at both Fancc and Trp53 developed tumors more rapidly than mice mutant at Trp53 alone. This shortened latency was associated with the appearance of tumor types that are found in patients with FA but not in mice mutant at Trp53 only. Collectively, these data demonstrate that p53 and Fancc interact functionally to regulate apoptosis and tumorigenesis in Fancc-deficient cells. (Blood. 2003;102:4146-4152).

First, the development of malignant cells from primary cells frequently requires alterations in apoptosis or cell cycle control. Because myeloid malignancies predominantly occur in the context of progressive apoptotic depletion of hematopoietic progenitors in patients with FA9 and in Fancc-/- mice,10 it has been hypothesized that leukemogenesis results from an accumulation of mutations that precipitates the emergence of apoptotic-resistant precursors. Second, p53 is a pivotal sensor of genotoxic and nongenotoxic stress and activates signaling pathways that result in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. The apoptosis in FANCC-deficient lymphoblasts has previously been shown to be due to activation of protein kinase R (PKR).11 Because p53 is a downstream effector of PKR,12-14 inactivation or polymorphisms of p53 or proteins in the p53 pathway may be an important target for cellular transformation in FA-associated myeloid malignancies. Third, patients with FA are predisposed to solid tumors, including epithelial and squamous cell carcinomas, which have a high rate of p53 alteration in sporadic malignancies.15,16 The risk of these solid tumors in patients with FA goes up markedly after 20 years of age and increases to a cumulative risk of 90% by 40 years of age.2 Finally, recent studies have positioned the FA proteins in a biochemical pathway that includes BRCA1 and BRCA2.17,18 In fact, truncating, hypomorphic mutations of BRCA2 were observed in the FA-D1 complementation group.18 Further, studies using Brca1 and Brca2 conditional knockout mice support a role for p53 in tumor progression.19-21.

To test this hypothesis, we intercrossed Fancc and Trp53 mutant mice to generate F2 animals deficient at both loci (Fancc-/-Trp53-/-) and assessed the sensitivity of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells to TNF-. Myeloid progenitor cells were initially used because these cells are hypersensitive to low concentrations of TNF- and loss of this hypersensitivity is observed in myeloid malignancies in a FA experimental murine model10 and in patients with FA.9 Cultures were scored by an investigator who was blinded to the experimental genotypes. Consistent with previous studies,8 Fancc-deficient cells were hypersensitive to TNF- (Figure 2A). Strikingly, this hypersensitivity was completely abrogated in cells lacking both Fancc and Trp53 (Figure 2A), indicating that the hypersensitivity of Fancc mutant cells to TNF- is dependent on p53. We also tested whether the hypersensitivity of Fancc-/- myeloid progenitors to mitomycin C was p53 dependent. In contrast to progenitors deficient at Fancc only, the number of Fancc-/-Trp53-/- progenitors was rescued to wild-type levels at low concentrations of mitomycin C, indicating that this hypersensitivity was significantly p53 dependent (Figure 2B). The rescue of mitomycin C hypersensitivity was not maintained at higher mitomycin C doses, indicating that a p53-independent pathway of apoptosis also contributed to the hypersensitivity of Fancc-/- cells to mitomycin C..

Myeloid progenitor cells were initially used because these cells are hypersensitive to low concentrations of TNF- and loss of this hypersensitivity is observed in myeloid malignancies in a FA experimental murine model10 and in patients with FA.9 Cultures were scored by an investigator who was blinded to the experimental genotypes. Consistent with previous studies,8 Fancc-deficient cells were hypersensitive to TNF- (Figure 2A). Strikingly, this hypersensitivity was completely abrogated in cells lacking both Fancc and Trp53 (Figure 2A), indicating that the hypersensitivity of Fancc mutant cells to TNF- is dependent on p53. We also tested whether the hypersensitivity of Fancc-/- myeloid progenitors to mitomycin C was p53 dependent. In contrast to progenitors deficient at Fancc only, the number of Fancc-/-Trp53-/- progenitors was rescued to wild-type levels at low concentrations of mitomycin C, indicating that this hypersensitivity was significantly p53 dependent (Figure 2B). The rescue of mitomycin C hypersensitivity was not maintained at higher mitomycin C doses, indicating that a p53-independent pathway of apoptosis also contributed to the hypersensitivity of Fancc-/- cells to mitomycin C..

In this model p53 is activated following stress to limit cell growth or to initiate apoptosis of oncogenic cells as a mechanism of tumor avoidance. Thus, we speculate that the modestly increased p53 protein levels observed in Fancc-deficient cells in the current report (Figure 1) following genotoxic or nongenotoxic stress could be a result of intrinsic genomic instability present in these cells, which is detected by the signaling network that activates p53.

0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	61	In summary, the present study in mice has identified p53 as an important cofactor with Fancc in suppressing tumorigenesis. Our findings establish that p53 is an important modulator of apoptosis in Fancc-deficient mice in vitro and is consistent with the observations that mice mutant at both loci acquire tumors at an accelerated rate in vivo. Finally, these mice provide a model to address fundamental aspects of FA and to test molecular therapeutic strategies..

Differences between species in pathways contributing to tumor development, however, raise the question in how far mouse models are valid for human risk assessment. One striking difference relates to the frequency of spontaneous liver cancer which is high in certain mouse strains but rather low in humans. Similarly, mutation frequencies in cancer genes are characteristically different, i.e. P53 mutations are frequent in human but very rare in murine liver tumors, whereas Ras genes are often mutated in mouse liver tumors but hardly ever in human liver cancers. Since P53 has been shown to control oncogenic RAS in human cells, we hypothesized that this function of the tumor suppressor could differ in mouse hepatocytes. To test this hypothesis, we used hupki (human p53 knock-in) mice which carry a partly humanized P53 sequence (P53KI). In this study, we report the results of the first hepatocarcinogenesis experiment with this strain of mice. Mice of the genotypes P53KI/KI, P53WT/KI and P53WT/WT were treated with N-nitrosodiethylamine at 2 weeks of age and killed 35 weeks later. The frequency of liver tumors and glucose-6-phosphatase-altered liver lesions was almost identical in all three P53 genotypes and 40 to 50% of liver tumors showed activating mutations in codon 61 of the Ha-Ras gene independent of genotype. Moreover, only very few P53-positive lesions were observed but without nuclear localization of the protein, suggesting the absence of P53 mutations. These data suggest that the hupki allele behaves like its murine ortholog in mouse hepatocarcinogenesis..

Risk factors like hepatitis B and C virus and aflatoxins as given in southern Africa and southern China make HCC the most frequent cause of cancer death in these countries. Most populations from industrialized countries, however, show a comparatively low incidence of HCC, indicating that development of  spontaneous  HCC is a rather rare event in humans. By contrast, certain strains of laboratory mice, e.g. C3H, show a very high incidence of spontaneous liver tumors which can reach up to 100% at the end of the animals' lives (2). These opposing findings are paralleled by differences at the molecular level. One of the most striking differences lies in the mutation frequencies of genes in two pathways, namely the P53 and the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway..

In unstressed cells, P53 is maintained at low levels by the action of the ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2 which earmarks P53 for degradation in the proteasome (3). MDM2 can also bind to the transactivation domain of P53 thus reducing its transcriptional activity (4). DNA damage or oncogenic stress, e.g. caused by mutated CTNNB1 (ss-catenin), c-MYC or RAS lead to a stabilization of the P53 protein (5 to 7) and transcriptional activation of a battery of  caretaker  genes (8)..

The most common mutations in Ras affect the GTPase activity of the small monomeric G-protein resulting in the constitutively active molecule which may, amongst others, permanently stimulate cell-cycle progression via activation of MAP kinase and other effector pathways (9). The tumorigenic transformation of cells by Ras oncogenes can be prevented by P53-controlled mechanisms: inappropriate stimulation of cell-cycle progression leads to an E2F-mediated upregulation of the tumor suppressor protein p14/19ARF which can bind MDM2 and inactivate its ability to initiate P53 degradation (7,12 to 14). Thus, in human cells, P53 controls oncogenic RAS and activation of RAS in tumor cells is often accompanied by ablation of P53-dependent responses..

Liver tumors from mice, however, are hardly ever mutated in P53 (2,19) but rather harbor activating mutations in Ha-Ras (20,21) and B-Raf (22). This evidence could indicate that murine P53 may not control the activated RAS oncoprotein in mouse liver as opposed to its human ortholog, suggesting that the P53 protein may differ in function between mice and men. Although P53 shows high homology between the two species both in the overall amino acid sequence (74%) and the DNA binding domain (91%), the homology is less in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions and the polyproline domains (PPDs). Mouse P53 lacks, for example, residues that constitute important phosphorylation sites in its human ortholog, e.g. serine 37 and 46, amino acids which are relevant for the modulation of P53 stress response in cells, and proline 72 with a role in apoptotic responses (23,24)..

Mice of differing P53 genotype were used (15 per group): mice carrying the mouse P53 wild-type allele (P53+/+), mice heterozygous for the humanized P53-KI (hupki) allele (P53KI/+) and mice homozygous for the P53-KI allele (P53KI/KI). Animals were killed 35 weeks after treatment, except for one animal in the P53+/+ group which was killed at 19 weeks of the study because it had developed overt signs of malady. At the end of the study, all animals had enlarged, sponge-like livers harboring numerous tumors visible at the surface of the livers. Mice of all three groups showed increased liver weights and liver/body weight ratios caused by the high liver tumor burden, without significant differences between groups (Table I). In historical controls, untreated wild-type C3H mice showed a liver/body weight ratio of 4 to 5%, a value that was almost doubled in DEN-treated mice of the present study..

Several studies have pinpointed the fact that P53 plays a central role in tumorigenesis both in humans and in experimental systems. For example, the gene dosage of P53 affects malignant development in murine skin and P53 null mice are highly susceptible to radiation-induced tumorigenesis (41,42). It is also well known that heterozygous P53 null mice show an overall increase in tumor burden when compared with wild-type mice (43). Interestingly, however, hepatocarcinogenesis was not enhanced on treatment of heterozygous P53 null mice with a chemical carcinogen (43 to 48). These results may be interpreted in the sense that murine P53 plays an important role in the control of malignant development in some organs of mice but not in their liver, quite in contrast to human liver where the frequent inactivation of P53 in HCCs points toward an important control function of the suppressor protein during malignant transformation. However, recent data from mouse models of the Li to Fraumeni syndrome show that point mutant P53 mice develop carcinomas in a number of tissue sites, including the liver, reopening the debate on effects of P53 mutation on murine hepatooncogenesis (49)..

Comparing this sequence with mice is not straightforward since it lies in one of the most divergent parts of the protein [discussed in (52)], but at the corresponding position in mouse P53 (codon 69) there is an alanine. In the hupki protein, this part of the sequence is human with an arginine at this site, but our data indicate that this does not induce a difference with respect to control of Ras-mutated cells by P53 since the prevalence of Ha-Ras mutated tumors was very similar in mice of all three P53 genotypes..

Substitution of serine 46 blocks the expression of P53AIP1 (P53 regulated apoptosis inducing protein 1) which is an important mediator of P53-dependent apoptosis (53). The murine protein lacks this phosphorylation site. Serine 46 might also provide a link of P53 to cell-cycle control since, based on sequence homologies, it could be a target for cyclin-dependent and MAP kinases in human cells (24). Constitutive activation of MAP kinase signaling in Ras-mutated cells carrying the humanized KI alleles could therefore have a lead, by feedback inhibition, to fewer Ras-mutated tumors, an effect that was not detectable in our study..

Nuclear P53 accumulation, however, was not observed in the positively stained lesions. Mutation within the DNA binding domain of P53 often results in loss of the protein's ability to act as a transcription factor. As a result Mdm2, one of its target genes, is no longer transcribed which eliminates the feedback loop that negatively controls the intracellular concentration of P53 (57). We therefore conclude that mutation of P53 was infrequent in the mouse liver tumors, irrespective of whether the mice harbored the murine or the humanized P53 alleles. We also found that the rare P53-positive lesions we detected were simultaneously positive for glutamine synthetase which is absent from most normal hepatocytes except those in a small ring of cells directly located around the central veins (58). Glutamine synthetase is overexpressed in hepatoma cells with an activated version of ss-catenin and may serve as marker indicating mutation of the gene (39,40). ss-Catenin and P53 may in fact interact: activation of ss-catenin signaling provoked by LiCl treatment of cells or by mutation of the gene leads to stabilization of P53, cell-cycle arrest, and induction of senescence in endothelial cells (59) and mouse fibroblasts (60). We therefore suggest that the accumulation of P53 protein in glutamine synthetase-positive liver lesions of this study may be caused by the presence of an activated form of ss-catenin in cells of these lesions..

There was no difference in tumor response, the Ha-ras mutation prevalence of tumors was similar and there was no indication of P53 mutations in liver tumors from hupki mice, in analogy to what has been demonstrated in mice with an unmodified P53 locus (19). These findings do not support the hypothesis that P53 harboring the human polyproline and DNA binding domains has a growth control function that is lacking in normal murine P53 of mouse hepatocytes. We cannot exclude the possibility that the segments of murine P53 that are not replaced in the hupki model could have had an influence on the outcome of this study (Figure 2). Another possibility is that the hupki allele may have novel properties but nevertheless behaves like the mouse protein in the genetic environment of the mouse, either because other human-specific proteins that interact with P53 are missing or mouse-specific proteins block the control function mediated by the human allele. The reason why the mutation prevalences in Ras and in P53 in liver tumors from mice and men are so different remains to be unveiled..
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	56	The results of our present study demonstrate that hupki mice behave like P53-wild-type mice with respect to hepatocarcinogenesis induced by our DEN treatment protocol. There was no difference in tumor response, the Ha-ras mutation prevalence of tumors was similar and there was no indication of P53 mutations in liver tumors from hupki mice, in analogy to what has been demonstrated in mice with an unmodified P53 locus (19). These findings do not support the hypothesis that P53 harboring the human polyproline and DNA binding domains has a growth control function that is lacking in normal murine P53 of mouse hepatocytes. We cannot exclude the possibility that the segments of murine P53 that are not replaced in the hupki model could have had an influence on the outcome of this study (Figure 2). Another possibility is that the hupki allele may have novel properties but nevertheless behaves like the mouse protein in the genetic environment of the mouse, either because other human-specific proteins that interact with P53 are missing or mouse-specific proteins block the control function mediated by the human allele. The reason why the mutation prevalences in Ras and in P53 in liver tumors from mice and men are so different remains to be unveiled..

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In response to DNA damage, signal transduction pathways are activated that result in the increase of p53 protein levels, leading to either growth arrest or apoptosis. Protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated as a tumor suppressor that is down-regulated by tumor-promoting phorbol esters in both mouse skin and cell culture models. We report here that the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate prevents DNA damage-induced up-regulation of p53 by down-regulating PKC . Regulation of p53 in response to stress most commonly occurs by preventing ubiquitination and degradation of the p53 protein. Surprisingly, suppression of p53 expression by inhibition of PKC was caused by the inhibition of p53 synthesis, not increased degradation of p53 protein. Inhibiting PKC blocked both basal transcription of the human p53 gene and initiation of transcription from the human p53 promoter. Therefore, the tumor-suppressing effects of PKC are mediated at least in part through activating p53 transcription..

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a central role in mediating stress and DNA damage-induced growth arrest and apoptosis (1). The p53 protein regulates normal responses to DNA damage and other forms of genotoxic stress and is a key element in maintaining genomic stability (2). In fact, the p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequently inactivated gene in human malignancy (3). The level of p53 protein is largely undetectable in normal cells but rapidly increases in response to a variety of stress signals. The mechanism by which the p53 protein is stabilized is not completely understood, but post-translational modification plays a pivotal role (4). Mutations in the p53 gene are frequently associated with the formation of human cancer; however, the p53 pathway can also be derailed by numerous oncogenic proteins (5). Mice engineered to have the p53 gene knocked out develop tumors at an increased rate (6). The critical position p53 plays in tumor suppression suggests that many agents may inhibit the p53 pathway as part of the road toward tumor promotion. However, the mechanisms of action of many chemical agents that promote tumor development have not been elucidated. With the central role of p53 in mind, it is logical to presume that agents that promote tumor formation might block the p53 pathway..

TPA is known to activate but then down-regulate the diacylglyceroldependent PKC isoforms (7, 8). We demonstrated that the tumor-promoting activities of TPA are mediated at least in part by down-regulating PKC (9 to 12). Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing PKC in their epidermis are resistant to tumor promotion by TPA (13). Increasing evidence suggests that PKC is a player in DNA damage response pathways. PKC is activated in the DNA damage response by both tyrosine phosphorylation and cleavage of PKC to a 40-kDa constitutively active catalytic fragment (14, 15). Furthermore, downregulation of PKC expression by inhibitors and siRNA has been associated with attenuation of the DNA damage-induced response (14, 16)..

Previous studies have suggested that TPA can inhibit the DNA damage-mediated induction of p53 (18, 19).

To investigate whether the survival signals generated by TPA involved p53, we examined the effect of TPA upon DNA damage-induced apoptosis in human cancer cell lines with (27, 28) and without wild type p53 (29). The DNA-damaging agents CPT, MC, and DMC induced apoptosis of the human myeloid leukemia cell line ML-1 (which has wild type p53), as demonstrated by the cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate PARP, which is widely used as an indicator of apoptosis (Fig. 1A, lanes 3, 5, and 7) (30). However, when ML-1 cells were pretreated with TPA for 24 h, PARP cleavage induced by the DNA-damaging agents was almost completely inhibited for CPT and MC (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 6). Similar data were obtained using flow cytometry where the CPT-induced appearance of sub-G1 DNA was also prevented by TPA treatment (data not shown). TPA was also able to inhibit the CPT- and MC-induced apoptosis of a number of other cell lines expressing wild-type p53 including LnCAP, H460, and MCF-7 (data not shown and Fig. 3D). Whereas CPT and MC require p53 in order to mediate significant apoptosis, DMC in addition to activating the p53 pathway is also able to induce apoptosis in the absence of p53 (31). When a similar experiment was performed with K562 cells, which lack p53, the DNA-damaging agent DMC induced significant PARP cleavage; however, TPA treatment had no effect upon PARP cleavage in these cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8). Modest PARP cleavage was also induced by CPT and MC in the K562 cells, and this cleavage was similarly unaffected by TPA treatment (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 to 6). A further demonstration of the lack of TPA inhibition of p53-independent apoptosis is shown in Fig. 1C, where neither the DMC-induced apoptosis of H460 cells (containing wild-type p53) or H1299 cells (without wild-type p53) were rescued by TPA pretreatment. The mechanism of action of DMC is under current investigation. Interestingly, we observed that TPA was able to partially rescue DMC-induced apoptosis in ML-1 cells (Fig. 1A). At this time, we do not know why TPA is able to inhibit DMC-induced apoptosis of ML-1 cells, but this does not detract from our finding that in cell lines that do not have p53, apoptosis is not inhibited by TPA..

This kinetics is important, because TPA treatment is known to initially activate PKC , but over time depletion of cellular PKC levels occurs via the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway (9, 10).

Pretreatment of ML-1 cells with 10 nM TPA for 6 h or longer inhibited CPT-induced p53 accumulation in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 to 9). The ability of TPA to inhibit p53 nuclear accumulation was not due to a change in p53 shuttling, since after TPA pretreatment there was no detectable accumulation of cytoplasmic p53 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2B, PKC is largely depleted by 6 h of TPA treatment in the ML-1 cells. The kinetics of PKC depletion slightly preceded the disappearance of p53 induction observed in Fig. 2A (compare lanes 4 to 9 for A and B), consistent with the inhibition of p53 induction being due to the depletion of PKC . Also shown in Fig. 2B is the CPT-induced appearance of the 40-kDa catalytically active fragment of PKC .

D, the influence of TPA on the level of PKC was analyzed as in B. E, the ability of TPA to down-regulate the p53 stabilization and the level of PKC , respectively, was also analyzed in extracts from the H460 cell line (E and F). Cells were either left untreated or treated with CPT (0.5  microM), etoposide (8  microM), or MC (5  microM) for 4 h. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with TPA (10 nM) for 21 h prior to the addition of the DNA-damaging agent. The blots were probed for p53, PKC , and actin as in A and B..

Once again, depletion of PKC correlated with the block of p53 accumulation (Fig. 2D).

We examined the effect of TPA upon DNA damage-induced apoptosis in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, which also has wild type p53 (28). As shown in Fig. 3A, CPT strongly induced PARP cleavage, which was completely inhibited by TPA pretreatment for 24 h. Importantly, the effect of TPA was overcome by bryostatin 1 (Fig. 3A). Bryostatin 1 has been shown to prevent the tumor-promoting effects of TPA in a number of cell lines (9, 32).

We examined the effect of rottlerin upon the DNA damage-mediated induction of p53 in ML-1 cells. This inhibition of PKC activity resulted in the inhibition of CPTmediated apoptosis as indicated by the lack of sub-G1 DNA content observed in the florescence-activated cell sorting analysis of cells treated with CPT together with rottlerin (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the hypothesis that PKC was required for p53 accumulation, the specific PKC inhibitor, rottlerin, blocked the accumulation of p53 in response to several DNAdamaging agents (Fig. 3D). This inhibition of p53 accumulation by rottlerin was evident in both the cytoplasmic as well as the nuclear extract (Fig. 3, D and E), demonstrating that the inhibition of p53 accumulation does not result from a change in p53 transport.

The ubiquitin proteosome pathway is involved in the degradation of p53, and after DNA damage the p53 protein is post-translationally modified so that it is no longer targeted for degradation (37). The levels of p53 can therefore be increased chemically by using inhibitors of the proteosome pathway (4, 38, 39). We reasoned that if TPA pretreatment of cells was inhibiting stabilization of p53 through increased degradation of the protein, then chemical inhibition of the proteosome pathway would be able to increase p53 levels even after the cells were pretreated with TPA. However, surprisingly, we observed that TPA pretreatment of ML-1 cells completely inhibited the ability of the proteosome inhibitor LLnL to stabilize p53 (Fig. 4A). Similarly, rottlerin was also able to prevent p53 accumulation induced by proteosome inhibition (Fig. 4B), implicating a requirement of PKC for synthesis of p53. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of TPA and PKC inhibition on p53 protein accumulation was apparently not due to enhanced p53 degradation by a proteosome-mediated proteolysis pathway..

We therefore investigated whether TPA was down-regulating p53 transcription. ML-1 cells were treated with TPA for increasing times, and RNA was extracted. Northern blot analysis using a p53 probe was then carried out. A clear reduction in the basal level of p53 transcript was evident with increasing time of TPA pretreatment, beginning after 8 h (Fig. 5A). The inhibition of p53 basal transcription after 8 h of TPA treatment was quantified using TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 5B). Importantly, the inhibitory effect of TPA on p53 was maintained in cells treated with the various DNA-damaging agents (data not shown). Slightly greater than 50% inhibition of p53 mRNA levels was observed after 8 h of TPA treatment. Down-regulation of PKC expression by siRNA has been associated with attenuation of the DNA damage-induced response (14, 16). We used siPKC as an additional means to confirm the requirement of PKC for the basal transcription of p53 (Fig. 5C). With the siRNA to PKC , we were able to inhibit the level of PKC protein by 38% as determined from the densitometry scanning of Western blot analysis, and the basal p53 message (monitored by quantitative TaqMan RT-PCR) was inhibited by 35%. Significantly, in addition to TPA, the PKC inhibitor also blocked p53 transcription (Fig. 5D). Whereas the proteosome inhibitor LLnL did not affect the level of p53 mRNA, the reduction of p53 mRNA was evident in the presence of LLnL and the PKC inhibitor (Fig. 5D). Inhibition of p53 mRNA by rottlerin was also associated with inhibition of transcription of p53 downstream target genes p21 and hdm2 activated in the presence of LLnL treatment (Fig. 5D, compare lanes 2 and 4).

Recently a role for PKC in the accumulation of p53 and the induction of apoptosis in bovine endothelial cells has been shown (41). Additionally, it has been shown previously that the tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 4--phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate transiently down-modulated p53 mRNA levels (42). Using siRNA to inactivate PKC , we have demonstrated a direct requirement for PKC in controlling basal human p53 transcription. In addition to demonstrating that TPA treatment does not decrease p53 message stability, we used a dominant negative PKC in co-transfection studies to extend the analysis of PKC inhibition. This extension examines p53 promoter regulation. Our results show that the initiation of transcription from the p53 promoter can be blocked by the inhibition of PKC . Whereas our studies do not rule out an additional effect of TPA and PKC down-regulation upon p53 protein stability, they do reveal a novel mechanism for suppressing p53 expression that probably contributes to tumor promotion by phorbol esters.

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	56	Our results raise several important questions regarding how tumor promoters might regulate the initiation of p53 transcription and suggest a model in which DNA damage in the presence of such tumor promoters could result in malignant transformation (Fig. 7, A versus B). Repression of the p53 promoter has been suggested as a mechanism for tumor promotion (34, 43). Damaged genes in tumor cells are usually thought to be the mechanistic drivers toward oncogenesis. However, down-regulation of endogenous genes, specifically tumor suppressors, may also be a key regulatory mechanism resulting in tumor promotion. Our data provide a transcriptional repression mechanism for tumor promotion by TPA and predict that agents that interfere with the activity of PKC may inhibit p53 responses. We have begun to compare the DNA binding activity of transcription factors known to bind to the p53 promoter in extracts from cells before and after the inactivation of PKC . Presently, we have not found the DNA binding activity of any transcription factor inhibited and have confirmed the previous finding that NF-B is activated by TPA treatment in most (but not all) of the cell lines tested.3 Continued promoter studies are in progress to search for either a repressor or activator involved in p53 transcription that may be regulated by PKC . One possibility is the Ets-2 protein, because there is a binding site for this protein in the p53 promoter, and PKC regulates the level of Ets-2 protein (44)..

Binding was not observed above background along the duplex telomeric repeats. However, the efficiency of TRF2-catalyzed t-loop formation on the model DNA was increased 2-fold in the presence of p53 although a variety of single strand or Holliday junction-binding proteins did not facilitate t-loop formation. These results suggest that p53 has an active role in telomere maintenance and structure through association with the t-loop junction.

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	7	Recent studies have implicated several proteins required for DNA damage recognition and repair in telomere maintenance. The mammalian protein Ku, which binds double strand (ds)1 ends and is central to ds break repair has been shown to bind telomeric DNA directly (1, 2) and to associate with the two duplex telomere repeat binding factors TRF1 and TRF2 (3, 4). Further, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the yeast homolog yKu is required for proper telomere function (5). Recent studies by Tong et al. (6) revealed that the tumor suppressor protein p53 is involved in the maintenance of telomeric tract length in mice. They observed that although the level of telomere-associated fluorescence in p53/ mouse embryo fibroblasts was equivalent to that of wild type cells, there was an increased heterogeneity of telomere lengths with some telomeres being longer than those seen in wild type cells whereas others were very short or lost entirely. These shortened telomeres resulted in a high frequency of telomere-telomere fusions..

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	9	The telomere-specific protein TRF2 plays a central role in concealing telomere ends from ds break recognition and repair factors (7, 8). Expression of a dominant-negative allele of TRF2 in cultured human cells triggers changes typical of those induced by ds breaks: loss of the 3' single strand (ss) overhang, induction of end-to-end chromosome fusions (8), and induction of apoptosis through the p53/ATM-dependent DNA damage checkpoint pathway (7). The induction of p53 is not dependent on DNA replication, suggesting that inhibition of TRF2 function at the telomeres signals p53 directly..

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	11	Our recent studies of telomere architecture provide a possible structural solution to how telomere ends are hidden from DNA break repair/recognition factors. These studies showed that mammalian telomeres are arranged into large duplex loops in vivo (t-loops) (9). The formation of t-loops in vitro requires TRF2 and a telomeric junction, which consists of a 3' ss overhang of at least one TTAGGG repeat adjacent to the ds portion of the telomere (10). The termini of the micronuclear chromosomes of Oxytricha nova (11), the telomeres of Trypanosoma brucei minichromosomes (12), and the telomeres of Pisum sativum2 have been shown to form looped structures in vivo whereas S. cerevisiae telomeres appear to form fold-back structures (13-15). It is plausible that telomeric looping is a common mechanism for protecting the termini of linear chromosomes..

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	13	It has been proposed that the t-loop structure is formed by strand invasion of the G-rich ss overhang into the preceding duplex TTAGGG tract (9, 10). This invasion would generate a D-loop, which would effectively hide the natural end of the DNA to protect it from the machinery that scans DNA for broken ends. In addition, recent data support the possibility that some portion of the C-rich strand of the ss/ds telomeric junction may also invade the duplex, resulting in the formation of a Holliday junction-like structure at the base of the t-loop (Fig. 1A) (10). p53 tightly binds Holliday junctions in vitro and enhances their resolution by junction-cleaving enzymes (16). Further, p53 has a strong affinity for ss DNA (17) and would presumably bind the ss telomeric overhang of the telomere. The affinity of p53 for these structures points to the importance of investigating p53 binding to both the telomeric overhang and the t-loop junction as well as examining the influence of p53 on t-loop assembly by TRF2 in vitro..

The overhang was removed by treatment with mung bean nuclease to create a telomeric tract that terminates in a blunt end (10). Linear DNA substrates containing the 576-bp tract located internally were generated by cleavage of pRST5 plasmid with AflIII (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), placing it 334 bp from the 5' end and 2597 bp from the 3' end..

It was of interest to examine the ability of p53 to bind t-loop structures. t-Loops were generated by incubation of the model telomere with TRF2, stabilization by AMT/UV photocross-linking, and protein removal (see "Experimental Procedures") (9). p53 was incubated with the purified DNA, and the resulting complexes were examined by EM. The purified DNA contained both looped (10  plus or minus  3%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) and unlooped (90  plus or minus  3%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) molecules. Overall, 59% ( plus or minus 21%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) of the input DNA was bound by p53. The p53 binding occurred at one end of the DNA, internally along the duplex repeats, or at the t-loop junction. The p53 bound to the non-looped species showed a strong preference for the DNA ends (Fig. 2, A and B; see below). Of the t-loops observed, 88% ( plus or minus 11%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) showed p53 bound exclusively at the t-loop junction (the junction of the loop and the linear tail) (Fig. 2, C and D). The mass of the p53 complex at the t-loop junction appeared consistent with the presence of one or two tetramers with a small portion of the molecules containing larger complexes. Similarly, when TRF2 was incubated with the deproteinized, cross-linked DNA, binding was observed exclusively at the t-loop junction (100  plus or minus   < 1%, n = 100/sample, three experiments). TRF1, however, rarely bound the junction, binding instead along the telomeric tract (data not shown). These results demonstrate that p53 has a high affinity for the t-loop junction..

It has been shown that p53 is capable of associating with DNA in both a sequence-dependent (reviewed in Refs. 23-25) and sequence-independent manner (26-27). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and EM were used to examine the affinity of p53 for duplex TTAGGG repeat tracts as well as for a model telomere containing a duplex tract adjacent to a ss 3' overhang containing TTAGGG repeats. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with p53 and a 200-bp DNA fragment consisting of tandem TTAGGG repeats. Even with an input ratio of 30 tetramers per DNA molecule, p53 showed very low binding, and this was easily competed with nonspecific DNA (data not shown)..

Because p53 has been shown to bind ss DNA with high affinity, the non-telomeric end of the DNA terminated in a blunt end. Conditions were optimized so that each DNA showed no more than one p53 particle bound (20 tetramers per DNA) (see "Experimental Procedures").

Removal of the 3' overhang decreased the fraction of end-bound p53 to 6%, demonstrating that the end localization of p53 is most likely because of its association with the ss overhang.

It is possible that p53 binding to the ss DNA overhang would inhibit loop formation by preventing TRF2 from localizing to the ss/ds junction, a critical step in t-loop assembly (10). Alternately, binding to the ss overhang might enhance t-loop formation by facilitating the strand invasion event. Studies from others have suggested that p53 has some strand transfer activity (28), which might either assist in TRF2-mediated loop formation or catalyze loop formation in the absence of TRF2. Finally, p53 may stabilize loops once they are formed by binding to the t-loop junction either at the Holliday junction-like structure or the displaced ss portion of the D-loop.

Each class was further divided into molecules that were gold-labeled (20%) and molecules that remained unlabeled (80%). In these studies, gold particles were only observed on end-bound molecules, t-loops, and aggregates. Of the t-loops detected, 86% were labeled with gold particles at the t-loop junction, demonstrating the association of both TRF2 and p53 (Fig. 3A). In addition, 43% of the end-bound molecules were tagged with gold labels (Fig. 3B). The labeled end bound complexes may contain both proteins or only p53. These results provide direct evidence for the presence of p53 at TRF2-bound t-loop junctions. The location of p53 binding within the junction, either to the displaced strand or the Holliday junction-like structure, could not be resolved using these methods..

Each class was further divided into molecules that were gold-labeled (20%) and molecules that remained unlabeled (80%). In these studies, gold particles were only observed on end-bound molecules, t-loops, and aggregates. Of the t-loops detected, 86% were labeled with gold particles at the t-loop junction, demonstrating the association of both TRF2 and p53 (Fig. 3A). In addition, 43% of the end-bound molecules were tagged with gold labels (Fig. 3B). The labeled end bound complexes may contain both proteins or only p53. These results provide direct evidence for the presence of p53 at TRF2-bound t-loop junctions. The location of p53 binding within the junction, either to the displaced strand or the Holliday junction-like structure, could not be resolved using these methods..

Complexes of p53 and TRF2 were formed on the model telomere DNA and detected by the addition of an anti-p53 polyclonal rabbit IgG followed by incubation with 10-nm gold particles conjugated with protein A. Samples were prepared for EM as described in Fig. 2. Gold labeling was observed at the t-loop junction (A) and at DNA ends (B). Reverse contrast is used; bar is equivalent to 1 kb.

No evidence for preferential binding of p53 to duplex telomeric DNA was observed. p53 does bind strongly to the ss overhang, as expected based on previous studies showing that p53 has a high affinity for ss DNA (17). p53 also associates with the t-loop junction with high affinity and was found to cooperate with TRF2 in formation of t-loops on the model telomere template. This produced a 2-fold increase in the frequency of t-loops as monitored by EM. p53 was detected at the t-loop junction in the presence of TRF2 binding, suggesting that both proteins are present in a complex at the t-loop junction..

Interactions of p53 with the junction may add stability and prevent t-loop loss in vitro. t-Loops could be lost because of migration of the junction along the duplex repeat tract or dissociation of TRF2. Association with the ss overhang may facilitate localization of TRF2 to the ss/ds overhang, which would result in an increase in loop assembly..

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	59	Several biologically significant roles for p53 localization to the t-loop junction can be envisioned. Normally, p53 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus at the G1/S transition and is shuttled back to cytoplasm shortly thereafter. The presence of p53 at the t-loop junction just prior to DNA replication may promote resolution of the junction to facilitate telomere replication. It is also possible that p53 is sequestered at the t-loop junction to allow immediate recognition of any loss of end protection by p53. Cell cycle arrest or apoptosis then can be triggered. Additionally, other protein factors may be recruited to the chromosome end through interactions with p53. These factors may be essential for telomere structure and function.     ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Apoptotic death of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is a prominent feature of blood vessel remodeling. In the present study, we examined the novel PKC isoform protein kinase C delta (PKC) and its role in vascular SMC apoptosis. In A10 SMCs, overexpression of PKC was sufficient to induce apoptosis, whereas inhibition of PKC diminished H2O2-induced apoptosis. Moreover, evidence is provided that the tumor suppressor p53 is an essential mediator of PKC-induced apoptosis in SMCs. Activation of PKC led to accumulation as well as phosphorylation of p53 in SMCs; this induction correlated with apoptosis. Furthermore, blocking p53 induction with small interference RNA or targeted gene deletion prevented PKC-induced apoptosis, whereas restoring p53 expression rescued the ability of PKC to induce apoptosis in p53 null SMCs. We also establish that PKC regulates p53 at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. Specifically, the transcriptional regulation required p38 MAPK, whereas the post-translational modification, at least for serine 46, did not involve MAPK. Additionally, PKC, p38 MAPK, and p53 co-associate in cells under conditions favoring apoptosis. Together, our data suggest that SMC apoptosis proceeds through a pathway that involves PKC, the intermediary p38 MAPK, and the downstream target tumor suppressor p53..

Because increased total cellularity is a prominent feature of an occluding neointima, the balance between proliferation and apoptosis during vessel healing appears central to this pathologic process (6, 7). Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that abnormal SMC apoptosis leads to neointimal hyperplasia (8 to 11).

The importance of p53 is also confirmed in various animal models.

Similar to what has been reported previously in mouse vascular SMCs, A10 cells, a rat aortic SMC line, responded to H2O2 with a large increase in DNA fragmentation. Pre-treatment of A10 cells with rottlerin (1  microM for 1 h) diminished the induction of DNA fragmentation induced by H2O2 (Fig. 1A). Alternatively, we inhibited PKC expression by treating cells with an antisense oligonucleotide.

To this end, we employed an adenovirus encoding full-length wild-type PKC (AdPKC), which led to a marked increase in cellular levels of PKC (Fig. 2B). Additionally, AdPKC induced a small but significant elevation in the level of fragmented DNA and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 2, A and B). To facilitate the activation of the ectopically expressed PKC, we treated A10 SMCs with 1 to 5  microM of PMA for 12 h. At these concentrations, PMA alone did not induce apoptosis as indicated by the lack of fragmented DNA as well as the absence of activated caspase-3. However, the PKC activator PMA, in combination with overexpression of PKC, resulted in an increase in DNA fragmentation by  > 3-fold (Fig. 2A) and cleaved caspase-3 by  > 300% (Fig. 2B). These data establish that overexpression of PKC is sufficient to induce SMC apoptosis. Because p53 has been implicated in SMC apoptosis, we investigated whether the overexpression of PKC and its dramatic increase in SMC apoptosis were associated with an induction of p53. As shown in Fig. 2B, overexpression of PKC in A10 SMCs significantly increased p53 levels. In parallel to the induction of apoptosis, the ability of AdPKC to induce p53 expression was further enhanced by PMA (Fig. 2B). Next, we tested whether the PKC-induced p53 accumulation leads to enhanced p53-dependent gene transcription by using a luciferase reporter gene containing a p53-specific enhancer element (40, 41). Co-transfection of a PKC expression vector significantly increased p53 reporter activity. More importantly, the addition of the PKC activator PMA facilitated the effect of PKC on the p53 reporter, which is consistent with the ability of PKC to induce p53 expression and SMC apoptosis (Fig. 2C)..

Next, we examined whether the p53 siRNA affects apoptosis. 48 h following infection with AdPKC or AdNull, A10 cells were incubated with p53 siRNA (50 nM for 72 h) prior to PMA treatment (1  microM for 12 h). Cell apoptosis was then assessed using ELISA for DNA fragmentation and Western blot analysis for cleaved caspase-3.

To confirm these findings using siRNA, we isolated SMCs from the thoracic aorta of p53 null mice and tested their ability to undergo apoptosis following overexpression of PKC and activation with PMA. Interestingly, AdPKC failed to induce apoptosis in p53 null SMCs (Fig. 3C). Next, we attempted to rescue apoptosis by restoring p53 expression using an adenovirus encoding wild type p53 (35).

To assess PKC-induced p53 phosphorylation, we utilized a specific antibody to p53 phosphorylated on serine residue 46, shown by others to provide p53 with greater affinity to promoters of apoptosis-related genes (43). PKC substantially increased the level of phospho-p53 (at serine 46), which was barely detectable in cells infected with the empty viral vector (Fig. 5A). To further confirm the role of PKC-induced p53 phosphorylation in apoptosis, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of p53 in A10 cells treated with H2O2, a stimulus for both apoptosis and p53 phosphorylation (44). Indeed, Western blot analysis of A10 cell lysates demonstrated a significant increase in p53 phosphorylation at serine 46 following treatment with H2O2 (200  microM for 4 h). Importantly, pre-incubation with the PKC chemical inhibitor rottlerin (1  microM for 1 h) dramatically diminished the ability of H2O2 to induce p53 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate that PKC is responsible, directly or indirectly, for p53 phosphorylation.

As shown above, p53 promoter activity was increased in response to PKC overexpression. However, inhibition of p38 by SB20358 diminished the ability of PKC to up-regulate p53 transcription (Fig. 6C). These data suggest that p38 is the intermediate responsible for the induction of p53 transcription in PKC-overexpressing SMCs..

Several studies suggest that the presence of a positive regulatory loop between PKC and caspase-3; however, exactly how PKC might stimulate caspase-3 remains unclear (45, 46). Another important target of PKC is the mitochondria. It was demonstrated in HeLa cells (47) and keratinocytes (48) that overexpression and activation of PKC leads to a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c, which subsequently leads to activation of caspases and apoptosis. Additionally, several nuclear proteins, including DNA-dependent protein kinase (49), p73 (50), and lamin B (51) have been identified as PKC targets/substrates. Activated PKC associates with and phosphorylates these proteins; such interactions, at least in part, contribute to apoptosis. In the current study, we present evidence that the tumor suppressor p53 is a necessary mediator of PKC-induced apoptosis in vascular SMCs. We have shown that activation of PKC led to accumulation as well as phosphorylation of p53 in SMCs; this induction correlated with SMC apoptosis. Moreover, blocking p53 induction with siRNA prevented apoptosis. Finally, targeted gene deletion of p53 prevented PKC-induced apoptosis, whereas restoring p53 expression through adenovirus-mediated p53 gene transfer rescued the ability of PKC to induce apoptosis.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	75	  Experimental evidence is now provided that PKC regulates p53 at both transcriptional and post-translational levels, apparently mediated by separate signaling mechanisms. Specifically, the transcriptional regulation requires p38 MAPK, whereas the post-translational modification, at least for Ser-46, does not require MAPK. The importance of post-translational regulation of p53 by PKC is demonstrated by our observation that ectopic expression of p53 alone was insufficient to induce apoptosis. Only when co-expressed with PKC was p53 able to restore apoptosis of p53 null cells, presumably through a PKC-dependent phosphorylation. It was surprising that the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor, SB20358, significantly inhibited PKC-induced accumulation of p53 but did not affect p53 phosphorylation at Ser-46, because direct interaction between p53 and p38 MAPK (52) has been suggested previously. Indeed, we showed that all three proteins, p53, p38 and PKC, co-associated in the immunoprecipitation complex isolated from SMC lysates. Our attempts to evaluate other serine residues within the p53 molecule are currently not possible due to a lack of specific phospho-antibodies. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether PKC and p38 stimulate p53 phosphorylation at additional residues. With respect to Ser-46, our data suggest that it is p38-independent..

The lack of cell death associated with PMA treatment may be related to the effect of PMA on other PKC isotypes. We have shown previously that SMCs express at least eight isotypes of PKC, among which six can be activated by PMA (56). Some of these PMA-sensitive PKC isoforms, such as PKC, are pro-apoptotic, whereas others, such as PKC, have been demonstrated to be anti-apoptotic in non-SMCs (57 to 59). Our data show that overexpressing PKC shifts the PMA response in favor of apoptosis.

References   Our environment contains physical, chemical and pathological agents that challenge the integrity of our DNA. In addition to DNA repair, higher multicellular organisms have evolved multiple pathways of response to damage including programmed cell death apoptosis. The p53 protein appears to sense multiple types of DNA damage and coordinate with multiple options for cellular response. The p53 protein activities depend upon its DNA binding. Specific p53 protein post-translational modifications are required for efficient sequence-specific binding and transcriptional activities. Non-sequence-specific DNA binding may involve a wide spectrum of p53 proteins and predominate as DNA damage is more severe or p53 protein is more highly induced. p53 protein is not strictly required for DNA damage sensing and repair. Rather, p53 protein may govern an apoptosis checkpoint through competition with DNA repair proteins for non-sequence-specific binding to exposed single-stranded regions in the DNA duplex. This model provides a framework for testing mechanisms of p53-mediated apoptosis dependent upon the p53 protein modification state, the level of p53 protein accumulation, the level of DNA damage and the capacity of the damaged cell to repair..

References   p53 protein is central to the cellular response of higher multicellular organisms to a variety of potentially damaging extracellular stimuli, including UV light, -irradiation, chemical carcinogens and chemotherapeutic agents. DNA repair machinery has evolved to maintain genomic integrity and stability after various kinds of DNA damage. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) eliminates pyrimidine dimers caused by UV light. Base excision repair (BER) targets base modifications caused by DNA hydrolysis and alkylation. Mismatch repair corrects errors of DNA replication. DNA strand breaks are remedied by DNA recombination using unbroken alleles as templates. The cell cycle checkpoint is a surveillance mechanism that coordinates with DNA repair by delaying progress through the cell cycle following DNA damage (1). This delay allows time for cells to repair DNA before replication or segregation of defective chromosomes, thus preventing propagation of heritable genetic errors. In prokaryotes, DNA damage blocks cell division by activating the `SOS' feedback control system (2) that prevents cell division and increases the capacity to repair damaged DNA. In yeast, an increased genetic instability following -irradiation can be seen in mutants of rad9 that have a defect in the G2 checkpoint (3). In addition to cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis evolved in multicellular organisms as a mechanism to ensure the integrity of the organism by eliminating cells with irreparable DNA damage. In this article, we will review the sequence-specific and non-sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 protein and comment on how p53 protein, as the guardian of the genome, might orchestrate the cellular response to DNA damage in concert with the DNA repair machinery in order to select among multiple effector pathways toward DNA repair, survival or apoptosis..

References   The critical role of the p53 gene in maintaining the integrity of the genome is evident in that p53 is the most commonly altered gene in human cancer, with a mutation frequency exceeding 50% (4). Most mutations are missense mutations within the evolutionarily conserved DNA binding domain (5). Mutation of the p53 gene results not only in loss of p53 function but also in gain of oncogenic functions (6) and in adoption of a dominant-negative conformation able to inactivate the protein product of the normal allele through heterotetramerization (7). Germline mutations of p53 have been found in Li to Fraumeni syndrome, an inherited disorder with a high risk of developing a variety of cancers at an early age (8). The impact of p53 alterations on tumorigenesis is considerably more than the statistics for p53 gene mutation indicate, as wild-type p53 may be functionally inactivated by other mechanisms. The p53 protein can be inactivated by viral oncogenes and defects in the p53 activation pathway. Most DNA tumor viruses have evolved their own mechanisms in order to gain advantage to replicate their genome. E6 protein from human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical carcinoma degrades p53 through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (9). Hepatitis B viruses (HBV) involved in the pathogenesis of 90% of human hepatocarcinoma encode HBXAg, which binds to the N-terminal domain of p53 and inactivates its transactivation activity (10). SV40 viral T antigen abolishes DNA binding activity of p53 by associating with the DNA binding domain of p53 (11), and adenoviral E1B protein inhibits transactivation activity of p53 protein (12). Although SV40 and adenovirus transform primarily rodent cells, they exemplify mechanisms by which cellular proteins yet to be recognized might inactivate p53 in human cancer..

The induction of p53 is achieved through a post-translational mechanism that reduces p53 turnover.

In addition to cdk inhibition, p21 binds to proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).

0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	11	   Regulation of p53 sequence-specific binding to DNA Top Abstract Introduction p53 as a guardian... Regulation of p53 sequence... p53 non-sequence-specific... References   Covalent modification p53 protein induction through post-transcriptional modification in response to DNA damage is a mechanism that permits rapid activation and avoids relying on transcription from a potentially damaged DNA template. Both the N- and C-terminal domains of the p53 protein are subjected to extensive covalent modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation and sumolation, as shown for human p53 in Table I. These modifications contribute to p53 regulation by affecting its DNA binding, degradation, localization, oligomerization and association with cellular factors. Since there are many excellent reviews about p53 modifications (21), we will focus mainly on modifications that regulate p53 DNA binding. Phosphorylation of S378 by PKC enhances p53 binding to DNA similarly to the C-terminal p53 activating antibody PAb421 (22). Phosphorylation of S392 is correlated with increased DNA binding, probably by facilitating p53 tetramerization. While phosphorylations of C-terminal amino acids generally enhance p53 sequence-specific binding to DNA, there are conflicting results. Phosphorylation of S315 by cdk enhances p53 binding to specific DNA and confers binding site preference (23). However, dephosphorylation of this site reportedly can facilitate tetramerization and nuclear localization, which are critical for p53 function (24). It remains to be tested whether phosphorylation of S376 is correlated with DNA binding regulation. Enhanced p53 binding to specific DNA has been associated with phosphorylation of S376 by cyclin-activated kinase (CAK) in one report (25), and with 14-3-3 binding to p53, which is dependent upon dephosphorylation of S376, in another report (26). These studies suggest that p53 modification is a complex process involving multiple enzymes acting in sequence. Although not a direct effect, p53 DNA binding can be increased by phosphorylation of N-terminal amino acids (27). Phosphorylation of S15 and S37 recruits p300/CBP protein that acetylates lysines 373 and 382 at the C-terminus, resulting in activation of p53 binding to specific DNA (28). Phosphorylation of S15 and S37 by Chk1 and Chk2 is heavily dependent upon tetramerization of p53 (29). Tetramerization of p53 protein is facilitated by phosphorylation of p53 at S392 and dephosphorylation at S315 (24). Regulation of p53 at multiple levels provides a means for p53 protein to select among downstream events in response to diverse genotoxic stress signals. Testing this cascade of events in cells responding to DNA damage is a major ongoing challenge. An even greater challenge is to determine how p53 modifications might confer specificity in transactivation of 20 or more p53 downstream genes. The DNA sequence variation in the p53 binding sites in these genes and the complexity of possible p53 modifications provide a mechanism for specificity in relaying signals from different genotoxic and oncogenic pathways to different downstream genes..
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	12	View this table:    Table I. p53 protein post-translational modifications and effects   p53-associated factors Although the DNA binding domain of p53 binds well to specific DNA (30), the binding is highly subject to regulation by other regions of p53 protein. It has been hypothesized that p53 DNA binding is subject to allosteric regulation by C-terminal domains that lock p53 tetramers in a latent state for DNA binding (31). Such inhibition can be overcome by C-terminal modifications other than phosphorylation, such as proteolytic truncation, alternative splicing and association with other cellular factors (32). The potential for p53 regulation by p53-associated factors has been long implicated from in vitro DNA binding activation by PAb421, which recognizes C-terminal amino acids 372 to 381. A number of cellular and viral proteins have been identified as p53-associated factors. While the biological relevance of these associations remains to be verified, several cellular factors have been shown to bind to the C-terminal region of p53 and activate DNA binding activity. 14-3-3 is a p53 downstream gene that mediates G2 arrest by sequestering phosphorylated cdc25C (33). Upon dephosphorylation of S376, 14-3-3 binds to p53 and enhances its DNA binding activity, thus forming a positive feedback loop for p53 (26). c-Abl is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by DNA damage and mediates phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK (34,35). Both JNK and p38 MAPK are kinases that phosphorylate p53 in a DNA damage-dependent manner. Recently, Nie et al. reported that c-Abl is capable of binding to p53 and stabilizing its DNA binding (36). While activation of p53 DNA binding by c-Abl is independent of its kinase activity, the direct activation of p53 DNA binding may synergize with the c-Abl kinase cascade-mediated p53 activation and amplify the response to DNA damage. Although the N-terminal domain of p53 is frequently targeted for transcriptional repression by cellular and viral oncogenes (12,37,38), there is evidence that the N-terminal association may participate in regulation of p53 DNA binding in other ways. Replication protein A (RPA) is a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein that binds to the N-terminus of p53. An in vitro study by Miller et al. showed that association with RPA blocks p53 binding to specific DNA (39). The association between RPA and p53 can be disrupted with ssDNA or DNA repair-dependent phosphorylation of RPA (40). While C-terminal associations are generally linked with enhanced DNA binding, the outcomes of the N-terminal interactions are less consistent. Zauberman et al. found that Mdm2 protein association abolishes p53 binding to specific DNA in cell lysates as determined by means of the McKay assay (41). However, the complex of p53 to DNA to Mdm2 was detected with purified recombinant proteins by EMSA (42). Nevertheless, the authenticity and biological relevance of these associations need to be evaluated in the context of the general transcription machinery. p53 is associated with several general transcription factors including TFIID, TFIIH and p300/CBP (43 to 45). These transcription factors form multiprotein complexes that span the N- and C-terminal domains of the p53 protein. For example, the p62 polypeptide component of TFIIH binds to the p53 N-terminus, whereas XPD and XPB of TFIIH bind the C-terminus. It has been found that p53 DNA binding is stabilized by the association with TFIID and p300/CBP. The association between p53 and these general transcription factors may more closely reflect the nature of p53 regulation in the chromatin context..

Histone acetyltransferase activity is associated with a number of transcriptional activators, such as p300/CBP (CREB binding protein), PCAF (p300/CBP associated factor) and TAFII250 (TATA binding protein associated factor) (46). In addition to acetylating p53 protein at lysine 373 and 382 (28), binding to N-terminally phosphorylated p53 could position p300/CBP to open up nucleosomes for recruitment of other transcription factors to promoters of p53 downstream genes. p53 binding sites in p53 downstream genes vary in position relative to the promoter. Two p53 binding sites in the WAF-1 gene are located between 2 and 3 kb upstream of the transcription start site (16). Two p53 binding sites are separated by 17 bp and located 1.5 kb downstream of the start site within the first intron of the Mdm2 gene (47). p53 binding sites in the cyclin G gene are separated by a half kilobase interval in the first exon (48). DNA loop formation was described as a mechanism of transactivation mediated by the stacking of tetramers through the central domain of p53 protein (49). Recently, we have observed active DNA binding by p53 protein in the absence of PAb421 for the endogenous Mdm2 p53 binding sequence (two p53 binding sites separated by 17 bp) and for that sequence in which the two Mdm2 p53 binding sites were replaced with Waf-1 sites (121 and unpublished data). Moreover, p53 binding to the double sites could not be fully competed by either single site. p53 binding to DNA, like that of other DNA binding proteins, represents a dynamic on/off state (50). The chance of dissociating two p53 to DNA complexes simultaneously is much lower than that for single binding. Therefore, the formation of a multi-p53 to DNA complex may provide a stable scaffold for transcription machinery as well as enhance the complexity for p53 regulation..

High mobility group protein-1 (HMG-1) is a non-histone chromosomal protein that has been shown to activate p53 DNA binding (51), perhaps mediated by DNA bending that stabilizes p53 to DNA complex formation. Unlike other p53 activators, HMG-1 is not present in the p53 to DNA complex. HMG-1 may allow p53 to overcome an energy barrier to bend DNA in an intermediate step of p53 binding to DNA. DNA bending is a common mechanism for transactivation. It helps not only the formation of stable DNA to protein complexes but also the assembly of transcription complexes in the chromatin context. However, our understanding of p53 regulation at the chromatin level is largely limited to speculations from in vitro studies and will depend upon new development in technology for in vivo evidence. Recently, Rubbi and Milner provided evidence that p53 is preferentially localized at sites of active RNA synthesis (52). p53 protein also associates with the centrosome, first shown by Brown et al.

0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	17	Redox modification Hainaut and Milner have shown that specific DNA binding of p53 is highly dependent upon the reduction state of p53 protein (55). p53 protein has a unique zinc finger that is composed of C176, H179, C238 and C242. The zinc finger forms a DNA binding interface by bridging two loop to helix structures in the DNA binding domain. There are an additional seven cysteine residues involved in direct DNA binding and conformation in the DNA binding domain. Mutations of these cysteine residues result in the loss of p53 DNA binding activity (56). The presence of cysteine residues in these critical positions of p53 protein renders it susceptible to regulation by cellular redox status. p53-specific binding to DNA requires a thiol reducing agent like dithiothreitol (DTT). Oxidation of p53 by thiol oxidants like diamide abolishes p53 binding to specific DNA. A similar effect can be achieved by metal chelation since zinc binding is correlated with thiol reduction. Considering oxidative stress caused by DNA damage and other genotoxic stimuli, it is essential for the cell to maintain a reductive state for p53 function. The cellular redox state is maintained in a highly efficient manner by antioxidant molecules and enzymes like glutathione, thioredoxin and superoxide dismutase. In addition to scavenging oxidants, they participate in transcription regulation in response to oxidative stress. For example, thioredoxin as a thiol reducing molecule is capable of stimulating DNA binding activity of various transcription factors like NFB (57) and AP-1 (58). More recently, thioredoxin has been shown to enhance p53 DNA binding and transactivation (59). Further, p53 transcriptional activity is suppressed in yeast strains with thioredoxin reductase mutation or deletion (60,61). More interestingly, p53 binding to specific DNA is activated by Ref-1, a dual functional protein that serves as an A/P endonuclease in BER and modulates DNA binding of various transcription factors in response to oxidative stress (62). Since DNA damage is associated with the production of oxygen free radical species, the regulation of p53 by Ref-1 may provide a mechanism to coordinate DNA repair and redox states. In addition to being modulated by redox proteins, p53 participates in redox metabolism by transactivation of reducing molecules like glutathione peroxidase and repression of oxidating molecules like nitric oxide synthase (63,64). Accumulating evidence suggests that the p53 pathway integrates signals not only from DNA strand breaks but also from oxidative stress pathways..

This ssDNA is vulnerable to nuclease attack and active for DNA recombination. Therefore, it is well protected by ssDNA binding proteins in both DNA repair and replication.

Activation of p53 by ssDNA seems to be an attractive model for p53 to coordinate cellular response to DNA damage. However, it is almost impossible for p53 activated at the damage site to transactivate distant downstream genes, and the short ssDNA generated by excision repair is rapidly degraded in the cell.

0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	23	   p53 non-sequence-specific binding to DNA and biological relevance Top Abstract Introduction p53 as a guardian... Regulation of p53 sequence... p53 non-sequence-specific... References   In addition to binding specifically to DNA at p53 consensus sites, p53 binds non-specifically to DNA. Besides ssDNA noted above, p53 is capable of binding to a DNA duplex with free ends, nicked DNA generated by DNase I, DNA damaged by -irradiation (71), a DNA duplex with insertion to deletion lesion (IDL) mismatches (72), DNA with Holliday junctions (73), triple-stranded DNA (74) and DNA with single-stranded gaps (C.Prives, 10th p53 Workshop). These DNA structures represent the intermediates of DNA damage and DNA repair. Binding to non-specific DNA was primarily mapped to the C-terminal domain of p53 protein, and non-sequence-specific DNA binding by the C-terminal polypeptide cannot be competed by specific DNA (30). The C-terminal domain of p53 protein is responsible for binding to ssDNA, as mentioned above, but binding to ssDNA activates p53 to bind both sequence-specifically and non-sequence-specifically to DNA. A 2 nt overhang of a DNA segment is sufficient to activate its binding to p53 protein (67). Although the C-terminal domain of p53 protein is sufficient for non-sequence-specific DNA binding, the binding affinity is always lower than that of the full-length p53 protein, implying participation of the central domain. Crystallographic analysis of the p53 central domain reveals a flexible structure ideal for binding to dsDNA. Indeed, the central domain is capable of binding non-sequence-specifically to DNA. p53 protein with the last 30 amino acids truncated can bind non-sequence-specifically to dsDNA (68). While it remains to be determined for ssDNA binding, p53 binding to non-specific dsDNA is largely dependent upon wild-type conformation (75). p53 protein binding to a DNA duplex with IDL mismatches has been reported to be wild-type specific (76). Such binding can be competed by DNA with a p53 consensus site (unpublished data). Thus, p53 binding non-sequence-specifically to DNA is likely to be synergistic between the C-terminal binding to ssDNA and the central domain binding to dsDNA. A survey of DNA templates targeted by p53 non-sequence-specific binding reveals a general structure composed of ssDNA in a DNA duplex context, as summarized in Figure 1. We will refer to this region of ssDNA and adjacent dsDNA as a single-stranded/double-stranded DNA transition (sds-DNA). This common structure may explain the ability of p53 protein to bind DNA damage induced by so many different agents..

Both the Y-shaped DNA and the DNA bubbles are recognized and incised by the UV light response-induced DNA repair protein UvrBC in the absence of UvrA (77). Analysis of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) by electron crystallography suggests that DNA-PK binds to sds-DNA with separate binding sites, one for dsDNA and one for ssDNA (78). Binding to sds-DNA activates its kinase activities. There is evidence supporting the concept that sds-DNA is the signal to activate p53 protein. Induction of p53 has been found to be dependent upon the presence of unwound DNA intermediates from NER (79).

Accordingly, p53 recognizes damaged DNA and recruits DNA repair machinery to the damaged site. The identification of DNA repair proteins XPB and XPD as p53-associated factors as well as the phosphorylation of p53 protein by CAK (which in addition can activate p53 sequence-specific binding) strongly favor this idea. Although p53 binding to damaged and mismatched DNA resembles mismatch repair sensor MSH2, there is no evidence to show that p53 protein participates in mismatch repair. Each DNA repair machinery complex has its own factor to sense damaged DNA. The binding to damaged DNA by the sensor is avid and highly specific so as to target the appropriate DNA repair machinery to the particular type of DNA damage. For example, XPC to hHR23B is a damage sensor for NER that binds specifically to pyrimidine dimers (with a Kd value of 5x10 to 9) and specifically recruits XPA and TFIIH to the damage site (82). p53 protein offers no obvious specificity to a particular repair machinery as it binds to different types of DNA structures and to proteins involved in different types of repair, like XPB and XPD for NER, and Rad51 for DNA recombination.

0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	29	Is p53 a DNA repair effector? If p53 protein is not primarily a damage sensor, is it directly involved in repair? Several biochemical properties associated with p53 non-sequence-specific binding to DNA have suggested a direct involvement in DNA repair. p53 protein is able to mediate ssDNA reannealing and DNA strand transfer (66,71,83). These activities resemble DNA strand invasion and single-strand annealing in homologous recombination. Homologous recombination is a well conserved cellular mechanism to repair damaged DNA and to mediate chromatin exchange in crossover during normal cellular processes like antibody generation and meiosis. Recombination is also a common cause of chromosomal abnormality in cancer development. Results from in vivo studies show that both inter- and intra-chromosomal recombination are significantly inhibited by wild-type p53 (84,85). This indicates that p53 may function as a regulator of DNA recombination by recognizing DNA ends and reannealing ssDNA to block abnormal recombination. However, it is possible that DNA recombination can be enhanced by high levels of p53 protein through binding at the C-terminus. This domain of mutant p53 remains intact in most cases, and stabilization of the mutant makes it highly available for this genetically destabilizing activity. We have suggested that increased non-homologous recombination may contribute to the `gain of function' phenotype associated with p53 mutants as implicated by p53 C-terminal activation of topoisomerase I catalytic activity (86). Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that p53 protein is capable of rejoining DNA with double strand breaks, indicating its role in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (80,87,88). Although NHEJ is required in preventing chromosomal translocation (89,90), the lack of specificity of DNA end rejoining by p53 protein may contribute to its `gain of function' phenotype, as mutant p53 is equally active in rejoining DNA ends (87,88)..

These observations suggest that p53 as guardian of the genome is not primarily involved in DNA repair. However, Offer et al. recently provided evidence that p53 participates in BER (91). Incorporation of radiolabeled dNTP into depurinated plasmids in nuclear extracts (indicative of BER activity) was enhanced in cells expressing wild-type p53 and reduced in cells expressing mutant p53 proteins. While there is no experimental evidence to show how p53 participates in BER, Mummenbrauer et al. have found that wild-type p53 protein possesses intrinsic 3' to 5' exonuclease activity in the presence of magnesium ions (92). This activity is localized to the central domain of p53 protein based on deletion analysis and structural similarity to the catalytic domain of exonuclease III in Escherichia coli. The 3' to 5' exonuclease activity is a common mechanism to ensure sequence fidelity during DNA replication and DNA repair. This activity provides a molecular basis for p53 involvement not only in BER but also in other DNA repair machinery complexes where proofreading is necessary. The exonuclease activity of p53 seems to be mutually exclusive to its specific DNA binding activity. While the C-terminal domain negatively controls both specific DNA binding and exonuclease activity of p53, the exonuclease activity of p53 is inhibited by the activation events for specific DNA binding, such as phosphorylation or PAb421 association. Inhibition of 3' to 5' exonuclease activity by PAb421 and phosphorylation events that activate p53 suggest its association with latent p53 proteins (81). However, binding to non-specific DNA is also affected by these activation events. As noted above, both latent and activated p53 proteins are capable of such binding, indicating a more general function of p53 proteins binding non-sequence-specifically to DNA..
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	32	Although p53 binds to ssDNA and mismatched DNA, there is no direct evidence to support the involvement of p53 in either NER or mismatch repair in cell free systems, and there are no obvious DNA repair defects in p53 knock out mice. These observations suggest that p53 as guardian of the genome is not primarily involved in DNA repair. However, Offer et al. recently provided evidence that p53 participates in BER (91). Incorporation of radiolabeled dNTP into depurinated plasmids in nuclear extracts (indicative of BER activity) was enhanced in cells expressing wild-type p53 and reduced in cells expressing mutant p53 proteins. While there is no experimental evidence to show how p53 participates in BER, Mummenbrauer et al. have found that wild-type p53 protein possesses intrinsic 3' to 5' exonuclease activity in the presence of magnesium ions (92). This activity is localized to the central domain of p53 protein based on deletion analysis and structural similarity to the catalytic domain of exonuclease III in Escherichia coli. The 3' to 5' exonuclease activity is a common mechanism to ensure sequence fidelity during DNA replication and DNA repair. This activity provides a molecular basis for p53 involvement not only in BER but also in other DNA repair machinery complexes where proofreading is necessary. The exonuclease activity of p53 seems to be mutually exclusive to its specific DNA binding activity. While the C-terminal domain negatively controls both specific DNA binding and exonuclease activity of p53, the exonuclease activity of p53 is inhibited by the activation events for specific DNA binding, such as phosphorylation or PAb421 association. Inhibition of 3' to 5' exonuclease activity by PAb421 and phosphorylation events that activate p53 suggest its association with latent p53 proteins (81). However, binding to non-specific DNA is also affected by these activation events. As noted above, both latent and activated p53 proteins are capable of such binding, indicating a more general function of p53 proteins binding non-sequence-specifically to DNA..
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	33	Does p53 protein mediate an apoptosis checkpoint? If p53-mediated DNA repair is critical for maintaining genomic integrity, p53 and its related DNA repair function should be well conserved from bacteria to humans. However, p53 and newly discovered members of the p53 gene family are present only in multicellular organisms. While p73 and p63 family members bind to the p53 consensus (93,94), to date there are no reports of their capacity for non-sequence-specific binding, for example, to mismatched DNA. The p53 homolog in Drosophila is the most primitive relative of p53 identified so far. Drosophila p53 mediates DNA damage-induced apoptosis but not growth arrest, suggesting that the primitive function of p53 is to mediate apoptosis in genome maintenance (95 to 97). Eliminating cells with damaged DNA by apoptosis is vital for multicellular organisms to prevent genetic transformation (98). It is generally accepted that p53-mediated apoptosis and p53-induced cell cycle checkpoints are the two major mechanisms of p53 protein activity as a tumor suppressor. The p53-mediated cell cycle checkpoint is activated by checkpoint proteins well conserved in yeast such as ATM, ATR and Chk2. However, the mechanism of p53-mediated apoptosis is largely unknown, despite the identification of apoptosis-related genes as downstream transcriptional targets of p53. So far it is not clear why p53 mediates growth arrest in certain cells but apoptosis in others responding to the same DNA damage, or how a given cell type determines its response to different DNA damaging agents or even to different doses of the same agent. Clearly, there are certain signals sensed by p53 protein that trigger the apoptosis pathway. Given the role of p53 as a guardian of the genome, unrepaired DNA should be a legitimate signal for p53 protein to direct the cell towards the apoptosis pathway. There is evidence that when DNA damage is not repaired, activation of p53 can lead to apoptosis (90). Binding to sds-DNA as defined above suggests a biochemical basis whereby p53 protein might monitor an apoptosis checkpoint in response to a variety of types of DNA damage. Rather than sensing the damage primarily to recruit repair proteins, p53 protein may sense the equilibrium between the amounts of damaged DNA and available DNA repair proteins. This equilibrium would be dependent upon p53 protein modification state, the level of p53 protein accumulation, the level of DNA damage and the capacity of the damaged cell to repair. Since sds-DNA is also targeted by DNA repair proteins like RPA and Rad51, it is tempting to propose that p53 proteins and DNA repair proteins are competing for sds-DNA dynamically, as reflected in the equation: [sds-DNA] + [p53]/[DNA repair proteins] Apoptosis. According to the scheme represented in Figure 2, DNA damage leads to accumulation of activated p53 proteins with increased affinity for DNA. Distinct p53 modifications may target different genes, such that certain cells with a higher capacity to repair or less capacity for rapid renewal might arrest, repair and survive. Because the levels of repair proteins generally far exceed those of p53 protein, sites of damaged DNA would be occupied predominantly by DNA repair proteins if the damage is mild. However, even limited levels of p53 protein may bind damaged DNA above the threshold of DNA repair protein availability. Alternatively, high levels of p53 induced by DNA damage or oncogenic events could compete with DNA repair proteins for a limited amount of DNA lesions, triggering apoptosis. There is abundant evidence that apoptosis is highly correlated with the level of p53 protein and the extent of DNA damage (99). Furthermore, increased apoptosis has been linked to p53 when DNA repair is inhibited by inactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a ubiquitous DNA binding protein involved in repair and possibly in apoptosis (100). It is possible to test the proposed apoptotic checkpoint equation by microinjection of fluorescein-labeled sds-DNA into cells. Huang et al. have reported that microinjection of a plasmid with a long gap or DNA with a 5' overhang into fibroblasts induced p53-dependent growth arrest (80). Cells with apoptotic potential could be used to test the hypothesis that sds-DNA dosage and extent of association of p53 and sds-DNA are directly correlated with p53-dependent apoptosis. Comparison of fibroblasts refractory to apoptosis with epithelial cells competent for apoptosis might provide clues as to how cell type-specific transcriptional events lead to survival or apoptosis. While the apoptosis checkpoint controlled by p53 binding non-sequence-specifically to DNA is hypothetical, it provides a framework for explaining how p53-mediated apoptosis is dependent upon cell type or extent of DNA damage and why apoptosis is more likely to be induced in cells less robust for DNA repair proteins..

Model: p53 protein mediates an apoptosis checkpoint in response to DNA damage. p53 protein is activated by DNA damaging stimuli through multiple post-translational modifications. Cell type and/or DNA damage-specific responses are dependent upon transcriptional and non-transcriptional effects of DNA binding by p53 proteins. An apoptosis checkpoint is determined by thresholds of p53 proteins and damaged DNA (sds-DNA) relative to a constant level of ubiquitous DNA repair proteins (see text)..
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	36	  The transcriptional and non-transcriptional p53-dependent arms of the p53 response to DNA damage could, theoretically, be exercised independently or cooperatively. Mainly transcriptional events might occur in cases where p53 is induced at very low levels of sds-DNA. Non-transcriptional events might predominate in severely damaged cells because transcriptional activities of p53 protein are compromised by conformational changes due to oxidative stress (101). Cell type-specific responses may require a cooperation of events in which accumulation of proteins encoded by p53 downstream target genes tip the balance toward survival (either due to reversible or prolonged cell cycle arrest) or apoptosis. While apoptosis can be regulated at the transcriptional level by p53, p53-dependent apoptosis can be achieved in a transcription-independent manner. Examples of this are p53-mediated apoptosis in the presence of inhibitors of transcription and translation (102,103) and apoptosis mediated by p53 mutants lacking transcriptional activities (104). Although the N-terminal proline-rich domain and the C-terminus of p53 protein are required for p53-dependent apoptosis (99,105), the central domain must participate in p53-mediated apoptosis, as tumor cells with p53 mutations are resistant to apoptosis in general. Furthermore, certain p53 mutants (Ala143, His273) with substantial transactivation activities are defective in apoptosis (106,107). Using a p53 DNA binding assay applicable to cells and tissues, we found that p53 mutant (His273) in human colon carcinoma cell SW480 has lost its ability to bind non-specific DNA while retaining the ability to bind specific DNA (unpublished data). This associates the defect in p53 binding non-sequence-specifically to DNA with the defect in p53- mediated transcription-independent apoptosis and is worthy of exploration in other p53 mutants..

0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	38	Due to the lack of sequence-dependence, apoptosis mediated by sds-DNA binding should be through protein to protein interactions instead of transactivation. Several lines of evidence coming from the laboratory of Harris and others indicate that DNA repair machinery is involved in p53-mediated apoptosis. p53-mediated apoptosis is abrogated in cells with either XPB or XPD mutations and can be restored by introduction of wild-type XP genes (108). Attenuation of p53-mediated apoptosis was also observed in cells with a defect in WNR, a DNA helicase mutated in Werner syndrome (109). At first glance, these observations seem contrary to the hypothesis above, since repair defects might be expected to result in a higher frequency of sds-DNA and increased p53 binding and apoptosis. However, the increased p53 binding to sds-DNA may occur, but apoptosis as its consequence may be blocked by the repair protein defect. These repair protein defects may provide clues as to how the signal of p53 binding to sds-DNA is transduced and linked to the apoptosis pathway. XPB and XPD mutants are associated with attenuated apoptosis whereas CSB mutants result in enhanced apoptosis. p53 protein has been found to be associated with XPB, XPD and CSB. Inhibition of the helicase activities of these proteins by association with p53 suggests that enhancement of DNA repair is not the mechanism by which p53 maintains genomic integrity, at least not through the association with these repair proteins. Since DNA repair is not necessary in cells committed to apoptosis, these associations may be primarily involved in apoptosis. The association between p53 and DNA repair proteins suggests transcription-independent apoptosis. Another possibility is that p53 binding non-sequence-specifically at sites of DNA damage mediates p53 modifications by the DNA repair machinery. Such modifications may confer specificity of p53 DNA binding to transactivate pro-apoptotic genes. Evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from p53 modification by CAK, a component of TFIIH (25,110). This would be a transcriptional means to convey the apoptotic signal if p53 protein dissociates from the complex upon modification. The availability of functionally distinct p53 mutants and model systems such as the simpler organism Drosophila will provide tools to dissect the mechanism of p53-mediated apoptosis..

A major challenge in the field is how to correlate its biochemical properties with its biological behaviors in cells and, more significantly, in vivo. Remaining questions include: how are the transcriptional and non-transcriptional arms of p53 response to DNA damage coordinated in specific cell types; what is the nature of the interactions between p53 proteins and DNA repair proteins or other constitutive or induced proteins required for p53-dependent apoptosis; how do p53 and other proteins at the postulated apoptosis checkpoint trigger the next steps in the apoptosis cascade. To answer these questions, DNA binding studies must be extended from the test tube to the cells, requiring increasing sensitivity. Molecular profiling of p53 downstream genes by means of DNA chip technology, affinity assays of cellular p53 protein binding to a range of specific and non-specific DNA templates and identification of discrete p53 proteins modified through phosphorylation and acetylation by means of specific antibodies will make a powerful combination for defining the p53 pathway in response to different genotoxic stresses in cells and tissues. Application of these approaches will permit defining the p53 response to DNA damage through sequence-specific and non-sequence-specific binding to DNA. It may reveal how p53 selectively turns on the expression of certain sets of genes through sequence-specific DNA binding or, in the face of overwhelming DNA damage, uses a variety of DNA repair machinery components to trigger apoptosis through non-sequence-specific DNA binding. Finally, these approaches may uncover how specific post-translationally modified p53 proteins integrate the response to different upstream signals. To fully understand how p53 proteins orchestrate the cellular response to DNA damage, it may be essential to view the location and extent of p53 binding to specific DNA and to damaged DNA and the association of p53 protein with other proteins in the chromatin context in cells responding to DNA damage..

0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	2	   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion References   The p53 system is highly stress sensitive and integrates diverse intracellular signals in a complex and poorly defined manner. We report on the high dependence of stress-induced p53 activation on mitochondrial activity. Down-regulation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTMP) by inhibitors of electron transport (rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA)) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis (oligomycin) prevented stress-induced p53 protein accumulation and abrogated p53-dependent apoptosis in a wild-type p53 leukemia cell line MOLT-3, in primary leukemia cells and in normal T lymphocytes. Using genome-wide gene expression analysis, stress-induced up-regulation of the p53 transcriptional targets and their specific inhibition by oligomycin has been demonstrated. Oligomycin did not impair p53-independent apoptosis and caused only a slight reduction of intracellular ATP levels. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) localized to mitochondria decreased in the presence of oligomycin, and stress-induced p53 activation showed strong ROS sensitivity both in leukemic and normal cells. These observations identify mitochondrial activity, described by MTMP and ROS levels, as a critical intracellular determinant of the p53 stress sensitivity and suggest potential implications of this linkage in the mechanisms of chemoresistance of acute leukemia cells.

Cellular stress response often implicates activation of the proapoptotic p53-dependent machinery, which determines the threshold level of cellular stress able to trigger apoptosis.1,2 p53 is regulated mainly at the posttranscriptional level and its protein level in the absence of stress is consistently low due to a high rate of p53 protein degradation via the proteasome pathway. Stress-induced signaling results in modification of the p53 protein either by phosphorylation or acetylation and in the resistance of p53 to proteasome degradation.3,4 A further basic regulatory mechanism of the p53 system is the interaction of p53 with its negative regulator Mdm2 protein, which acts as a p53-specific E3 ligase and is, in turn, transcriptionally regulated by p53.5 The importance of p53/Mdm2 interactions is underscored by the variety of mechanisms used by a cell to disrupt these interactions in response to stress, including posttranslational modifications, subcellular redistribution, inhibition of Mdm2 activity, and its transcription.5 More recently, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADH) quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) was demonstrated to regulate p53 stability.6 NQO1 was suggested to interact physically with p53 and to stabilize p53 through Mdm2-independent mechanisms.7,8.

The electron transport chain serves to convert the high energy potential of electrons from NADH and FADH2 molecules into the energy of the proton gradient across the inner membrane, defined as the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, MTMP (DeltaPsiM; m). The MTMP level is proportional to the number of protons pumped to the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane during electron transport and reflects the mitochondrial activity of the cell. It is the free energy of the proton gradient that finally drives the synthesis of ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate, occurring at the site of ATP synthase (complex V, F0/F1-ATPase).14 Mitochondrial activity critically contributes to the intracellular redox state as the major source of reactive oxygen species, ROS, which are generated as a result of occasional escape of electrons from the electron transport chain.15,16.

Comparative analysis of MOLT-3 cells, either untreated (medium) or treated with etoposide and doxorubicin, in the presence and absence of oligomycin, identified a limited number of gene transcripts, whose levels changed by threefold or greater in at least one treated versus untreated sample (44 genes up-regulated, 29 genes down-regulated; data not shown). A list of genes, which changed their expression by at least threefold in at least 2 treated samples, is summarized in Table 1.

Of the proapoptotic p53 targets, BAX and BIK,39 the up-regulation of BIK was particularly strong. In all these cases, oligomycin counteracted the up-regulation of p53 targets (Table 1).

NAO binds specifically to mitochondrial cardiolipin, and its binding affinity and fluorescence properties depend on the oxidation state of cardiolipin.49-51 NAO binds with high affinity to a nonoxidized cardiolipin in a 2:1 ratio, and its fluorescence shifts toward longer wavelength from 525 nm (green) to about 640 nm (red) as a result of NAO dimerization on the site of the mitochondrial membrane.49,50 In the case of oxidized cardiolipin, NAO has been reported to bind cardiolipin with a decreased affinity reflected by lower levels of red fluorescence.49 Therefore, oxidative stress localized to mitochondria can be assessed by red fluorescence measurement of NAO.51 Using this approach we observed a 26% increase of the NAO red fluorescence in MOLT-3 cells in the presence of oligomycin compared with cells cultured in the medium (P  <  .001, t test; Figure 6A). Therefore, oligomycin predominantly decreased levels of ROS localized at mitochondria..

Oligomycin was recently reported to inhibit apoptosis in cellular systems with transiently activated p53.22 ATP synthase has been shown to cooperate with the p53 target Bax, thus indicating a contribution of mitochondrial components of oxidative phosphorylation to proapoptotic signaling downstream of p53 activation. Our investigations of cellular systems with endogenous wt p53 suggest a contribution of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to the proapoptotic signaling upstream of p53 activation. Moreover, the observation that apoptotic signaling via p53-independent pathways, either mitochondrial (staurosporine) or extrinsic (CD95 death receptor), was not affected by mitochondrial inhibitors, indicates a selective linkage of mitochondrial activity to p53. This is further supported by genome-wide gene expression analysis of MOLT-3 cells, which has demonstrated a largely selective inhibition by oligomycin of p53-specific targets but not other stress-inducible (including NFB-dependent) transcriptional targets..

Chang et al63 identified WOX1 oxidoreductase as a proapoptotic protein, which became phosphorylated in response to stress or apoptotic stimuli and formed a complex with activated p53. The p53 complex with a wild-type, but not mutant WOX1, translocated to the mitochondria and further to the nuclei to mediate apoptosis. In a series of studies Asher et al6,64,65 demonstrated that NQO1 oxidoreductase regulates p53 in a MDM2-independent manner. In addition, Anwar et al7 demonstrated that p53 stabilization requires the physical interaction of p53 with NQO1. It was also shown that heat-shock protein HSP70B interacts with an immature form of NQO1 and is responsible for the stability and functionality of this oxidoreductase.47 We observed down-regulation of the HSP70B encoding gene and of the gene encoding for a component of the mitochondrial complex I with a NADH dehydrogenase activity, NDUFC1. These changes, which indicate interference of oligomycin with cellular redox regulation at the transcriptional level, are of particular interest, as only a small number of genes were consistently down-regulated by oligomycin (Table 1). It remains to be elucidated, whether oxidoreductase-specific p53 regulation may be operative in the ROS-mediated linkage between mitochondrial activity and the p53 system..

Thus, it is no surprise that functional p53 is lost in about half of all human cancers. What about the other half? One possibility is that p53-independent regulatory mechanisms have been lost. Another is that inactivation of p53-dependent pathways can occur at any of several different points and that p53 itself is merely the most common target. For example, the p53 inhibitor Mdm2 is overexpressed in tumors independently of the p53 mutation. Here, we review pathways that signal in to p53, in response to different forms of stress, and pathways that signal out, triggered by activated p53. It is clear that p53 is the central component of a complex network of signaling pathways and that the other components of these pathways pose alternative targets for inactivation. For additional recent reviews, see Refs. 1 and 2..

The same stimuli also activate p53, which is mostly latent in the absence of stress. The increase in the amount of protein is often achieved through an increase in the half-life, from ~30 min in untreated cells to ~150 min in, for example, UV-treated cells (3). However, an increase in the rate of translational initiation of p53 mRNA can also affect the steady-state level of the protein (for example, see Ref. 4). The ubiquitin pathway probably plays an important role in degrading p53 (5), and evidence for a ubiquitin-independent mechanism of degradation has also been presented (6)..

The fact that the mdm2 gene is a transcriptional target of p53 suggests a molecular basis for the commonly observed increased metabolic half-life of mutant p53 proteins defective in transactivation. Thus, the stability of these mutant proteins appears to be due to their inability to up-regulate the expression of Mdm2, a protein involved in their degradation, rather than an intrinsic property conferring resistance to degradation per se..

Chernov and Stark (10) found that sodium salicylate, which inhibits protein kinases inhibits the activation of p53, with no significant effect on the accumulation of the protein. Several processes might be involved in activating p53 (1), including phosphorylation, glycosylation, binding to regulatory proteins, alternative splicing, and acetylation (11)..

The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPK),1 a plausible candidate, binds to and is activated by broken ends of DNA (12) and can phosphorylate residues 15 and 37 of p53 in a DNA-dependent manner in vitro (13). The phosphorylation of serine 15 affects the transactivation and growth arrest functions of p53 in some cells (14). However, cells lacking DNAPK show no defect in the p53-mediated inhibition of the cell cycle, revealing that if DNAPK has any role in regulating p53 at all, other components must be able to compensate for its loss (15)..

However, very little in vivo evidence exists for the role of phosphorylation in regulating p53. Recent work showing that p53 can be acetylated in vitro is intriguing and suggests the possibility of an additional mechanism of regulation (11).

0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	15	Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) has long been known to have a role in recognizing DNA damage and in DNA repair. PARP-null Chinese hamster cells are defective in activating p53 and resistant to apoptosis induced by DNA damage (16). However, embryo fibroblasts from PARP-null mice have normal DNA repair and DNA damage-induced apoptosis (17), and although there is a significant decrease in the induction of p53 protein after DNA damage or nucleotide depletion, there is no change in p53 activity or in the cellular responses to stress (18). Therefore, although PARP is involved in increasing the amount of p53 protein in mouse fibroblasts, other signaling pathways must be more important in activating p53 in response to DNA damage, consistent with experiments showing at least two levels of 53 regulation (9, 10). Loss of ATM, the product of the ataxia telangiectasia gene, slows the induction of p53 protein in response to the DNA strand breaks caused by -radiation but not in response to the pyrimidine dimers caused by UV radiation (19, 20). Similarly, p53 is induced normally in human ATM-null cells after treatment with N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), which blocks de novo UMP biosynthesis, or adriamycin, which damages DNA.2 p53 and ATM may both be components of complexes that function in recombination (21). Similarly, the gene product involved in Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) has also been placed upstream of p53 in the pathway that responds to ionizing radiation but not in the responses to other DNA-damaging agents (22). Because the defects in p53 induction in ATM-null, NBS-null, and PARP-null cells are partial or selective for certain kinds of DNA damage, these gene products are involved in some but not all of the signals. Double or triple knock-outs should have a more profound (perhaps even a complete) defect in p53 induction in response to DNA damage. Similar partial defects in p53 signaling have been observed in Fanconi anemia syndrome (FAS) and Bloom's syndrome (BLS) fibroblasts, suggesting that many pathways regulate p53 (20, 23)..

0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	17	Recently a role for oncogenic Ras and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway in p53 modulation and function has been revealed in both human and rodent cells. High expression of Ras or activation of the Mos/MAPK pathway induces wild-type p53 levels and causes a permanent growth arrest, similar to cellular senescence (24, 25). Cells lacking p53 can tolerate high levels of MAPK and display loss of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and enhanced genomic instability (24). In a cell line defective in the MAP kinase pathway and in p53 expression, increased expression of the MAP kinase ERK2 restores the normal levels of p53, clearly placing ERK2 in a pathway that regulates the steady-state level of p53.3 MAPK has been shown to phosphorylate residue 73 or 83 of murine p53 in vitro, and this phosphorylation may be important in stabilizing the protein (26). Other kinases, such as DNAPK II, cyclin A-Cdc2, and cyclin B-Cdc2, are known to phosphorylate the p53 protein in vitro and may play a role in stabilizing it (14, 27). The mechanisms of p53 induction in response to different types of stress are still largely unknown..

How does it regulate so many different processes? p53 is a tetramer that can bind to specific sequences and thus transactivate a group of genes (reviewed in Ref. 1; for example, p21/waf1, gadd45, mdm2, cyclin G, bax, and IGF-BP3). Several groups have found that active p53 is sensed differently at different promoters, resulting in differential DNA binding and transactivation (for example, see Ref. 28). p53 can also inhibit the expression of some genes (for example, see topoisomerase IIa (29)). Furthermore, some p53-dependent phenotypes do not involve transcriptional regulation at all (for example, see Ref. 30)..

0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	21	The G1-S Transition-- Antibodies recognizing the C terminus of p53 prevent serum-stimulated fibroblasts from entering S phase (31). This result, originally interpreted as evidence that a positive function of p53 was required, posed a paradox when overexpression of wild-type p53 was found to cause growth arrest (32). The paradox was resolved when it was found that these antibodies activate rather than inhibit p53 (9). It is now understood more clearly that p53 mediates G1 arrest in response to DNA damage caused by UV or -radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, or nucleotide deprivation (33-35). The cell-type variability in p53-dependent G1 arrest is illustrated by studies with -radiation, which in normal diploid fibroblasts causes long-term, p53-dependent arrest associated with prolonged induction of p21/Waf1 (36). The irreversibility of this arrest depends on the inability of these cells to repair even a small number of double-strand DNA breaks, so that the activating signal persists (37). In contrast, -irradiation of HT1080 cells, derived from a fibrosarcoma with wild-type p53, causes a transient G1 arrest (38), whereas the colorectal tumor line RKO and the breast tumor line MCF7, which also have wild-type p53, fail to arrest in G1 following irradiation (39). These differences may indicate that tumor formation may involve the inactivation of components upstream or downstream of p53, causing the cellular response to DNA damage to fail. For example, -irradiation activates p53 to turn on the transcription of p21/Waf1, which binds to and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases, causing hypophosphorylation of Rb, thus preventing the release of E2F and blocking the G1-S transition (Fig. 1). Alteration of any of these downstream components may have an effect similar to that of inactivating p53 itself in preventing the pathway from functioning..
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	22	The G1-S Transition-- Antibodies recognizing the C terminus of p53 prevent serum-stimulated fibroblasts from entering S phase (31). This result, originally interpreted as evidence that a positive function of p53 was required, posed a paradox when overexpression of wild-type p53 was found to cause growth arrest (32). The paradox was resolved when it was found that these antibodies activate rather than inhibit p53 (9). It is now understood more clearly that p53 mediates G1 arrest in response to DNA damage caused by UV or -radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, or nucleotide deprivation (33-35). The cell-type variability in p53-dependent G1 arrest is illustrated by studies with -radiation, which in normal diploid fibroblasts causes long-term, p53-dependent arrest associated with prolonged induction of p21/Waf1 (36). The irreversibility of this arrest depends on the inability of these cells to repair even a small number of double-strand DNA breaks, so that the activating signal persists (37). In contrast, -irradiation of HT1080 cells, derived from a fibrosarcoma with wild-type p53, causes a transient G1 arrest (38), whereas the colorectal tumor line RKO and the breast tumor line MCF7, which also have wild-type p53, fail to arrest in G1 following irradiation (39).

Components of p53 signaling pathways. p53 accumulates and is modified and activated in response to signals generated by a variety of genotoxic stresses. Several proteins, including ATM, PARP, FAS, BLS, and NBS (see the text for full names), are involved in activation, but the pathways that lead to modification are largely unknown. The RAS-MAP kinase pathway is involved in establishing basal levels of p53 and may also affect function. Some of the cellular functions affected by p53 can be compromised by deregulated expression of Myc, Bcl2, E1B, or E2F. The control of p53 activity includes an autoregulatory loop involving Mdm2. The intact set of p53-dependent pathways helps to maintain genomic integrity by eliminating damaged cells, either by arresting them permanently or through apoptosis. p53 also helps to regulate entry into mitosis, spindle formation, and centrosome integrity, cell cycle checkpoints that are likely to be involved in preventing DNA damage from occurring..
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	24	The Spindle Checkpoint-- p53 is involved in a checkpoint that blocks the re-replication of DNA when the mitotic spindle has been damaged. When the DNA content of embryo fibroblasts was measured after treatment with nocodazole or other inhibitors of microtubule assembly, it was found that normal fibroblasts arrest with a 4 N content of DNA, whereas p53-null fibroblasts attain DNA contents of 8 or 16 N (40). Spindle destruction might block progression through mitosis, or re-replication might be controlled by blocking entry into S phase. In a murine cell line with wild-type p53, nocodazole causes transient mitotic arrest, followed by entry into G1 without chromosome segregation (41). p53 is induced after mitosis is complete. The conclusion that the p53 induced in response to spindle damage blocks entry into S phase was also reached by analyzing DNA synthesis in fibroblasts exposed to nocodazole or colcemid (42). Interestingly, fibroblasts from p21/Waf1-null mice do not re-replicate their DNA when treated with spindle poisons, consistent with the observation that G1 arrest in response to a number of agents is only partially abrogated in these cells (43). Therefore, p53 must also utilize p21-independent mechanisms to arrest cells in G1 and thus to inhibit re-replication in response to spindle poisons..

Alternatively, improper duplication of centrosomes may signal p53 activation, which could in turn cause arrest in G2 or G1. It is intriguing that MAP kinase and Cdc2, both capable of phosphorylating p53, are also bound to centrosomes (1, 26, 46, 47) and, like p53, MAP kinase is important for centrosome homeostasis (46)..

Recent results show that this property of p53 is important in a novel cell cycle checkpoint that controls entry into mitosis when DNA synthesis is blocked.4 In hydroxyurea-treated cells in which synthesis of dNTPs is blocked very rapidly, p53 plays a vital role in inhibiting premature entry into mitosis. Wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts do not attempt mitosis in hydroxyurea. In contrast, p53-null mouse embryo fibroblasts continue to attempt mitosis, entering metaphase with condensed chromatin and high levels of phosphorylated histone H1. However, cytokinesis cannot occur and mitosis is aborted, presumably because the spindles cannot segregate incompletely replicated DNA. Presumably, these responses are present to prevent the segregation of damaged or incompletely synthesized DNA..

Stimuli such as DNA damage, withdrawal of growth factors, and expression of Myc or E1A can also cause p53-dependent apoptosis (50-54). p53 must be able to function as a transcription factor to block the G1-S transition, but p53-mediated apoptosis does not necessarily require transcriptional activation, because inhibition of transcription by actinomycin D or translation by cycloheximide does not always affect p53-dependent apoptosis (30, 54). Furthermore, inhibitors of protein phosphatases induce p53-dependent apoptosis in the absence of transactivation (55). However, the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Igf-Bp3 are transcriptional targets of p53, suggesting that transactivation by p53 is important in inducing apoptosis in some circumstances. In addition, the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and the adenovirus 19-kDa E1B protein can prevent p53-mediated apoptosis (53, 56)..

Although the mechanisms of such divergent responses are not known, deletion of p21/Waf1 can cause cells that would otherwise undergo p53-dependent cell cycle arrest to undergo apoptosis instead, underscoring the major role of genetic background in determining these cellular responses (57). Several variables, such as the extent of DNA damage and the levels of p53, also affect the choice between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (58). Also, cross-talk between the p53 and Rb pathways may be important in determining the biological responses to DNA damage. For example, the inactivation of Rb results in the loss of G1 arrest and induction of apoptosis after DNA damage (59). This might be explained by the release of E2F (Fig. 1), which when overexpressed on its own can induce apoptosis (60). Furthermore, overexpression of Rb blocks p53-mediated apoptosis (61). Thus, modulation of Rb and E2F through p53 signaling in response to DNA damage may play a central role in determining the balance between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis..

In most transformed or immortalized cells, drugs such as PALA or methotrexate, which inhibit the synthesis of nucleotide precursors, select for the amplification of target genes whose products overcome the inhibition, carbamyl-P synthetase/aspartate transcarbamylase/dihydro-orotase (CAD) in the case of PALA and dihydrofolate reductase for methotrexate (62). However, normal cells (63) and rare cell lines, such as REF52 (64), do not give rise to resistant colonies in these drugs. The function of p53 is lost frequently during the process of tumorigenesis (65) and in the spontaneous immortalization of primary cells (66), indicating that p53 can be the main factor determining permissivity for gene amplification. Indeed, embryo fibroblasts from p53-null mice are permissive for gene amplification (67), and primary human cells from Li-Fraumeni patients became permissive as soon as they lost their single copy of wild-type p53 (67, 68). Transformation of REF52 cells with either SV40 large T antigen or activated Ras plus E1A abolishes p53-dependent cell cycle control and allows these cells to become permissive for gene amplification (64). What signal is generated as a part of the mechanism of gene amplification that could activate p53-dependent pathways and prevent the propagation of drug-resistant cells? The current model of amplification involves, as an essential early step, multiple bridge-breakage-fusion cycles in which broken DNA is formed throughout an entire lineage of daughter cells (69, 70). The importance of DNA damage in regulating early stages of gene amplification was demonstrated with REF52 cells transfected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of SV40 large T antigen (71). When these cells are selected with PALA at low temperature, active large T antigen inactivates p53, rendering the cells permissive for gene amplification. Restoration of p53 by inactivating large T antigen at a higher temperature very early in the process of forming PALA-resistant colonies stably arrests all cells containing newly amplified DNA..

Most PALA-resistant colonies, from several different human cell lines, either do not contain amplified CAD DNA at all or increase the copy number of CAD as isochromosomes 2p (72). However, in both cases, p53-dependent pathways are still involved. The depletion of pyrimidine nucleotides caused by PALA generates a signal for p53 induction before any DNA damage occurs (35), arresting the cells and preventing PALA-resistant colonies from forming. Recent work has shown that overexpressing endogenous or exogenous N-Myc allows REF52 cells to overcome the p53-dependent cell cycle arrest caused by DNA damage, making these cells permissive for gene amplification (73). This observation emphasizes the fact that p53-dependent pathways can be inhibited at any of several different points (Fig. 1)..

Alterations in components either upstream or downstream of p53 may be analogous to inactivation of p53 itself, preventing all or a part of the entire pathway from functioning and leading to deregulation of cell cycle controls, genomic instability, and the development of cancer. In addition, the recently discovered protein p73, which has a high degree of structural and functional homology to p53, may be another important target for inactivation during the development of cancer (74). It remains to be determined if p73 affects signals impinging on or emanating from p53 or if it is a central component of its own independent signaling network..

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The role of the checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) as an upstream activator of p53 following DNA damage has been controversial. We have recently shown that Chk2 and the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) are both involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis but not G1 arrest in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Here we demonstrate that Chk2 is required to activate p53 in vitro as measured by its ability to bind its consensus DNA target sequence following DNA damage and is in fact the previously unidentified factor working synergistically with DNA-PK to activate p53. The gene mutated in ataxia telangiectasia is not involved in this p53 activation. Using wortmannin, serine 15 mutants of p53, DNA-PK null cells and Chk2 null cells, we demonstrate that DNA-PK and Chk2 act independently and sequentially on p53. Furthermore, the p53 target of these two kinases represents a latent (preexisting) population of p53. Taken together, the results from these studies are consistent with a model in which DNA damage causes an immediate and sequential modification of latent p53 by DNA-PK and Chk2, which under appropriate conditions can lead to apoptosis..

Furthermore, Chk2 has been identified in a subset of Li Fraumeni patients with normal p53 alleles, making it a potential tumor suppressor protein (17 to 19). How endogenous Chk2 functions in this capacity has been the focus of many recent studies. Chk2-/- murine embryonic stem cells have been examined and reported to be unable to maintain IR-induced G2 arrest, and murine Chk2-/- thymocytes and mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) have been shown to have an attenuated apoptotic response (12). The role of Chk2 in the G1 cell cycle checkpoint in the murine model has been controversial with some groups reporting its requirement, whereas others are reporting it as unnecessary for the p53-mediated G1/S arrest (12 to 15)..

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	9	The role of Chk2 in the human p53 responses has recently been questioned. Ahn et al. (20) have purified Chk2 from DNA damaged human cells and demonstrate that p53 phosphorylation is not enhanced after IR. Furthermore, following introduction of Chk2 short interfering RNA into three different human tumor cell lines, p53 was still found to be stabilized and active after IR. Concurrently, Jallepalli et al. (21) disrupted the Chk2 gene in human cancer cells and found that p53 Ser-20 phosphorylation, stabilization, and transcriptional activation as well as its cell cycle-mediated arrest and apoptotic responses remained intact. These two reports call into question the role of Chk2 in human cells and further question whether Chk2 lies upstream of the p53-dependent apoptotic response because it seems clear that it does lie upstream in the murine system. More recently, however, Craig et al. (22) have demonstrated that Chk2 is regulated by allosteric effects of p53 and that its kinase-dependent phosphorylation of p53 requires conformational docking sites on p53, lending evidence again to a role for human p53 as a target of Chk2 phosphorylation..
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	10	Because disruption of the p53 tumor suppressor is often found in many human cancers, understanding the mechanism of p53 activation is essential to our progress in the treatment of cancer. We have recently reported that DNA-PK and Chk2 are both required for p53-mediated apoptosis in MEFs and that they function in a pathway that uses latent p53 to mediate this response (8, 13). In this study, we used various approaches to establish the link between these two kinases in p53 activation following DNA damage. We show that Chk2 and DNA-PK act synergistically and in parallel to activate p53 (including human p53) as measured by its ability to bind its consensus DNA target sequence. The p53 target of these two kinases is a latent (preexisting) population of p53. The gene mutated in ATM is not involved in this p53 activation. Our results are consistent with a model in which the immediate actions of DNA-PK and Chk2 on latent p53 following DNA damage are the first events that dictate the subsequent cellular apoptotic response..

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	19	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   DNA-PK and Chk2 Are Both Required to Activate p53 DNA Binding in Vitro We have previously demonstrated that DNA-PK is necessary but not sufficient to activate p53 DNA binding in vitro and that an unknown factor present in DNA damaged cells is also required for p53 activation (7). More recently, we reported that both DNA-PK and Chk2 are involved in p53-dependent apoptosis and that the latent, rather than the inducible population of p53, is implicated in this process (8, 13). To determine whether the unknown factor that collaborated with DNA-PK in activating p53 in vitro was Chk2, we employed the same cell-free translation system used previously to show that DNA-PK acts upstream of p53 in promoting p53 sequence-specific binding (7). Accordingly, wild-type human p53 was translated in a cytoplasmic extract prepared from the human glioma cell line M059J, which lacks any DNA-PK activity (because of defective expression of DNA-PK catalytic subunit) (23). Nuclear extract from either DNA-PK-positive (M059K) or null (M059J) glioma cell lines (untreated or -irradiated) was then added to test whether the translated p53 could be activated for p53 binding. As previously reported (7), the irradiated glioma line with DNA-PK (M059K) activated p53 binding as did the glioma line lacking DNA-PK (M059J) if supplemented with purified DNA-PK (Fig. 1, lanes 1 to 4). Most importantly, whereas DNA-PK or Chk2 (in vitro translated) alone was unable to activate p53 (lanes 5 and 6), together they activated p53 binding to the same extent as with the irradiated nuclear extract (lane 7). The specificity of the Chk2 kinase in this role was confirmed because Chk1 kinase did not cooperate with DNA-PK to activate p53 (data not shown). The ability of DNA-PK to activate p53 in the absence of DNA damage in this case can be explained by the fact that DNA-PK is activated by the presence of DNA ends supplied by the consensus DNA sequence. Also, it has been shown recently that overexpression of Chk2 can result in autophosphorylation and trans-phosphorylation events that activate Chk2 in the absence of IR (24). Therefore, our experiment identifies the previously hypothesized "unknown" nuclear factor acting with DNA-PK to activate p53 DNA binding in vitro (13) as the checkpoint kinase Chk2. In addition, because all of the components involved are human in origin, our experiment supports a possible role of Chk2 upstream of human p53..

The p53 in these A-T cells is highly unstable, and therefore, no endogenous p53 protein was detectable by EMSA (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 7) or by Western blot (data not shown). However, nuclear extracts from IR-treated A-T cells, similar to those from IR-treated M059K cells, were able to activate in vitro translated p53 (Fig. 2, lanes 2 to 5). This finding suggests that ATM, although necessary for the stabilization of p53, is not required for the activation of p53 DNA binding. In an independent experiment, A-T cells were treated with leptomycin B to determine whether accumulation of p53 by stabilization alone was enough to activate p53 DNA binding and it was found that it was not (data not shown). This finding is consistent with our previous results, demonstrating that Chk2 functions independently of ATM to activate the p53-apoptotic response (13)..

As can be seen in Fig. 3A, DNA-PK activity is required to activate p53 because inhibition of DNA-PK prior to its incubation with p53 prevented p53 DNA binding (compare lanes 3 and 4). By contrast, if DNA-PK and p53 are allowed to interact and then DNA-PK is inhibited by wortmannin prior to Chk2 addition, p53 binding can still be observed (Fig. 3A, lane 5).

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	31	  We have previously demonstrated that Ser-15 on latent p53 is a target of DNA-PK immediately following DNA damage and that this residue plays a role in IR-induced apoptosis of MEFs (8). To determine whether Ser-15 is also involved in the in vitro activation of p53 by DNA-PK, two Ser-15 mutants of p53, S15A and S15D, were tested in our in vitro activation assays. Because S15D mimics phospho-Ser-15, it was expected to be active even in the absence of DNA-PK, whereas S15A would be innately inactive. Unexpectedly, we found that for both mutants, Chk2 was absolutely required but DNA-PK was dispensable for activation of DNA binding (Fig. 3B). This finding suggests that conformational changes in p53 brought on by Ser-15 phosphorylation, rather than a difference in charge, are responsible for DNA-PK-induced activation of p53. The observation that, for both S15A and S15D mutants, Chk2 alone was able to activate DNA binding in the absence of DNA-PK also strongly argues for the independence of Chk2 from DNA-PK. It further implies that upon DNA damage, p53 is probably first acted on by DNA-PK before being further modified by Chk2..

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	48	Further evidence for a parallel and sequential mechanism of p53 activation by DNA-PK and Chk2 comes from the observation that the two p53 Ser-15 mutants, S15A and S15D, do not require DNA-PK and can be activated by Chk2 alone. Although this result is expected for the S15D mutant, which mimics phospho-Ser-15, it came initially as a surprise in the case of the S15A mutant. The most logical explanation for both of these mutants being able to bypass the DNA-PK requirement is that modification of serine 15 by any means (phosphorylation or mutation) leads to an altered conformation of p53, which is recognizable by Chk2. Indeed, previous work by Shieh et al. (29) shows that phosphorylation at the serine 15 site by DNA-PK alters the tertiary structure of p53. Very recently, Craig et al. (22) demonstrated that two peptides derived from the DNA binding domain of p53 could bind Chk2 and allosterically stimulate the phosphorylation of full-length p53. Based on our present findings, we contend that the reason why full-length p53 by itself cannot activate Chk2 is probably because these Chk2-docking sites on native p53 are cryptic and are exposed only after phosphorylation of Ser-15 by DNA-PK. Thus, the initial modification of p53 by DNA-PK is a prerequisite for its subsequent modification by Chk2 with the two events probably occurring quickly in tandem and resulting in full p53 activation..

Therefore, it therefore appears that the fate of the cell (cell growth arrest or apoptosis) is determined very early on, possibly immediately following DNA damage.

The modified p53 manifests DNA binding activity in vitro, which may reflect the actual event in vivo or an altered conformational state that is unrelated to its DNA binding activity. In either case, the extent of such modifications on this latent population of p53 probably dictates the subsequent course of action and, depending on the cell context, can lead to apoptosis..

Immediately following DNA damage, DNA-PK is activated by strand breaks and phosphorylates a latent (preexisting) population of p53 on Ser-15. This induces a conformational change in the p53 protein such that it is recognized by the Chk2 kinase, which then phosphorylates (and activates) the latent p53. The severity and nature of DNA damage incurred dictates the extent of this latent p53 activation, which in many cell types probably represents the first obligatory event that leads to apoptosis. Under circumstances where cell growth arrest or DNA repair is the preferred outcome, a separate pathway (data not shown) involving inducible p53 and mediated by ATM, ATR, or other kinases comes into play..

Perspective/future directions References   The tumour suppressor p53 has an essential role in maintaining the genomic integrity of the mammalian cell. This is achieved in part through its function as a transcription factor enabling it to induce either growth arrest or apoptosis in response to cellular stress. Changes in gene expression commonly require localized chromatin remodelling and p53 is known to interact in vivo with a variety of transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors with intrinsic histone modifying activities. Here we examine the links between p53 and chromatin structures associated with (i) transcriptional regulation of gene expression, (ii) with DNA repair as part of the process of nucleotide excision repair and (iii) with histone modifications which impact upon chromosomal condensation and ploidy..

Perspective/future directions References   The packaging of DNA into chromatin is a major obstacle to transcription as well as to DNA repair, recombination and replication (1). Chromatin remodelling is necessary to allow such processes to proceed and may be defined as a discernible alteration in chromatin structure that results in a change in the accessibility of a region of DNA. This encompasses changes induced by ATP-dependent remodelling complexes that can alter nucleosomal positioning, and post-translational modification of nucleosomal histones, which may alter the interactions between histones and the DNA (2,3). Post-translational histone modification may also play a role in chromatin remodelling indirectly through the specific recruitment of non-histone proteins such as ATP-dependent remodelling complexes to chromatin (4,5). The N-termini of the core histones are subject to a plethora of site-specific modifications including acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation (5). The significance of these modifications can vary between the different histones. For example, modification of the histone H3 has critical roles in heterochromatin and euchromatin formation (6), global chromatin condensation for mitosis (7 to 11), and chromatin remodelling for transcription and repair (5,12,13)..

Global chromatin remodelling for... p53 and histone... Regulation of S10 H3... Perspective/future directions References   Although euchromatin is transcriptionally competent, access of the transcriptional machinery to the DNA is severely restricted and transcription of genes located within euchromatin still requires local chromatin remodelling in order to proceed. The susceptibility of different genes to chromatin repression can vary considerably, however, depending upon factors such as the exact positioning of nucleosomes over the gene promoter and the ability of transcription factors to compete with histones for binding DNA (1,15). Consequently, the contribution of chromatin remodelling to regulation of gene expression can also differ drastically between genes..
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	9	A number of transcriptional co-activators and co-repressor complexes that bind p53 in vivo possess histone-modifying activities (16 to 20) suggesting that targeted chromatin remodelling may be important for p53 function as a transcription factor. Moreover, in several cases the ability of a protein to act as a transcriptional co-activator or co-repressor has been shown to be dependent upon its enzymatic activity (21,22). However, histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases also target non-histone proteins for acetylation/deacetylation and, interestingly, such targets include p53 (16 to 19,23,24). p53 is regulated by multiple post-translational modifications, including acetylation at a number of sites in its C-terminus (19,23,24). The co-activator and HAT p300 directly acetylates p53 at several lysine residues and acetylation has been reported to affect aspects of p53 function including DNA-binding (19,23,24), stability (25,26) and subcellular localization (27,28). Since p53 is a substrate for HATs and HDACs (16 to 19,23 to 26) it is quite likely that changes in p53-dependent transcription upon recruitment of these activities may not necessarily be due to changes in histone acetylation. A number of studies have addressed this issue directly and for some p53 target genes histone modification rather than modification of p53 is important for p53-dependent changes in gene expression (20,29 to 31)..

Using a reconstituted in vitro transcription system with a chromatin-assembled p21 promoter, Epsinosa and Emerson found that the ability of p53 and p300 to activate p21 transcription is dependent upon cooperation to overcome the repressive effects of chromatin packing rather than acetylation of p53 by p300 (29). Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that p53 recruits p300 to the p21 promoter thereby enabling targeted acetylation of chromatin-assembled core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (29)..

Following gamma irradiation they used chromatin immunoprecipitation to analyse the effects of p53 acetylation status on the association of p53 and of non-acetylatable p53 mutants with the endogenous p21 promoter (30). Consistent with the results of Epsinosa and Emerson, acetylation of p53 had no discernible effect on p53 binding to the endogenous p21 promoter. Exploring other possibilities, they found that acetylation of p53 promotes the association of the co-activators CBP and TRRAP with the p21 promoter (30). While CBP has intrinsic HAT activity (34), TRRAP is a component of multiple co-activator complexes with HAT activity including PCAF, TFTC, STAGA and Tip60 complexes (35,36). Recruitment of CBP and TRRAP by acetylated p53 correlated with elevated levels of acetylated H3 and H4 at the endogenous p21 promoter (30). In another study, a variety of p53 mutants expressed in stable cell lines were analysed for their ability to activate endogenous p21 transcription (37). While ChIP analysis revealed that the abilities of most of the mutants to bind to the p21 promoter was equivalent to that of wild-type p53, differences in their ability to activate transcription correlated directly with the extent of histone acetylation and levels of p300/CBP at the p21 promoter (37). In further support of the importance of chromatin remodelling in p53-mediated regulation of p21 transcription, Lagger et al. have discovered recently that p53 and the histone deacetylase HDAC1 are antagonistic regulators of p21 gene expression in vivo and that p53 can displace HDAC1 from the p21 promoter (38). Other transcriptional targets of p53 include mdm2. Here transcriptional activation is dependent on recruitment of TRRAP, correlating with increased histone acetylation suggesting that chromatin remodelling is also important for p53-dependent regulation of mdm2 transcription (31)..

Global chromatin remodelling for... p53 and histone... Regulation of S10 H3... Perspective/future directions References   The mammalian genome is prone to bombardment by a multiplicity of genotoxic insults as well as naturally occurring errors that need to be repaired. Amongst the most common forms of DNA damage are bulky DNA lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts caused by UV-irradiation and other environmental carcinogens (41). These types of lesions are eliminated by NER, which comprises of two subpathways: transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which removes lesions from actively transcribed regions of the genome, and global genomic repair (GGR), which erases damage in non-transcribed regions (41). Efficient detection of these lesions requires chromatin relaxation (42 to 45) and for TCR the  opening  of chromatin by passage of the RNA polymerase along its template seems sufficient (45). For GGR global chromatin relaxation is required to allow detection of lesions throughout the genome (43 to 45)..
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	23	Although it is well documented that efficient NER requires p53 (46) its exact role has been difficult to define. Significantly, NER reconstituted in vitro with naked DNA has no requirement for p53 (47) but p53 is necessary for efficient NER in its natural context of chromatin and notably only for GGR (48,49). Moreover, the effect of p53 on the efficiency of GGR is much greater for CPDs than 6-4 photoproducts (48,49). CPDs are often located within nucleosomes and are thus much more dependent on chromatin relaxation for their repair than 6-4 photoproducts, which are only found in linker DNA (50). Together the data are clearly suggestive that p53 may function in NER by facilitating access to the chromatin for GGR. Using microscopy Rubbi and Milner asked if p53 can induce global chromatin relaxation for GGR and demonstrated that p53 is required for global chromatin relaxation induced by UV-irradiation (Figure 2) (43). Interestingly, the UV dose of 4 J/m2 used in this study is half the minimum dose necessary to activate p53 as a transcription factor (51 to 53). This suggests that p53-dependent global chromatin relaxation is due to transcription-independent effects of p53. Furthermore, xeroderma pigmentosum cells deficient in p48, XPC or XPA all showed normal UV-induced global chromatin relaxation for GGR (43) thus demonstrating that the p53 requirement for global chromatin relaxation is not mediated by p48 or XPC transcriptional targets of p53. Under conditions in which p53 is activated as a transcription factor it is likely that p53 also has additional roles in NER (and perhaps chromatin accessibility) through the transcriptional induction of repair factors such as p48 and XPC (54 to 57). Recent work from Ford and colleagues has shown that p48 can rapidly co-localize with CPD-containing foci following localized UV-irradiation and that p48 facilitates localization of XPC at such foci, leading to the suggestion that p48 may remodel chromatin thereby enabling the recognition of CPDs by XPC (56,57). Here it is important to distinguish between chromatin relaxation and chromatin remodelling, and to note that p48 is dispensable for p53-dependent chromatin relaxation (43) (see above) but may facilitate chromatin remodelling (56,57)..

Furthermore, xeroderma pigmentosum cells deficient in p48, XPC or XPA all showed normal UV-induced global chromatin relaxation for GGR (43) thus demonstrating that the p53 requirement for global chromatin relaxation is not mediated by p48 or XPC transcriptional targets of p53. Under conditions in which p53 is activated as a transcription factor it is likely that p53 also has additional roles in NER (and perhaps chromatin accessibility) through the transcriptional induction of repair factors such as p48 and XPC (54 to 57). Recent work from Ford and colleagues has shown that p48 can rapidly co-localize with CPD-containing foci following localized UV-irradiation and that p48 facilitates localization of XPC at such foci, leading to the suggestion that p48 may remodel chromatin thereby enabling the recognition of CPDs by XPC (56,57). Here it is important to distinguish between chromatin relaxation and chromatin remodelling, and to note that p48 is dispensable for p53-dependent chromatin relaxation (43) (see above) but may facilitate chromatin remodelling (56,57)..

This allows access of the repair machinery to the DNA lesions for GGR.

Global chromatin remodelling for... p53 and histone... Regulation of S10 H3... Perspective/future directions References   Local, p53-dependent changes in histone acetylation have been observed at the promoters of a number of p53 target genes (20,29 to 31,37,38,60 to 62). The demonstration that p53 can induce global alterations in chromatin structure raised the possibility that p53 might influence histone modification on a global scale. Focusing upon modification of histone H3 because of its central role in local and global chromatin remodelling (5 to 9,12), we compared the pattern of modification at specific residues of H3 in isogenic clones of human p53+/+ and p53 to / to  cells. Since there is a general increase in histone acetylation following UV treatment (58) we were particularly interested to see whether other lysine residues of histone H3 in addition to K9 were similarly acetylated in response to UV irradiation. In contrast to K9, levels of acetylated K18 of histone H3 did not change in response to UV-irradiation (59). However, p53 did facilitate a rise in acetylated K14 levels (59). Our results demonstrate that p53, directly or indirectly, has site-specific effects on histone H3 acetylation in response to UV-irradiation and it will be interesting to see how these changes are mediated and if they contribute to p53-induced global chromatin relaxation for GGR. With the recent advances in siRNA technology it should be possible to confirm the effects of p53 upon histone H3 modification already observed in isogenic clones of human p53+/+ and p53 to / to  cells. RNA interference should also allow examination of p53 effects in a range of cell types of wild-type or mutant p53 background for which isogenic clones are not yet available..

Indeed, acetylation at K9 and K14, both of which are regulated by p53, has been associated with chromatin relaxation for transcription (12). Changes in histone acetylation have been observed previously at p53 target genes and there is evidence for differential core histone acetylation at different genes (61). Our own results identify differential effects of p53 upon individual residues within histone H3, a key determinant of chromatin organization. p53 also influences histone H3 modification under normal growth conditions in which p53 is not activated as a transcription factor (observations summarized in Figure 3, see ref. 59 for details). This clearly has important implications and suggests additional roles for p53 in chromatin remodelling beyond UV-induced global relaxation for repair and localized remodelling for transcription..

Global chromatin remodelling for... p53 and histone... Regulation of S10 H3... Perspective/future directions References   In addition to site-specific effects on histone H3 acetylation, p53 also affects levels of phosphorylated S10 of histone H3 (Figure 3 and ref. 59). Phosphorylation of S10 of histone H3 has at least two distinct roles in the cell. At the level of local chromatin remodelling, S10 phosphorylation is important for the transcriptional activation of specific genes including the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun (64 to 66). On a larger scale of chromatin remodelling, global S10 H3 phosphorylation occurs in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and is required for proper chromosome condensation and segregation at mitosis (7 to 10)..

Significantly, AIM1/Aurora B is over-expressed in many human cancer cell lines and abnormalities in S10 phosphorylation have been shown to cause chromosomal abnormalities and segregation defects resulting in aneuploidy (7,10,68). Loss of p53 also causes abnormalities in S10 H3 phosphorylation (59). Under constitutive growth conditions, we consistently found that total levels of S10P H3 were at least several fold higher in the absence of p53 (59). Moreover, whereas total levels of S10P H3 remained relatively constant in response to various treatments in p53+/+ cells, in the absence of p53 levels of S10P H3 were found to vary enormously in a tight inverse relationship with total levels of acetylated K9 H3 (59). It seems that in the absence of p53, S10P levels are dictated to a large extent by the levels of acetylated K9. Such dependency upon the levels of another modification is potentially very dangerous for the cell as it may not allow appropriate regulation of S10 phosphorylation, which is critical for proper chromosomal condensation for mitosis and the maintenance of a normal ploidy. Abnormal S10P H3 levels were also observed in p53 to / to  cells following release from nocodazole-induced G2/M arrest and this correlated with impaired cell cycle recovery (59), possibly due to defective chromosomal management..

Perspective/future directions References   Recent advances suggest that chromatin remodelling plays a crucial role in p53 function and that this extends beyond its role as a transcription factor (Figure 4). The field now awaits further studies to decipher exactly how p53 exerts its effects on chromatin. How, for example, does p53 induce global chromatin relaxation for GGR? This may be mediated, in part, through recruitment of p300 by p53 to chromatin and acetylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 but is this really sufficient, or are other HATs and chromatin modifying complexes involved? We have shown that p53 differentially affects multiple modifications of the same core histone. Further work is now needed to elucidate the functional consequences of this distinct pattern of histone modifications and to determine how p53 achieves its specificity..

As the case of methylated K9 and K4 of histone H3 exemplifies, the same modification of different residues of the same histone cannot be presumed equivalent (6). Clearly there is a need to define in detail the pattern of modification at specific genes. For example, how does the pattern of histone modification differ between a gene repressed by p53 and a gene activated by p53?

Do the effects vary depending upon stress and how do they correlate with the pattern of gene expression, i.e. choice between growth arrest or death? Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with engineered mutation of histones at selected sites (4) will prove invaluable in addressing such questions.

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   S100 calcium-binding proteins such as S100B are elevated in primary malignant melanoma and are used as markers for this and numerous other cancers. Wild-type p53 protein levels are relatively low in these cancer cells (i.e. when compared with cells without S100B) but are elevated when RNA antisense to S100B is introduced. This result implicates S100B in the down-regulation of p53 and is consistent with the large decreases in p53 protein levels observed previously in transient co-transfections of p53 and S100B (Lin, J., Blake, M., Tang, C., Zimmer, D., Rustandi, R. R., Weber, D. J., and Carrier, F. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 35037 to 35041). Down-regulation of p53 in primary malignant melanoma cells is likely the result of a direct interaction with S100B, which was observed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, p53 binds regions of the S100B promoter, one of which matches the 20-nucleotide p53-binding consensus DNA sequence perfectly. Therefore, when p53 levels increase, it contributes to its own demise by up-regulating the transcription of S100B as part of a negative feedback loop. This is analogous to what is found for another protein that down-regulates p53, namely hdm2 (human double mutant 2)..

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription activator that signals for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and plays a pivotal role in the maintenance and regulation of normal cellular functions (1, 2). Its inactivation affects cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, gene amplification, centrosome duplication, and ploidy (2 to 9). If p53 is inactivated by mutation, as is found in  > 50% of human cancers, the cell cycle proceeds unregulated, and cell growth proliferates. Likewise, apoptosis pathways are not induced, and proliferating cells transform into cancerous ones (3, 10). On the other hand, if p53 levels are too high, then phenotypes associated with aging, particularly those associated with problems in skin and bone, are observed (11). For these reasons, it is important that p53 protein levels are highly regulated, which is achieved by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins inside the cell (5, 12 to 15). The interactions of p53 with members of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins (i.e. S100B) are particularly intriguing because they link p53 biology to calcium-mediated signal transduction pathways..

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	8	There are now  > 20 members of the S100 family of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins, and they are widely distributed in human tissue (16 to 18). S100 proteins were given this name because they are soluble in 100% saturated ammonium sulfate (19). One member, S100B, is a 21.5-kDa symmetric homodimer that is highly conserved ( > 95%) among mammals (16, 19). In a manner similar to that of calmodulin, a Ca2+-dependent conformational change is required for S100B to bind target proteins such as p53 (20, 21). Although it is not completely clear how S100 proteins affect cell growth, S100B and several other S100 proteins (i.e. S100A1, mts1) interact with the tumor suppressor protein p53, resulting in significantly reduced p53 levels, and p53-dependent transcription activation of target genes is inhibited (22 to 24). In primary malignant melanoma cancer cells, we report here that S100B interacts directly with p53 and that inhibiting S100B with siRNA restores the functional p53 protein. These data support the notion that higher than normal levels of S100B, as found in malignant melanoma, are likely contributing to tumor progression by excessive down-regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein..

This observation is consistent with what is found in transient co-transfections of S100B and p53, where levels of the tumor suppressor protein were significantly reduced by the addition of S100B ( > 100-fold) (23). Using increasing amounts of purified recombinant S100B protein (Fig. 1A; lanes 3 to 6), we estimated that the levels of S100B in the melanoma C8146A cells are at least 50 times higher than in the U118 cells (Fig. 1A). To verify whether the S100B-p53 correlation was specific to C8146A cells or could be found in other melanoma cells, we performed Western blots analysis in five other melanoma cell lines known to have a p53 wild-type genotype (28). The data shown in Fig. 1B indicate that cells having relatively low S100B levels (i.e. LOX-IM VI, UACC-62, and SK-MEL-5) have higher levels of p53, whereas in UACC-2571, C8146A, and Malme 3M cells the S100B levels are relatively high and the p53 levels are lower as compared with the other melanoma lines. This indicates that the S100B-p53 correlation (i.e. high S100B/low p53 levels) is consistent in at least six melanoma cell lines..

The bar labeled with the asterisk (*) for the LOX-MM cell line is off-scale and has a p53 to S100B ratio of 11.8  plus or minus  2.8. Together, these data illustrate that skin cancer cells with higher S100B protein levels have diminished levels of wild-type p53..
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	23	  To determine whether S100B contributes directly to the lowering of p53 levels in the melanoma cancer cells, siRNA corresponding to the C terminus of S100B (siRNAS100B) was introduced into primary C8146A melanoma cells and compared with results from scrambled siRNA that does not interfere with S100B production (Fig. 2). The addition of the S100B antisense RNA lowered S100B levels by 2.4  plus or minus  0.3-fold and correspondingly, increases in p53 levels (2.5  plus or minus  0.3-fold) were observed (Fig. 2; 20 nM siRNAS100B). Likewise, levels of the p21 protein, Bcl-2, and hdm2 (i.e. genes activated by p53) were also up-regulated by comparable amounts with the addition of the siRNA of S100B when p53 levels are elevated (Fig. 2). These results with antisense RNA indicate that S100B contributes directly to the down-regulation of functional p53 inside primary malignant melanoma cancer cells and that inhibiting S100B protein production with siRNAS100B restores active p53..

However, it is critically important to determine whether S100B and p53 interact directly inside cells. To do this, co-immunoprecipitation of the S100B-p53 complex was monitored in C8416 melanoma cells (Fig. 3). The data in Fig. 3 indicate that, in addition to the immunoprecipitation of S100B, the S100B antibody can co-immunoprecipitate p53 (lane 1). The reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiment performed with p53 antibody (lane 2) confirmed the formation of a complex between p53 and S100B in primary malignant melanoma (C8416 cells). As a control, it was shown that nonspecific antibodies of the same isotype could not immunoprecipitate p53 (lane 3) and S100B (lane 4). Therefore, it is likely that a direct interaction between the S100B and p53 proteins contributes to decreased levels of the tumor suppressor, p53, in melanoma with elevated S100B..

In a situation analogous to that of hdm2, the promoter for S100B has seven regions in its promoter (named prS100B-1 to prS100B-7) that correspond to the consensus sequence for p53 binding.2 In fact, one DNA sequence, prS100B-3, matches perfectly the 20-nucleotide p53-binding consensus sequence (20/20 nucleotide match).2.

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	30	Mobility shift assays (Fig. 4) were performed with purified p53 to determine whether sequences in the promoter of S100B (prS100B-1, prS100B-2, and prS100B-3) were bona fide p53 binding sites, using the p53 regulatory sequence from GADD45, a p53 downstream effector gene (34), as a positive control. The data shown in Fig. 4 indicate that a complex of slower mobility was generated with both GADD45 and the prS100B-3 probes (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 5, respectively). Moreover, both bands were super-shifted by the p53 antibody (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 6, respectively) and, thus, represent genuine p53 complexes. However, despite the fact that the prS100B-3 sequence matches the consensus sequence perfectly, five times more protein and DNA were necessary to generate the protein-DNA complex with the prS100B-3 promoter sequence when compared with data from the GADD45 sequence (Fig. 4). In a separate experiment, when equal concentrations of protein and DNA were used in such band shift assays, the intensity of the super-shifted DNA band, as measured by densitometry, was 6.5  plus or minus  0.8-fold lower for the prS100B-3 promoter sequence than for the GADD45 DNA. This may be due to the fact that two of the A/T variants in the consensus sequence are A in the GADD45 sequence, which is preferred, but are T in the prS100B-3 sequence (Fig. 4). Another difference between these p53 binding sites is the length of the intervening DNA sequence that links the two 10-nucleotide stretches of DNA that interact with p53 (11 nt in prS100B-3 versus 0 nt in GADD45; Fig. 4). Similar data were obtained with the two other p53 consensus sites in the S100B promoter (nt 149 to 169, prS100B-1; nt 1455 to 1478, prS100B-2); however, these sites had lower affinity for p53 than did the 20/20 sequence, prS100B-3 (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that the regulation of S100B transcription by p53 would occur only after genes with higher affinity p53 sites in their promoters are occupied..

Transient transfections performed in the p53 null cells H1299 (p53-/-) indicated that each S100B promoter construct was activated in a p53-dependent manner (Fig. 5; lanes 8 to 11). Likewise, it was found that endogenous wild-type p53 in RKO cells (34) (p53+/+) could also activate the S100B promoter constructs and that UV treatment amplified this transcription activation activity as found with other genes activated by p53 (Fig. 6). However, it is likely that negative regulatory elements exist in the S100B promoter that affect the p53-dependent transcription activation of S100B, because cutting the S100B promoter back to make smaller constructs was found to increase the amount of p53-dependent transcription activation in both cell lines (Figs. 5 and 6). These results are not too surprising, however, because previous studies of the S100B promoter indicate that the overall regulation of this S100 gene is complex, often cell-type specific, and involves multiple positive and negatively regulatory elements (25)..

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	40	View larger version (21K):    FIG. 7. Scheme for the down-regulation of wild-type p53. p53 is activated upon DNA damage or under stress and up-regulates the transcription of genes involved in apoptosis (i.e. Bax, etc.) and cell cycle-dependent growth arrest (i.e. p21 etc.). As part of a feedback control mechanism, p53 also up-regulates the transcription of genes involved in its own inactivation (i.e. hdm2 and S100B). As part of a cell growth response (Ca2+), the Ca2+-dependent interaction between S100B and p53 induces a conformational change in p53 and tetramer dissociation of the tumor suppressor (29), which likely contributes to its degradation (i.e. perhaps involving hdm2/ubiquitin- and/or protease-dependent pathways). Thus, down-regulation of p53 by S100B and hdm2 ultimately facilitates cell growth.

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	41	  For S100B, the affinity of p53 for its promoter regions are relatively low (Figs. 4, 5, 6), which suggests that regulation of S100B by p53 would occur only after higher affinity promoter sites are occupied (i.e. for GADD45). This idea is further supported by p53 transcription activation assays performed with shorter constructs of the S100B promoter (Figs. 5 and 6), which indicates that additional negative regulatory elements exist in the full-length promoter that reduce p53-dependent transcription activation of the S100B gene. Specifically, at the levels of the p53 protein necessary to activate the transcription of S100B, numerous other genes (i.e. GADD45, p21, etc.) will have already been transcribed. This, of course, is a scenario that one might expect for the regulation of a gene such as S100B, which is involved in a feedback loop that ultimately leads to lowering the levels of functional p53..

However, more work needs to be done before general conclusions can be made about the functional significance of regulatory pathways involving p53 and other S100 family members..

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	45	The lowering of p53 protein levels inside cells by S100B that was observed here (Fig. 2) and previously (23) is most likely related to the ability of S100B to bind directly to p53 (Fig. 3), dissociate the p53 tetramer (29), and/or cause conformational changes in the extreme C terminus and tetramerization domains of the tumor suppressor (30). Such effects by S100B may work synergistically with the hdm2 protein/pathways, which are involved in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 (37), although this concept needs to be rigorously established. Nonetheless, an important distinction between these two negative regulatory proteins (hdm2 versus S100B) is that the S100B interaction with the C terminus of p53 is Ca2+-dependent (21) and links p53 biology to calcium-mediated signaling pathways and extracellular growth responses, whereas, hdm2 binds the N terminus of p53 in a calcium-independent manner and is regulated by other proteins (i.e. p14ARF)/signaling pathways and the phosphorylation state of p53 (33, 37, 38) (Fig. 7)..

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	47	It is important to understand how cancer cells, such as those in malignant melanoma, can proliferate even though they have wild-type p53. One possible explanation for this paradigm is that elevated levels of the proteins that negatively regulate p53, such as S100B, may be a culprit. Specifically, the overall effect of elevated S100B levels on wild-type p53 could mimic cellular aberrations such as gene amplification and mutations that are encountered with non-functional mutants of p53. Specifically, several melanomas have wild-type p53 and higher than normal levels of S100B, and the prognosis for patients such as these is generally poorer than for those with lower S100B levels (39 to 41). For primary skin cancer cells, we show that there is a direct interaction between p53 and S100B and that functional wild-type p53 levels can be restored when S100B levels are lowered by siRNA (Fig. 2). This result directly implicates S100B in the down-regulation of wild-type p53 and is consistent with the large decreases in p53 protein levels observed previously in transient co-transfections of p53 and S100B (23). With these results in mind, perhaps a small molecule inhibitor that binds S100B, blocks the S100B-p53 interaction, and restores wild-type p53 levels (i.e. an siRNAS100B mimic) could be useful in therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancers with elevated S100B, such as some forms of malignant melanoma and glioma..

What determines the choice between them is poorly understood. In a rat embryo fibroblast model, caspase inhibition changed the outcome of p53 activation from standard Bcl-2-regulated apoptosis to caspase-independent and Bcl-2-insensitive cell death, a phenomenon not described previously. Here, we show that caspase inhibition affects cell death commitment decisions by modulating the apoptotic functions of p53. Indeed, in the Bcl-2-sensitive pathway, transactivation-dependent signalling is activated leading to a rapid MDM2-mediated degradation of p53. In contrast, in the Bcl-2-insensitive pathway, p53 is stable and this is associated with transrepression-dependent signalling. A study with microarrays identified these genes regulated by p53 in the absence of active caspases..

One of the most important links between the proliferation and cell death machineries is the tumour suppressor protein p53. This protein promotes cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage or strong oncogenic stimuli for proliferation (1). p53 is a phosphoprotein that is pivotal in suppressing cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. In about half of the human cancers, p53 is inactivated directly as a result of mutations in the p53 gene. In many others, it is inactivated indirectly through binding to viral proteins, or as a result of alterations in genes whose products interact with p53 or transmit information to or from p53..

The sequence-specific trancriptional induction of the mdm2 gene results in a product, MDM2, which binds to p53 and stimulates the addition of ubiquitin groups to the C-terminus of p53. The ubiquitinated p53 is detected and degraded by the proteasome (2). In normal cells, p53 gene expression is low. In stress conditions or following DNA damage, post-translational changes in p53 or MDM2 can disrupt the balance and allow p53 activation. p53 can be modified by phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation or addition of ribose, and these events can regulate p53 function (1)..

Indeed, p53 represses the transcription of a number of genes, including those involved in regulatory cascades mediating cell proliferation (cyclin B and RNA polymerase I) and apoptosis (bcl-2). Furthermore, p53-mediated repression of genes involved in cytoskeleton organization (stathmin and map4), leading to a decrease in microtubule polymerization, participates in both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (13). In contrast to the information available concerning p53 as an activator, the mechanism by which repression occurs is less well documented (14,15). This is due in a large part to there being no identified consensus p53-binding site within repressed promoters (16,17). The genes up- and down-regulated by p53 are not the same; induced genes being principally pro-apoptotic and repressed genes being anti-apoptotic or important for cell survival. It has been shown that p53 can lead to transcription-independent caspase activation (18), probably through a direct effect on the release of apoptogenic molecules from mitochondria (19). However, the physiological relevance of this apparently redundant pro-apoptotic property and the determinism of choice between them are unknown..

Moreover, whereas bcl-2 overexpression inhibits apoptosis, caspase inhibition surprisingly both accelerates apoptosis and abolishes the protective effect of Bcl-2 (22). Z-Val-Ala-DL-Asp-Fluromethylketone (ZVAD)-mediated caspase inhibition changed the outcome of p53 activation from Bcl-2-regulated apoptosis to mitochondria- and caspase-independent cell death, a phenomenon that had not been described previously (23)..

Moreover, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) controlled by Bcl-2 family proteins resides at the heart of several alternative death pathways whatever be their apoptotic or necrotic feature. Therefore, the p53-induced cell death program in the presence of ZVAD appears to differ from most caspase-independent alternative pathways: on the one hand by its apoptosis-like nature and on the other hand by being MOMP-independent and insensitive to Bcl-2 protection..

The wild-type LT immortalizes these cells via the inhibitory binding of the p53 tumour suppressor. However, the tsA58 mutant of LT cannot interact with p53 at restrictive temperature.

We first assayed p53 by western blotting at permissive temperature (33 degrees C) and at various time periods after a temperature shift to 39.5 degrees C (Figure 1). The p53 detected at permissive temperature was in the inactive state, bound to SV40 LT antigen. After the temperature shift in the absence of ZVAD, there was a rapid, time-dependent decrease in p53 levels. This is consistent with reports that p53 induces expression of the mdm2 gene, the product of which induces degradation of p53 by the proteasome. Conversely, no decrease in p53 abundance was observed in the presence of ZVAD. RT to PCR analysis showed that ZVAD treatment did not affect the amount of p53 transcript (data not shown), so the regulation of the p53 abundance by ZVAD seems to result from a post-transcriptional mechanism. We then examined the effect of ZVAD on the LT antigen (Figure 1): LT gave several bands in western blots due to the diverse modifications of the LT gene following its introduction into mouse or rat cell lines (35). We found that ZVAD did not significantly influence the amount of LT (Figure 1), indicating that p53 stabilization was not due to changes in LT levels..

Therefore, we investigated whether the accelerated apoptosis induced by ZVAD involves the transcriptional repression activity of p53. We tested the transcription of the map4 and stathmin genes in REtsAF-Bcl-2 cells by northern blotting. The products of these genes regulate microtubule polymerization, and their transcription is negatively regulated by p53 (13,36). The map4 mRNA is subject to alternative splicing but the messenger studied was the full-length form (6.7 kb). We found that p53 activation at 39.5 degrees C correlated with a transient decrease in both map4 and stathmin mRNA levels and that the decrease was greater in the presence of ZVAD (Figure 3). This suggests that ZVAD-induced apoptosis results from an increased transrepression activity of p53. Also, regulation of the amount of p53, involving one or more caspase(s), may affect which p53 functions are involved: increased amounts of p53 are associated with greater transrepression versus transactivation activity..

Some of these genes have not been identified because not all the probes have been sequenced. Interestingly, the few genes which were represented by more than one spot on the chip gave reproducible results. For example, the procollagen type III alpha 1 gene appeared five times with the same negative regulation. These various procollagen probes allowed to estimate the experimental variation: it was 0.007 in the absence of ZVAD and 0.004 in the presence of ZVAD. This indicates the reproducibility of the results..

The molecular events that lead to p53-dependent apoptosis are less clear. Transactivation of target genes may be involved but there is growing evidence that transrepression and transcription-independent functions are central to p53-dependent apoptosis (15,40).

In the absence of caspase activity, p53 can induce a Bcl-2-insensitive cell death program (22,23).

The microarray analysis indicated that 86% (clusters 1 and 2) of the 94 genes modulated by ZVAD were more repressed or less activated in the presence of the drug; in other words, these genes are less expressed when caspases were inactive. Thus, the inhibition of caspases modifies the contribution of the different transcription activities of p53 to apoptosis the onset of the Bcl-2-insentive process is associated with both a decrease in transactivation and an increase in transrepression.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	91	Various different mechanisms have been described to account for p53-mediated repression. Inhibition of the NF-Y transcription factor (47,48) or up-regulation of p21 which leads to hypophosphorylation of Rb and transcriptional repression via E2F1 binding (49), has been implicated. However, there is evidence that p53 can promote sequence-specific repression by binding proteins, like HDAC, that possess deacetylase and chromatin condensation properties. According to this model, our data suggest that the composition of transcriptional machinery complexes recruited by p53 on promoters might be modulated by a ZVAD-sensitive protease. Indeed, p53 can activate transcription through interaction with coactivators, e.g. p300 and CBP. Both of these proteins have histone acetylase (HAT) activity, which is critical for the transactivation function of p53. Conversely, to repress transcription p53 recruits histone deacetylases through a physical association with mSin3a. The time course of p53 association with mSin3a and p300 might differ according to the presence or absence of ZVAD. Interestingly, the C-terminal mSin3a-interaction domain and tetramerization domain of p53 overlap (43). Therefore, this interaction could contribute to the decrease in p53 transactivation in favour of increased transrepression. How ZVAD promotes the formation of this complex on promoters of p53-repressed genes remains unclear..

These genes are thus specifically implicated in the alternative pathway. They include genes encoding regulators of transcription, e.g. the high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 1 and the transcription factor E2a. Interestingly, high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 1 gene (hmgn1), encodes an activator of transcription which binds to the minor groove of DNA, promoting transcription by inducing a conformational change of the chromatin (50). The hmg 17 gene, another member of the high-mobility group family, is a known primary target of p53 (51). Possibly hmgn1 is also a direct target of p53. The down-regulation of this type of transcription factor could trigger a process of amplification contributing to the overall transactivation decrease observed in the presence of ZVAD. Indeed, most of the genes identified in our analysis have not been reported to be p53 targets and our approach does not discriminate between genes directly repressed by p53 in a sequence-specific manner and genes repressed indirectly by a cascade of regulations. Another type of gene identified in our study was regulators of cell cycle (including growth arrest specific 6, polymerase beta and cell division cycle 2 homolog A). This is consistent with the established ability of p53 to arrest the cell cycle through transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, the commitment of REtsAF-Bcl-2 cells to apoptosis is associated with an inability to respond appropriately to p53-induced negative regulators of the cell cycle (52)..

Numerous studies show that the heterogeneous responses of gene transcription to p53 activation by diverse agents could be due to p53 protein levels differing according to the nature of the stress signal (37). In our model, target genes can be transactivated by p53 in a transient manner, the transient nature being determined by MDM2-mediated degradation of p53. In contrast, it could be argued that transcriptional repression is effective only if repression complexes are present on the promoters of repressed genes for prolonged periods (43,53). By protecting p53 from degradation, caspase inhibition may therefore enhance the effectiveness of p53 as a transrepressor. Note that two components of the proteasome were repressed in the presence of ZVAD (cluster 2 of DNA chip analysis), and this may contribute to the decrease in p53 and MDM2 proteasomal degradation in this condition..

As MDM2 also accumulates in the presence of ZVAD, probably as the result of inhibition of its proteasome-mediated degradation, it is possible that ZVAD blocks the caspase-mediated inactivation of a component which regulates, via MDM2, the stability and the apoptotic function of p53.

0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	3	The ability of p53 to induce apoptosis requires its sequence-specific DNA binding activity; however, the transactivation-deficient p53(Gln22-Ser23) can still induce apoptosis. Previously, we have shown that the region between residues 23 and 97 in p53 is necessary for such activity. In an effort to more precisely map a domain necessary for apoptosis within the N terminus, we found that deletion of the N-terminal 23 amino acids compromises, but does not abolish, p53 induction of apoptosis. Surprisingly, p53(1-42), which lacks the N-terminal 42 amino acids and the previously defined activation domain, retains the ability to induce apoptosis to an even higher level than wild-type p53. A more extensive deletion, which eliminates the N-terminal 63 amino acids, renders p53 completely inert in mediating apoptosis. In addition, we found that both p53(1-42) and p53(Gln22-Ser23) can activate a subset of cellular p53 targets. Furthermore, we showed that residues 53 and 54 are critical for the apoptotic and transcriptional activities of both p53(1-42) and p53(Gln22-Ser23). Taken together, these data suggest that within residues 43-63 lie an apoptotic domain as well as another transcriptional activation domain. We therefore postulate that the apoptotic activity in p53(Gln22-Ser23) and p53(1-42) is still transcription-dependent..

Several different biological responses that could play a role in maintaining genome stability have been strongly correlated with wild-type p53 function (1, 3). Following stress conditions such as in the presence of damaged DNA or insufficient growth and survival factors, the cellular levels of p53 increase. This leads to one of at least three well understood cellular responses as follows: cell cycle arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis. Several factors have been shown to determine how a cell responds to the accumulation of p53, e.g. cell type and the presence of several cellular and viral proteins (4-8). In addition, the levels of p53 in a given cell can dictate the response of the cell such that lower levels of p53 result in cell cycle arrest (9) or differentiation (10), whereas higher levels result in apoptosis (9, 10)..

0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	8	The functional domains of p53 have been subjected to extensive analysis (1, 3, 4). A transcriptional activation domain has been shown to lie within N-terminal residues 1-42 (11, 12). Within this region there are a number of acidic and hydrophobic residues, characteristics of the acidic activator family of transcriptional factors (13). Indeed, a double point mutation of the two hydrophobic amino acids at residues 22 and 23 renders p53 transcriptionally inactive (14). These two residues presumably are required for the interaction of the activation domain with the TATA box binding protein and/or TATA box binding protein-associated factors (15-18)..

However, it is not certain what function(s) of p53 is required for apoptosis. The transactivation function of p53 was shown to be required in some experimental protocols (22-24). There are several candidate genes that play roles in apoptosis that can be activated in response to p53 induction, such as BAX (25), IGFBP3 (26), PAG608 (27), KILLER/DR5 (28), and several redox-related PIGs genes (29). Several other studies, including our own observations, have provided evidence that p53 might have a transcription-independent function in apoptosis (9, 30-32). Recently, the proline-rich region between residues 60 and 90, which comprises five "PXXP" motifs (where P represents proline and X any amino acid), was found to be necessary for efficient growth suppression (33) and apoptosis (34) and to serve as a docking site for transactivation-independent growth arrest induced by GAS1 (35)..

To more precisely map such a domain in the N terminus necessary for apoptosis, we have made several new mutants. Analyses of these mutants lead to identification of a novel domain between residues 43 and 63 that can mediate apoptosis and activate cellular p53 targets. We also found that a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 completely abolishes both the transcriptional and apoptotic activities mediated by this novel domain. Thus, we hypothesize that a transcriptional activity located in this novel domain regulates a subset of cellular p53 targets that are responsible for apoptosis..

0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	32	We have previously established a cell line that expresses high levels of wild-type p53 called p53-3 (9). This line was established using a tetracycline-regulated expression system as described previously (42). By using similar techniques, we established nine stable cell lines that express p53(1-23). Three representative cell lines, p53(1-23)-9, -10, and -23, are shown in Fig. 1A. Western blot analysis showed that these cell lines express p53(1-23) at levels comparable to wild-type p53 in p53-3 cells (Fig. 1A). To characterize p53(1-23), we looked at its transcriptional and apoptotic activities and the growth rate of the cell line p53(1-23)-9. The transcriptional activity was determined by monitoring the expression of the endogenous gene, p21, a well defined transcriptional target of p53 (19). We found that p53(1-23) is still capable of activating p21, albeit to a much less degree than wild-type p53 (Fig. 1A). Next, the growth rates of p53(1-23)-9 cells under both uninduced and induced conditions were determined, and these cells failed to multiply following p53 expression (Fig. 1B). To exclude potential effects of the regulator tetracycline and/or the tet-vp16 transactivator (42) on cell growth, we analyzed the growth rate of the cell line H24-1, which was similarly established but did not express any protein. The results showed that the growth rates of H24-1 cells under both the uninduced (+tet) and induced (tet) conditions were nearly identical (Fig. 1C), indicating that both tetracycline and tet-vp16 transactivator have no effect on cell growth. It is well established that the percentage of cells containing a sub-G1 DNA content reflects the extent to which cells are undergoing apoptosis (9, 23, 31). Since p53 can induce apoptosis in H1299 cells (9, 31), FACS analysis was used to observe the extent of apoptosis by determining the distribution of cells in each phase of the cell cycle. The results showed that 18% of cells expressing p53(1-23) had a sub-G1 DNA content 3 days after induction of this mutant, compared with less than 5% of the same cells expressing no p53 (Fig. 1, D and E; Table I). Trypan blue exclusion assay showed that 15% of cells were dead, which is consistent with FACS analysis. In contrast, about 45 and 30% of cells had a sub-G1 DNA content at day 3 following expression of either wild-type p53 or transactivation-deficient p53(Gln22-Ser23), respectively (Table I). The FACS results also showed that the number of cells in S phase was decreased from 38 to 22.3% following induction of p53(1-23), and these cells primarily arrested in G1 (Fig. 1, D and E). Similar results were obtained using another high p53(1-23) producer, p53(1-23)-10..

In contrast, about 45 and 30% of cells had a sub-G1 DNA content at day 3 following expression of either wild-type p53 or transactivation-deficient p53(Gln22-Ser23), respectively (Table I). The FACS results also showed that the number of cells in S phase was decreased from 38 to 22.3% following induction of p53(1-23), and these cells primarily arrested in G1 (Fig. 1, D and E). Similar results were obtained using another high p53(1-23) producer, p53(1-23)-10..

To this end, we established 16 individual stable cell lines that inducibly express p53(1-42) that lacks the N-terminal 42 amino acids. Three representative cell lines, p53(1-42)-2, -5, and -11, were shown in Fig. 2A. Consistent with previous results that p53(Gln22-Ser23) cannot activate p21 (9, 22, 33, 43), p53(1-42) only minimally activated p21 as compared with wild-type p53 (Fig. 2A). We then determined the growth rate of a high producer, p53(1-42)-2. Surprisingly, we found that a majority of cells died within 3 days following induction of p53(1-42) (Fig. 2B). In addition, both trypan blue exclusion assay and FACS analysis showed that approximately 50-68% of cells underwent apoptosis (Fig. 2C; Table I). Similar results were obtained from several other cell lines.

Since p53(1-42) lacks the previously defined activation domain and only minimally activates p21 as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A), it appears that it can induce apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner. To ascertain whether p53(1-42) contains a transcriptional activity, the expression patterns of four well defined cellular p53 targets, p21, MDM2, GADD45, and BAX, were analyzed in cells expressing p53(1-42) by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4A). The expression levels of these genes in cells with or without p53 were quantitated by PhosphorImage scanner, and the fold increase of their relative mRNAs was calculated after normalization to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels (Table II). The results showed clearly that p53(1-42) significantly activated MDM2 (8-fold), GADD45 (7.03-fold), and BAX (3.9-fold) but only minimally activated p21 (1.83-fold). As expected, wild-type p53 but not mutant p53(Gln22-Ser23) activated these cellular p53 targets (Fig. 4A; Table II). As a control, p53(64-91), which lacks all of the five PXXP motifs, was examined. The proline-rich domain in p53 is dispensable for transactivation (33, 34). As expected, p53(64-91) activated these p53 targets (Fig. 4A and Table II). Since p53(1-63) failed to activate any of these p53-regulated genes (data not shown), the results suggest that another activation domain lies within residues 43-63.

We therefore made identical mutations in these two amino acids in p53(Gln22-Ser23) or p53(1-42), changing tryptophan 53 to glutamine and phenylalanine 54 to serine to generate p53(Gln22-Ser23/Gln53-Ser54) and p53(1-42/Gln53-Ser54). We then established a number of cell lines that inducibly express these mutants, and their ability to induce apoptosis and activate cellular p53 targets were similarly analyzed as above. Three representative cell lines that express either p53(Gln22-Ser23/Gln53-Ser54) or p53(1-42/Gln53-Ser54) are shown in Fig. 5, A and C, respectively.

0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	53	Here we found that within residues 43-63 lies another novel domain that is necessary for apoptosis on the basis of the following observations: (i) p53(1-42), which lacks the N-terminal 42 amino acids and the previously defined activation domain, contains a strong apoptotic activity; (ii) p53(1-63), which lacks the N-terminal 63 amino acids but contains intact PXXP motifs, has no apoptotic activity; (iii) a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 renders both p53(1-42/Gln53-Ser54) and p53(Gln22-Ser23/Gln53-Ser54) completely inert in inducing apoptosis; and (iv) codon 53 is one of the frequently mutated sites outside the DNA binding domain in the p53 gene in human tumors (45), which underscores the importance of the apoptotic function within residues 43-63 in p53 tumor suppression..
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	54	How does this novel domain mediate an apoptotic activity? Previously, it was shown that p53(Gln22-Ser23), which cannot activate several cellular p53 targets (9, 14, 22, 31, 43), is still capable of inducing apoptosis (9, 31, 34), and a p53 mutant, which lacks the proline-rich region, is capable of activating several p53 targets (33, 34) but cannot induce apoptosis (33, 34). These results lead to a hypothesis that p53 has both transcription-dependent and -independent functions in apoptosis. However, it is well established that p53 mutants that are defective in sequence-specific DNA binding activity are also inert in inducing apoptosis (1, 3, 4), suggesting that p53 sequence-specific DNA binding activity and possibly its sequence-specific transcriptional activity are required for inducing apoptosis. Here we found that p53(1-42), which lacks the entire previously defined activation domain I, not only induces apoptosis, but also activates the MDM2, BAX, and GADD45 genes through its activation domain II located between residues 43 and 63 (Fig. 4; Table II). Since p53(Gln22-Ser23) contains an intact activation domain II, we hypothesized that it might still contain transcriptional activity. Indeed, we found that p53(Gln22-Ser23) can activate one of the putative p53 targets, MCG14. Furthermore, a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 completely abolishes the ability of both p53(Gln22-Ser23/Gln53-Ser54) and p53(1-42/Gln53-Ser54) to activate MCG14 and induce apoptosis. Consistent with our results, Candau et al. (46) recently showed that within residues 40-83 lies a sub-activation domain, which can activate a reporter gene under control of a promoter with a p53-responsive element when p53 is cotransfected, and a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 also abolished the transcriptional activity of the sub-activation domain. These results suggest that p53 has two independent activation domains. A second activation domain within a transcription factor is not without precedent. Herpes simplex virus protein VP16 also contains two independent activation domains (47). Thus, it appears that in response to various stress conditions and their subsequent modifications, the two independent activation domains might serve as an intrinsic factor of p53 that determines whether a given p53 target is activated. Although BAX, MDM2, and GADD45 are the activation domain II-regulated gene products, these cellular p53 targets might not mediate the p53-dependent apoptosis on the basis of two observations: (i) these genes were not activated by p53(Gln22-Ser23) which is competent in inducing apoptosis (Fig. 4A; Table II); (ii) these genes were activated by p53(62-91) which is defective in inducing apoptosis (Fig. 4A; Table II). Since cell type has been shown to influence the cellular response (cell cycle arrest or apoptosis) to p53 (1, 4, 8), cellular genetic background might then determine the modification of the two activation domains. Therefore, the results obtained in H1299 cells need to be confirmed in other cell types..

Since both p53(1-23) and p53(1-42) can activate these p53 targets, it suggests that the presence of the first 23 amino acids may mask the ability of the activation domain II in p53(Gln22-Ser23) to activate these cellular p53 targets. Alternatively, it is also possible that when the activation domain I is inactivated by a double point mutation at residues 22 and 23, the N-terminal 42 residues might then inhibit or block interaction of a co-activator (or an adaptor) with the activation domain II that is required for activation of some p53 targets, such as MDM2, p21, BAX, and GADD45, but not for activation of other p53 targets, such as MCG14. It is important to note that although the activation domain I is primarily responsible for activation of p21, the level of p21 in cells expressing either p53(1-23) and p53(1-42) was slightly increased upon p53 induction (Figs. 1A and 2A), suggesting that the activation domain II can weakly activate p21. Furthermore, our preliminary studies showed that activation of p21 was compromised by a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 when p53(Gln53-Ser54) was expressed at a low to intermediate level,3 consistent with the idea that the activation domain II contributes to the activation of p21. Since several clones that express various expression levels of the target genes are required for determining the function of the targets (48), these results remain to be confirmed..

Lack of p21 expression due to homologous deletion of the p21 gene also renders HCT116 colorectal cancer cells susceptible to apoptosis following treatment with either -radiation or chemotherapeutic agents (50). In addition, a significant fraction of tumors in mice deriving from p21/ HCT116 cancer cells were completely cured, and all tumors deriving from p21+/+ cancer cells underwent regrowth after treatment with -radiation (50). It is interesting to note that p53(Gln22-Ser23) and p53(1-42), both of which lack a functional activation domain I, cannot significantly activate p21 (Fig. 2 and 4; Table II) but can induce apoptosis (Table I). The strong apoptotic activity conferred by p53(1-42) might be due to its failure of activating p21. Thus, we have generated a mutant, p53(1-42), that might be better than wild-type p53 in the elimination of cancer cells and therefore a potential candidate for gene therapy..

H2O2 is rapidly degraded by catalase, which protects cells against oxidant injury. To study the effect of catalase on apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents, HepG2 cells were infected with adenovirus containing the cDNA of catalase (Ad-Cat). Forty-eight hours after infection, catalase protein and activity was increased 7-10-fold compared with control cells infected with Ad-LacZ. After treatment with Vp16 or mitomycin C, control cells underwent apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner; however, overexpression of catalase inhibited this apoptosis. Basal levels as well as Vp16- or mitomycin C-stimulated levels of p53 and p21 protein were decreased in the catalase-overexpressing cells as compared with control cells; however, p53 mRNA levels were not decreased by catalase. There was no difference in p53 protein synthesis between catalase-overexpressing cells and control cells. However, pulse-chase experiments indicated that p53 protein degradation was enhanced in the catalase-overexpressing cells. Proteasome inhibitors but not calpeptin prevented the catalase-mediated decrease of p53 content. Whereas Vp16 increased, catalase overexpression decreased the phosphorylation of p53. The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid did not prevent the catalase-mediated down-regulation of p53 or phosphorylated p53. These results demonstrate that catalase protects HepG2 cells from apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents in association with decreasing p53 phosphorylation; the latter may lead to an acceleration in the degradation of p53 protein by the proteasome complex. This suggests that the level of catalase may play a critical role in cell-induced resistance to the effects of anti-cancer drugs which up-regulate p53.

0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	6	Many chemotherapeutic drugs, including Vp16 and mitomycin C, induce cells to undergo apoptosis through damage of nuclear DNA. The activation of wild type p53, a major tumor suppressor protein, which is implicated in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and apoptosis (1-3), has been reported to be involved in the process of apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents (3, 4). The increase in p53 levels after DNA damage results in large part from stabilization of the p53 protein against degradation, and accumulation of p53 occurs because of this increased protein stability in the presence of ongoing translation (4). Acute overexpression of wild type p53 mediated by adenovirus facilitates the ability of DNA-damaging drugs to induce death of cancer and normal cells (5). As a transcription factor, p53 protein enhances the transcription rate of several genes including p21WAF1, GADD45, and 14-3-3, which are genes involved in cell cycle arrest (6-8), and Bax, CD95, Noxa, PUMA, and p53AIP1, which are related to p53-dependent apoptosis (9-13)..

Other studies indicate that ROS are downstream mediators of p53-dependent apoptosis (15, 16). p53 acts to regulate the intracellular redox state and induces apoptosis by a pathway that is dependent on ROS production (17). p53 results in apoptosis through a multi-step process, including the transcriptional induction of redox-related genes, the generation of ROS, and the oxidative degradation of mitochondrial components, leading to apoptosis (15). There is also evidence that ROS could regulate apoptosis as a signal transmitter or mediator (16, 18, 19). However, other studies indicate that apoptosis can be induced in the absence of any detectable oxidative stress when cells are treated with VP-16 and cisplatin (20), and oxidative stress can inhibit apoptosis in human lymphoma cells (21)..

This basal level of p53 was even lower in cells infected with Ad-Cat than in cells infected with Ad-LacZ (Fig. 4, panel a). After treatment with Vp16 or mitomycin C, the p53 protein level was dramatically increased in cells infected with Ad-LacZ but only slightly increased in the cells infected with Ad-Cat. Because p21 is one of the downstream genes of p53, which is induced by activation of p53, p21 protein level was also detected by Western blot. Coincident with p53, the p21 protein level was dramatically increased in cells infected with Ad-LacZ after treatment with Vp16 or mitomycin C (Fig. 4, panel b). Infection with catalase adenovirus lowered the basal as well as the stimulated levels of p21, analogous to results with p53 levels. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are two anti-apoptotic genes.

HepG2-mtp53 and HepG2-neo cell lines were set up by stable transfection of HepG2 cells with the expression plasmid vector containing mutant p53 or empty vector. This mutant p53 expression vector encodes a mutant p53 protein, which combines with wild type p53 protein in a dominant-negative manner and blocks the DNA binding domain on wild type p53, therefore inhibiting the activity of wild type p53. After treatment with different concentrations (50, 250, and 500  microM) of Vp16 for 24 h, HepG2 cells transfected with the empty vector (HepG2-neo) underwent DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5). However, no or very weak DNA fragmentation was observed in HepG2 cells transfected with the mutant p53 expression vector (HepG2-mtp53), even at the maximum concentration of Vp16 (500  microM) studied (Fig. 5). These results indicate that p53 is necessary for the Vp16-induced apoptosis in the HepG2 cells and suggest that one mechanism by which catalase protects against this apoptosis is to lower the intracellular levels of p53..

0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	55	The Potentiated p53 Protein Degradation Caused by Catalase Overexpression Is Prevented by Proteasome Inhibitors-- The proteasome complex plays an important role in the turnover of p53; therefore, the effect of proteasome inhibitors such as 5  microM lactacystin or 10  microM MG115 as well as the calpain inhibitor calpeptin on p53 protein levels in cells infected with Ad-LacZ or Ad-Cat was determined (Fig. 8). The administration of lactacystin or MG115 increased the p53 protein level 3-4-fold in Ad-LacZ-infected cells not treated with Vp16. This likely reflects the prevention of p53 degradation. The elevated level of p53 in the Vp16-treated cells was not further increased by lactacystin or MG115, which may reflect that both treatments result in decreasing p53 turnover (further described below, Fig. 9). Calpeptin did not affect the basal level of p53 or the Vp16-stimulated levels in the Ad-LacZ-infected cells (Fig. 8). In the Vp16-treated cells, catalase lowered p53 levels by 50-60% in the control or calpeptin-treated cells but only 20-25% in the lactacystin- or MG115-treated cells. Thus, the lowering of p53 levels by catalase was partially prevented or diminished by administration of proteasome inhibitors but not by calpeptin. Because of toxicity, higher concentrations of lactacystin or MG115 could not be evaluated; however, these results are consistent with role for the proteasome in p53 turnover and in the catalase enhancement of this turnover..

Once phosphorylated, p53 is imported into the nucleus and can now activate downstream genes such as p21 and Bax, acting as a transcription factor. In addition, phosphorylated p53 has a longer half-life than unphosphorylated p53, therefore leading to p53 accumulation. This phosphorylation can occur on several serine residues including serine 9, 15, 20, and 392 of the p53 protein. One possible mechanism by which catalase increases turnover of p53 could be by decreasing formation of the more stable phosphorylated p53. Using anti-p53 antibody and a specific antibody for recognition of phosphorylation of p53 on serine 20, the pp53 level was compared with the total p53 level in cells treated with Vp16 or lactacystin. Both Vp16 and lactacystin increase the p53 level; however, only Vp16 increased the pp53 level (Fig. 9A). This suggests that although lactacystin and Vp16 each increase the p53 level by decreasing the degradation of p53, they do so by different mechanisms. Lactacystin inhibits the degradation of p53, whereas Vp16 results in formation of the more stable pp53.

This suggests that ROS, especially H2O2, might be involved in the process of apoptosis induced by these DNA-damaging drugs. Studies in a variety of cell types suggest that cancer chemotherapeutic drugs induce tumor cell apoptosis in part by increasing formation of ROS (14). However, other studies indicate that apoptosis can be induced in the absence of any detectable oxidative stress when tumor cells were treated with VP-16 and cisplatin (20). ROS may not necessarily be the direct factor to cause apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging reagents, but intracellular ROS may modulate apoptotic gene expression, which subsequently regulates apoptosis. Thus, although catalase was protective against Vp16 or mitomycin C-induced apoptosis, it is not clear if H2O2 is directly responsible for inducing toxicity or H2O2 is upstream of signaling events that alter the pro- and anti-apoptotic balance in the HepG2 cells..

The overexpression of wild type p53 constructs in tumor cells was able to inhibit cell growth or to initiate apoptosis. p53 gene status modulates the chemosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells. DNA damage induced by the DNA-damaging agents Vp16 or mitomycin C activates p53 mainly through protein modification events such as phosphorylation, which results in p53 protein stabilization and accumulation of p53 protein due to the decrease of its degradation (4) (Fig. 9, A and B). HepG2 cells transfected with a mutant p53 expression vector (HepG2-mtp53), which encodes a mutant p53 protein, decreasing wild type p53 function, are more resistant to Vp16-induced apoptosis than HepG2 cells transfected with empty vector (HepG2-neo) (Fig. 5). This indicates that apoptosis induced by Vp16 in HepG2 cells is p53-dependent. HepG2 cells overexpressing catalase as mediated by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer (Ad-Cat) show a lower level of basal or induced p53 protein than control (Ad-LacZ) cells. Lowering of p53 levels is likely to be the mechanism whereby catalase overexpression protects HepG2 cells from apoptosis induced by the DNA-damaging agents, whereas the latter induce apoptosis by elevating p53 levels. There are no differences in p53 mRNA levels between catalase-overexpressing cells and control cells with or without treatment by DNA-damaging agents, and the p53 mRNA level did not change after treatment with Vp16 even though p53 protein levels were strongly increased. Thus, the decrease in p53 protein levels by catalase overexpression or the increase in p53 levels by treatment with Vp16 is due to posttranscriptional effects. P21 is a downstream gene target of p53 and is regulated by p53 (27). HepG2 cells overexpressing catalase also display a lower level of p21 protein than control cells either in the absence or presence of treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Lower levels of p21 protein in the presence of catalase may reflect the lower levels of p53 protein in the presence of catalase. The results of synthesis experiments indicate that overexpression of catalase does not change the rate of p53 protein synthesis; however, pulse-chase experiments did reveal that p53 protein degradation was increased in cells infected with Ad-Cat compared with cells infected with Ad-LacZ..

This indicates that apoptosis induced by Vp16 in HepG2 cells is p53-dependent. HepG2 cells overexpressing catalase as mediated by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer (Ad-Cat) show a lower level of basal or induced p53 protein than control (Ad-LacZ) cells. Lowering of p53 levels is likely to be the mechanism whereby catalase overexpression protects HepG2 cells from apoptosis induced by the DNA-damaging agents, whereas the latter induce apoptosis by elevating p53 levels. There are no differences in p53 mRNA levels between catalase-overexpressing cells and control cells with or without treatment by DNA-damaging agents, and the p53 mRNA level did not change after treatment with Vp16 even though p53 protein levels were strongly increased. Thus, the decrease in p53 protein levels by catalase overexpression or the increase in p53 levels by treatment with Vp16 is due to posttranscriptional effects. P21 is a downstream gene target of p53 and is regulated by p53 (27). HepG2 cells overexpressing catalase also display a lower level of p21 protein than control cells either in the absence or presence of treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Lower levels of p21 protein in the presence of catalase may reflect the lower levels of p53 protein in the presence of catalase. The results of synthesis experiments indicate that overexpression of catalase does not change the rate of p53 protein synthesis; however, pulse-chase experiments did reveal that p53 protein degradation was increased in cells infected with Ad-Cat compared with cells infected with Ad-LacZ..

(17) find that cells sensitive to p53-mediated apoptosis produced ROS concomitantly with p53 overexpression, whereas cells resistant to p53 failed to produce ROS. In sensitive cells, both ROS production and apoptosis were inhibited by antioxidant treatment. These results suggest that p53 acts to regulate the intracellular redox state and induces apoptosis by a pathway that is dependent on ROS production (17). In our experiments, removing H2O2 by expression of catalase causes the p53 protein level to decrease, and this is associated with resistance to apoptosis induced by Vp16 or mitomycin C. This suggests that, at least in HepG2 cells, H2O2 regulates apoptosis by modulating p53 levels, and H2O2 acts upstream of p53..

In response to genotoxic stress or oncogenic signaling, p53 levels rapidly increase, mainly through protein stabilization. An important regulator of the p53 level is MDM2, which possesses intrinsic E3 ligase activity and, thus, promotes p53 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via proteasome-mediated proteolysis (29). Overexpression of catalase did increase p53 protein degradation, and the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and MG115 but not the calpain inhibitor calpeptin could partially block the p53 protein lowering caused by overexpression of catalase. This is consistent with the overall mechanism that catalase lowers p53 levels by accelerating p53 degradation..

0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	71	How overexpression of catalase specifically down-regulates p53 protein or enhances p53 turnover is not clear. Because H2O2 is a specific substrate of catalase, catalase down-regulation of p53 protein would appear to involve some function or action of H2O2. One hypothesis is the H2O2 may increase the level of phosphorylated p53 by stimulating certain protein kinases implicated in the phosphorylation of p53 or by inhibiting the activity of protein phosphatases that convert pp53 to the less stable nonphosphorylated state. Once p53 protein is phosphorylated, its half-life is increased, which causes p53 accumulation (30). If ROS indeed modulate the actions of p53 kinases or p53 phosphatases, overexpression of catalase may decrease p53 accumulation by removing ROS such as H2O2. Using a specific antibody for detecting phosphorylated p53 on serine 20, we found that overexpression of catalase did prevent phosphorylation of p53 induced by Vp16, and low levels of pp53 were associated with low levels of total p53. However, the general phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, did not prevent the effect of catalase on down-regulation of p53 or pp53. This suggests that catalase may inhibit activity of p53 kinases, which may be activated by H2O2. Recent studies indicate that ROS such as H2O2-induced phosphorylation of p53 can be mediated in part by polo-like kinase-3 (30). Further studies will be necessary on the effects of ROS and of catalase on the activities of protein kinases implicated in phosphorylation of p53 and on protein phosphatases implicated in the dephosphorylation of pp53. Chromium and vanadate metals that can cause oxidative stress are believed to modulate p53 through H2O2 (31, 32). H2O2 may also cause certain modifications of the p53 protein structure, e.g. thiol oxidation, such that the protein is not an effective substrate for proteolysis. Such putative, stabilizing modifications would be prevented by rapid removal of H2O2 by catalase..

Phosphorylation induced by multiple stress-activated kinases has been proposed to be essential for p53 stabilization, interaction with transcriptional co-activators, and activation of p53 target genes. However, genetic studies suggest that stress-activated phosphorylation may not be essential for p53 activation. We therefore investigated the role of p53 phosphorylation on six key serine residues (Ser6, Ser15, Ser20, Ser37, Ser46, and Ser392) for p53 activation using nutlin-3, a recently developed small molecule MDM2 antagonist. We show here that nutlin does not induce the phosphorylation of p53. Comparison of the activity of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated p53 induced by the genotoxic drugs doxorubicin and etoposide in HCT116 and RKO cells revealed no difference in their sequence-specific DNA binding and ability to transactivate p53 target genes and to induce p53-dependent apoptosis. We conclude that p53 phosphorylation on six major serine sites is not required for activation of p53 target genes or biological responses in vivo..

In response to diverse stress factors, p53 induces the expression of different subsets of genes leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair, or senescence. In cells that are not under stress, p53 activation could suppress their growth or induce apoptosis were it not for the tight regulation elicited by MDM2 (3, 4). The MDM2 gene expression is regulated in part by a p53-responsive promoter. In turn, MDM2 protein binds the p53 N-terminal transactivation domain and negatively regulates tumor suppressor function by compromising transcriptional regulation. Additionally, as MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53 and itself, MDM2 controls p53 half-life via ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This negative feedback control mechanism assures that both p53 and MDM2 proteins are kept at very low levels in proliferating cells (4)..

0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	8	In response to stress, the p53-MDM2 interaction must be disrupted to enable p53 to associate with factors needed for activation of its target genes. Stress-induced p53 activation involves post-translational modification of p53 on multiple sites by phosphorylation, acetylation, and sumoylation (2, 5) and modifications to MDM2 that can enhance MDM2 autoubiquitination and degradation (6). With regard to p53 modifications, phosphorylation has been studied most intensively and has been proposed to play a critical role in the stabilization and activation of the tumor suppressor. These studies have been greatly facilitated by the availability of antibodies that recognize p53 modified on specific phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues (for review, see Ref. 7). Multiple serine (6, 9, 15, 20, 33, 37, 46, 315, 371, 376, 378, and 392) and three threonine residues (18, 55, and 81) have been reported to undergo phosphorylation in response to diverse stresses. Multiple serine/threonine kinases have been implicated in the upstream signaling leading to p53 phosphorylation (ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Chk1, Chk2, CK1, p38, CDK2, PKC, JNK), but the precise mechanism of this signaling and its regulation are not well understood (8, 9). Residues from the N-terminal MDM2 binding domain of p53 (Ser20 and Thr18) have been shown to play a critical role in the interaction between the two proteins and their stress-induced phosphorylation decreases substantially the affinity between p53 and MDM2 when analyzed in vitro using peptide substrates (10 to 12). These and other studies (7, 13) have led to the conclusion that phosphorylation of p53 is a key mechanism responsible for activation of the tumor suppressor in response to cellular stress..

However, this aspect of p53 phosphorylation is still poorly understood and controversial. Transcriptional activity of p53 is of principal importance for its function as a tumor suppressor. It has been suggested that phosphorylation at specific residues can affect the transcriptional activity of p53 and/or its selectivity toward different subset of genes thus determining the specific type of cellular response to stress (5, 8). Activity of p53 as a transcription factor may be influenced by several factors: (a) ability to form active tetramers, (b) sequence-specific DNA binding, and (c) interaction with other components of the transcriptional machinery. It has been reported that Ser315 and Ser392 phosphorylation may regulate the oligomerization of p53 and thus its sequence-specific DNA binding (14 to 16). Ser15 phosphorylation has been shown to enhance the interaction of p53 with transcriptional co-activators CBP and PCAF (10, 17 to 19). Stress-induced phosphorylation of Ser46 has been implicated in the activation of p53-dependent apoptotic response (20, 21). Recently, prolyl isomerase Pin1 has been reported to bind p53 and enhance its DNA binding and transcriptional activity. This binding is dependent on DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of p53 (22, 23). Taken together, these observations suggest that p53 phosphorylation may play an important role not only in stabilization of p53 but also in modulation of its transcriptional activity. On the other hand, experiments in which almost all phosphorylation sites in p53 have been mutated demonstrated that transiently expressed phosphorylated and unphosphorylated p53 do not differ significantly in their stability or ability to transactivate reporter genes in p53-null cells (24). Furthermore, studies using mouse mutants with substitutions of Ser15 or Ser20 suggest that these residues are not essential for p53 activation (25 to 27)..

0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	12	Recently, we reported the identification of the first potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of p53-MDM2 interaction, the nutlins (28). These compounds bind MDM2 in the p53 binding pocket with high selectivity and can release p53 from negative control leading to effective stabilization of p53 and activation of the p53 pathway in vitro and in vivo. Nutlins are non-genotoxic and activate p53 by preventing it from binding to MDM2 (28). They do not bind to p53 protein and do not interfere with its activities. Treatment of cultured cells with MDM2 antagonists cause accumulation of p53 protein that is free of phosphorylation on Ser15 (28). Therefore, nutlins may represent valuable molecular tools for studying the role of p53 phosphorylation in its natural cellular context. Here, we show that p53 induced by the MDM2 antagonist, nutlin-3, is not phosphorylated on six key serine residues. Despite the lack of detectable phosphorylation, nutlin-induced p53 showed equal or better sequence-specific DNA binding, ability to transactivate p53 target genes, and p53-dependent apoptotic activity than phosphorylated p53 induced by the genotoxic drugs doxorubicin and etoposide. Our results provide further support to the notion that separating MDM2 from p53 is an important step in p53 activation, but phosphorylation is not required for execution of p53 biological functions..

We chose the colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and RKO as they possess wild-type p53 and respond to genotoxic stress by p53 stabilization and activation of the p53 pathway (28). To find the optimal treatment condition, we incubated exponentially growing cells with a range of concentrations of etoposide, doxorubicin, and the active enantiomer of nutlin-3 (nutlin-3a) for 24 h. These ranges included the IC50 and IC90 values previously determined by a proliferation/viability assay (28). Western analysis of the cell lysates from both cells lines revealed a dose-dependent accumulation of p53 and its target gene products MDM2 and p21Waf1/CIP1 (Fig. 1). The observed decrease in the MDM2 and p21 level at the high doxorubicin concentrations is most likely due to protein degradation in cells undergoing apoptosis.

The relative increase in gene expression was different in each cell line, probably reflecting differences in the basal level of expression. p21 was most highly elevated in HCT116, while MIC-1 showed the strongest induction in RKO cells. To compare the transcriptional activity of p53 between drug-treated cells the highest level of induction within the concentration range was plotted for each drug and cell line (Fig. 4B). The level of gene induction by nutlin-3a (10 to 12-fold) was the highest for all three genes in HCT116 cells and for p21 and MDM2 in RKO cells. Only the expression of the MIC-1 gene was slightly higher in doxorubicin-treated RKO cells (Fig. 4B). The inactive enantiomer (nutlin-3b) did not show significant transcriptional activation of any of the genes in either cell line, confirming that the activation of p53 target genes by nutlin-3a is due to inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction (28)..

However, one could argue that p53 phosphorylation accelerates p53 activation by both antagonizing MDM2 interaction and enabling recruitment of co-activators. On the other hand, if the critical step in p53 activation involves preventing MDM2 binding, then nutlin-3a may provide a more direct and rapid route to activation, since kinase activation, p53 modification, and damage-induced degradation of MDM2 (6) would not be required as intermediate steps. We investigated these possibilities by determining the kinetics of transcriptional activation of the p21 and mic-1 genes (up to 8 h) after addition of doxorubicin (1  microM), etoposide (20  microM), and nutlin-3a (10  microM). Previous studies have demonstrated that 1  microM doxorubicin is the optimal dose for p53 induction within an 8-h time frame (33). The results from this experiment showed that the levels of p21 and MDM2 expression were higher or equivalent in nutlin-3a-teated cells than in cells treated with doxorubicin or etoposide (Fig. 5). Importantly, nutlin-3a induced these p53 target genes slightly faster than the genotoxic drugs. This is consistent with its mechanism of action involving direct interference with p53-MDM2 binding. Since nutlin-induced p53 was not detectably phosphorylated on the six residues analyzed (Fig. 2), while doxorubicin-induced p53 was phosphorylated on all six, and etoposide-induced p53 was phosphorylated strongly on at least three residues, we conclude that p53 phosphorylation on key reported phosphorylation sites is dispensable for timely and robust activation of its major downstream transcriptional targets in vivo..

These include an insertion of a stop codon at position Gln144 and a mutation in the DNA binding domain of p53 (S240G). As a result, RKO-R cells are resistant to nutlin-3a, which only works through inhibition of MDM2 in cells with wild-type p53 (28). At the same time, RKO-R cells are only partially resistant to doxorubicin and etoposide due to their p53-independent activities. Treatment of RKO-R cells with doxorubicin, etoposide, and nutlin-3 for 24 h showed a strongly attenuated response to all three drugs. Compared with RKO cells, p53-regulated gene p21 was only partially activated in doxorubicin- and etoposide-treated RKO-R cells but not in the cells exposed to nutlin-3a (Fig. 7). The expression level of MDM2 in RKO-R cells was not affected by the drug treatment. This indicates that p53 response is disabled in RKO-R cells.

A substantial fraction of the apoptotic population was also found in etoposide-treated cells. Nutlin-3a did not induce detectable apoptosis compared with untreated control.

However, as predicted by the mechanism of action, p53 induced by interference with p53-MDM2 binding did not show detectable phosphorylation on six serine residues previously reported as major phosphorylation sites (Ser6, Ser15, Ser20, Ser37, Ser46, and Ser392). At the same time, p53 was phosphorylated on all six serine residues in doxorubicin-treated cells (Fig. 2). Etoposide-induced p53 showed a comparable level of phosphorylation on some serine residues but much weaker to undetectable on others, reflecting differences in the upstream signaling by these drugs (41). The fact that nutlin-induced p53 is not phosphorylated on six highly conserved phosphorylation sites makes it unlikely that other potential sites could be phosphorylated by MDM2 antagonists. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that p53 stabilized by nutlin-3 is free of phosphorylation and perhaps from other post-translational modifications..

However, transactivation properties depend on multiple factors and are best measured on native p53-regulated genes in vivo. To this end, we examined the activation of three different p53 target genes by quantitative PCR. All three have been reported as immediate downstream genes directly regulated by p53. This test revealed that unphosphorylated nutlin-induced p53 had equal or superior activity (Fig. 4). Together with the previous result, this experiment confirmed that the phosphorylation status does not confer to p53 higher transactivation potency. On the contrary, it appears that unphosphorylated p53 is an equivalent or possibly better activator of all three genes in both cell lines. Only MIC-1 is activated slightly higher by doxorubicin in RKO cells..

However, transcription-independent p53 functions have also been reported to mediate apoptosis under some experimental conditions (36, 37). p53 can bind directly to mitochondrial proteins and induce apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner (43). Apoptotic activity of p53 is the most complex and least understood of its functions. There are multiple and frequently overlapping apoptotic pathways downstream of p53, and studying one or several of them may not be of significant value. Fortunately, all apoptotic pathways converge at the point of irreversible commitment to apoptosis. This can be quantified by measuring an established apoptotic marker such as annexin V reactivity. Treatment of HCT116 and RKO cells with the active enantiomer of nutlin-3 for 48 h induced apoptosis in a substantial fraction of the cell population that is p53-dependent, since the inactive enantiomer did not contribute to apoptosis (Fig. 6). The apoptotic fraction in etoposide-treated cells was slightly higher, while doxorubicin induced massive apoptosis (90%) in both cell lines. We found that a significant fraction of the apoptosis induced at high doses was p53-independent by comparing the apoptotic fractions in isogenic variants containing (RKO) and lacking (RKO-R) a functional p53 pathway (Fig. 8). If the apoptotic activity of doxorubicin and etoposide in RKO-R cells is subtracted from their activity in the parental RKO cell line, the residual activity should represent the p53-dependent component of the apoptotic activity of both drugs. The maximal residual (p53-dependent) activity for both doxorubicin and etoposide is equal or lower than the activity of nutlin-3a. This result suggests that the p53-dependent apoptotic activity of nutlin-induced unphosphorylated p53 is equal or better than the activity of phosphorylated p53 induced by doxorubicin or etoposide. However, one needs to acknowledge that such normalization for p53-independent activity could only be used as an approximation, since both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms may utilize the same apoptotic pathways. Despite the possible inaccuracy, to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to reveal differences in the apoptotic activity of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated p53. Further studies, however, are needed to assess the possible effect of phosphorylation on transcription-independent apoptotic activity of p53..

This result suggests that the p53-dependent apoptotic activity of nutlin-induced unphosphorylated p53 is equal or better than the activity of phosphorylated p53 induced by doxorubicin or etoposide. However, one needs to acknowledge that such normalization for p53-independent activity could only be used as an approximation, since both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms may utilize the same apoptotic pathways. Despite the possible inaccuracy, to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to reveal differences in the apoptotic activity of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated p53. Further studies, however, are needed to assess the possible effect of phosphorylation on transcription-independent apoptotic activity of p53..
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	61	Comparison of the activities of p53 phosphorylated on six key serine residues in response to genotoxic insult with unphosphorylated p53 induced by MDM2 antagonists revealed that phosphorylation status of p53 does not affect the main functions of the tumor suppressor. Unphosphorylated p53 is indistinguishable from phosphorylated p53 by its ability to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and activate transcription of target genes and apoptosis in vivo. This study confirms and extends previous observations (24, 42) using an experimental system that allows assessing p53 function in its natural cellular context and reinforces the notion that phosphorylation is dispensable for activation of p53 as a transcription factor. The data also demonstrate the importance of separating MDM2 from p53 as a key requirement for p53 activation. They raise the question of how this is achieved in vivo in light of studies showing that p53 mutants that cannot be phosphorylated can nonetheless be activated equivalently to wild-type p53 (24). Recent studies imply that a key event may actually be the damage-induced phosphorylation of MDM2 itself, which triggers the preferential degradation of MDM2. This provides an effective and rapid means for removing MDM2 from p53 in vivo and for enabling p53 to engage the transcriptional apparatus for target gene induction (6)..

0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	63	The possibility still remains that phosphorylation of p53 may affect p53 activity independent of transcription (e.g. in p53-dependent apoptotic pathways). However, previously published data from our laboratory does not support this possibility. Treatment of the SJSA-1 osteosarcoma cell line with 10  microM nutlin-3a leads to massive apoptotic death (28) comparable with that in doxorubicin-treated RKO cells (Fig. 5). This higher responsiveness to MDM2 antagonists is most likely due to the fact that mdm2 gene amplification in SJSA-1 cells is the only defect in the p53 pathway, while cell lines with normal MDM2 level (e.g. HCT116 and RKO) are likely to have defects in the p53-dependent apoptotic pathways..
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	64	The conclusion that p53 phosphorylation is not essential for execution of its major functions in the p53 pathway has one important implication for cancer therapy. We have shown that MDM2 antagonists can stabilize p53 and inhibit tumor growth in mouse xenografts models of human cancer (28). However, these drugs are non-genotoxic and do not cause phosphorylation of p53. If p53 phosphorylation is important for modulation of its transcriptional activity then the effectiveness of MDM2 antagonists may be limited. Our data support the utility of MDM2 antagonists as single therapeutic agents in treating tumors with wild-type p53 that have retained intact signaling downstream of p53..

We found that heat shock inhibited p53 ubiquitination and caused accumulation of p53 at the post-transcriptional level. Heat shock induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 in an ATM kinase-dependent fashion, which may contribute partially to heat-induced p53 accumulation. However, p53 accumulation also occurred after heat shock in ATM-deficient cells. Heat shock induced conformational change of wild type p53 and binding to hsp90. Inhibition of hsp90-p53 interaction by geldanamycin prevented p53 accumulation partially in ATM-wild type cells and completely in ATM-deficient cells. Therefore, phosphorylation and interaction with hsp90 both contribute to stabilization of p53 after heat shock.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	7	The p53 tumor suppressor is an important regulator of cellular response to stress, abnormal cell proliferation, and DNA damage. In normal cells, p53 is maintained at a very low level because of rapid degradation through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway (1). In response to different stress stimuli including ionizing radiation, UV, and hypoxia, p53 is activated and stabilized as a transcription factor. Activated p53 induces the expression of p21WAF1, gadd45, bax, p53AIP, PUMA, and others, which in turn induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (2)..

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	9	The level of p53 in cells is mainly regulated at the post-transcriptional level by the MDM21 oncoprotein. MDM2 binds to p53 and promotes its ubiquitination by acting as a ubiquitin E3 ligase (3-5). Expression of MDM2 is activated by p53 at the transcription level (6, 7), forming a negative feedback loop to maintain p53 at low levels. To date, most stress signals that activate p53 are known to interfere with the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 degradation by phosphorylation of p53, induction of the MDM2 inhibitor ARF, or inhibition of MDM2 expression (1, 2). Phosphorylation of MDM2 by ATM may also play a role in p53 activation after DNA damage (8). The MDM2-binding domain in the N terminus of p53 contains several phosphorylation sites (9, 10). Recent studies (11, 12) suggest that after DNA damage, the phosphorylation of Ser-15 by the ATM kinase and Ser-20 by human Chk2 plays important roles in p53 stabilization by interfering with MDM2 binding..

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	11	Previous reports (13-17) show that heat shock (1 h at 43  degrees C) also induces p53 accumulation in wild type p53 cell lines and contributes to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Heat shock is clinically useful in facilitating the treatment of certain tumors such as gliomas in combination with chemotherapy or ionizing radiation (18-20). Therefore, investigating the mechanism of p53 accumulation after heat shock is important in understanding p53 response to a physiologically relevant stress. A previous study (22) suggests that p53 accumulation in response to heat is not the result of a general stress-induced increase in protein synthesis, because heat causes a reduction in overall cellular protein synthesis. Heat shock has been reported to induce DNA damage (21), suggesting that it may stabilize and activate p53 in part through the DNA damage response pathways. A recent study shows (15) an increase in p53 mRNA level after heat treatment of A-172 glioma cells, suggesting a mechanism of induction at the transcriptional level..

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	13	Stabilization of p53 also occurs in tumor cells with mutated p53, which result in an accumulation to high levels. Missense mutations of p53 in the DNA-binding core domain cause conformational change and stable association with molecular chaperones such as hsp70 and hsp90 (23, 24). hsp90 binding has been shown to contribute to the accumulation of mutant p53 and many other client proteins (25-27). Our recent studies show (28, 29) that binding of hsp90 inhibits the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in the stabilization of both mutant p53 and MDM2. hsp90 appears to inactivate MDM2 by blocking the central domain of MDM2 normally involved in regulation by ARF, thereby mimicking the effect of ARF to prevent mutant p53 degradation (29)..

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	15	Although the role of hsp90 in mutant p53 stabilization is well established, there is no evidence to date that it contributes to the stabilization of wild type p53 during stress. Molecular chaperones only associate with certain proteins in a transient manner during folding or during heat shock response. Wild type p53 does not form stable complex with hsp90 in normal growth conditions. Because DNA damage does not induce p53 conformational change, hsp90 is unlikely to play a role in DNA damage response. However, p53 is a structurally unstable protein and undergoes conformational change (denaturation) at temperatures above 40  degrees C in vitro (30). Work by Graeber et al. (31) also indicates that heat shock alters the conformation of wild type p53, allowing the formation of the p53 hsc70 complex. Therefore, it is possible that hsp90 binding also interacts with wild type p53 after heat shock and plays a role in stabilizing p53 through mechanisms similar to the stabilization of mutant p53..

The protein levels of p53 and MDM2 were measured by Western blot. The results showed that p53 and MDM2 levels increased significantly 4 h after heat shock (Fig. 1, A and B). Quantitation of the level of p53 by loading titration indicated that heat shock caused a 6 to 8-fold increase in p53 level 4 h after termination of heat treatment (data not shown).

The results showed that p53 mRNA level in A-172 and MCF-7 cells did not change after heat shock (Fig. 2A). Therefore, increased p53 protein expression was not attributed to increase in transcription. To test whether p53 was stabilized after heat shock, A-172 cells were treated with heat shock and the proteasome inhibitor MG132. The magnitude of p53 accumulation after MG132 treatment provided an indication of how rapidly p53 was degraded by ubiquitin-dependent proteasomes. The result showed that in control cells, a 4-h treatment with MG132 caused a significant increase in p53 level. However, after heat shock, MG132 treatment did not lead to further increase of p53 level compared with heat shock alone (Fig. 2B), indicating that it was already stabilized. This suggested that the increased p53 level was because of reduced p53 degradation by the proteasomes..

Western blot of such lysate showed that the high molecular weight bands of ubiquitinated p53 were significantly reduced immediately after heat shock (Fig. 2C). There was significant recovery of p53 ubiquitination at 4 h after heat shock, which may be because of high level MDM2 expression at this time point and the start of a recovery process (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 ubiquitination was inhibited after heat shock, consistent with the increase in p53 stability..

The DNA-damaging agent CPT was used as a positive control. Furthermore, to control for the increased levels of p53 protein after heat shock, we also used MG132 treatment to induce p53 accumulation at 37  degrees C. Antibodies recognizing different phosphorylated serine residues on p53 were used in Western blot detection of phosphorylated p53. The results showed significant increase of phosphorylation level at Ser-15 after heat shock (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation of Ser-20 was also reproducibly induced by heat shock, although it was less than that induced by CPT treatment. The phosphorylation level of Ser-46 was induced by CPT but not by heat shock. The anti-phospho-Ser-392 antibody also did not detect a change after heat shock (Fig. 3), whereas the UV irradiation control induced moderate increase in signal as expected (Fig. 3, bottom panels) (33). The results of Ser-9 and Ser-37 phosphorylation were uninformative because they were not induced by heat shock or the CPT control (data not shown). In summary, heat shock selectively induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and Ser-20, suggesting the involvement of ATM and human Chk2 kinases..

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	45	p53 Conformational Change after Heat Shock-- To test the hypothesis that heat shock caused wild type p53 conformational change, p53 was precipitated by mutant-specific Pab240 and wild type-specific Pab1620 antibodies (35). Pab240 recognizes hydrophobic peptide sequences of p53 normally packed inside the DNA-binding core domain (36); therefore, the exposure of the Pab240 epitope is indicative of misfolded p53. The result showed that in control A-172 cells, p53 could be precipitated efficiently by Pab1620 but weakly by Pab240 (Fig. 5A). Conversely, heat shock significantly increased reaction with Pab240 when the cells were harvested 2 h after heat shock treatment (Fig. 5A), although a significant fraction of p53 also retained Pab1620 reactivity. At 4 h after heat shock, which was the highest point of p53 accumulation, p53 reactivity to Pab1620 increased strongly and Pab240 reactivity reduced significantly. Therefore, there was rapid recovery of p53 conformation back to the wild type status after heat shock. The result also showed that change of p53 conformation correlated with the level of p53 ubiquitination (Fig. 2C). Immediately after heat shock, there was significant reduction of ubiquitinated p53 species, which recovered to near control level 4 h after heat shock. Therefore, change in p53 conformation may also play a role in stabilizing p53..

Coprecipitated hsp90 was detected by Western blot of the p53 precipitate using hsp90-specific antibody. The results showed that hsp90 did not coprecipitate with wild type p53 in the control A-172 cultures without heat shock treatment (Fig. 5B). However, significant amounts of hsp90 coprecipitated with the mutant p53 protein in DLD-1 cells at 37  degrees C and also with wild type p53 in the heat-treated A-172 cells (Fig. 5B). The binding between p53 and hsp90 was stronger at 2 h after heat shock than 4 h, because more p53 was present in the 4-h lysate yet the amount of hsp90 coprecipitated did not increase (Fig. 5B). This was consistent with the significant recovery of wild type p53 conformation and ubiquitination level observed at this time point. Therefore, heat shock induced transient association between wild type p53 and hsp90..

Therefore, we examined the role of hsp90 on wild type p53 stability after heat shock. A-172, NC-607, and AT-29 cells were treated with heat shock in the presence or absence of the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. The level of p53 was measured by Western blot 4 h after heat shock. The results showed that without heat shock, geldanamycin treatment did not significantly affect p53 level. However, geldanamycin prevented the accumulation of p53 after heat shock in ATM-deficient AT-29 cells (Fig. 6A), suggesting that hsp90 function was important for p53 accumulation. The inhibitory effect of geldanamycin was not as complete in A-172 and NC-607 cells, probably because ATM-mediated phosphorylation also contributed to p53 stabilization..

A, cells were treated with heat shock in the presence or absence of 4  microM geldanamycin (GA), and p53 levels were determined by Western blot after 4 h. B, the effect of geldanamycin on p53 hsp90 binding after heat shock was determined by treating cells in the presence of 4  microM geldanamycin and immunoprecipitation of p53 with Pab1801 4 h after heat shock. Coprecipitation of hsp90 was detected by Western blot. The amounts of cell lysate used for precipitation were adjusted to contain a similar amount of p53..

To confirm that geldanamycin blocked hsp90-p53 binding after heat shock, A-172, NC-607, and AT-29 cells were treated with heat shock and geldanamycin. hsp90-p53 binding was detected by p53 immunoprecipitation followed by hsp90 Western blot. The result showed that geldanamycin treatment reduced hsp90-p53 coprecipitation in the three cell lines (Fig. 6B).

Increased p53 expression level is not because of induction of p53 transcription, because its mRNA level does not change after heat stress. Similar to other forms of p53 stress response, reduced ubiquitination and degradation appears to be the major cause of its accumulation after heat shock. The stabilized p53 is functional in inducing expression of downstream target genes and has been shown to contribute to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis response after heat shock (13, 15). Therefore, p53 activation after heat shock is a functionally relevant response to environmental stress..

Many p53 responses to environmental or cellular stresses cause p53 stabilization by interfering with MDM2 function. Phosphorylation of p53 and MDM2, inhibition of MDM2 expression, and inactivation of MDM2 by expression of ARF have all been implicated in wild type p53 accumulation (1, 38). Furthermore, stabilization of mutant p53 involves binding to molecular chaperones hsp90 (25, 27, 37). hsp90-mutant p53 complex is resistant to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, because MDM2 bound to p53 in such a complex is inactivated by hsp90 (29). hsp90 appears to conceal the ARF binding site on MDM2 in hsp90 p53 MDM2 complexes and prevent MDM2 from ubiquitinating p53 and itself. As a result, both MDM2 and mutant p53 become stabilized in tumor cells expressing mutant p53 (28). We previously showed that dissociation of hsp90 by geldanamycin treatment restores the ubiquitination and degradation of mutant p53 (29). Therefore, hsp90-mutant p53 complex also causes p53 stabilization by interfering with MDM2 activity..

Wild type p53 is a structurally unstable protein and readily undergoes conformational change above 40  degrees C in vitro (30). Point mutations in the DNA-binding domain disrupt proper folding and cause structural change at physiological temperatures. Different mutations lead to different temperature sensitivities; some mutations (such as the Val-138) remain functional and conformationally wild type at 32  degrees C and lose activity at 39  degrees C (40). Many hot spot mutations found in human tumors cause significant conformational changes and complete loss of activity at physiological temperature (41). Therefore, it is conceivable that heat shock also causes transient conformational change of wild type p53 similar to the misfolding caused by structural mutations, resulting in binding by hsp90..

However, hsp90 binding would also prevent MDM2-mediated degradation in a manner similar to stabilization of mutant p53 by hsp90 at 37  degrees C. Unlike mutant p53, which cannot fold properly even in the presence of molecular chaperones, heat-denatured wild type p53 can be efficiently refolded by chaperones at 37  degrees C. Therefore, the conformational change after heat shock is transient, and p53 level begins to decrease several hours after heat shock. This correlates with return of normal p53 ubiquitination level..

We found that heat shock also induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and Ser-20, which are sites important for regulating the stability and transcription activity of p53 (1). Phosphorylation of Ser-15 and Ser-20 is dependent on ATM kinase activity and ATM-mediated activation of human Chk2 kinase, suggesting that heat shock can activate the ATM kinase and induce p53 accumulation in part through phosphorylation. A previous study (21) shows that heat shock causes low levels of DNA damage. Our results also showed that heat shock only induced phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 and Ser-20, whereas the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin induced stronger phosphorylation of Ser-15 and Ser-20 as well as an additional phosphorylation at Ser-46. This is consistent with the requirement of severe DNA damage for inducing Ser-46 phosphorylation (42). Therefore, heat shock may activate ATM through inducing low level of DNA damage, which in turn activates p53 by phosphorylation of p53 or MDM2 (8). DNA damage-mediated dephosphorylation of MDM2-acidic domain may also play a role in stabilization of p53 (43). During the course or our study, Miyakoda et al. (17) also reported that phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 occurs after heat shock in an ATM-dependent fashion, which is consistent with our finding..

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	5	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The tumor suppressor protein p53 may have other roles and functions in addition to its well-documented ability to serve as a sequence-specific transcriptional activator in response to DNA damage. We showed previously that p53 can block the replication of polyomavirus origin-containing DNA (Py ori-DNA) in vitro when p53 binding sites are present on the late side of the Py ori. Here we have both further extended these observations and have also examined whether p53 might be able to bind directly to and inhibit the replication of damaged DNA. We found that p53 strongly inhibits replication of -irradiated Py ori-DNA and such inhibition requires both the central DNA binding domain and the extreme C-terminus of the p53 protein. An endogenous p53 binding site lies within the Py origin and is required for the ability of p53 to block initiation of replication from -irradiated Py ori-DNA, suggesting the possibility of DNA looping caused by p53 binding both non-specifically to sites of DNA damage and specifically to the endogenous site in the polyomavirus origin. Our results thus suggest the possibility that under some circumstances p53 might serve as a direct regulator of DNA replication and suggest as well an additional function for cooperation between its two autonomous DNA binding domains..

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	7	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The p53 tumor suppressor protein accumulates in the nuclei of cells in response to various forms of stress including DNA damage. Once stabilized, p53 can arrest cells in G1 and/or G2 or cause apoptosis, through its functions as a sequence-specific transcriptional regulator (for reviews, see 1 to 3). The p53 protein possesses structural domains that are characteristic of transcriptional activators including an activation region at its N-terminus, a sequence-specific DNA binding region within its central portion and an oligomerization domain within its C-terminal region. In addition to genes regulating cell cycle and cell death, p53 can stimulate the transcription of genes encoding products that can affect both DNA synthesis and repair. For example, one of the most well studied p53 target genes is p21/CIP1/WAF1, which can both inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases (4) and also bind to and inactivate PCNA, which plays an essential role in DNA replication by facilitating processive DNA synthesis by polymerase (5). Moreover, p53 activates both the RRM2B/p53R2 gene (6) and the DDB2 (damage-specific DNA binding protein 2) gene (7,8) that each plays distinct roles in DNA repair..

This region of the protein has been shown to facilitate and be required for the interaction of p53 with various forms of damaged or altered DNA including deletion/insertion mismatches, DNA ends, as well as double- and single-strand breaks (for a review, see 10). The function of this region is not fully clarified and it has also been shown to be able to regulate the mode by which the central region recognizes DNA (for a review, see 11)..

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	11	Although p53 is clearly involved in regulating the transcription of numerous targets, there are several lines of evidence suggesting that p53 may play transcription- independent roles in cells as well. Some mutant p53 proteins that have lost transcriptional transactivation capacity retain their ability to arrest cell growth to varying extents (12 to 16). Conversely, loss of growth suppressor function has been reported in some p53 mutants, which retain transcriptional activity (17 to 19). A recent study by Jaks et al. (20) showed that when cells are treated with the DNA-damaging drug camptothecin, p53 accumulation rather than the transactivation of p21 is required for the G1 arrest, strongly suggesting that p53 may play transcription-independent role(s) in cells. In fact it is possible that under some conditions p53 may play a direct role in regulating DNA synthesis. Various experimental results suggest that p53 protein may inhibit DNA replication in a transcription-independent manner. The C-terminally truncated form of p53 protein, p53C30, which is also the DNA binding active form of p53 protein, was reported to inhibit Xenopus nuclear DNA replication in a transcription-independent manner (21). p53 may inhibit the initiation of DNA replication directly by binding to RP-A (22 to 24), which is a single-stranded DNA binding protein required for DNA replication. p53 protein also blocks the replication of SV40 DNA in vitro by binding to and inactivating the SV40 large T antigen (25 to 27). Additionally, although p53 protein does not bind to or inhibit polyoma large T antigen, it is also able to inhibit the replication of polyomavirus origin-containing DNA (Py ori-DNA) in vitro although in this case it is necessary for p53-specific binding sites to be present in the template origin-containing plasmid (28)..

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	13	There have also been reports supporting the possibility of role(s) for p53 in regulating and responding to altered DNA replication in vivo. When DNA synthesis is blocked, p53 inhibits entry into mitosis (29), and in several cell lines p53 is transcriptionally dysfunctional when DNA synthesis is blocked (30). p53 protein prevents mammalian DNA reduplication, following the release from the mitotic spindle checkpoint, in a transcription-independent manner (13). In addition, p53 inhibits the replication of Py and papillomavirus origin-containing DNAs in a cell-specific way: p53 represses replication of both viral origins in human and Chinese hamster cells, but fails to do so in mouse cells (31 to 33). Further evidence supporting the possibility for a direct interaction between p53 and the DNA replication machinery is provided by the observations that p53 is localized to foci of replication in the nuclei of herpes virus-infected cells (34) and that p53 is imported into the nucleus of Xenopus oocyte upon fertilization, although the first 12 rapid cell cycles occur without transcription of the genome (35)..

We found that p53 can block the initial stage of replication of a -irradiated plasmid containing the Py replication origin. Such inhibition requires both specific binding by the p53 core domain and non-specific binding by its C-terminus.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	29	  It was shown previously by Jayaraman et al. (39) that N-terminally HA-tagged p53 protein that had been immunopurified using an affinity column containing the C-terminal-specific monoclonal antibody PAb421, HA to p53 [PAb421], is more active in sequence-specific DNA binding than a similarly purified p53 protein preparation (HA to p53 [flu]) in which the affinity column contained the HA antibody (mAb12.CA5). The basis for this difference is not fully understood but may be related to the observations that interactions of PAb421 with the p53 C-terminus can in some cases stimulate its ability to bind to DNA (41). It has also been shown that p53 purified in the absence of reducing agents (HA to p53 [flu,  to DTT]) is inert in DNA binding (39,42,43). In contrast, as is well-documented, p53 lacking the C-terminus (HA to p53C30 [flu]) can bind extremely well to DNA (41,44). These four different forms of HA-tagged p53 were prepared and tested for their ability to affect replication of Vw16PyCAT Py ori-DNA. As expected, equivalent quantities of these p53 protein preparations, HA to p53C30 [flu], HA to p53 [PAb421], HA to p53 [flu] and HA to p53 [flu,  to DTT], have descending affinities for an oligonucleotide probe, which contains three copies of the RGC site (Fig. 1A and B). The abilities of the different forms of p53 protein to inhibit the replication of Vw16PyCAT in vitro as measured both by incorporation of labeled deoxynucleotide into progeny DNA (Fig. 1C) and DpnI-resistant DNA detected on a 1% vertical agarose gel (Fig. 1D) reflected their relative abilities to bind to DNA. Note that the presence of DpnI-resistant DNA suggested that all the dAMP incorporation measured was produced by replication synthesis. We then tested a core domain  hot-spot  p53 mutant, HA to p53His to 175 [flu], as well as an N-terminally mutated form of p53, HA to p53Gln to 22/Ser to 23 [flu], which has been shown to be defective in transactivation of p53 target genes but active in sequence-specific DNA binding (45). As shown in Figure 2, both wild-type HA to p53 [flu] and HA to p53Gln to 22/Ser to 23 [flu] bound to the oligonucleotide probe containing three copies of RGC sites to similar extents, while, as expected, HA to p53His to 175 [flu] failed to interact with the RGC sites. Correspondingly, wild-type HA to p53 [flu] and HA to p53Gln to 22/Ser to 23 [flu] inhibited replication of Vw16PyCAT in a dose-dependent fashion while HA to p53His to 175 [flu] failed to do so. Our results thus strongly support the conclusion that the essential feature required for p53 to block DNA replication is specific binding to the Py ori-DNA template. Furthermore, the fact that HA to p53Gln to 22/Ser to 23 [flu] functions like wild-type HA to p53 [flu] in inhibiting the replication of Vw16PyCAT suggests that this inhibition does not require interaction of the N-terminus with cellular proteins that bind to its activation domain..
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	30	  It was shown previously by Jayaraman et al. (39) that N-terminally HA-tagged p53 protein that had been immunopurified using an affinity column containing the C-terminal-specific monoclonal antibody PAb421, HA to p53 [PAb421], is more active in sequence-specific DNA binding than a similarly purified p53 protein preparation (HA to p53 [flu]) in which the affinity column contained the HA antibody (mAb12.CA5). The basis for this difference is not fully understood but may be related to the observations that interactions of PAb421 with the p53 C-terminus can in some cases stimulate its ability to bind to DNA (41). It has also been shown that p53 purified in the absence of reducing agents (HA to p53 [flu,  to DTT]) is inert in DNA binding (39,42,43).

We did not, however, determine whether the interaction of p53 with this site was required for p53 to block replication of constructs containing binding sites on the late side of the origin. To determine the role of this endogenous p53 binding site in the inhibition of the replication of Vw16PyCAT by p53, two mutant plasmids, Vw16PyCATBSM1 (BSM: p53 binding site mutant) and Vw16PyCATBSM2, were constructed that have mutated forms of this endogenous p53 binding site (Fig. 3A). In PyORI-BSM1 the two sets of essential C and G nucleotides from the p53 consensus sequence were mutated to T and A, while PyORI-BSM2 was altered to conform to a  perfect  p53 consensus sequence. To test the affinity of p53 protein to the three different sequences, we used two different approaches. Figure 3B shows the result of a gel mobility shift assay in which HA to p53 [flu] bound end-labeled 411 bp oligonucleotide fragments excised from the respective Vw16PyCAT derivatives (Py nucleotide 5076 to 89).

Interestingly, while in the absence of p53, Vw16PyCATBSM2 had a replication efficiency close to that of Vw16PyCAT, Vw16PyCATBSM1 replicated 3 to 4-fold more efficiently than the other two plasmids (data not shown). Since the endogenous p53 binding site is located between two T antigen binding consensus pentanucleotides spanning nucleotides 62 to 66 and 95 to 99, it may be that the weaker T-A base pairs constructed in PyORI-BSM1 make it easier for T antigen to unwind the origin DNA.

To test this, plasmids pBE102BSM1 and pBE102BSM2 were constructed, which have the endogenous p53 binding site mutated to BSM1 and BSM2, respectively (as shown in Fig. 3A). Indeed, in contrast to wild-type or pBE102BSM2, the replication of -irradiated pBE102BSM1 was not inhibited by HA to p53 [flu] (Fig. 5C), indicating that the endogenous p53 binding site is required for p53 to inhibit the replication of radiation damaged Py ori-DNA..

Thus, p53 might bind simultaneously to an irradiated plasmid with its C-terminus and to another unirradiated plasmid through interaction of its central domain with the endogenous binding site and this would somehow prevent replication of the unirradiated plasmid. To test this we mixed untreated pBE102 and -irradiated pBluescript, which does not have the Py origin and therefore does not support DNA replication with the Py large T antigen-complemented in vitro DNA replication system. It was observed that the endogenous p53 binding site and DNA lesion(s) caused by -irradiation do not work in trans in making DNA replication inhibited by HA to p53 [flu] (Fig. 6A).

As was first demonstrated with SV40 ori-DNA replication, when reaction mixtures are deprived of deoxynucleotides and pre-incubated with T antigen, the pre-synthesis complex forms (47), but the complex is unable to begin elongation. It is thus possible to determine whether p53 inhibition of DNA replication occurs at the elongation or initiation stage by adding it to replication mixtures either before or after addition of deoxynucleotides. Pre-incubation with T antigen was carried out for 10 min and then HA to p53 [flu] protein (600 ng) was added and incubated for a further 10 min, followed by the addition of deoxynucleotides to allow elongation (Fig. 7). DNA replication after this treatment was compared with that in replication reaction mixtures when HA to p53 [flu] was added without pre- incubation (compare lane 3 with lane 5, lane 4 with lane 6). HA to p53 [flu] inhibited replication of both Vw16PyCAT and damaged pBE102 templates without T antigen pre-incubation. When T antigen was allowed to form the pre-synthesis complex at the origin; however, HA to p53 [flu] was no longer able to inhibit replication of either template (Fig. 7). The result that inhibition of replication of both types of template happens at the beginning of DNA replication suggests that p53 may inhibit replication of the two different types of templates through the same mechanism..

Thus, it is unlikely that p53 is blocking replication by random non-specific binding to the damaged DNA. It is also noteworthy that Ito et al.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	65	To explain the mechanism underlying the inhibition of Py DNA by p53, several possibilities can be suggested: (i) by binding to flanking consensus sites or lesion site(s), p53 may sequester away proteins which are essential for the replication machinery such as RP-A and T antigen; (ii) p53 binding to a site close to the replication origin, such as the endogenous p53 site of Py DNA, may block access of the replication initiation complex to the origin; (iii) p53 may also function as an anti-helicase (49) and counteract the helicase activity of T antigen by re-annealing denatured DNA around the origin; (iv) by binding to separate sites p53 may loop DNA around the origin and therefore produce steric hindrance to replication initiation. Our results presented in this paper strongly support the DNA looping model (Fig. 8), because both the endogenous p53 binding site on the early side and an in cis p53 binding site on the late side adjacent to the Py origin are required for the DNA replication to be inhibited by p53. It has been shown previously that p53 binding to separate single consensus sequences can indeed bend and loop DNA, and DNA looping by p53 may play an important role in transactivation of certain promoters (50,51). So far, it remains to be tested whether p53 can also loop DNA by binding to separate DNA lesions, or as suggested by our result, by separately binding to a consensus sequence and a lesion site(s)..

The fact that the wild-type polyomavirus genome contains an endogenous p53 binding consensus site provides the intriguing possibility that polyomavirus may indeed use the host p53 protein to regulate amplicational replications. Amplicational replication of small DNA tumor viruses is normally initiated after entry of the viral genome into the cell nucleus, which leads to a rapid increase in copy number of the virus genome (32). Amplicational replication of the viral genome is essential for the establishment of viral infection but has to be controlled in order to avoid over-replication and unscheduled death of host cells prior to the synthesis of late genes and the production of infectious particles. It is tempting to speculate that polyomavirus uses p53 as a cellular factor to control amplicational replication. Further experiments will be required to test this possibility. Small DNA tumor viruses generally encode proteins that interact with and modulate the activity of p53 and thereby regulate p53-dependent apoptosis of the host cells. For example, the large T antigen of SV40 (26,52), E1B protein of adenovirus (53), x antigen of hepatitis B virus (54,55) and other viral proteins interact with p53 and thereby modulate p53-dependent apoptosis. So far no protein encoded by the Py genome has been identified that interacts with or regulates the activity of p53 protein. It supports the likelihood that polyomavirus uses p53 as a cellular factor to keep amplicational replication in check..

It is tempting to speculate that p53 may participate directly in a pathway that stops or slows down DNA replication more rapidly than the transcription- dependent p21/E2F pathway. Although p53 is believed to interact with various forms of DNA damage through its C-terminus the biological function of this interaction has not been elucidated. In our study using ionizing radiation damaged Py ori-DNA plasmids we were able to demonstrate by in vitro experiments a potential new function for p53, namely that of direct inhibition of initiation of DNA replication in a DNA binding-dependent manner. It should be noted here that a p53-dependent DNA replication checkpoint has not been demonstrated (57), and in fact p53 has been shown to be transcriptionally impaired when it accumulates in blocked S-phase (30). What is not known, however, is whether at the very onset of S-phase radiation-damaged templates might be prevented from initiating replication as a result of direct interactions with p53. It is acknowledged that the replication of Py ori-DNA embodies several features that are distinct from the as yet poorly understood process of mammalian genomic DNA replication. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that p53 could only exert its effect on the initial stages of Py-ori DNA synthesis and, once initiated, p53 was ineffective in inhibiting ongoing replication. Thus, based both on our biochemical observations and the existing body of knowledge of p53 in cells, it is possible that p53 might serve to prevent the onset of S-phase both through its function as a transcription factor and its ability to bind to damaged DNA and prevent initiation of DNA synthesis. Once S-phase has initiated, it would follow that p53 would no longer be effective in inhibition of pre-initiated replication forks, even if stalled..

BID: a link between... p53-mediated abrogation of... p53-mediated cancer therapy Conclusion References   Exposure to cellular stress can trigger the p53 tumor suppressor, a sequence-specific transcription factor, to induce cell growth arrest or apoptosis. The choice between these cellular responses is influenced by many factors, including the type of cell and stress, and the action of p53 co-activators. p53 stimulates a wide network of signals that act through two major apoptotic pathways. The extrinsic, death receptor pathway triggers the activation of a caspase cascade, and the intrinsic, mitochondrial pathway shifts the balance in the Bcl-2 family towards the pro-apoptotic members, promoting the formation of the apoptosome, and consequently caspase-mediated apoptosis. The impact of these two apoptotic pathways may be enhanced when they converge through Bid, which is a p53 target. The majority of these apoptotic effects are mediated through the induction of specific apoptotic target genes. However, p53 can also promote apoptosis by a transcription-independent mechanism under certain conditions. Thus, a multitude of mechanisms are employed by p53 to ensure efficient induction of apoptosis in a stage-, tissue- and stress-signal-specific manner. Manipulation of the apoptotic functions of p53 constitutes an attractive target for cancer therapy..

The ability of p53 to eliminate excess, damaged or infected cells by apoptosis (Kerr et al., 1972) is vital for the proper regulation of cell proliferation in multi-cellular organisms (Huang and Strasser, 2000). p53 is activated by external and internal stress signals that promote its nuclear accumulation in an active form. In turn, p53 induces either viable cell growth arrest or apoptosis. The latter activity is crucial for tumor suppression. The growth inhibitory activities of p53 prevent the proliferation of cells with damaged DNA or with a potential for neoplastic transformation. In addition, p53 contributes to cellular processes such as differentiation, DNA repair and angiogenesis, which also appear to be vital for tumor suppression (reviewed by Vogt Sionov and Haupt, 1999)..

This obstacle has to be removed in order to allow tumor development. Indeed, approximately 50% of human cancers bear p53 gene mutations; in the majority of the remaining cancer cases, p53 activity is compromised by alternative mechanisms (Vogelstein et al., 2000). These involve elevation in the expression levels of p53 inhibitors, such as Mdm2 or the E6 protein of HPV, or silencing of key p53 co-activators, such as ARF (Vogelstein et al., 2000; Vogt Sionov et al., 2001)..

Mdm2 inhibits the transcriptional activity of p53 and, more importantly, promotes its degradation by the proteasome. However, the status of p53 is drastically altered when cells are exposed to stress, including DNA damage, untimely expression of oncogenes, hypoxia and nucleotide depletion (reviewed by Giaccia and Kastan, 1998). p53 activation involves stabilization of the protein, and enhancement of its DNA binding and transcriptional activity. These changes in p53 are mediated by extensive post-translational modifications of p53 and protein-protein interactions with cooperating factors. Ultimately, the activation of p53 leads to cell growth arrest, senescence or apoptosis, the choice of which depends on the summation of the incoming signals and the cellular context (see below). Because the apoptotic function of p53 is critical for tumor suppression, reconstitution of inactive p53-dependent apoptotic pathways is an attractive approach currently being explored for anti-cancer treatment. Here, we review recent developments in our understanding of p53-mediated apoptosis. References to relevant exhaustive reviews on this subject are made in the appropriate sections..

BID: a link between... p53-mediated abrogation of... p53-mediated cancer therapy Conclusion References   p53 is a transcription factor that activates vital damage-containment procedures to restrict aberrant cell growth in response to DNA damage, oncogene activation, hypoxia and the loss of normal cell contacts (Giaccia and Kastan, 1998; Lohrum and Vousden, 1999). It restricts cellular growth by inducing senescence, cell cycle arrest (at G1 and/or G2 phase) or apoptosis (Jin and Levine, 2001). The exact criteria that influence p53 to stimulate cell cycle arrest or apoptosis are only partially understood and are the subject of intense study. Several general factors that influence this decision include p53 expression levels, the type of stress signal, the cell type and the cellular context at the time of exposure to stress (reviewed by Balint and Vousden, 2001; Vogt Sionov and Haupt, 1999). Several intriguing observations have recently provided insight into the apparent intricacies of such cell fate determination. The examples described below involve the binding of p53 to its canonical binding sequence in target genes (el-Deiry et al., 1992). Note, however, that p53 can also activate target genes through a non-canonical sequence. The first such example is in the p53-induced gene 3 (PIG3), which has been implicated in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis induction (Polyak et al., 1997). PIG3 can be induced by p53 through a microsatellite sequence within its untranslated region (Contente et al., 2002). Another recently described example is the gene encoding the pro-apoptotic phosphatase PAC1, which is induced through binding of p53 to a novel palindromic binding site (Yin et al., 2003). This might represent a new mechanism for transcriptional regulation of apoptotic genes by p53, which differs from that already described (see below)..

BID: a link between... p53-mediated abrogation of... p53-mediated cancer therapy Conclusion References   The nucleotide sequence of the binding site for p53 within the promoters of its target genes is a critical determinant in the response to stress (UV light or -irradiation exposure). In response to DNA damage, the binding affinity of p53 for the promoter of the cell-cycle-regulating gene p21WAF/CIP1 (p21) is unchanged, whereas binding to the promoter of the DNA-repair-associated gene Gadd45 is reduced. This is due, primarily, to oxidation of Cys277, residing within human p53, which contacts the third base (the first pyrimidine residue) in the p53-binding consensus pentamer A/TGPyPyPy: where the p53-binding element of p21 is 5'-GAACATGTCCcAACATGTTg-3' and that of GADD45 is 5'-GAACATGTCTAAGCATGCTg-3' (and where the critical residues that determine the binding to Cys277 are indicated in red, and consensus-fitting bases are in uppercase). Although the mechanism of p53 Cys277 oxidation is unclear, it may be associated with the production of oxygen radicals that are induced in response to exposure to high-dose UV light (Buzek et al., 2002)..
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	12	Only under reducing conditions is the affinity of p53 for the Gadd45 promoter increased, which suggests that the reduction of Cys277 is necessary to enable binding of p53 to C-rich binding sequences, such as that of Gadd45. Intriguingly, Seo et al. found that reduction of residues Cys275 and Cys277 by selenomethionine (the major dietary source of selenium) caused p53 to recruit the p53-binding redox factor Ref1 and activate DNA-repair machinery through the induction of Gadd45, without affecting cell growth (Seo et al., 2002). Thus, the redox state of p53 Cys277 appears to serve as a switch for activating the DNA repair machinery. This selective activation of p53-dependent DNA repair activity has been proposed as a novel approach to cancer prevention (Gudkov, 2002)..

It is therefore plausible that the specific co-factors expressed in a particular cellular context determine the repertoire of p53-target genes induced, and consequently whether the cell undergoes growth arrest or apoptosis, or even a particular apoptotic pathway (Fig. 1), may be subject to the availability of co-activators (Rozenfeld-Granot et al., 2002)..

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	15	The Myc protein has been implicated as an important determinant of the choice between p53-induced growth arrest or apoptosis. Myc inhibits growth arrest in response to UV light, -irradiation and DNA damage inflicted by reactive oxygen species (Sheen and Dickson, 2002; Vafa et al., 2002). In the absence of Myc, cells that are exposed to UV light arrest in a p53- and Miz-1 (DNA-binding Myc-interacting zinc-finger 1)-dependent manner through activation of p21. However, when Myc is present, exposure to UV triggers its recruitment by Miz-1 to the proximal promoter region of p21. This interaction effectively represses p21 induction by p53 and other activators (Herold et al., 2002; Seoane et al., 2002). Intriguingly, this repression appears to be specific for p21, because other p53-target genes, such as p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and PIG3, are induced. This block in p21 induction shifts the balance away from growth arrest towards apoptosis (Seoane et al., 2002). It should be noted, however, that arrested cells are not necessarily protected from apoptosis. For example, normal thymocytes and mature lymphocytes undergo p53-mediated apoptosis under certain stress conditions (Strasser et al., 1994). Interaction of p53 with several other proteins specifically enhances the induction of apoptotic target genes. The apoptosis stimulating proteins of p53 (ASPP), for example, increases the DNA binding and transactivation activity of p53 on the promoters of apoptotic genes (e.g. Bax and PIG3), while failing to promote binding to the p21 promoter by a mechanism that remains to be defined (Samuels-Lev et al., 2001)..

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	17	A novel insight into the interplay between p53 and its family members, p63 and p73, in the induction of apoptosis has been recently revealed by Flores et al. (Flores et al., 2002). Their study of the effect of p63 and p73 on p53 transcriptional activity, using a selection of knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), defined two distinct classes of target gene. Whereas p53 alone is sufficient for the induction of p21 and Mdm2, the induction of the apoptotic genes PERP, Bax and Noxa requires p53 together with p63 and p73. This finding demonstrates an essential role for both p63 and p73 in the efficient induction of apoptotic target genes by p53. The mechanism of this cooperation is currently unknown, but it may involve an enhanced binding to and/or stabilization of the transcription complex on the promoters of p53 apoptotic target genes by the cooperative action of all three members (Urist and Prives, 2002). In addition to the contribution of p63 and p73 to the apoptotic function of p53, they play an important role in the precise control of cell death during normal mouse development. p73 also plays a role in the induction of cell death in response to DNA damage, a process involving cooperation between the Abl tyrosine kinase and p73 (reviewed by Shaul, 2000)..

BID: a link between... p53-mediated abrogation of... p53-mediated cancer therapy Conclusion References   Exacting discrimination between p53 arrest and apoptotic functions has been critical to the identification of the importance of the latter in tumor suppression. A strong link between the apoptotic function of p53 and tumor suppression has been demonstrated using transgenic mice bearing an SV40 large T antigen (LT) mutant, which inhibited pRb function without directly compromising p53 activity. p53-mediated growth arrest is however impaired in these mice owing to pRb loss of function, but the apoptotic activity is functional. These mice develop choroid plexus tumors, but at a slow rate owing to continuous p53-dependent apoptosis. Elimination of p53 from these mice, by crossbreeding with p53-null mice, resulted in aggressive tumor development. This finding suggested that tumor suppression is primarily due to p53-mediated apoptosis (reviewed by Vogt Sionov and Haupt, 1999). The most compelling insight into this fundamental question came from a recent study using the E micro-myc-mediated lymphoma mouse model. The apoptotic pathway of the lymphoma cells was blocked either by retroviral expression of bcl-2 or a dominant negative caspase-9. The effect of this block on the growth of these lymphomas was then tested in recipient mice. In the apoptosis-impaired cells there was no selection for p53 mutations, in contrast to cells that had intact apoptotic pathways. Remarkably, in the apoptosis-impaired lymphoma cells expressing functional p53, the integrity of the genome and the cell cycle checkpoints were maintained. Taken together these studies support the notion that apoptosis is the critical function of p53 in tumor suppression..
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	19	How p53 mediates apoptosis has been a matter of intensive study since this was first demonstrated (Yonish-Rouach et al., 1991). Numerous publications have recently described the importance of p53 transcriptional regulation of components of both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. However, few target gene products have been unequivocally established to be essential to p53-dependent apoptosis induction; we discuss the supporting evidence below. p53 is also able to promote apoptosis through transcription-independent apoptotic mechanisms. Under certain conditions, p53 induces apoptosis in the absence of transcription or protein synthesis (e.g. Caelles et al., 1994). Moreover, transcriptionally inactive mutants of p53 can induce apoptosis in certain cell types (Haupt et al., 1995), and PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT), which blocks binding of p53 to DNA, does not inhibit p53-mediated apoptosis (Nelson et al., 2001). In general, the transcription-independent apoptotic activities of p53 have been demonstrated in transformed cells rather than in normal cells (e.g. lymphocytes or fibroblasts). Presumably, these activities of p53 require cooperation with other apoptotic factors - for instance E2F-1 (a transcription factor in the retinoblastoma protein pathway) (reviewed by Vogt Sionov and Haupt, 1999). Experimental cell transformation may mimic various stages of tumor development, where the apoptotic function of p53 is being activated and becomes critical for the suppression of tumor progression. These apoptotic activities of p53 may not be sufficient to induce apoptosis in non-transformed cells, such as normal thymocytes. Whereas the transcription-dependent and -independent apoptotic functions of p53 are often described separately, they appear to complement each other. We therefore discuss their contributions together in the context of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways..

BID: a link between... p53-mediated abrogation of... p53-mediated cancer therapy Conclusion References   p53 is implicated in the induction of what had until recently been understood to be two distinct apoptotic signaling pathways that lead to the activation of the aspartate-specific cysteine proteases (caspases) that mediate apoptosis (Fig. 1). The extrinsic pathway involves engagement of particular `death' receptors that belong to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family and, through the formation of the death-inducing-signaling-complex (DISC) (Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998), leads to a cascade of activation of caspases, including caspase-8 and caspase-3, which in turn induce apoptosis. The intrinsic pathway is triggered in response to DNA damage and is associated with mitochondrial depolarization and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF-1) and procaspase-9 then form a complex termed the apoptosome, in which caspase-9 is activated and promotes activation of caspase-3, caspase-6 and caspase-7 (reviewed by Nicholson and Thornberry, 2003). Recent studies, however, link the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, lending support to the idea of converging rather than distinct pathways (Gross et al., 1999; Li et al., 1998)..

BID: a link between... p53-mediated abrogation of... p53-mediated cancer therapy Conclusion References   p53 can activate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway through the induction of genes encoding three transmembranes proteins: Fas, DR5 and PERP. The cell-surface receptor Fas (CD95/Apo-1), a member of the TNF-R family of receptors, is a key component of the extrinsic death pathway (Nagata and Golstein, 1995). Fas is activated by binding of its ligand, FasL, which is expressed predominantly by T cells (Muzio, 1998). p53 induces Fas mRNA expression by binding to elements found in the promoter and first intron of the Fas gene (Muller et al., 1998). This induction occurs in response to -irradiation, and it appears to be strictly tissue specific (Bouvard et al., 2000). p53-dependent Fas mRNA induction has been demonstrated in the spleen, thymus, kidney and lung, but not in the heart and liver (Bouvard et al., 2000). However, at least in lymphocytes, Fas appears to be dispensable for p53-dependent apoptosis (Fuchs et al., 1997; O'Connor et al., 2000). The importance of Fas as a p53 target in other cell types remains to be elucidated..
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	22	In addition to stimulating Fas transcription, overexpressed p53 may enhance levels of Fas at the cell surface by promoting trafficking of the Fas receptor from the Golgi (Bennett et al., 1998). This may allow p53 to rapidly sensitize cells to Fas-induced apoptosis before the transcription-dependent effect operates. How p53 promotes Fas trafficking is not understood..
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	23	The second member of this receptor family that is induced by p53 is DR5/KILLER, the death-domain-containing receptor for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). DR5 is induced by p53 in response to DNA damage (Wu et al., 1997) and in turn promotes cell death through caspase-8 (reviewed by Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998). DR5 induction is cell type specific. Whole body -irradiation induces DR5 expression in the spleen, small intestine and thymus (Burns et al., 2001), which is consistent with DR5 participating in the p53-mediated response to DNA damage in these tissues. Strikingly, in MEFs exposed to DNA damage (by doxorubicin), similar levels of DR5 were identified in cells undergoing G1 arrest and apoptosis (Attardi et al., 2000). Thus, the contribution of DR5 to these different p53-determined cell fates remains to be clarified..

PERP is a putative tetraspan transmembrane protein that represents a new member of the PMP-22/gas family of proteins implicated in cell growth regulation. The kinetics of PERP induction in response to DNA damage and the presence of a p53-responsive element in the PERP promoter support the notion that it is a direct p53 target. A role for PERP in apoptosis is suggested by the significantly higher levels of PERP mRNA in cells undergoing apoptosis than in arresting cells. However, the mechanism by which PERP contributes to p53-mediated apoptosis is yet to be defined (Attardi et al., 2000)..

BID: a link between... p53-mediated abrogation of... p53-mediated cancer therapy Conclusion References   The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is dominated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which governs the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (Cory and Adams, 2002; Kuwana et al., 2002). The Bcl-2 family comprises anti-apoptotic (pro-survival) and pro-apoptotic members. Family members are classified on the basis of structural similarity to the Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains (BH1, BH2, BH3 and BH4), and a transmembrane domain. The BH3 domain, which is present in all members and is essential for heterodimerization among members, is the minimum domain required for the proapoptotic function (Kelekar and Thompson, 1998; Yu et al., 2001). The Bcl-2 family is divisible into three classes: pro-survival proteins, whose members are most structurally similar to Bcl-2, such as Bcl-XL; pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and Bak, which are structurally similar to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and antagonize their pro-survival functions; and the pro-apoptotic `BH3-only' proteins (Bouillet and Strasser, 2002). Intriguingly, a key subset of the Bcl-2 family genes are p53 targets, including Bax, Noxa, PUMA and the most recently identified, Bid..

In response to stress activation, Bax forms a homodimer and releases cytochrome c from the mitochondria (Skulachev, 1998), which results in caspase-9 activation (reviewed by Adams and Cory, 1998). The requirement for Bax in p53-mediated apoptosis appears to be cell-type dependent. Bax is required for the apoptotic response of the developing nervous system to -irradiation (Chong et al., 2000) and contributes to chemotherapy-induced killing of E1A-expressing fibroblasts (McCurrach et al., 1997)..
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	29	In contrast, equivalent levels of Bax induced in MEFs undergoing either arrest or apoptosis had been understood to indicate that Bax does not dictate cellular fate in these cells (Attardi et al., 2000). In addition, in colonic epithelia undergoing apoptosis in response to -irradiation, Bax did not appear to be essential (Pritchard et al., 1999)..
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	30	A fascinating explanation for the apparent enigmatic role of Bax in apoptosis induction has recently been offered in the context of PUMA. The PUMA gene is also directly induced by p53 in response to DNA damage, through p53-responsive elements within the first intron of PUMA. In humans, PUMA encodes two BH3-domain-containing proteins, PUMA- and PUMA-ss (Nakano and Vousden, 2001; Yu et al., 2001). A vital balance between PUMA and p21 has been identified to determine the onset of arrest, or death, in response to exogenous p53 expression and also hypoxia in human colorectal cancer cells. Growth arrest through activation of p21 is the normal response to p53 expression in these cells. If p21 is disrupted the cells die through apoptosis; if, however, PUMA is disrupted, apoptosis is prevented. Bax is absolutely required for PUMA-mediated apoptosis. PUMA expression promotes mitochondrial translocation and mulitmerization of Bax, culminating in apoptosis induction (Yu et al., 2003). Thus, although p53 can bind to the Bax promoter, the affinity is weak in contrast to p21 and PUMA binding (Kaeser and Iggo, 2002). Bax thus participates in the death response as an indirect target of p53 through PUMA (Yu et al., 2003)..

If p21 is disrupted the cells die through apoptosis; if, however, PUMA is disrupted, apoptosis is prevented. Bax is absolutely required for PUMA-mediated apoptosis. PUMA expression promotes mitochondrial translocation and mulitmerization of Bax, culminating in apoptosis induction (Yu et al., 2003). Thus, although p53 can bind to the Bax promoter, the affinity is weak in contrast to p21 and PUMA binding (Kaeser and Iggo, 2002). Bax thus participates in the death response as an indirect target of p53 through PUMA (Yu et al., 2003)..

Noxa encodes a BH3-only protein and hence is likely to contribute to p53-mediated apoptosis in a similar manner to PUMA and Bax, although this is yet to be demonstrated. Thus, it appears that, in response to DNA damage, p53 activates the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by inducing the expression of at least three Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic family members, shifting the balance towards pro-apoptotic effects..

BID: a link between... p53-mediated abrogation of... p53-mediated cancer therapy Conclusion References   The formation of the apoptosome requires the release of cytochrome c and APAF-1 from mitochondria and their formation of a complex with pro-caspase-9 (Adams and Cory, 2002). p53 promotes cytochrome c release through the induction of target genes encoding BH3-only proteins. Importantly, p53 also induces APAF-1 expression through a response element within the APAF-1 promoter (Kannan et al., 2001; Moroni et al., 2001; Robles et al., 2001; Rozenfeld-Granot et al., 2002). This induction by p53 is boosted by E2F-1, which induces APAF-1 expression, and activates p53 in an ARF-dependent manner (Moroni et al., 2001). APAF-1, is required for stress-induced p53-dependent apoptosis of fibroblasts and also for the induction of apoptosis by Myc, in which caspase-9 is an essential downstream component (Soengas et al., 1999). In another study the response to IR of thymocytes from Apaf-1/caspase-9 null mice was compared with that of normal mice. This comparison revealed an impaired response, but neither protection from apoptosis nor normal sensitivity to IR-induced death (Marsden et al., 2002). This apparent difference may represent a different role for the apoptosome in Myc-expressing fibroblasts versus normal thymocytes. It may also suggest that the apoptosome can contribute to p53-mediated apoptosis, but perhaps is not essential for it to occur, at least in thymocytes..

These initiator caspases cleave the pro-enzyme forms of the effector caspases, caspase-3, caspase-6 and caspase-7, allowing digestion of essential targets that affect cell viability (Fig. 1) (MacLachlan and El-Deiry, 2002). Intriguingly, p53 boosts the activation of the caspase cascade by both transcription-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In response to -irradiation of nucleus-depleted S100 cell-free extracts, p53 can activate caspase-8 (Ding et al., 1998). Depletion or inactivation of caspase-8 in cell-free extracts completely prevents this effect and significantly attenuates overall apoptosis induced by wild-type p53. However, etoposide- and UV-mediated death of fibroblasts derived from caspase-8-deficient mice is not impaired (Varfolomeev et al., 1998). Thus, caspase-8 can contribute to, although is not always essential for, DNA-damaged induced death..

BID: a link between... p53-mediated abrogation of... p53-mediated cancer therapy Conclusion References   p53 also participates in apoptosis induction by acting directly at mitochondria. Localization of p53 to the mitochondria occurs in response to apoptotic signals and precedes cytochrome c release and procaspase-3 activation. Importantly, redirecting p53 to mitochondria by using mitochondrial-import leader peptides is sufficient to induce apoptosis in p53-deficient Saos-2 cells (Marchenko et al., 2000). Recently Mihara et al. also extended this finding to show that p53 promotes permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane by forming complexes with the protective Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 proteins. Interestingly, p53 binds through its DNA-binding domain to Bcl-XL. Tumor-derived transactivation-deficient mutants of p53 cannot interact with Bcl-XL and hence do not promote mitochondrial apoptotic events, even though they localize to the mitochondria (Mihara et al., 2003). Separating these two activities of p53 may shed light on the biological relevance of p53 localization to the mitochondria. Since p53 can mediate apoptosis without its DNA-binding domain (Haupt et al., 1995) it is likely that the mitochondrial localization of p53 is not the only transcription-independent mechanism by which p53 promotes apoptosis..

BID: a link between... p53-mediated abrogation of... p53-mediated cancer therapy Conclusion References   The pro-apoptotic Bid is distinguished by its unique ability to connect activation of the extrinsic death receptor pathway to activation of the mitochondrial-disruption processes associated with the intrinsic pathway. Activation of Bid involves cleavage of cytoplasmic Bid by caspase-8 to expose a new N-terminal glycine residue, which undergoes post-translational myristoylation. Myristoylated Bid translocates to the mitochondria, inserts into the membrane and activates BAX and BAK to initiate mitochondrial events leading to apoptosome formation. The Bid gene is transcriptionally regulated by p53 in response to -irradiation through response elements in the first intron of the human gene or in the promoter of the mouse gene. Bid mRNA increases in a p53-dependent manner in the splenic red pulp and the colonic epithelium; however, a correlation with an increase in Bid protein levels needs to be shown. Cellular chemosensitivity to the DNA-damaging agents adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil appears to be critically dependent on the presence of wild-type p53 and Bid, Bid-null cells being resistant to the effects of these drugs (Sax et al., 2002). p53 therefore appears to promote the convergence of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways through Bid regulation..

BID: a link between... p53-mediated abrogation of... p53-mediated cancer therapy Conclusion References   Binding of mitogens and cytokines to cell surface receptors including the insulin receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and the actions of oncogenes such as Ras and Her2/Neu, is transduced by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activating signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation and viability (Fig. 2). PI3K comprises a p85 regulatory subunit, which interacts with phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases, and the 110 kDa subunit, which localizes to the membrane upon receptor binding. In response to a change in redox state caused by H2O2-induced oxidative stress, p85 is upregulated by p53. p85 is involved in the p53-dependent apoptotic response to H2O2 in MEFs, but its precise role in cell death is unclear. PI3K activates AKT, a serine/threonine kinase, through phosphorylation on Ser473 by the 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase PDK1 (Lawlor and Alessi, 2001). In turn, AKT phosphorylates a range of targets that function to promote cell survival, including the major inhibitor of p53, Mdm2 (reviewed by Mayo and Donner, 2002). This phosphorylation enhances the nuclear accumulation of Mdm2, augments Mdm2 interaction with p300, and reduces the affinity of Mdm2 for p19ARF (reviewed by Testa and Bellacosa, 2001). Consequently, AKT augments the inhibition and destabilization of p53 by Mdm2 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, stress-induced activation of p53 counteracts the inhibitory effects of this survival pathway by multiple mechanisms (Fig. 2). First, p53 promotes caspase-mediated cleavage and subsequent degradation of the AKT protein itself (Gottlieb et al., 2002). Second, p53 induces the expression of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, which encodes a phosphatase that dephosphorylates PI3K, thereby impairing AKT activation (reviewed by Mayo and Donner, 2002). Third, p53 induces expression of cyclin G, which in turn recruits the phosphatase PP2AB' to the Mdm2-p53 complex, where it dephosphorylates Mdm2 at the AKT phosphorylation sites. These feedback loops determine the survival versus apoptotic outcome in the interplay between p53 and the AKT survival pathway (Fig. 2) (reviewed by Oren et al., 2002). This fine balance is often interrupted in cancer, either by mutations in PTEN or amplification of Mdm2 (Mayo and Donner, 2002)..

The negative regulation of p53 by AKT is induced in response to survival signals from Mdm2. The activation of this pathway leads to the inhibition and destruction of p53. Under stress conditions this pathways is blocked through the cleavage and degradation of AKT, and the inhibition of PI3K through PTEN. Both of these activities are induced by p53. In this model survival is achieved by inhibition of p53 by AKT, whereas apoptosis is achieved by counteracting AKT by p53. p53 target genes are shown in red. Green arrows represent activation, whereas red arrows represent inhibition..

BID: a link between... p53-mediated abrogation of... p53-mediated cancer therapy Conclusion References   Stimulation of disabled p53 pathways has been suggested as a potential mode of therapy for cancer: potential approaches include introducing wild-type p53 genetically, empowering aberrant p53 molecules to perform wild-type functions, or intervening to activate directly targets in the p53 apoptotic pathways. Gene therapy based on the introduction of wild-type p53 (reviewed by Wen et al., 2003) and elimination of mutant-p53-expressing cells (reviewed by Post, 2002) is undergoing clinical trials. Restoration of wild-type conformation to structurally contorted p53 DNA-binding mutants has been demonstrated, using peptide constructs and small molecular weight synthetic molecules (reviewed by Bullock and Fersht, 2001). Synthetic peptides derived from the C-terminus of p53 can induce p53-dependent apoptosis in tumor cells and restore the specific DNA-binding and transcription functions to mutant p53 in vitro (Abarzua et al., 1996; Selivanova et al., 1997; Selivanova et al., 1999). In vivo activity of these peptides has been associated with an increase in the levels of the Fas receptor on the cell surface, through a p53-dependent mechanism that is independent of transcription (Kim et al., 1999). Other small synthetic peptides derived from a p53-binding protein have been introduced to restore sequence-specific DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 (Friedler et al., 2002). The expense and complexity of synthesizing synthetic peptides and stability limitations have stimulated screening for small, easily synthesized molecules that have greater therapeutic potential. PRIMA (p53 reactivation and induction of massive apoptosis) is a small molecular weight molecule that provokes apoptosis in a transcription-dependent fashion through conformational manipulation of p53 mutants to restore sequence-specific DNA binding (Bykov et al., 2002). CP-31398 is another small synthetic molecule (Foster et al., 1999) with the capacity to restore wild-type p53 function (apoptosis or growth arrest induction) to mutants (Wang et al., 2003); however, exposure is also associated with the elevation of steady-state wild-type p53 to levels induced by DNA damage (Smith and Fornace, 2002; Takimoto et al., 2002). CP-31398 has been suggested to trigger apoptosis through the intrinsic Bax/mitochondrial/caspase-9 pathway (Luu et al., 2002), while additional responses involving increased DR5 cell surface exposure and reduction in p53-ubiquitination are also associated with this molecule (Wang et al., 2003)..

BID: a link between... p53-mediated abrogation of... p53-mediated cancer therapy Conclusion References   Deconstruction of p53-mediated apoptosis reveals an extensive network of signaling pathways triggered by p53 to ensure an appropriate response to a given stress. Intriguingly, p53 can intervene at every major step in apoptotic pathways: from extrinsic death receptor signaling, through the convergent pathway component Bid, to the intrinsic mitochondria pathways involving apoptosome formation, and culminating in direct caspase activation. Many of these effects are mediated through the activation of specific p53-target genes. In addition, p53 is able to activate apoptotic pathways by transcription-independent mechanisms (including direct shuttling of p53 to the mitochondrial membrane), more of which are likely to be unraveled in the future. Why is this complex apoptotic network required? One possible reason may be to ensure a rapid response. Another is that specific sets of target genes might be activated under a given set of conditions, in a stage-, tissue- and stimulus-specific manner. Alternatively, active p53 may induce the same set of target genes under different conditions, the specificity being determined by other cellular factors. Currently there are examples to support each of these options. Defining the effect of these variables on p53 transcriptional activity using genome-wide expression analysis may help to answer some of these fundamental questions. Such analyses are likely to shed new light on the determinants of the cellular decision between growth arrest and apoptosis..

We have now shown that inhibition of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription by -amanitin or RNA interference induced p53-dependent apoptosis. Inhibition of pol II-mediated transcription resulted in down-regulation of p21Cip1, which was caused by both transcriptional suppression and protein degradation, despite eliciting p53 accumulation, allowing the cells to progress into S phase and then to undergo apoptosis. This cell death did not require the transcription of p53 target genes and was preceded by translocation of the accumulated p53 to mitochondria.

Consistent with the data obtained by flow cytometry, -amanitin induced a substantially larger increase in the amount of cytoplasmic DNA fragments in p53+/+ HCT116 cells than in the p53-/- cells. Microscopic observation of HCT116 cells stained with PI also revealed that -amanitin induced a marked increase in the proportion of cells with fragmented chromatin (supplemental Fig. S2), a characteristic of apoptosis. Given that p53-/- HCT116 cells are resistant to -amanitin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1, A and B), we next examined whether restoration of p53 expression in these cells renders them sensitive to this effect of -amanitin. Adenovirus-mediated expression of p53, but not that of luciferase, indeed restored the sensitivity of p53-/- cells to -amanitin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S3), supporting the notion that p53 expression is required for this effect of -amanitin. In addition, the apoptosis induced by -amanitin was completely blocked by the presence of the caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fmk (Fig. 1D).

Adriamycin-induced Ser15 phosphorylation was apparent at 3 h, as was p53 accumulation; an increase in the extent of phosphorylation of Ser46 was not apparent until 6 h, consistent with the delay in the phosphorylation of this residue compared with that of Ser15 observed previously in adriamycin-treated cells (6).

Therefore, we next confirmed that p53-mediated apoptosis induced by -amanitin is independent of the transactivation activity of p53. With the use of semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis, we determined the amounts of mRNAs derived from various p53 target genes, including those for p21Cip1, Bax, Noxa, GADD45 (34), and p53DINP1 (35), in HCT116 cells treated with adriamycin or -amanitin for 24 h (Fig. 3). Whereas adriamycin increased the abundance of the mRNAs for all p53 target genes examined, -amanitin did not. The abundance of p53 mRNA was reduced by treatment of cells with -amanitin but not by exposure to adriamycin. Additionally, our time course experiments showed that the expression of these p53 target genes was not up-regulated in -amanitin-treated cells throughout the treatment period (data not shown).

With the use of semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis, we determined the amounts of mRNAs derived from various p53 target genes, including those for p21Cip1, Bax, Noxa, GADD45 (34), and p53DINP1 (35), in HCT116 cells treated with adriamycin or -amanitin for 24 h (Fig. 3). Whereas adriamycin increased the abundance of the mRNAs for all p53 target genes examined, -amanitin did not. The abundance of p53 mRNA was reduced by treatment of cells with -amanitin but not by exposure to adriamycin. Additionally, our time course experiments showed that the expression of these p53 target genes was not up-regulated in -amanitin-treated cells throughout the treatment period (data not shown). These data suggest that transcriptional blockade triggers a p53-dependent apoptosis that is not dependent upon p53-mediated changes in gene expression..

We therefore examined whether p53 molecules that accumulate in response to transcriptional blockade translocate to mitochondria. Confocal microscopic analysis was carried out by using MRC-5 human normal fibroblasts that have wild-type p53. MRC-5 cells are suitable for investigating the subcellular distribution of endogenous p53 because the cells have flat and large morphology and can be easily observed cytoplasmic structures. We also confirmed that -amanitin elicits p53 accumulation and apoptosis in MRC-5 cells (supplemental Fig. S5, A and B) as observed in HCT116 cells. Although p53 protein was detectable at a low level in the nuclei of untreated cells, it was present in increased amounts in -amanitin-treated cells and was localized to mitochondria in a substantial proportion of these cells (Fig. 4A). Cell fractionation experiments also demonstrate that p53 accumulated by -amanitin treatment is primarily detected in mitochondrial fractions, and those mitochondrial p53 molecules are phosphorylated on Ser15 and/or Ser46 (Fig. 4B). These findings thus suggest that p53 molecules that accumulate in response to transcriptional blockade translocate to the mitochondria, which may activate the apoptotic program..

Depletion of pol II LS by siRNA also increased the population of S phase cells in comparison to control siRNA treatment (Fig. 1A). Therefore, to investigate further the effect of -amanitin on cell cycle progression, HCT116 cells were first incubated with -amanitin or other reagents alone and then in the absence or presence of nocodazole, which induces cell cycle arrest in prometaphase through activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Consistent with previous observations (36), treatment of the cells with actinomycin D, which is an RNA polymerase I inhibitor, or adriamycin resulted in G1 or G2 arrest, respectively (Fig. 5A). In contrast, cells treated with -amanitin incorporated BrdUrd and accumulated predominantly in the S phase (61%); they neither arrested in G1 nor entered M phase regardless of whether or not they were exposed to nocodazole (Fig. 5, A and B). Whereas the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) was dephosphorylated in cells treated with adriamycin, it was highly phosphorylated in -amanitin-treated cells (Fig. 5C) as it was in cells exposed to a DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin, which induced S phase arrest. Furthermore, the abundance of ICBP90, a nuclear protein whose expression is down-regulated during DNA damage-induced G1 arrest (20), was not affected by treatment of HCT116 cells with -amanitin, whereas it was decreased by treatment with adriamycin or actinomycin D (Fig. 5D). Together, these findings suggest that cells exposed to -amanitin progress through the G1-S transition and arrest in S phase..
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	56	We next investigated the mechanism by which -amanitintreated cells are able to enter S phase even though they manifest accumulation of p53. DNA damage is known to induce expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21Cip1 via p53-dependent transactivation (25). p21Cip1 binds to and inhibits the activity of both PCNA and the complexes of CDK2 with cyclin A or cyclin E, thereby blocking progression of cells from G1 to S (37). Given that the levels of p21Cip1 protein and mRNA were down-regulated in both the -amanitin-treated cells and the siRNA-mediated pol II-depleted cells (Figs. 2C and 3 and supplemental Fig. S1), cells might be able to enter S phase despite p53 accumulation. To address this issue further, we monitored changes in the levels of p21Cip1 during cell cycle progression of the -amanitin-treated cells (Fig. 5E). HCT116 cells were synchronized at metaphase by nocodazole treatment and then released into fresh medium containing -amanitin or actinomycin D, the latter of which stabilizes p53, up-regulates p21Cip1 expression, and induces G1 arrest. The size of the G1 population was markedly reduced and that of the sub-G1 (apoptotic) population was increased for cells treated with -amanitin compared with the corresponding populations of cells treated with actinomycin D or those left untreated. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the amount of p21Cip1 protein was reduced in cells exposed to -amanitin, although it was markedly increased in response to actinomycin D (Fig. 5E)..

The decrease in the amount of p21Cip1 induced by -amanitin was prevented by MG132 (Fig. 5F), indicating that p21Cip1 undergoes ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in response to -amanitin.

We therefore investigated whether cells treated with -amanitin undergo apoptosis as they enter S phase. HCT116 cells were synchronized at G0-G1 by serum deprivation and then re-exposed to serum in the absence or presence of -amanitin (Fig. 6A). Cells treated with -amanitin exhibited a marked delay in progression through S phase compared with control cells. In addition, treatment with -amanitin resulted in a large increase in the number of cells positive for M30 CytoDeath antibody, which recognizes a specific caspase cleavage product of cytokeratin 18 and can be a marker of early apoptosis, at the time (24 h after release) when the cells began to accumulate in S phase (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, this apoptotic marker was detected in the -amanitin-treated cells during early S phase but not at G2-M phase, suggesting that -amanitin induces p53-dependent apoptosis as cells enter S phase. This notion is further supported by the immunocyto-chemical finding that -amanitin-treated cells in which p53 was localized to mitochondria preferentially incorporate BrdUrd, indicating that they had entered S phase (Fig. 6B)..

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	75	Inhibition of pol II by -Amanitin Induces p53 Accumulation and p53-dependent Apoptosis Apoptosis induced by -amanitin was markedly greater in extent in p53+/+ HCT116 cells than in the corresponding p53-/- cells and was blocked in the presence of a caspase inhibitor, indicating that transcriptional blockade induces p53-dependent, caspase-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, this notion was supported by the finding that the -amanitin-resistant p53-/- cells underwent apoptosis by expression of exogenous p53. The accumulation of p53 appeared to be attributable to inhibition of p53 degradation, given that the amount of p53 mRNA was actually reduced by -amanitin treatment. These findings are consistent with previous results (43), showing that the accumulation of p53 induced by inhibition of pol II-dependent transcription results from down-regulation of MDM2 gene transcription. Therefore, in addition to the MDM2 down-regulation-mediated pathway, signaling triggered by modification of p53 protein may contribute to p53 accumulation. In fact, we also found that -amanitin induces p53 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of p53, which is mediated by various stress-activated kinases (44), contributes to the stabilization and activation of the protein. The DNA-damaging agent adriamycin induced the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15, which is reportedly mediated by the kinase ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (45) and results in p53 accumulation, before that on Ser46. In contrast, -amanitin induced p53 phosphorylation on Ser46 before the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15, and the former reaction coincided with the accumulation of p53. Transcriptional blockade by -amanitin might thus result in the activation of stress-activated kinases that are distinct from those activated by DNA-damaging agents and that phosphorylate and thereby stabilize p53. Indeed, caffeine, an inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase and ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, did not inhibit -amanitin-induced p53 phosphorylation and accumulation,2 suggesting that these kinases do not contribute to the effects of -amanitin. We also found that transcriptional blockade did not activate the Chk1 (supplemental Fig. S7). Furthermore, -amanitin did not induce p53 accumulation in M059J cells (46), which are deficient in the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (supplemental Fig. S8), suggesting a possible role for DNA-dependent protein kinases in the phosphorylation of p53 in response to transcriptional blockade in the absence of DNA damage..
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	76	Inhibition of pol II by -Amanitin Induces p53 Accumulation and p53-dependent Apoptosis Apoptosis induced by -amanitin was markedly greater in extent in p53+/+ HCT116 cells than in the corresponding p53-/- cells and was blocked in the presence of a caspase inhibitor, indicating that transcriptional blockade induces p53-dependent, caspase-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, this notion was supported by the finding that the -amanitin-resistant p53-/- cells underwent apoptosis by expression of exogenous p53. The accumulation of p53 appeared to be attributable to inhibition of p53 degradation, given that the amount of p53 mRNA was actually reduced by -amanitin treatment. These findings are consistent with previous results (43), showing that the accumulation of p53 induced by inhibition of pol II-dependent transcription results from down-regulation of MDM2 gene transcription. Therefore, in addition to the MDM2 down-regulation-mediated pathway, signaling triggered by modification of p53 protein may contribute to p53 accumulation. In fact, we also found that -amanitin induces p53 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of p53, which is mediated by various stress-activated kinases (44), contributes to the stabilization and activation of the protein. The DNA-damaging agent adriamycin induced the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15, which is reportedly mediated by the kinase ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (45) and results in p53 accumulation, before that on Ser46. In contrast, -amanitin induced p53 phosphorylation on Ser46 before the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15, and the former reaction coincided with the accumulation of p53. Transcriptional blockade by -amanitin might thus result in the activation of stress-activated kinases that are distinct from those activated by DNA-damaging agents and that phosphorylate and thereby stabilize p53. Indeed, caffeine, an inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase and ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, did not inhibit -amanitin-induced p53 phosphorylation and accumulation,2 suggesting that these kinases do not contribute to the effects of -amanitin. We also found that transcriptional blockade did not activate the Chk1 (supplemental Fig. S7). Furthermore, -amanitin did not induce p53 accumulation in M059J cells (46), which are deficient in the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (supplemental Fig. S8), suggesting a possible role for DNA-dependent protein kinases in the phosphorylation of p53 in response to transcriptional blockade in the absence of DNA damage..

However, we found that the expression of p21Cip1 was down-regulated by -amanitin as a result of both suppression of gene transcription and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. The -amanitin-treated cells were thus prevented from arresting at G1 phase. In addition, we found that the abundance of p27Kip1, another CDK2 inhibitor, was also down-regulated by -amanitin treatment in HCT116 and MRC-5 cells (supplemental Fig. S9). Thus, despite the fact that they accumulate p53, cells treated with -amanitin proceed to S phase, as confirmed by the status of pRb phosphorylation, flow cytometric analysis of DNA content, and BrdUrd incorporation. The down-regulation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 might possibly be due to cleavage by the CPP32-like caspase during apoptosis (47). However, the abundance of p21Cip1 in -amanitin-treated HCT116 cells was reduced prior to the appearance of the apoptotic phenotype (Fig. 2C). Moreover, Skp2, which is a subunit of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein ubiquitin ligase that controls the proteolysis of p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 (48-50), was up-regulated in -amanitin-treated HCT116 cells (supplemental Fig. S10), suggesting that signaling activated by transcriptional blockade results in the activation of Skp2, which then mediates the down-regulation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1..

A fraction of accumulated p53 molecules also translocates to the mitochondria and thereby promotes apoptosis in cells with DNA damage (15). The p53 protein directly induces permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane by forming complexes with the protective proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, resulting in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. It has also been shown to activate and to induce the translocation of Bax to mitochondria, again resulting in cytochrome c release (54). However, specific cellular contexts that trigger the transcription-independent translocation of p53 to mitochondria remain obscure.

Indeed, we found that high dose UV radiation induced pol II degradation, p53 accumulation, down-regulation of p21Cip1 expression, and p53-dependent apoptosis, similar to the effects of -amanitin treatment. UV irradiation was shown previously to induce transcription of the c-jun gene and to modulate the association of p53 with the promoter of the p21Cip1 gene, resulting in repression of p21Cip1 gene activation and cell death (55). Therefore, in addition to the c-Jun-mediated pathway, signaling triggered by transcriptional blockade at the sites of unrepaired DNA lesions may contribute to UV-induced apoptosis by a p53-dependent pathway..

0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	5	The current model for p53 function as a tumour suppressor is that the protein acts as a highly regulated transcription factor. Normally p53 is a very unstable protein and is present only in minute concentrations in the cell. Even these small amounts of p53 are not fully active as a transcription factor, because the negative regulator protein, Mdm2, binds them. When cells are exposed to a wide variety of aberrant growth signals, the p53 protein is activated and stabilized and triggers the expression of downstream genes such as p21 that trigger cell cycle arrest, or Puma that triggers apoptosis. This response is potentially lethal since mice that have p53 but lack Mdm2 die very early in development at the pre-implantation stage (3,4). The response is vital to control tumour growth as mice that lack p53 develop spontaneous early onset malignancies (5). More recently however another aspect of p53 regulation has emerged. In two mouse models where p53 activity is modulated and increased by the expression of an N-terminally truncated form of the protein, accelerated aging phenotypes are seen (6 to 8). Thus, the p53 response needs to be very finely controlled in order to provide adequate tumour suppression without promoting accelerated aging..

0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	7	Haploinsufficiency Genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated a rich variety of genes and pathways that act to control p53 function and thresholds. These must act in concert to precisely control the activity of p53. These pathways are nearly always disrupted in cancer cells that need to avoid the full p53 response if they are to grow and survive. Genetic studies have helped to clarify the importance of key players in this pathway and also suggested suitable points for therapeutic intervention. The huge number of biochemical and cell biological studies on the p53 protein can be hard to evaluate but the genetic models provide an increasingly firm basis on which to build a core understanding of the p53 pathway. Studies of the responses of heterozygote wild-type over null mice (p53+/ to ) have demonstrated unequivocally that the p53 locus does not obey Knudsen's two hit hypothesis. Instead there is clear evidence of haploinsufficiency at the locus. Thus, cells that contain a single copy of the p53 gene as opposed to two copies show an impaired response to radiation-induced apoptosis and tumours that arise in these mice quite frequently retain the wild-type allele (9). This also seems to occur in the tumours of individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome where not all tumours show loss of the single wild-type parental allele. This implies that the regulation of the p53 system is exceptionally tightly controlled and that gene dosage and transcription is a critical method by which the p53 threshold is set..

0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	9	Implications of a hypomorphic Mdm2 allele Further support for the tight control of the p53 system emerges from elegant studies on a mouse model that carries a hypomorphic allele of the Mdm2 gene (10 to 12). The Mdm2 protein binds to p53 and targets it for degradation by acting as a ubiquitin E3 ligase that results in the specific ubiquitination of p53. In mice that are +/ to  at the mdm2 locus no phenotype is evident but in mice that express a slightly lower level of Mdm2 from a single hypomorphic allele thymic ablation, poor weight gain and bone marrow and intestinal cell loss are evident. All of these phenotypes are dependant on wild-type p53 and do not require any exogenous signal. The data strongly suggest that p53 is always active in these target tissues and that Mdm2 is a rate limiting negative regulator normally expressed at roughly three times the level needed to repress p53 function. The fact that the inactivation of the Mdm2 related gene Mdmx (or Mdm4) (13) also gives a p53 dependant early embryonic lethal phenotype has implied that this less well studied gene also must be critical in controlling p53 and that it cannot be compensated for by Mdm2..

0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	11	The p19Arf locus and other regulators of p53 Other genes that control p53 function have also been verified by genetic analysis and the upstream genes ATM and CHK2 clearly act to regulate p53 response, as does the negative regulator of Mdm2 p19Arf. Fascinatingly while p19Arf acts as a critical activator of p53 that suppresses tumour genesis it does not alter the phenotype of the Mdm2 hypomorphic mice (11). This implies that the normal regulation of p53 is not modulated by p19Arf but that the p19Arf control pathway is activated by early events in the tumorigenic process. Other genes that modulate wild-type p53 function are fragments of p53 and mutant p53 s. Most point mutations in p53 that inactivate its function can also act as dominant negative mutants and are thus seen to act as oncogenes in transgenic mouse models. The affect of the two N-terminal truncations that promote aging is subtler however as they seem to activate wild-type function but perhaps act selectively to promote p53 function at some but not all p53 responsive promoters. Finally, the two p53 related genes p63 and p73 could also modulate p53 responses in vivo (14). Recently, further study of the ubiquitin pathway has identified two new E3 s for p53 the Cop1 (15) and Pirh2 (16) proteins. Thus, negative regulation of p53 seems to occur through at least four E3 or E3-like proteins (COP1, Pirh2, Mdm2, Mdm4) and three of these, Cop1, Pirh2 and Mdm2, are p53-induced genes. This creates a very complex and responsive control circuit able to fine-tune the p53 response. Another new gene that also looks as though it may be a powerful modulator of the response is the deubiquitinating enzyme HAUSP (17 to 19). Again genetic studies using knock in mice have established that p53 must have an intact N-terminal transactivation domain to function as a tumour suppressor as the knock in mouse that expresses a p53 mutant at amino acids 25 and 26 (20) is no longer able to suppress tumorigenesis and in fact, despite expressing high levels of the mutant p53 protein, has an identical phenotype to a p53 null mouse. While a very large number of genes have been identified as potential down stream targets of p53 activation or suppression only three have been established as being of critical importance in vivo these are the pro-apoptotic genes Noxa and Puma (21,22) and the cell cycle regulatory CDK inhibitor p21. While knock out of these downstream response genes has a clear affect on the phenotype of the p53 dependant DNA damage response none of the knock out mice have the dramatic tumour prone phenotype of the p53 null mice..

Thus, we can expect both coding and non-coding polymorphisms at these multiple control loci to be segregating in the population.

0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	16	Mutation in p53 The most common route by which the p53 pathway is inactivated in human cancers is by mutation in the coding region of the p53 gene. These mutations have been extensively catalogued and have provided a powerful database in examining mutational spectra compared with predicted environmental causes of cancer in man. The mutations occur at many sites within the gene but the most common class of mutation is a point mis-sense mutation in the central DNA binding domain of the protein. These mutant proteins can accumulate to high levels in tumour cells where they are readily detected by antibody staining. The mutations act as dominant negative mutations as the full-length mutant protein will form mixed inactive oligomers with the wild-type protein. All of the mutants seem to be defective as transcription factors, which has formed the basis for yeast based functional assay for mutant p53 detection. Structural and physical biochemical studies of the mutant proteins has helped to promote some understanding as to why mutations at so many different locations in the protein can all inactivate its function. The current model would suggest that the core DNA binding domain of p53 is only just stable at body temperature, thus very small structural alterations are sufficient to destabilize the protein completely. This is consistent with the finding that many of the mutant p53 proteins are temperature sensitive and if expressed at lower temperature can regain p53 wild-type activity. It also helps to explain how antibodies to epitopes within the folded core of the protein are exposed by many different p53 mutations (23 to 28). As will be discussed later this property of instability may allow the development of novel mutant p53 reactivating compounds. Why should p53 be so unstable? It is reasonable to suppose that this property may allow its rapid breakdown and close regulation as it would be more difficult to switch off a very stable protein. Our knowledge of the affects of p53 mutations is still incomplete however. In some systems the mutant proteins appeared to have gained new functions beyond that of simply acting as dominant negative p53 mutants and other models make it clear that while p53 is often described as having a domain structure these domains do have a strong interconnection with each other. Thus, a small mutation in the N-terminal domain of p53 can cause the second site reversion of a temperature sensitive mutation in the DNA binding core of the protein (29). The accumulation of mutant p53 proteins in cancer cells is not yet understood. An attractive model is that the loss of p53 transcription reduces the level of the E3 ligases so that p53 accumulates. However, other mechanisms may be at play, because in a knock in mouse model that expresses a mutant p53 protein in all tissues, p53 protein accumulation seems only to occur in cancer cells (T.Jacks, personal communication)..

One route is by inactivation of upstream signalling pathways; thus, CHK2 mutations have been reported in breast cancers, tumours arise in patients with ATM, loss of p19Arf expression is common in many cancers and amplification and over-expression of Mdm2 may occur in up to 9% of cancers. In cervical cancers the expression of the HPV E6 protein inactivates p53 and it is probable that as more components of the p53 response pathway are uncovered that it will be possible to see many new ways that the pathway is abrogated. The role of COP1 Pirh2 and HAUSP for example has yet to be determined. Overexpression of survival signals and of anti-apototic proteins can also help tumour cells to evade p53 activity..

Many current treatments trigger the p53 response in normal and tumour tissue and a critical question has been whether or not the p53 status of a tumour affects the chance of a response to treatment. While in animal models dramatic affects can be seen with p53 wild-type tumours responding much better to chemotherapeutic drugs, the data obtained with human material is less clear cut. This reflects the genetic complexity of human cancer, the technical difficulties of working with patient samples and the possibility that many  wild-type  p53 tumours may have other defects in the pathway. More encouraging perhaps has been the discovery and development of therapies based on the understanding of the p53 pathway..

Animal models Models of tumourigenesis p53 in the clinic Regulation of p53 function p53-based therapies p53 the future References   In 1992, when David Lane described p53 as  Guardian of the Genome  (1), he established a paradigm embodying p53 as a tumour suppressor. In essence, p53 was a DNA damage sensor that acted to prevent the accumulation of genetic lesions that might contribute to tumourigenesis. This model could not only explain the role of p53 in cell-cycle control and apoptosis but also the stabilization of p53 after exposure to UV radiation and other DNA damaging agents, and the need for p53 function to be compromised during tumourigenesis. Indeed, it seemed like the  p53 story  might be solved soon after that time. The intervening years, however, have clearly demonstrated that this was a naive expectation. We now know that the role of p53 extends to participation in a diverse array of signalling pathways associated with cellular stress and DNA damage (Figure 1), and recent studies have even raised the possibility that p53 may be involved in pathways that have little to do with cancer..

Animal models Models of tumourigenesis p53 in the clinic Regulation of p53 function p53-based therapies p53 the future References   New isoforms After 25 years working with a gene we thought encoded a single protein, a novel discovery that will probably have important ramifications on much of the p53 field, was the identification of several new alternatively spliced isoforms of human p53. This was reported by J.-C.Bourdon and D.Lane (Dundee, Scotland). Using a technique to ensure that only full-length, capped p53 mRNA molecules were analysed, they identified numerous start sites for transcription: two mRNA species initiated from different start sites in exon 1 (P1 and P1'), and one mRNA was derived from a promoter (P2) within intron 4. Primers based in exon 11, also identified three splice variants of exon 9. Thus, p53 now has a total of 12 possible mRNAs and 9 proteins. Although it is still the early days, it is clear that the isoforms show different patterns of expression within tissues and cell lines. A key area of investigation will be to determine how these isoforms function. Interestingly, one isoform, Np53, is a dominant negative inhibitor of wild-type (wt) p53 in transactivation and apoptosis assays, as has been reported for an N-terminal truncation of p73, a relative of p53. Some of the isoforms of p53 are abundantly expressed in tumours, suggesting a possible role in carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the existence of dominant negative isoforms provides an explanation for an impaired p53 response in the absence of coding region mutations..

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	19	Post-translational modifications phosphorylation S.-Y.Shieh (Taipei, Taiwan) addressed the role of the checkpoint kinases, Chk1 and Chk2, in p53 regulation. She showed that in addition to phosphorylation of known N-terminal residues, phosphorylation on ser313, ser314, thr377 and ser378 were also found. Furthermore, downregulation of Chk1 and Chk2 not only reduced the phosphorylation of ser20 as expected but also reduced the acetylation of lys382, leading to poor induction of the CDKN1A gene encoding the cyclin inhibitory protein p21WAF1/CIP1. The data suggest that Chk1 and Chk2 may regulate p53 function in several ways and not just by N-terminal phosphorylation. Such data serve to emphasize the importance of the C-terminus in regulating p53 function, a theme that was repeated throughout the meeting. In addition, it is interesting to note that germline mutations of Chk2 have been found in some Li Fraumeni families that have wt TP53. Further evidence for the apparent complexity in Chk2 regulation of p53 function was provided by Y.Haupt (Jerusalem, Israel). Specific mutation of pro82 prevented binding of Chk2 and Chk2-dependent phosphorylation of ser20 after DNA damage. In his attempts to identify the functional relevance of this aspect, Haupt looked at the role of Pin-1 in facilitating the Chk2 modulation of p53. Previous studies had shown that activation and stabilization of p53 by Pin-1 requires specific phosphorylation of p53 on ser33, tyr81 and tyr150. Experiments in Pin1 to / to  mouse fibroblasts were used to show that Pin-1 is also essential for phosphorylation at ser23 in mouse p53 (equivalent of ser20 in human p53) and stabilization of p53. Haupt also showed that Pin-1 enhances formation of Chk2/p53 complexes early after DNA damage and requires pro82. He therefore proposed a model in which p53 phosphorylation at specific residues permits binding of Pin-1, which then alters the conformation of p53 to allow binding of Chk2. Chk2 then phosphorylates ser20, thus releasing p53 from Mdm-2 and stabilizing/activating p53. A similar conclusion with respect to phosphorylation and the role of Pin-1 in regulating the interaction between p53 and Mdm-2, was reached by G.Del Sal (Trieste, Italy)..
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	20	However, C.Prives (New York, USA) was unable to demonstrate any N-terminal phosphorylation of mouse p53 by Chk2 after DNA damage, and downregulation of Chk1 and Chk2 by siRNA failed to affect p53 function before or after DNA damage. Further, questioning the importance of phosphorylation in regulating p53 function, L.Giono (from J.Manfredi's group, New York, USA), using an artificial system involving tetracycline-regulated p53 expression and therefore not involving DNA damage, reported that p53 is not phosphorylated on ser6 and only poorly phosphorylated on ser15 and ser37 and yet binds DNA very efficiently, at least to the p53 response element in the CDKN1A promoter. Furthermore, using proteosome inhibitors to elevate p53 levels, she showed that DNA binding, either in vitro or in vivo was not affected by the absence of phosphorylation on ser15 and ser392, and no acetylation at lys382. So, if post-translational modifications are not required for p53 activity, what are they required for? A probable answer is that p53 may carry out many functions once it has reached a threshold concentration. It may need to be  told  to activate a specific promoter by processes, such as phosphorylation or acetylation or by interacting proteins. For example, A.Braithwaite (Dunedin, NZ) also failed to observe phosphorylation on N-terminal residues using hormone inducible p53, but still obtained activation of the CDKN1A and MDM-2 promoters. However, no induction of the NOXA or BAX promoters was observed..
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	21	Some support for the idea that phosphorylation on specific residues controls p53 specificity, at least in part, came from the presentation by S.Soddu (Rome, Italy). Phosphorylation on ser46 is known to be important for p53 to induce apoptosis, at least in some instances, yet the kinase responsible for ser46 phosphorylation is unknown. The data from Soddu's work suggested that the enzyme could be HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting kinase 2), a member of a novel ser/thr kinase family. Her studies were initiated by an observation that thyroid papillary tumours (TPA) have wt p53 and yet high levels of the anti-apoptotic protein galectin-3, expression of which is normally repressed by wt p53. Soddu showed that these tumours have allelic loss on chr7q32 to 34, which encompasses the HIPK2 gene locus and that wt p53 can only repress galectin-3, when HIPK2 is present. So, HIPK2 activates an apoptotic pathway that involves phosphorylation of p53 on ser46 and inhibition of the p53-mediated repression of galectin-3..
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	22	Ubiquitination, Mdm-2 and the control of p53 stability It seems clear from the above discussion that much of the activity of p53 is dependent on its concentration (also discussed later). Thus, it is not only post-translational modifications, but also the level of p53 that must be regulated precisely. In a comprehensive analysis of enzymes required for ubiquitination of p53, D.Lane (Dundee, Scotland) identified UbcH5B/C as an E2-like protein involved in controlling the levels of p53 and Mdm-2. Knockdown of UbcH5B/C increased levels of p53, but this p53 was transcriptionally inactive being still bound to Mdm-2, which is also modified by UbcH5B/C. Activation of the stabilized p53 thus requires the removal of bound Mdm-2. These results in conjunction with the recent discovery that both p53 and Mdm-2 can be modified by the ubiquitin-like NEDD8, a well-characterized regulator of p27kip1 and IB levels, demonstrate that there are now at least two pathways resulting in ubiquitination and inactivation of p53. Both pathways involve Mdm-2 in a two-step stabilization and subsequent inactivation of p53: the NEDD pathway and UbcH5B/C that ubiquitinate both p53 and Mdm-2. Understanding of this new complexity for p53 regulation has important implications for the design and use of therapeutic modulators of the p53/Mdm-2 interaction. In addition, work presented by M.Rossi (G.Melino's group, Leicester, UK) showed that both p63 and p73 are also subject to tight control by ubiquitin-like degradation processes. He reported on the discovery of a new NEDD-like E3 ligase called Aip4/Itch that downregulates p73 upon DNA damage..

Thus, it is not only post-translational modifications, but also the level of p53 that must be regulated precisely. In a comprehensive analysis of enzymes required for ubiquitination of p53, D.Lane (Dundee, Scotland) identified UbcH5B/C as an E2-like protein involved in controlling the levels of p53 and Mdm-2. Knockdown of UbcH5B/C increased levels of p53, but this p53 was transcriptionally inactive being still bound to Mdm-2, which is also modified by UbcH5B/C. Activation of the stabilized p53 thus requires the removal of bound Mdm-2.

This means that phosphorylation of ser15 does not always equate to  active  p53 protein. During this time however, p53 becomes much more stable, as Mdm-2 becomes unstable. Proteosome inhibitors (to block Mdm-2 degradation) inhibited the transactivation function of p53 in this system, suggesting that the decrease in Mdm-2 stability contributed to p53 activation. Thus, if there is sufficient DNA damage, Mdm-2 stability is reduced and p53 becomes activated without a requirement for phosphorylation. These data provide a possible explanation for how p53 can be functional in the absence of N-terminal phosphorylation and also in p53 mutants lacking conserved serine and threonine residues (see above). Thus, once again p53 level may be the critical determiner of function..

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	30	Y.Taya (Tokyo, Japan) reported that the cytoplasmic protein, clathrin, which normally plays a role in the formation of  coated pits  in vesicle transport, binds p53 and influences its function. He reported that clathrin binds the N-terminus and to the S46F mutant in particular. Interestingly, phosphorylation of this residue is reported to be important for the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis (see data reported by Soddu). He went on to show by transfection and reporter assays, that clathrin enhanced p53-dependent activation of apoptosis inducing protein 1 (AIP1) and other p53-dependent promoters, which was particularly marked for the S46F mutant. In addition, RNAi studies showed that downregulation of clathrin partially ablated the ability of p53 to transactivate several target genes after UV exposure..
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	31	Binding of p53 by the Y-box factor, YB1, was reported by A.Braithwaite. YB1 binds the C-terminus of p53 and like clathrin, is generally located in the cytoplasm. YB1 translocates to the nucleus in response to various stresses and regulates transcription of several tumour-associated genes. In tumours, nuclear localization and over-expression of YB1 are associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis. Braithwaite showed that YB1 requires a transcriptionally active p53 for translocation and does not appear to require direct binding. Once in the nucleus, he showed that YB1 partially inhibits p53 activity. Genes such as BAX and NOXA involved in apoptosis were inhibited by YB1, but CDKN1A and MDM-2 were not inhibited. However, knockdown of YB1 with antisense oligonucleotides increased NOXA expression in a p53-dependent manner. Braithwaite proposed that YB1 reduces the ability of p53 to bind target promoters of low affinity, such as those in the apoptotic pathway, and that this partial inhibition of p53 function may contribute to cancer formation..

In this sense it is an important regulator of p53 function and is often over-expressed in common human cancers, such as prostate and breast.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	34	X.Lu (London, UK) expanded her work on the pro-apoptotic ASPP (so-called because they comprise Ankrin repeats, SH3 domains and a Poly Proline domain) proteins and their effect on p53 function. The ankyrin repeats bind p53 within the N-terminus. It is of interest to note that, the polymorphism arg72 binds ASPP to a lesser extent than pro72. When ASPP proteins bind p53, they augment the ability of p53 to transactivate pro-apoptotic genes, but have no effect on the ability of p53 to transactivate cell-cycle genes. Although data were presented showing a similar selective influence by ASPP proteins for p73 and p63, much of the talk was focused on the regulation of ASPP function. Biochemical studies showed that ASPP1 is a substrate for MAP-kinase (MAPK), and that both ASPP1 and ASPP2 are stabilized by MAPK. Interestingly, RNAi downregulation of ras, inhibited ASPP1 and ASPP2 mediated p53-dependent apoptosis, demonstrating that ASPP proteins link p53-dependent apoptosis to a ras-signalling pathway. In studies looking at transcriptional regulation of ASPP1 and ASPP2, they found binding motifs for E2F-3 (ASPP1, 4; ASPP2, 2 common to ASPP1) in both promoters. That E2F-1 could bind these motifs was confirmed by in vivo (chromatin immunoprecipitation, ChIP) and in vitro (reporter) assays. E2F-3 was also shown to activate both promoters. However, only E2F-1 and E2F-2 can strongly activate the ASPP2 promoter. Transfection of E2F-1 was able to induce ASPP1 and ASPP2 mRNA, leading to a proposal that induction of ASPP1 and ASPP2 by E2F-1 might sensitize cells to apoptosis..

Using cells derived from TGFss1 knockout mice, she found that radiation induced p53-dependent growth arrest and apoptosis were defective. The defect was associated with an absence of ser15 phosphorylation but no overall change in p53 levels was observed and there was also no direct interaction between TGFss and p53. In addition, studies with small molecule inhibitors of TGFss signalling led to a similar conclusion that TGFss is a regulator of the p53 DNA damage response. Additional evidence of a link between the TGFss and p53 pathways, was provided by M.Agarwal (Cleveland, USA) who showed that TGFss mediates a p53-dependent protective cell-cycle arrest in response to dNTP imbalance..

Animal models Models of tumourigenesis p53 in the clinic Regulation of p53 function p53-based therapies p53 the future References   It is becoming increasingly clear that the regulation of p53-dependent apoptosis is complex. In simple terms, the process can be divided into three parts: (i) what tells p53 to induce apoptosis, (ii) what mechanisms are involved and (iii) what the downstream effectors are. The first part has been dealt with above and often involves post-translational modifications and/or interactions with other proteins. This session of the meeting dealt principally with the latter two components..
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	37	For many years it was thought that, like induction of cell-cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis by p53 was due solely to the transactivation of pro-apoptotic genes. However, transactivation-independent apoptosis does occur in some cells. This area has been pioneered by U.Moll (New York, USA) who believes that p53 induces mitochondrial apoptosis directly. In support of this, she showed convincing evidence of p53 associating with mitochondria. This association occurred only during p53-dependent apoptosis and in radiosensitive tissues, such as spleen and thymus, and was earlier to transactivation. She also showed that p53 binds the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl to 2 and Bcl-xL. Using modelling techniques she predicted that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL would bind p53 within the central, specific DNA-binding domain. Using the classic cytochrome C (cyt C) release assay, she showed that tumour-derived mutants of p53 are defective for binding Bcl-xL and prevent cyt C release from mitochondria. M.Murphy (Philadelphia, USA) provided independent evidence that certain p53 mutants (those that cannot oligomerize) fail to bind Bak and as a consequence are defective for p53-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis. These data suggest that tumour-derived mutants have a double-hit, i.e. they cannot induce mitochondrial death and are transcriptionally inactive too!.

During apoptosis, pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family act to permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membranes, without a requirement for the inner membranes or mitochondrial proteins. As a result, cyt C is released in a manner that is sudden, rapid and complete. Using this system, he looked at induction of apoptosis by p53 in intact cells and cytoplasts and concluded that the nucleus is dispensable for apoptosis! To further look at the function of endogenous p53 in apoptosis, he purified native p53 from various cell lines after UV treatment, as well as several p53 mutants including Pro (deleted the polyproline domain between residues 62 and 92) and examined their interaction with Bcl-2 family proteins and their ability to induce cyt C release. Based on these studies, he proposed a model whereby after stabilization, p53 accumulates in the cytoplasm but is held  inactive  by Bcl-xL. Nuclear p53 then activates BAX and PUMA transcription. Puma accumulates in the cytoplasm and p53 is liberated from Bcl-xL by Puma. Bax can then be activated by p53, cyt C is released and cell death occurs..

Thymocytes from NOXA  to / to  mice died after radiation or exposure to various DNA damaging agents but similar cells from PUMA to / to  mice were resistant. Fibroblasts from PUMA to / to  mice were also much more resistant to apoptosis compared with NOXA to / to  fibroblasts. He concluded that neither NOXA nor PUMA were required for normal development, but that PUMA and to a lesser extent, NOXA, were involved in mediating p53-dependent apoptosis, although tissue differences were noted. Interestingly, he also showed that loss of PUMA protected cells from diverse p53-independent cytotoxics, such as staurosporine, glucocortocids, phorbol ester and cytokine withdrawal, suggesting that PUMA is not specific to p53 pathways. By crossing PUMA to / to  and +/ to  mice with E micro-myc mice, they found that loss of PUMA accelerated tumour growth, consistent with its role as a tumour suppressor.

Animal models Models of tumourigenesis p53 in the clinic Regulation of p53 function p53-based therapies p53 the future References   Although not required for DNA repair, p53 facilitates nucleotide excision repair (global and transcription coupled repair) and base excision repair. C.Harris (Bethesda, MD, USA) and L.Wiesmuller (Ulm, Germany) both extended the role of p53 in DNA repair to the repair of DNA damage occurring during replication stress. Harris presented evidence that p53 is downstream of ATR kinase, Chk-1 kinase, 53BP1. BLM helicase in response to Holliday junctions (HJ) and other replication intermediates, enhances the endonuclease activity of Mus81, a candidate resolvase of HJs, and functions as a  governor  of excessive rates of homologous recombination. Wiesmuller also presented data indicating that p53 restrains Rad51-dependent DNA exchange events involving imperfectly homologous sequences. p53 may also contribute to recombinative repair, when it is recruited to specific repair complexes by molecular interactions with topoisomerase I and other binding partners. These and other studies further establish the transcription independent and dependent mutifunctionality of p53 in the DNA damage and repair response..

Animal models Models of tumourigenesis p53 in the clinic Regulation of p53 function p53-based therapies p53 the future References   Tumour-derived p53 mutations are almost always missense mutations and heterozygous, with gene disruptions being very rare. In addition, the spectrum of tumours seen in p53 knockout mice is quite different to that seen in humans, including in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. These observations combined with a considerable body of in vitro data, have led to the conclusion that p53 mutants have some  gain-of-function  in tumourigenesis, a notion supported in a presentation from M.Oren (Rehovot, Israel) showing that mutant p53 can specifically regulate the expression of CD95, EGR1 and MSP, resulting in an inhibition of apoptosis. This issue of  gain-of-function  is also being explored in vivo using conditional  knock-in  mutations in mice. Using this approach, K.Olive from the group of T.Jacks (Cambridge, MA, USA) and T.Iwakuma from G.Lozano's group (Houston, USA) reported the results of studies analysing the function of mR172H (hR175H; a structural mutant) and mR270H (hR273H; DNA contact mutant; Olive only). They generated mutant/wt, mutant/null and wt/null mice but saw no significant difference in overall survival. However, the tumour spectra were very different. Mice with mutant p53 had significantly more carcinomas, brain tumours and endothelial tumours (R175H only), whereas mice with both mutant p53 and R175H showed decreased haematological tumours. Importantly, there were also novel tumours in mutant/null mice. They concluded that different p53 mutants do exhibit a clear gain-of-function and different mutants can have different effects that may be tissue specific..
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	45	L.Attardi (Palo Alto, USA) used a similar approach, but rather than using tumour mutants she examined the importance of p53 transactivation function in vivo, by generating knock-in mice with a p53 gene mutated at residues 25 and 26 to abolish transactivation and Mdm-2 binding. By looking at various p53 parameters in fibroblasts derived from these mice, she confirmed that the mutant is markedly defective for gene activation under most conditions used, and also defective for cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, there were some treatment-specific differences. For example, the mutation could induce BAX expression after DNA damage, but was completely defective for induction of CDKN1A or NOXA. Interestingly, she was unable to obtain homozygous mutant mice owing to embryonic lethality. These data suggest that transcriptionally competent p53 is required for normal embryogenesis, yet paradoxically, mice that are deleted for TP53 generally develop in a normal fashion, although a significant proportion of female TP53 null mice show ex-encephaly. Attardi's mutant mice therefore may have some gain-of-function that has yet to be described..

As indicated elsewhere in this review, modifications to these residues are thought to be important in dictating the nature of the p53 response to DNA damage. Wahl showed however that these mice and cells derived from them, behaved essentially as cells with wt p53. Thus, once again we have this conflict as to how critical post-translational modifications are for p53 function..

Furthermore, induction of SWAP p53 after ionizing radiation did not induce apoptosis in the thymus and spleen and even more surprisingly, in crosses with E micro-myc mice, SWAP p53 did not prevent rapid onset of tumourigenesis. Thus, although the approach is novel, as SWAP p53 behaves very differently from expectations, its merits are unclear..

Animal models Models of tumourigenesis p53 in the clinic Regulation of p53 function p53-based therapies p53 the future References   The role of p53 in tumourigenesis was explored in cell culture and in animal systems by several groups. Both V.Rotter (Rehovot, Israel) and T.Tlsty (San Francisco, USA) have been looking at genetic changes that occur in primary cells as they progress from initial culture, through immortalization and eventually to tumourigenesis. In Rotter's study, primary fibroblasts were transfected with a retrovirus expressing hTERT to induce immortalization, followed by a mutant p53 and/or Ha-Ras to induce a tumourigenic phenotype. At each stage, expression microarray was performed. Based on changes in gene expression, she concluded that the initial slow-to-fast growth stage was associated with the loss of INK4A expression and reflects a defect in differentiation; the loss of p53 leads to continued proliferation and genomic instability, and fully transformed cells have characteristics that permit in vivo tumour growth. The details of this will no doubt be unveiled at the next meeting!.

When HMEC (normal p16INK4A) and vHMEC (silenced p16INK4A) were further examined, it was noted that the levels of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 were high in vHMEC, but very low in HMEC. Biochemical studies indicated that p16INK4A might be regulating p53 stability. This reciprocal relationship between p16INK4A and p53 expressions, however, was not true of fibroblasts.

Continuous exposure to TPA then leads to mutation of p53, loss of the remaining p53 allele and finally to amplification of the mutated H-ras gene. His group has demonstrated a clear progression from normal cells to papillomas, then to tumours and metastases in this model. Knowing that p53 is activated either by DNA damage (via ATM and ATR) or via oncogene activation (via p19ARF), he asked which activation pathway regulates p53 tumour suppressor activity. To this end, tumours were generated in ATM to / to , p19ARF to / to  and p53 to / to  mice. All tumours, irrespective of stage, had Ha-ras mutations, confirming that this was the initiating event. Consistent with this pathway, p53 levels were elevated in papillomas from normal and ATM to / to  mice, but not in tumours from p19ARF to / to  mice. The absence of p53 function accelerated malignant conversion from papilloma to carcinoma in p19ARF to / to  mice and p53 to / to  mice and was associated with metastasis, supporting the idea that induction of p53 suppressed metastasis. The importance of p19ARF to p53 induction was further shown by the fact that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of ARF in carcinomas overcame the need for subsequent LOH of TP53. Their data support the idea that, in this system, selection for p53 mutations is not due to external stress or DNA damage (i.e. signalling via ATM), but rather, it results directly from signalling from the initiating oncogenic lesion via p19ARF. Importantly, such data provide an explanation as to why mutational alteration of p53 is often a late event in the development of human malignancies..

Analysis of the MDM-2 promoter has identified an SNP within the first intron, at nucleotide 309. Within the general population 12% are G/G, 40% G/T and 48% are T/T (wt). Functional analysis predicts that having G makes a better Sp1 binding motif (which was confirmed using gel shift assays) and increases transcriptional activity by Sp1 in reporter assays. The importance of this is that in cells with Sp1, endogenous levels of Mdm-2 are higher in cells with G/G than T/T; as a consequence, these cells are more resistant to apoptotic cell death than T/T cells, because less  active  p53 is available so only high affinity promoters will be activated..

GBM is highly invasive, resistant to apoptosis and almost completely refractory to treatment. E.Kim (Luebeck, Germany) presented an interesting talk on an interaction between p53 and ets-1 in progression of glioblastoma. Over-expression and activation of the transcription factor ets-1, which increases expression of pro-invasive genes, such as MMPs, pre-senilin and integrins in invasive GBM, has been well documented, but the underlying molecular basis is unknown. She showed that wt p53 binds ets-1 and inhibits its ability to activate pro-invasive genes. Ets-1 induction of thromboxane mRNA is inhibited by p53 (and binding of p53 to ets-1) in transient transfections. Ets-1 also complexes with several p53 mutants that enhance the ability of ets-1 to activate transcription. Her data suggest that in GBM, there is a selection against wt p53 function, the result of which is to aid in the upregulation of pro-invasive genes by ets-1. In a related talk, J.Royds (Dunedin, NZ) examined the relationship between TP53 mutations and telomere maintenance (TM) in gliomas. Two mechanisms for TM have been described in gliomas, one requiring the enzyme telomerase and the other a recombinational method designated as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). This latter mechanism was described in more detail by R.Reddel (Sydney, Australia) who demonstrated that ALT is manifested by a rapid increase in telomere length and the appearance in the nuclei of ALT-associated PML bodies. Moreover, he showed that ALT is repressed by sequestration of the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 recombination complex by Sp100. Royds found a high correlation between TP53 mutations and ALT, but not with telomerase. Since ALT is based on telomere-specific recombination events, and p53 is a strong repressor of recombination, these data suggest that loss of p53 early in tumourigenesis might facilitate the acquisition of ALT. Interestingly, ALT was found to be associated with a significantly better outcome than telomerase for patients with high grade gliomas. However, there was a correlation between wt TP53 and telomerase in gliomas. Wt TP53 gliomas showed high expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 but not apoptosis.

Animal models Models of tumourigenesis p53 in the clinic Regulation of p53 function p53-based therapies p53 the future References   Notwithstanding any role played by p53 in the mitochondrion, p53 undoubtedly can and does function as a transcription factor. In this context, it is very clear that p53 binds to motifs within the promoters of a selected group of target genes via its central hydrophobic domain. However, there is also a C-terminal non-specific DNA binding domain, whose function remains somewhat controversial. Furthermore, the question remains as to how p53 recognizes its specific binding motifs within the genome as a whole? Much of this recognition process appears to be dependent on the C-terminus..

Support for this idea was provided further by M.Kulesz-Martin (Oregon, USA) using a combination of ChiP and western blotting analysis. She showed wt mouse p53 was much more efficient at binding and activating the CDKN1A promoter in vivo, than the mouse alternative splice variant (p53AS) that contains a very different C-terminus. She suggested that non-specific DNA binding facilitates localization of p53 to specific response elements via a sliding mechanism. This was tested by looking at the binding of p53 to genomic DNA. The p53AS form binds genomic DNA much more slowly than wtp53. So perhaps, p53 having located DNA damage, then slides along the DNA to locate its binding motifs in promoters as a rapid response to stress?.

She showed that p53 activation domain 2 (amino acid residues 43 to 63) is required for transcription of the pro-apoptotic insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) but the C-terminal basic domain (amino acid residues 364 to 393) is inhibitory. Activation domain 1 (amino acid residues 1 to 42) controls the inhibitory action of the C-terminus. Inhibition of apoptosis is thus alleviated by deletion of both of these domains. The C-termini of p63 and p73 also inhibit induction of IGFBP3..

In addition, there are differences in promoter architecture between different p53 response genes, e.g. the CDKN1A promoter possesses two p53 binding sequences upstream of TATA/Inr element; the FAS/APO1 promoter has one p53 binding motif downstream of an Inr and PTEN has a p53 binding motif adjacent to a GC-rich sequence. It is generally believed that p53 links upstream enhancer factors to mediators and the basal transcription machinery. The advent of ChIP has allowed detailed in vivo analyses of p53-dependent activation of transcription. Using a time-course ChIP approach, B.Emerson (La Jolla, USA) presented the results of elegant studies into the relationship between core transcription factors, p53, and the responses of p53 target promoters to different types of DNA damage. Focusing on the CDKN1A promoter, prior to UV DNA damage, p53 is bound to its motifs but unphosphorylated at ser15. Histone acetyl transferase (HAT; bound to p53) and TBP (bound to the TATA-box) are also present, but there is no transcription. TAF250 is only recruited to the TBP pre-initiation complex after UV damage and when the promoter is active. In contrast, TFIIB and RNA polymerase II are bound before damage, but not present after damage. This RNA polymerase II is the unphosphorylated and active but non-elongating form of the enzyme; elongation activity is activated shortly after UV damage. Histone acetylation and TAF250 recruitment occur prior to phosphorylation of ser15 on p53 and the stabilization of p53. Therefore, the CDKN1A promoter is poised for action in response to DNA damage. However, induction is transient because TFIIB is quickly lost, so RNA polymerase II cannot rebind and transcription is not sustained. In contrast, the CDKN1A response to doxorubicin is biphasic. After exposure, there is no recruitment of TAF250 to the CDKN1A promoter but there is an increase in TFIIB. So after the initial burst of  ready-to-go  transcription and loss of RNA polymerase II, the increase in TFIIB means that TFIIB tends to stay on the promoter, recruit more RNA polymerase II and therefore, another wave of transcription..

These promoters have plenty of paused RNA polymerase II compared with the apoptotic response genes. Analysis of the FAS/APO1 promoter, which has very low levels of paused bound RNA polymerase II, showed that there is recruitment of TAF250 in response to UV but not doxorubicin, and low levels of bound TFIIB and paused RNA polymerase II remain constant after damage by UV and doxorubicin. In this case, there is little pre-initiation complex present before DNA damage but it persists afterwards, and therefore, initiation of transcription by p53 is delayed compared with CDKN1A.

Animal models Models of tumourigenesis p53 in the clinic Regulation of p53 function p53-based therapies p53 the future References   Given the prevalence of p53 mutations in human cancer, the ultimate goal of our investigations into the regulation and functions of p53 is to develop novel and rational therapeutics for the treatment of a wide range of malignancies. The majority of investigations are focused on two main areas: one is targeting the Mdm-2/p53 interaction (or equivalent such as the E6/p53 complex; M.Jiang, from J.Milner's group, York, UK), and the other aims to alter the conformation of mutant p53 proteins in order to reactivate wt p53 functions. From the former perspective, nutlins, appear to be promising candidates. Nutlins (cis-imidazolines), are small molecules that inhibit the p53/Mdm-2 interaction by mimicking binding of three critical p53 amino acids (leu26, trp23 and ph19) within the p53/Mdm-2-binding domain. In an impressive presentation, L.Vassiliev (New Jersey, USA) showed that in cells with wt p53 but not mutant p53, nutlins cause a dose-dependent elevation of p53 protein and p53 transcriptional activity. The global effect of nutlin on p53 gene activation was verified by gene array profiling. Nutlins also efficiently inhibit clonogenic growth and induce apoptosis in cells with wt p53, in a dose-dependent fashion. The beauty of nutlins is that they do not need DNA damaging agents to activate p53 (see Signalling section). In xenograft models, nutlins have proved more effective than paclitaxel and at higher doses can completely abrogate tumour growth, with no obvious pathology. These agents appear to show great promise as new cancer therapeutics..
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	72	Several studies have attempted large-scale screening of small molecules that might reactivate mutant p53. H.-C.Ang (from A.Fersht's group, Cambridge, UK) provided preliminary data of an NMR approach that could be used to evaluate the effects of small molecule effects on p53 structure, thus allowing the rationale design of molecules. They are now using NMR as a sensitive tool for screening novel molecules that bind weakly to p53 and might then be refined. The advantage of this system is that only compounds that bind and alter p53 structure are detected and the approach can be automated for high throughput screening. At a more advanced stage, K.Wiman (Stockholm, Sweden) reported on efforts to identify small molecules that might be used to reactivate normal p53 function in mutants. Using a high-throughput screen of small molecules able to induce growth arrest or apoptosis in cells stably expressing mutant R273H, they originally identified PRIMA-1. PRIMA-1 inhibits tumourigenesis of human xenografts and may prove useful in sensitizing cells to killing by current anticancer drugs. Biochemical studies suggest that this sensitization may result from increased levels of mutant p53 induced by low levels of drug (e.g. cisplatin), which increases the available pool of p53 for reactivation by PRIMA-1. With this in mind, he proposed that any agent capable of elevating mutant p53 levels might synergize with PRIMA-1 to kill cells. Using a similar approach, this group has also identified another small compound, MIRA-1, that can also reactivate mutant p53..

Commenting on areas that were under-represented at the meeting, he thought that in the next period up to the 13th International p53 Workshop in New York in 2006, we would learn a lot more about the  gain-of-function  of tumour associated p53 mutant proteins, about transcriptional repression by p53 and about the role of p53 in cellular senescence. For example, which mutants have gain-of-function? Do they all behave in the same way? Does transcriptional repression have biological meaning? How does p53 induce senescence? The increased use of transgenic knock-in mutant mice will help answer many questions about  gain-of-function  mutants as well as yeast based genetic screens..
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	75	However, beyond its role in tumour suppression, and having regard for the many complex signalling pathways with which p53 appears to be involved in (Figure 1), Levine proposed that p53 may be a  ubiquitous sensor  of stress and as such is involved in the prevention of other, possibly aging-related disorders. These, he suggested, may include diabetes, arthritis, atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases, for which there is indeed some evidence already (2 to 4), and even psychological stresses. Thus, rather than just acting to prevent genetic lesions accumulating in somatic tissues which can lead to cancer, p53 may act to dampen many physiological stresses that may, if unchecked, lead to disorders. Such responses may often be beneficial in the short-term, but long-term dysregulation can cause damage to body organs, resulting in premature ageing. This cumulative wear and tear is known as allostatic load (5). The idea that p53 may be important in the control of allostatic load is very exciting as it may well account for the large diversity of signals that appear to  activate  p53. A handle on this might be obtained by analysing patients for polymorphisms in TP53 and in other members of the p53 pathway, such as the SNP309 discussed above, and correlating them with various ageing-related phenotypes. It will be interesting to see if anyone picks up this gauntlet and has data by the time of the next meeting, potentially opening up even more areas of investigation, for the next generation of p53 researchers..

A handle on this might be obtained by analysing patients for polymorphisms in TP53 and in other members of the p53 pathway, such as the SNP309 discussed above, and correlating them with various ageing-related phenotypes. It will be interesting to see if anyone picks up this gauntlet and has data by the time of the next meeting, potentially opening up even more areas of investigation, for the next generation of p53 researchers..
