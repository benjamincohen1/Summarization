0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, July 7, 2004 , and in revised form, September 8, 2004.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	4	In the response to various stresses, such as ionizing radiation, UV and hypoxia, p53 is activated, stabilized, and imported into the nucleus, where it promotes transcription of several genes whose products induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis (14).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In a non-stress situation, the level of p53 in the cells is mainly regulated at the post-translational level by MDM2 (12, 15 to 17).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	6	Hsp90 is an abundant molecular chaperone important for protecting cells from stress, such as high temperature.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Additionally, Hsp90 regulates many signaling pathways.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Hsp90 is found in a complex with several oncoproteins, including v-Src, c-Erb2, Raf-1, Akt, Bcr-Abl, and tumor suppressor p53 (18 to 22).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG) is currently in phase II of clinical trials as a potential anti-tumor drug.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Hsp90 inhibitors usually induce ubiquitination and degradation of Hsp90 client proteins (23).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In tumor cells, Hsp90 exists in a functionally distinct conformational form that is much more efficiently recognized by 17-AAG.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This form of Hsp90, which possesses elevated ATPase activity, is found in a multichaperone complex with cochaperones: p23, Hop, and probably others (24).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	13	It has been known for years that genotypically mutant p53 co-immunoprecipitates with members of the Hsp70 and Hsp90 families (19).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Such interactions lead to the formation of a p53 multichaperone complex that is responsible for the stabilization and sequestration of p53 in the cytoplasm (25 to 27).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Binding of molecular chaperones to mutant p53 inhibits the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in the stabilization of both p53 and MDM2 (28, 29).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	16	 It also has been shown that Hsp90 directly associates with the MDM2 protein (30).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Hsp90 inhibitors can partially disrupt these interactions, which results in the degradation of mutant p53 (31, 32).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	18	 With the use of highly purified proteins, we have identified intermediate reactions that lead to the assembly of molecular chaperone complex with p53 protein possessing wild-type or mutant sequence.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The presence of Hsp90 in a complex with wt-p53 inhibits binding of Hsp40 and Hsc70 to p53.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, the conformational mutant of p53, which possesses low affinity toward Hsp90, can form a stable multichaperone complex in which Hsp90 is bound to mutant p53 indirectly (mut p53-Hsp40-Hsc70-Hop-Hsp90).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Several independent methods, such as surface plasmon resonance, immunoprecipitation, ELISA, and cross-linking were used to demonstrate that Hsp90 directly, in the absence of any other co-chaperones, can associate with genotypically wt-p53 but not with mutant p53 protein (33).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The accompanying article by Muller et al.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Moreover, it has been shown by NMR that Hsp90 associates with a truncated version of wt-p53.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	24	 It was suggested that the p53 core domain bound to Hsp90 is predominantly unfolded and lacking helical or sheet secondary structure (35).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	25	Wild-type p53 is a structurally unstable protein, which undergoes conformational changes at elevated temperatures (36, 37).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We have proposed that during heat shock, cytoplasmic p53 possessing the wild-type sequence could temporarily adopt a mutant conformation, subsequently initiating the formation of a multichaperone complex that could partially stabilize wt-p53 (19).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Results from a recently published article by Wang and Chen (38) support our hypothesis.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	28	 They found that heat shock inhibited p53 ubiquitination and initiated the accumulation of p53 at the post-translational level.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Two factors influence these events during heat stress: 1) ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53 and 2) formation of the chaperone complex with genotypically wt-p53, which adopts a conformation characteristic to that of a mutant protein (38).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The evidence for Hsp90 binding to mutant p53 is conclusive, whereas the exact nature of cellular interactions between Hsp90 and genotypically wt-p53 possessing either wild-type or mutant conformation still remains to be elucidated.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	31	In this study, we demonstrate that the chaperone activity of Hsp90 is required for wt-p53-dependent transcriptional activity.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Specific Hsp90 inhibitors, geldanamycin and radicicol, inhibit p53 activity as the transcription factor by dissociation of p53 from its target DNA promoter sequence sites.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Results from the reconstituted in vitro system clearly show that Hsp90 positively regulates p53 DNA binding to a specific promoter sequence after incubation at physiological temperature of 37  degrees C.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Moreover, this Hsp90 activity is ATP-dependent and inhibited by geldanamycin.

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	250	 A, specific binding of p53 to the labeled p21 promoter DNA was activated by the antibody Ab421 (lanes 4 to 6; supershifted by the antibody) and CKII-dependent phosphorylation (lanes 1 to 3; not supershifted) and both could be inactivated by a 1-h incubation at 37  degrees C (lanes 2 and 5).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Although difference between binding strength at 4  degrees C and 37  degrees C is smaller in the case of CKII than in Ab421 activation (phosphorylation may protect against heat inactivation, see text for reference), Hsp90 rescues p53-specific binding in both cases (lanes 3 and 6).

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	257	  The Mode of p53-Hsp90 Interaction Suggests Dynamic Mechanism for Positive Regulation of wt-p53 by Hsp90  The ability of Hsp90 to restore p53 binding to the promoter sequence at 37  degrees C cannot be explained by a simple, passive protection of the wild-type conformation of p53 at elevated temperatures, analogous to that described for RNA polymerase protection by DnaK (57, 58).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	258	 In the mentioned case, the presence of ATP diminishes to a great extent the DnaK-dependent protection of RNA polymerase at elevated temperatures.

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	260	 4B) also shifts the equilibrium of p53-Hsp90 complex formation toward its dissociation.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	261	 The weaker effect of AMP-PNP, the ATP analog, indicates that at least nucleotide hydrolysis and probably its exchange is important for this reaction (Fig.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Consequently, 5 mM AMP-PNP could not substitute for ATP in the Hsp90-dependent enhanced DNA-binding of p53 in the EMSA assay (results not shown).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Hsp90 also did not cause p53 supershifts in the EMSA assay when Hsp90 was present in reactions (Figs.

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Taken together, these results indicate that the dynamic repeated binding and dissociation of the Hsp90 to p53 is responsible for the positive regulation of p53 DNA binding activity at physiological temperatures of 37  degrees C.

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Whereas the presence of geldanamycin or radicicol had minor effects on the cellular wt-p53 level and its phosphorylation at Ser-15, these Hsp90 inhibitors dramatically influenced p53 activity as the transcription factor, measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation as well as quantitative analysis of p21 mRNA and protein levels.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	278	 The observed effect of Hsp90 inhibitors on the p53 transcriptional activity is not caused by the inhibition of the nuclear transport of p53 (results not shown).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	279	 These in vivo data suggest that Hsp90 may play a role in the regulation of p53-promoted transcription.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	280	 To examine the possible effects of Hsp90 on p53 DNA binding activity, in vitro DNA binding studies were performed with purified human Hsp90 recombinant protein and Hsp90 purified from a bovine brain (a mixture of bovine and Hsp90 isoforms).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Both Hsp90 protein preparations displayed similar ATPase and luciferase refolding activities that were inhibited by geldanamycin.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	282	The gel shift assay was used to monitor in vitro p53 binding to the p21 promoter DNA sequence.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	283	 A wt-p53 conformation, recognized by pAb 1620, is essential for this activity.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Incubation of the p53 protein encoded by the non-mutated sequence, at 37  degrees C decreases the amount of p53 protein found in an immunocomplex with pAb 1620 as well as the p53 DNA binding.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	285	 In fact, incubation of wt-p53 for 1 h at 37  degrees C completely abolished p53 binding to the p21 promoter-derived sequence.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Interestingly, the presence of increasing amounts of Hsp90 during the incubation of p53 at 37  degrees C can positively regulate p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence, whereas other human recombinant chaperone proteins from Hsp70 and Hsp40 families were not able to substitute for Hsp90 activity.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	287	 This activity is ATP-dependent and can be inhibited by geldanamycin.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	288	 These effects correlate with our in vivo results, where geldanamycin inhibited p53 binding to the chromatin as well as transcription from the p21 promoter.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	289	 In order to examine the possibility that transient Hsp90 interactions are required for positive regulation of p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence at 37  degrees C, we monitored the direct binding of Hsp90 to p53 in the presence or absence of ATP.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Similar to Hsp70-substrate complex formation (61, 62), the presence of ATP shifted the binding/dissociation equilibrium toward dissociation.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	291	 These results suggest that the influence of Hsp90 on p53 DNA binding cannot be explained by the passive protection of wt-p53 conformation, caused by static association with Hsp90.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	292	 We showed that the presence of ATP, which induces dissociation of Hsp90 from p53, also promotes the ability of p53 to bind to the DNA promoter sequence at 37  degrees C.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	293	The concentrations of geldanamycin and radicicol, which are sufficient to inhibit Hsp90-dependent in vivo transcriptional activity of p53 are lower than the concentration of Hsp90 inhibitors used in our in vitro assays, suggesting that we are only reconstituting the minimum Hsp90 chaperone systems in vitro.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	294	 We are in the process of testing the hypothesis that the presence of Hsp90 co-chaperones could influence the inhibitors' affinity to Hsp90 and Hsp90-dependent p53 binding to the promoter sequence.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	295	 However, our results already indicate that the influence of Hsp90 on wt-p53 activity should be taken into consideration while using Hsp90 inhibitors in the therapeutic treatment of cancer, especially if cancer cells possess wt-p53.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	296	There are at least two possibilities of explaining the mechanism for Hsp90 positive regulation of p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence at 37  degrees C.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	297	 First, Hsp90 inhibits p53 aggregation or catalyzes the disaggregation of p53 protein at elevated temperatures.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Such a mechanism was previously discovered for chaperones belonging to prokaryotic (57, 58) and eukaryotic (63) Hsp70 families; and now is shown for Hsp90 in presence of p53 by Muller et al.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Second, the Hsp90 association with wt-p53 could induce the partial unfolding of p53.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Following the dissociation of this Hsp90-p53 complex in the presence of ATP, p53 could spontaneously refold back into a wild-type conformation with a high affinity for the p21 promoter sequence.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	301	 A similar mechanism of molecular chaperone action was proposed in the case of Hsp100 involved in protein folding and proteolysis (64).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	302	 The unfoldase activity of Hsp100 molecular chaperone was eventually demonstrated by a subsequent study (65).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Recent data from the Ted Hupp laboratory (30) suggest that Hsp90 in the presence of MDM2 could indeed partially unfold p53.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	304	 We propose that partial unfolding of p53 could be catalyzed by Hsp90, and the subsequent spontaneous refolding of p53 back into a wild-type-like conformation may prevent p53 aggregation thus increasing p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence (see Fig.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	305	 More importantly, these chaperone-mediated actions would decrease the probability for the formation of kinetically trapped, mutant-like intermediates and that would allow a shift in the conformational equilibrium toward the active, wt-p53 conformation.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	306	 These events would ultimately promote the p53 transcriptional activity and allow for the ubiquitination and degradation of p53 protein.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	307	 In addition, the retention of p53 in a wild-type conformation by transient Hsp90 interaction would also inhibit the formation of a multichaperone-p53 complex, which prevents p53 degradation and import to the nucleus (Fig.

0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	3	Previously we reported that an altered FN matrix triggers apoptosis in primary cells via a novel pathway that is regulated by transcriptionally mediated decreases in p53 and c-Myc levels in primary cells (5).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	4	 To further decipher this apoptotic pathway, we explored the possible connections between integrin/FAK-mediated signals and the down-regulation of p53.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We hypothesized that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) might be at the crossroads of this signaling pathway, since FAK and associated focal adhesion proteins (Rac1/Pak1/MKK4/JNK) have been linked to p53 status in the apoptosis of primary cells (9, 10).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In addition, JNK can phosphorylate (11) and form a complex with p53 to stabilize it (12 to 16), thereby influencing its activity directly.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	7	FAK is an integrin-associated protein tyrosine kinase that is important in integrin signaling.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Its activation, triggered by increased phosphorylation of Tyr397 and other sites, has been implicated in many cellular processes, including cell survival.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The N-terminal domain of FAK directs interactions with integrins and growth factor receptors.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	10	 FAK also has a central catalytic domain, which contains Tyr397, a major autophosphorylation site and a site of interaction with the Src homology 2 domain.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Its C-terminal noncatalytic domain, also known as FAK-related non-kinase (FRNK), contains sites for multiple protein-protein interactions and a focal adhesion targeting (FAT) region.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Both FRNK and FAT act in a dominant-negative fashion to inhibit cell spreading and migration and growth factor-mediated signals to mitogen-activated protein kinase (17).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	13	JNK, a group of mitogen-activated protein kinases that are activated by cytokines or environmental stress, participate in various signaling pathways, including apoptotic pathways.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	14	 JNK proteins are encoded by three genes, JNK1 (46 kDa), JNK2 (54 kDa), and JNK3 (54 kDa), each of which undergoes alternative splicing to express various isoforms.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	15	 JNK is activated by phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (18).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Activated JNK1 can modify p53 posttranslationally by phosphorylation.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	17	 JNK2 and JNK3 can also phosphorylate p53, and all three associate with p53 in vivo (19).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	18	In this study, we sought to determine whether FAK signaling pathways communicate with p53 via JNK interactions in an altered matrix environment.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Here we report that the apoptotic mechanism triggered by an altered FN matrix is propagated by decreases in FAK phosphorylation that are linked to increased phosphorylation of JNK and to decreased levels of p53, which is oppositely regulated by JNK1 and JNK2.

0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Total FAK, pFAK, total JNK1 and -2, and actin levels were unchanged.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	155	Several studies have shown that JNK interacts with (13, 14) and can phosphorylate p53 (11).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	156	 In fact, p53 and JNK can form a complex, and JNK is a regulator of p53 stability (13 to 16).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	157	 In one study, sustained activation of JNK1 down-regulated p53 expression during apoptosis (16), similar to our findings.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	158	 However, we found that JNK1 and JNK2 are opposite regulators of p53.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Surprisingly, treatment with antisense JNK2 suppressed p53 levels in controls and under altered FN matrix conditions.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	160	 JNK1 antisense treatment, however, increased p53 levels.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	161	 P53 expression was also suppressed in jnk2-deficient cells.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	162	 These data indicate that JNK2 expression is tightly linked to that of p53 and that JNK1 and JNK2 regulate p53 by different mechanisms.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Furthermore, increases in JNK1 expression (or pJNK1) decreased p53 protein levels, and decreases in JNK1 expression (or pJNK1) increased p53 levels.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Conversely, increases in JNK2 expression (or pJNK2) may increase p53 levels, and decreases in JNK2 expression (or pJNK2) profoundly decreased p53 levels.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Thus JNK1 is a negative regulator and JNK2 is a positive regulator of p53 expression.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	166	The antibody we used to detect pJNK also detects JNK1, -2, and -3, and Western blots for pJNK showed two bands at 54 and 46 kDa.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	167	 For several reasons, however, we are confident that treatment with an altered FN matrix increased JNK1 phosphorylation only and not that of JNK2 or JNK3.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	168	 First, transfection with a JNK1 construct (Fig.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	169	 3A) and a dominant-negative JNK1 construct (Fig.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	170	 3B) both showed an increase in the two bands visible in the pJNK Western blots under control conditions, indicating that both bands are JNK1 isoforms.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Second, treatment with a JNK1 antisense oligonucleotide decreased both bands, indicating that they are both JNK1 isoforms (Fig.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Third, transfection with a JNK2 construct induced a new higher molecular mass band at 54 kDa for pJNK that was not seen before with any other treatments and likely represents the phosphorylated form of JNK2 (Fig.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Fourth, Western analysis of jnk2-deficient cells showed two bands that likely represent two isoforms of JNK1.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	174	 These bands were not seen in Western blots of cells deficient in JNK1 and JNK2.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	175	Interestingly, overexpression of p53 limited the phosphorylation of JNK normally induced by an altered FN matrix, suggesting that p53 and pJNK participate in a negative feedback mechanism.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Similarly, in previous studies, introduction of p53 into p53-null cells reduced JNK activity to a low basal level (24), possibly indicating feedback between p53 and JNK.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	177	JNKs are a family of stress-related kinases, and an altered FN matrix represents a stressful condition in which JNKs seems to play a role.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	178	 At sites of inflammation, the extracellular matrix is degraded by proteolytic enzymes in the inflammatory milieu.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Degraded matrix conveys messages that are different from those normally conveyed by an intact or stable matrix, and the degradation increases with the severity of the disease.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	180	 In periodontal disease and arthritis, FN fragments are most abundant in the most diseased sites (6, 25 to 30).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Previously, we found that a proteolytic 40-kDa fragment of FN associated with the most advanced disease also induced apoptosis of periodontal ligament fibroblasts in vitro by down-regulating p53 and c-Myc (6, 7).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	182	 This 40-kDa fragment, which is comparable with the recombinant FN fragment we tested here, induced apoptosis of fibroblasts via a novel alternative pathway that involves decreases in FAK phosphorylation and down-regulation of p53 and c-Myc.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	183	 This pathway appears to be triggered by cooperative interactions between integrins and a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (4, 5).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	184	 From the present findings we can further add that this inflammation-associated apoptotic pathway also involves interactions between pFAK and JNK1 and -2 and their phosphorylated isoforms, which oppositely regulate p53 expression levels.

0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, November 22, 2004 , and in revised form, April 29, 2005.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	3	Pathologic overexpression of uPA has been linked to a wide range of inflammatory and neoplastic lung diseases (4, 5).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	4	 For example, high levels of uPA as well as PAI-1 and uPAR in lung tumor tissue correlate with poor prognosis (6, 7).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In addition, increasingly compelling evidence for the involvement of the uPA system in cell proliferation, migration, tumor invasion, and metastasis (8-17) has positioned plasminogen activation as central to the propagation of neoplasms (5).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In certain tumors, neoplastic growth can be effectively attenuated by PAI-1, presumably through its interaction with uPA (18).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	7	In addition to its proteolytic properties, recent data from our laboratory has demonstrated that uPA enhanced expression of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 in Beas2B cells (19-21).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Elaboration of these molecules influences two major features associated with lung neoplasia, including excessive proliferation of neoplastic cells and their capacity to invade normal tissues.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	9	 It is now clear that the pathogenesis of lung neoplasia prominently involves expression of tumor suppressor protein p53 (22-24) as well as extracellular matrix degradation by uPA-mediated plasminogen activation (6, 7, 24).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Among the plethora of potentially useful markers of tumor virulence that have been identified to date, both uPA and p53 appear to be promising (24, 25).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The prognostic value of uPA and p53 accumulation has been reported in primary breast cancer patients (8-16), supporting their role in tumor progression and overall survival.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, no direct relationship between tumor suppression and extracellular matrix degradation has been established to date.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	13	Stimulation of the lung epithelium by uPA elicits proliferative responses via signaling mechanisms that are incompletely characterized at present.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Expression of growth factor activity has been attributed to uPA stimulation and suggests activation of such signaling processes (8-16).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	15	 uPA bound to its receptor activates intracellular signaling through protein intermediates that are currently not well understood.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Overexpression of either uPA, uPAR, or PAI-1 by tumor cells (19, 25-28) as well as potent growth factor activity of uPA in epithelial cells prompted us to test the possibility that uPA might regulate p53 expression in lung epithelial cells, a possibility that has not been explored previously, to our knowledge.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	17	 We now report a new paradigm by which p53 expression by lung epithelial cells is regulated by uPA.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	18	 We also characterize the responsible mechanism.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	19	 This pathway could influence alveolar p53 expression and thereby modulate uPA-mediated responses of lung epithelial cells in lung injury or neoplasia.

0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	235	 In this context, uPA appears to play a cooperative role in the propagation and spread of neoplasms (5).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	236	 A change in proto-oncogene and tumor-suppressor gene expression (41) may facilitate epithelial cell transformation and alter the capacity of lung epithelial cells to effect proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	237	 The activity of the p53 tumor suppressor protein in particular has a key role in this process.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	238	 We therefore sought to elucidate interactions by which uPA and p53 can interact and to determine specifically how p53 is expressed and regulated by uPA in lung epithelial cells.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	239	In this study, we present evidence that uPA induces expression of p53 in cultured Beas2B and that the effect is also observed in primary SAE cells.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	240	 This pathway provides a versatile regulatory system through which the uPA concentration of the ambient microenvironment and pericellular proteolysis could regulate cellular transformation by up-regulating expression of p53.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	241	 This molecular mechanism may be a crucial determinant of epithelial cell transformation or the invasiveness of lung carcinomas, in which excessive uPA-dependent pericellular proteolysis increases cellular proliferation and invasiveness (5).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	242	uPA-mediated p53 expression does not induce p53 mRNA induction, indicating the involvement of post-transcriptional mechanisms such as enhanced translation of p53 mRNA and/or decreased proteolytic degradation of the protein (42).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Activation of p53 following genotoxic damage is achieved by induction of p53 levels and by modifications of the p53 protein such as phosphorylation and acetylation (43-47).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	244	 DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, UV radiation, alkylating agents, and environmental carcinogens induces p53 through alteration of p53 protein stability (48-54).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	245	 However, uPA is a serine protease involved in extracellular matrix degradation to which no DNA damage or repair function has been attributed.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Altered p53 protein expression because of translation rather than transcription or mutation in the p53 gene has been observed in blast cells obtained from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (55).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	247	 In the present study we have observed that uPA induces phosphorylation of the Ser-15 residue of p53 in a concentration-dependent manner consistent with the uPA-mediated induction of p53.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Activation of p53 can lead either to cell arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	249	 At low concentrations of uPA, Beas2B cells undergo apoptosis as a consequence of increased p53 accumulation.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	250	 This is accomplished by two independent mechanisms.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	251	 First, uPA induces Ser-15 phosphorylation at a concentration of 50 ng/ml, which impairs p53 interaction with MDM2 and its degradation.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Second, at a low concentration uPA also fails to maintain elevated levels of MDM2 protein required for p53 turnover.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	253	 However, at higher uPA concentrations induction of MDM2 protein as well as inhibition of Ser-15 phosphorylation leads to increased degradation of p53, which results in reduced apoptosis and increased DNA synthesis.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	254	In previous studies, we and others have found that uPA influences uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 expression through posttranscriptional pathways (19-21).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Similar influences on uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 mRNA stabilities are also discovered in lung cancer-derived cell lines (25, 56).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	256	 It has been reported previously that p53 regulates fibrinolysis by inhibiting uPA expression through suppression of promoter and enhancer activity of the uPA gene and the activation of the PAI-1 promoter (58, 59).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	257	 The present study suggests that uPA may overcome the transcriptional control of p53 over the expression of uPA and PAI-1 by inhibiting the p53 expression itself at higher a concentration.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Activation of c-Myc stabilizes p53 protein in quiescent mouse fibroblasts (57), indicating the involvement of p53-induced apoptosis and cell cycle reentry to prevent cell proliferation induced by oncogene activation.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Because uPA is known to induce cell proliferation on a wide variety of cell types, including fibroblasts (8-15), uPA-mediated p53 induction probably mediates apoptosis as a safeguard to prevent unrestrained cell proliferation induced by uPA.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	260	 It is highly likely that uPA at a higher concentration probably induces cell proliferation by disrupting this safeguard mechanism through MDM2-mediated ubiquitination.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	261	The identification of a newly defined mechanism by which the uPA regulates expression of p53 suggests the possibility that other novel pathways could likewise influence cellular transformation.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Based upon our previous observations, the induction of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 by uPA in lung epithelial cells could likewise contribute to altered p53 expression, possibly by influencing the kinetics of internalization of trimeric complexes of uPA, PAI-1, and uPAR.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	263	 The precise regulatory levels by which uPA induces p53 expression by lung epithelial cells remain to be elucidated in studies that extend this report.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	264	We found that the induction of p53 by uPA in Beas2B cells requires receptor interaction and that the LMW fragment could not reproduce the effect.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Engagement of 1 integrin with specific antibody inhibited uPA-induced p53 expression, indicating the intricate connections between expression of p53 and uPA-uPAR integrin-mediated adhesion.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	266	 There are precedents for this mode of uPA-mediated induction of cellular responses.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	267	 uPA is mitogenic for several different cell types.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	268	 The mitogenic response likewise requires receptor interaction with uPA in pleural mesothelioma as well as epidermal tumor cell lines (8-15).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	269	 The inhibitory effect of a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor on p53 expression indicates that the process involves cellular signaling mainly through activation of tyrosine phosphatases.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Alternatively, uPA stimulation of Beas2B cells may also induce synthesis of growth factors or cytokines that in turn may induce p53 protein.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	271	 The elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for the prolonged effect of uPA on the p53 protein level remains to be determined.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Phosphorylation of serines 15 and 20 following genotoxic stress (25, 43-56) has been demonstrated to impair interaction between p53 and MDM2, resulting in enhanced p53 accumulation (45).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	273	 In contrast to DNA damage, differential expression of p53 predicated on uPA concentration can act as a selective pressure during tumor growth for the elimination of cells with wild-type p53 and clonal expansion of cells with diminished p53 expression.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Induction of p53 by uPA in Beas2B cells clearly is not mediated via generation of plasmin because exposure of cells to treatment with plasmin did not affect p53 expression.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	275	In summary, we now report that uPA stimulates expression of p53 by lung epithelial cells in culture.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	276	 If operative in vivo, this pathway could contribute to the relative local overexpression of uPA and the neoplastic transformation associated with lung cancer.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	277	 To our knowledge, this newly identified pathway is the first description of the ability of uPA to regulate the expression of p53 in any cell type.

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	3	Interestingly, inhibition of angiogenesis by blockade of v-integrins is accompanied by an induction of endothelial cell p53 activity (5).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Based on this, we hypothesized that loss of p53 might compensate for v-integrin function during neovascularization.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To examine this possibility, we analyzed p53 null mice, where the effect of a specific v-integrin antagonist was studied on retinal neovascularization.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Mouse retinal neovascularization occurs during the first days after birth, and therefore, newborn mice were treated with an v-integrin antagonist as described (7).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The retinal vasculature in wild type newborn mice treated for 3 days with the v-antagonist was significantly less developed than retinas from control treated mice (Table I).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	8	 When accounting for the retinal vascular area already existing when the treatment started, the inhibition was close to 100%, in accordance with our previous observations after 4 days of treatment (7).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Targeted p53 null males were then mated with p53 heterozygous females.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This type of mating was not only necessary for sufficient embryonic survival but also allowed for a comparison of p53 null mice with heterozygous mice within the same litter in a double-blind fashion, including animals of exactly the same age receiving identical treatment.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	11	 No difference in retinal vascularization could be observed between p53 null and heterozygous mice during the first 3 days (data not shown).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In addition, no difference in degree of neovascularization between p53 null and heterozygous mice could be observed after control treatment (Fig.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This indicates that p53 does not influence normal vascularization of the retina.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	14	 We then treated entire litters of newborn mice of a mixed genotype (see above) with the v-integrin antagonist.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Interestingly, p53 heterozygous animals had a markedly less developed retinal vasculature compared with p53 null mice when treated with the v-antagonist (Fig.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Statistical analysis of measurements performed on the vascular area of these retinas revealed that the vascular development in anti-v-treated p53 heterozygous was suppressed, a suppression that was found to be statistically significant (p = 5.

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This result closely resembled the difference seen between retinas from antagonist versus control treated wild type mice (Table I).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Taken together, these findings indicate that although p53 expression does not influence normal neovascularization, loss of p53 compensates for the function of v-integrins in neovascularization.

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	31	A possible explanation for the lack of response to the v-integrin antagonist in p53 null mice could be deficient retinal integrin v expression.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	32	 To test this possibility, retinal lysates were analyzed for v protein levels by Western blot analysis.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	33	 2A, v-integrin levels in p53 null retinas do not differ from that in p53 heterozygous mice.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Another possibility for a lack of response to the v antagonist in p53 null mice could be that cells lacking p53 are insensitive to this treatment because of alterations in v-integrin function at the cell surface.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	35	 To examine this possibility, we examined v-integrin function of mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p53, including their responsiveness to the v-integrin antagonist and compared them to mouse fibroblasts expressing p53.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	36	 2B, the responsiveness to the antagonist in inhibiting v-dependent attachment to vitronectin was virtually identical in p53 null fibroblasts and the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3, demonstrating that lack of p53 does not cause a general insensitivity to v-integrin antagonists.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	37	 These findings reveal that loss of p53 does not affect expression levels or general function of v-integrins.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Instead, we conclude that intracellular events involving p53 mediate the inhibition of neovascularization by v antagonists, events that may be related to the activation of endothelial cell p53 that we previously observed upon v-integrin blockage during angiogenesis (5).

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	46	Studies using targeted gene knockout mice have in some cases revealed surprising results in that expected phenotypes were not found.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	47	 This is particularly surprising for molecules found to play a role in certain in vivo events by previous loss of function studies, including for integrin v and the capacity for at least 20% of v-integrin null mice to form blood vessels (9) and for the capacity of integrin 3 and 5 subunit combinatorial gene knockouts to support enhanced pathological angiogenesis (10).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	48	 In some cases, combinatorial knockout of two or three related genes has demonstrated compensatory mechanisms by displaying phenotypes missing in single gene knockout mice.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	49	 However, it is unclear as to how the functions of v-integrins can be compensated for.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	50	 To this end, although it does not represent the only possible mechanism of v-integrin compensation, our finding that p53 null mice form blood vessels in the absence of functional v-integrins that are critical in wild type mice reveals the first in vivo example of an intracellular mechanism that is able to compensate for loss of integrin function.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	51	Alternatively, the function of v-integrins in neovascularization in wild type animals may be to negatively regulate and balance vessel formation in an unfavorable extracellular matrix environment in order to prevent angiogenesis in inappropriate locations.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Such a function of v-integrins would then lead to enhanced angiogenesis when v3 is lacking as suggested by Reynolds et al.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	53	 In support of this model, caspase-8 was activated at the cell surface in other cell types by unligated integrin v3, thereby causing apoptosis (15).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	54	 This mechanism might be related to p53, because caspase-8 plays a role in certain p53-induced apoptosis (16).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Nevertheless, in both alternative models for the function of v-integrins, our results suggest that p53 may mediate v-integrin regulation of cell survival during neovascularization.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	56	Neovascularization is a critical component of tumor growth, where a tumor is unable to grow beyond a minimal size without new blood vessels (17).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	57	 In fact, we previously observed that v-integrin antagonists could block the growth of human tumors in animal models (3, 4).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	58	 In addition, uncontrolled ocular neovascularization is a major cause of blindness in various ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, and age-related macular degeneration.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Integrins v3 and v5 may be involved in the regulation of neovascularization of these diseases as systemic treatment with v-integrin antagonists block retinal neovascularization (7, 8).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This suggests that v-integrin antagonists constitute a potential therapy for ocular diseases and cancer.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Our findings indicate that the molecular mechanism for this potential anti-angiogenic treatment actively involves p53, similar to what was recently indicated for angiostatin and TNP-470 (18-20).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	62	We were unable to detect apoptosis in the retinal vasculature because of an obscuring background with a large number of apoptotic cells in the whole mounts of developing retinas with no apparent differences between the groups (data not shown).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	63	 However, previous studies in other models clearly demonstrate that blocking of v-integrins during neovascularization leads to vascular cell apoptosis (3, 5).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	64	 This suggests that the inhibition of vessel formation by v antagonists may be caused by induction of apoptosis of the forming vascular cells, and the fact that vascular formation in p53 null mice is refractory to v antagonist treatment suggests that these vessels do not undergo apoptosis (Fig.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Whereas p53 may mediate v-integrin-regulated apoptosis in vascular cells, induction of p53 by loss of integrin ligation does not constitute a generic mechanism for regulation of cell survival in all cells and by all integrins.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	66	 For example, ligation of integrin 31 in an in vitro model of mammary epithelial cells lead to apoptosis only in the absence of functional p53 (21), a mechanism that appears to be the opposite of our findings on vascular cell integrin v3 and p53 during neovascularization.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	67	 In future studies, it will be interesting to elucidate whether downstream integrin signaling pathways such as activation of ERKs1 might be involved in the regulation of p53, because ERK1/2 signaling was identified as another critical v-integrin-mediated event during angiogenesis (22).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In addition, it remains to be elucidated whether the p53-mediated response to v antagonist treatment in vascular cells is functionally related to activation of caspase-8 by unligated v3 (15).

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	71	 In neovascularization of wild type animals (left), v3-and/or v5-integrins are activated (1, 2).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The v-integrins are then allowed to ligate to their provisional matrix, a ligation that is necessary to keep endothelial cell p53 inactive and cells surviving (vascularization is facilitated (3, 5)).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	73	 When v-integrins are blocked in wild type animals (middle) and thereby prevented from forming clusters, endothelial cell p53 activity is induced, and the vascular cells undergo apoptosis leading to a block of blood vessel formation (5).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	74	 However, when p53 is absent during vascularization, inhibition of v-integrins does not affect the formation of viable vessels (right).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Taken together, this suggests that p53 and v-integrins are linked into the same pathway in the control of blood vessel formation.

0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, October 1, 2003 , and in revised form, October 22, 2003.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	4	The tumor suppressor p53 is a sensor of diverse cellular stresses including DNA damage, oxidative stress, and hypoxia, and helps to direct cell cycle arrest and apoptosis at least in part through transcriptional activation of target genes like p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 (p21),1 GADD45, 14-3-3, and bax (2).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Not surprisingly, p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in a broad spectrum of cancers, and its inactivation is frequently associated with tumor progression, resistance to therapy, and poor prognosis.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, the p53 gene is rarely mutated in melanoma (3), and increased expression is associated with tumor progression (4).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Results from several studies suggest that the p53 pathway is dysregulated in melanoma cells, which in turn may lead to inactivation or alteration of p53 function (5).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	8	 For instance, many human melanoma cell lines containing wild type p53 showed abnormalities in the p53 pathway in response to -irradiation (6).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In recent years, studies have suggested that the retention of wild type p53 may actually confer resistance to therapy in a number of tumor systems (7).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, the role of p53 function in melanoma remains unclear.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	11	Activated p53 can bind to p53-responsive elements in the promoter of the potent cell-cycle regulator p21 and induce its expression (8).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	12	 When sufficiently expressed, p21 induces G1 arrest by direct binding of cyclin-dependent kinases (9).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Expression of p21 has been implicated as a survival mechanism against therapy (10).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	14	 For instance, inhibition of p21 by antisense technology sensitized glioblastoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents (11) and to radiation therapy (12).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	15	 p21 also appears to protect human colon carcinoma cells and prostate cancer cells against apoptosis (13, 14).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Additionally, there is evidence that p21 may protect against p53-mediated apoptosis in human melanoma cells (15).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The precise involvement of p21 in the resistance of melanoma to therapy remains largely undefined.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	18	Nitric oxide (NO) has recently been implicated in the regulation of p53.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Specifically, treating cells with NO donors resulted in conformational and functional changes and possible tyrosine nitration of p53 protein (16, 17).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In addition, it was shown that NO can regulate the ability of p53 to stimulate radiation-induced cell cycle arrest in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (18).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	21	 NO is generated as a reaction product of the enzymatic conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by three isotypes of NO synthase (NOS): endothelial (eNOS), neuronal (nNOS), and inducible (iNOS).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	22	 NOSs are expressed in various tissue types.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	23	 eNOS and nNOS are typically considered to be constitutively expressed, whereas iNOS, as its name implies, is inducible (19).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	24	 NO is involved in neurotransmission, vasodilation, inflammation, and immunity (20) and is also believed to play roles in multiple stages of various cancers (21).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	25	 It exhibits both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic characteristics, depending on concentration and cell type (22, 23).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Recently, NO has been shown to covalently modify proteins that can lead to regulation of activity, including caspases (24, 25), retinoblastoma protein (26), c-Src (27), and p53 (17).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	27	Our laboratory observed that the expression of iNOS and the presence of nitrotyrosine in tumor cells of melanoma patients correlated strongly with poor patient outcome (p  <  0.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	28	02, respectively) (28), suggesting an important role for NO in melanoma resistance to therapy.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Presently, samples from 103 patients with stage III and 36 patients with stage IV melanoma have been analyzed, and similar results have been obtained.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	30	2 Others have correlated NOS activity and iNOS expression with melanoma progression (29).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	31	 (30) provided evidence that endogenous NO may serve as a survival factor in human melanoma cells.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	32	Using human melanoma cell lines and cisplatin as a model system, we tested the hypothesis that NO regulates p53 signaling and is required in melanoma resistance to chemotherapy.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	33	 We present evidence that the depletion of endogenous NO in melanoma cell lines leads to increased sensitivity to cisplatin as a consequence of the inhibition of cisplatin-induced p53 accumulation and p21 expression.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Our findings support the hypothesis that NO is required for DNA damage-induced p53 activation, which acts as a protective factor against apoptosis in melanoma cells.

0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	215	  To determine whether p21 is activated via a cGMP-dependent pathway, ODQ, an inhibitor of NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase, was added to melanoma cells prior to cisplatin treatment.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Treatment with ODQ did not inhibit cisplatin-induced p21 expression.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Paradoxically, ODQ treatment appeared to enhance p53 accumulation and p21 expression.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Similarly, the addition of the plasma membrane permeant cGMP analog 8-bromo-cGMP reduced p21 expression slightly (Fig.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	219	 6, B and C), suggesting a possible regulatory role for cGMP in the induction of p21 via the p53 pathway.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	220	 ODQ and 8-bromo-cGMP treatments did not affect cell cycle distribution or the level of cisplatin-induced apoptosis (data not shown).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Taken together, these data strongly suggest that p21 expression is p53-dependent and not cGMP-dependent.

0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	228	 However, p21 expression in p53DN-transfected cells was reduced relative to control cells, suggesting that p53 function is partially inhibited.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Transfection of p53 siRNA also reduced p53 expression after cisplatin treatment.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	230	 However, the level of p53 reduction was not sufficient to enhance cisplatin-induced apoptosis (data not shown).

0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	237	Titration of the NO donor DETA illustrates the dichotomous role of NO in the regulation of proliferation.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Addition of 50  microM DETA led to an increase in proliferation, whereas higher levels of DETA ( > 150  microM) markedly inhibited proliferation.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	239	 It is now generally accepted that high levels of NO are toxic, whereas lower levels of NO may be growth promoting (reviewed in Refs.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	240	 40 and 41), although the threshold between low and high levels of NO is still dependent on the cell type and context within which NO is found.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	241	Our initial observations that NO depletion and cisplatin treatment resulted in reduced proliferation in melanoma cells led us to evaluate whether the effect was attributable to apoptosis.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	242	 A number of groups have reported both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic properties of NO, depending on cell type and experimental system (22, 23, 42 to 45).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	243	 We observed that NO depletion by c-PTIO or oxymyoglobin treatment was capable of enhancing cisplatin-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	244	 However, when NOS inhibitors, including L-NMMA, AMG, and 1400W, were used to block NO production in melanoma cells, they were only minimally effective in enhancing apoptosis after cisplatin treatment.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	245	 (30) found that serum completely suppresses the apoptotic effect of AMG in melanoma cells, so it is possible that serum components interfere with NOS inhibitor activity or complicate its chemistry.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Albumin can act as a NO reservoir, and may control NO-dependent processes in the vasculature (46).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Various thiol containing proteins and low molecular weight thiols such as glutathione may also act as a NO store and selectively release NO to maintain cellular NO levels (47).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Use of a chemical NO scavenger would nullify NO stores by quickly reacting with any newly released NO, whereas inhibition of NO production by NOS does not deplete possible cellular NO storage mechanisms.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Another possibility is that c-PTIO possesses some secondary reactivity (48).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	250	 However, the lack of effect of quenched NO scavenger controls and the similar effects of oxymyoglobin on melanoma cells strongly suggest that NO is the causal agent in our observations.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	251	Analysis of cell cycle alterations showed that NO depletion by c-PTIO resulted in significant G2 arrest in A375 melanoma cells.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	252	 This sustained G2 arrest was subsequently accompanied by an increase in apoptosis.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Cell cycle alterations were also shown to result from NO depletion in pulmonary cells (49).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	254	 The precise involvement of NO in cell cycle regulation is not known.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	255	 However, a number of cell cycle regulators appear to be targets of NO, the most prominent of which is retinoblastoma protein (26).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Accumulation of melanoma cells at the G1/S boundary after cisplatin treatment and a trend toward the return to a normal cell cycle distribution after 36 h suggest that melanoma cells are capable of responding to and possibly repairing DNA damage.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Our data suggest that p53 response to DNA damage is at least partially intact, as evidenced by the stabilization and nuclear accumulation of p53 after cisplatin treatment and by the subsequent expression of p21.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	258	 NO-depleted melanoma cells did not accumulate at the G1/S boundary after cisplatin treatment.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Instead, cells slowly progressed to the S and G2/M phases, which may be explained by the concomitant loss of cisplatin-induced p21 expression.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	260	We found that NO depletion in melanoma cells led to reduced p53 accumulation and activation after cisplatin treatment in all melanoma cell lines tested.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	261	 NO depletion also reduced overexpression of mutated p53 in MeWo melanoma cells, which suggests that NO can regulate both wild type and mutant p53 (data not shown).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	262	 In SK-MEL-1 melanoma cells, which exhibit altered p53 and p21 regulation, NO depletion with c-PTIO inhibited basal p21 overexpression and cisplatin-induced p53 accumulation in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	263	 These data suggest that NO may regulate p53 and p21 regardless of their functional or mutational status.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	264	p53 and iNOS were shown to participate in a negative regulatory loop (50).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Specifically, NO was able to activate p53, which in turn inhibited iNOS expression.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	266	 This observation led to the suggestion that in tumors expressing NOS, there may be a selective pressure to acquire p53 mutations (51).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	267	 This appears not to be the case in melanoma, in which iNOS is upregulated and p53 mutations are rare.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	268	 The precise mechanism through which NO modulates the p53 signal transduction pathway remains to be clarified.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Our data suggest that NO is required for proper stabilization and activation of p53 protein, which may exert a protective role against therapy.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	270	NO is likely to interact directly with p53 or regulate signaling components upstream of p53.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	271	 In MCF-7 cells, NO donor treatment resulted in possible tyrosine nitration of p53 and improved DNA binding at low donor levels (0.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	272	5 mM), but inhibited DNA binding at higher donor concentrations (1 to 5 mM) (16), which alludes to some possibly complex interaction between p53 and NO.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Superoxide, known to be up-regulated in melanoma (52), reacts quickly with NO to form peroxynitrite, a potent oxidizing agent capable of nitrating tyrosines (53).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	274	 A recent study that focused on the influence of superoxide on nitrosylation reactions may add insight to the exquisite edge on which NO is balanced (32).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	275	 NO may also regulate phosphorylation of p53 in response to DNA damage (55, 56).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	276	 In addition, cysteines present in the zinc finger DNA binding motifs of p53 may be susceptible to nitrosylation by NO, leading to alterations in p53 function.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	277	Recently, NO was shown to inhibit Hdm2-p53 binding (57).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Hdm2 (Mdm2 in mouse) binds p53 to inhibit its transcriptional activity, ubiquitinates p53 to regulate its stability, and plays a pivotal role in determining p53 localization.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Nitrosylation of cysteine 77 in the hydrophobic p53-binding pocket of Hdm2 is thought to interfere with p53 binding.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Hdm2 has also been found to be up-regulated in some melanoma cells containing wild type p53 (58).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	281	 These findings suggest that NO is involved in the regulation of p53 stability, which may help to explain how the depletion of endogenous NO inhibits cisplatin-induced p53 accumulation in melanoma cells.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Whether endogenous NO inhibits Hdm2-p53 interaction in melanoma cells remains to be determined.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	283	 NO may regulate the activity of p53 upstream effectors such as ataxia telangectasia mutant kinase, AT-mutated and Rad3-related kinase, and DNA-PK.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	284	 For example, NO was shown to activate DNA-PKc to protect against DNA damage (59).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Whether NO regulates the activity of these DNA damage-activated kinases in melanoma cells is not known.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	286	We found that NO depletion, in addition to inhibiting p53 induction, strongly inhibited the cisplatin-induced expression of p21, a downstream target of p53.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	287	 NO is capable of activating p21 via p53 or cGMP pathways (60, 61).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	288	 We observed that inhibition of p21 expression by NO depletion consistently correlated with reduced p53 accumulation.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	289	 NO depletion resulted in the near abrogation of p53 binding to the p53-binding site of the p21 promoter.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Inhibition of p53 by siRNA or dominant negative p53 expression also reduced p21 expression.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	291	 p53 and p21 expression, cell cycle distribution, and the level of apoptosis after cisplatin treatment were not altered by either ODQ or 8-bromo-cGMP.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Furthermore, melanoma cells frequently do not express the NO-sensitive isoform of soluble guanylyl cyclase, which responds to NO to generate cGMP and subsequently induce p21 expression (62).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Taken together, these data strongly suggests that p21 is activated in a p53-dependent manner in melanoma cells with wild type p53 and that the cGMP signaling pathway is not involved.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Whether p21 is a direct target for modification by NO or its derivatives is not known.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	295	Numerous studies have highlighted the ability of p21 to protect glioblastomas, gliomas, colon carcinomas, prostate cancer (14), and melanomas from apoptosis-inducing stimuli.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	296	 p21 was also found to be overexpressed and is rarely mutated in melanoma (54, 63).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Our data show that p53 and p21 are upregulated in melanoma in response to DNA damage by cisplatin, which suggests that melanoma cells actively respond to genotoxic insult by inducing cell cycle arrest and possibly carrying out DNA repair, thus avoiding cell death.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Transfection of a dominant negative form of p53 into A375 melanoma cells resulted in a substantial increase in cisplatin sensitivity as well as a reduction of p21 expression after cisplatin treatment, confirming that p53 activation following exposure to cisplatin protects melanoma cells from apoptosis.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Inhibition of p53 by siRNA only partially reduced cisplatin-induced p53 and p21 expression, which was not sufficient to enhance apoptosis after cisplatin treatment.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Transfection of mutated p53 into melanoma cells has a dominant effect, which is not the case in siRNA transfection.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Cells transfected with siRNA may still produce low levels of wild type p53, and thus could still be capable of responding to DNA damage.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Indeed, we observed that p53 siRNA-transfected cells still expressed p21, albeit at a lower concentration (data not shown).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	303	Based on our data we present a model for the mechanism of melanoma resistance to cisplatin treatment (Fig.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	304	 In this model, NO is a key factor in the p53-dependent activation of p21 expression after cisplatin-induced DNA damage.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Expression of p21 results in a skewing of cellular response toward cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and cell survival, and away from apoptosis.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Inhibition of p21 can result in the loss of G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and can lead to the induction of apoptosis.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Therefore, the regulation of its expression by NO via the p53 signaling pathway may be of extreme importance in melanoma resistance to therapy.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	308	 In this case, the ability of p53 to induce p21 would determine whether tumor cells are protected against genotoxic insult.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	309	 These insights offer several potential pathways to target for future therapies against melanomas containing wild type p53.

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	5	The involvement of Mpl-L (also known as thrombopoietin or TPO) and its receptor Mpl in early hematopoiesis is consistent with the following observations: (1) Mpl is expressed on the AA4+ Sca+ subpopulation of murine hematopoietic stem cells6; (2) Mpl-L stimulates the expansion of very immature precursors both in vitro and in vivo; and (3) Mpl and Mpl-L are required for optimal multilineage hematopoietic development, as well as for thrombocytopoietic differentiation.

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	135	Previous studies reported that Bax expression is induced in radiosensitive tissues following irradiation.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	136	25 By contrast, we observed that carboplatin and -IR, with or without administration of PEG-rmMGDF, did not affect the steady-state level of Bax protein in bone marrow cells.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	137	 These results, however, did not rule out the possibility that small changes in Bax expression and/or posttranslational modifications could significantly regulate the apoptotic response to this myelosuppressive regimen.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	138	 To assess the role of Bax in p53-mediated apoptosis in our myelosuppression model, we measured the survival and the hematopoietic recovery of Bax/ mice exposed to carboplatin and -IR, and whether PEG-rmMGDF affects this response.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Similar to WT littermate animals, Bax/ mice were highly susceptible to the lethal effects of this DNA-damaging regimen.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Assessment of platelet counts, WBC counts, and hemoglobin levels indicated that Bax/ mice died due to hematopoietic failure (Figure 6A-C) (confirmed in 2 independent experiments).
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Interestingly, Bax/ mice treated with PEG-rmMGDF exhibited a more rapid recovery of hemoglobin levels (on day 14, P  <  .

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Thus, although clearly not required, Bax appears to play some role in p53-dependent apoptosis in this myelosuppression model.

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	152	Atm is a member of the PI-3' serine/threonine kinase family that phosphorylates and activates p53 in response to certain DNA damage signals.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	153	25,26 Loss of Atm in mice and humans is typically associated with attenuated p53 responsiveness and impaired cell cycle arrest.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Paradoxically, Atm/ mice display remarkable susceptibility to DNA-damaging insults,27,28 which appears to be cell-type specific and largely attributable to increased gastrointestinal sensitivity.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	155	29 Since p53-null bone marrow progenitors are resistant to DNA damage, we tested whether loss of Atm would also influence the response of bone marrow-derived progenitors to carboplatin and -IR.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	156	 To this end, we assessed the responses of WT mice receiving Atm/, p53/, p53+/, or WT bone marrow transplants to DNA damage.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Animals transplanted with Atm/ marrow and treated with PEG-rmMGDF succumbed earlier to the myelosuppressive regimen than did similarly treated mice transplanted with p53+/ and WT bone marrow, whereas all mice receiving p53/ transplants survived without PEG-rmMGDF treatment (Figure 7).

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The inability of Atm/ bone marrow cells to properly arrest in response to DNA damage presumably overrode the protective effects of Mpl-L, resulting in dramatically earlier hematopoietic death of all Atm/ mice.

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	164	The mechanism by which Mpl-L protects animals from a lethal myelosuppressive regimen has not been previously established.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Myelosuppressive agents such as chemotherapy and -IR are known to activate p53-dependent apoptosis.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	166	14,15,30 Because Mpl is expressed on multipotential hematopoietic progenitors7-9,31 and its ligand, TPO, prevents apoptosis of these progenitors in vitro,11-13 we hypothesized that Mpl-L protects mice by preventing p53-dependent cell death.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	167	 If this hypotheses is correct, then Mpl-L administration should not provide greater protection to hematopoiesis in p53/ mice, as compared with carrier-treated p53-null animals, following a myeloablative regimen.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Our findings support this hypothesis: when exposed to the same myelosuppressive insult, p53-deficient mice survived without Mpl-L treatment, whereas WT mice died.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Furthermore, p53/ mice subjected to the myelosuppression regimen and treated with Peg-rmMGDF had the same degree of myelosuppression and hematopoietic recovery profile as the p53/ mice given the myelosuppressive regimen and carrier alone.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	170	 These findings indicate that Mpl-L is acting to suppress p53-dependent apoptosis in vivo.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	171	The increased resistance of p53-deficient mice to the carboplatin and -IR regimen is consistent with the results of other investigators who have noted that p53/ mice survive 10 Gy of -IR, a dose that is lethal to WT mice.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	172	17 Correlative evidence has suggested that the radioresistance of p53-deficient mice is a consequence of reduced apoptosis of bone marrow cells.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	173	16,18 The results of our transplantation studies with p53-deficient marrow provide direct proof that the loss of p53 indeed protects mice from lethal myelosuppression; the results also suggest that p53-dependent apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitors leads to hematopoietic failure and death.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Nonetheless, carboplatin- and -IR-treated p53/ mice experienced substantial myelosuppression, indicating that hematopoietic cells also die by a p53-independent pathway(s).
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	175	We observed interesting differences between the hematopoietic responses of p53-deficient mice given PEG-rmMGDF or carrier versus WT mice given PEG-rmMGDF after the myelosuppressive regimen.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Hemoglobin concentration and WBC counts were reduced to a greater extent in WT mice given PEG-rmMGDF than in p53-deficient mice given PEG-rmMGDF or carrier alone.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	177	 By contrast, the degree of thrombocytopenia in these 3 groups was virtually identical.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	178	 We speculate that this difference reflects the disparate patterns of Mpl expression on the various hematopoietic progenitors.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	179	9,10 In that case, all p53-null multipotential hematopoietic progenitors and committed precursors would be protected from p53-dependent apoptosis, whereas in the normal phenotype, only hematopoietic cells that express Mpl would be protected by Mpl-L.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	180	 If this view is correct, then concomitant administration of Mpl-L in combination with erythropoietin and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) immediately after a myelosuppressive insult might optimally reduce the degree of suppression of all 3 committed hematopoietic lineages.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	181	The number of bone marrow-derived colonies generated by cultures with IL-3 was substantially higher in mice that received PEG-rmMGDF after the myelosuppression regimen than carrier-only controls; this finding suggests that Mpl-L protects hematopoietic progenitors.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In contrast, the assays of bone marrow-derived colonies generated from myelosuppressed, Mpl-L-treated p53/ mice compared with carrier-treated p53/ mice demonstrated no additional protective effect of Mpl-L on colony formation.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	183	 These results support the conclusion from our in vivo experiments that Mpl-L is acting to suppress p53-dependent apoptosis of hematopoietic cells in vivo.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	184	Our analysis of protein expression provides insight into how Mpl-L prevents p53-dependent apoptosis after the myelosuppressive regimen.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The increase in p53 protein levels in bone marrow cells in response to carboplatin and -IR was unaffected by Mpl-L administration, indicating that PEG-rmMGDF did not protect hematopoietic cells by directly suppressing p53 expression.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Furthermore, the induction of p21Cip1 expression was not enhanced in carboplatin/radiation-treated WT mice after PEG-rmMGDF injection.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	187	 These results indicate that Mpl-L does not interfere with the p53 pathway at the level of p53-induction; rather, the cytokine appears to protect bone marrow cells by suppressing p53 function at a downstream step.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that cytokines, such as IL-3 and erythropoietin, protect against p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage by inducing the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, both of which are potent suppressors of cell death.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	189	32,33 These findings support the hypothesis that cytokines block p53-mediated cell death by antagonizing downstream target genes, such as Bax or other proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	190	Because Bax is directly transactivated by p53 and promotes apoptosis,21,34 we also tested the role of this gene by using Bax-deficient mice in our myelosuppression model.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	191	 We found that Bax is constitutively expressed in mouse bone marrow cells and that Bax levels are not affected by carboplatin plus -IR, or by the administration of PEG-rmMGDF.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Consistent with these findings, Bax deficiency did not protect the animals from the lethal dose of carboplatin and -IR.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	193	 However, when PEG-rmMGDF was given, platelet counts, WBC counts, and hemoglobin levels recovered more rapidly in Bax/ mice than in WT mice, indicating that Bax does play a proapoptotic role in the response of multipotential hematopoietic cells to this myelosuppressive regimen.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	194	 These findings convincingly demonstrate that loss of Bax is not equivalent to loss of p53 in protecting against lethal myelosuppression and that other downstream factors must mediate p53-dependent apoptosis under these conditions.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	195	The increased radiosensitivity of ATM/ mice has been attributed to the high level of apoptosis induced in the gastrointestinal tract of these mice29; however, the fact that recipients of Atm/ bone marrow transplants died at an accelerated rate after the myelosuppressive regimen, and were not protected by PEG-rmMGDF, indicates marrow toxicity plays a major role in the increased sensitivity of these mice to DNA-damaging agents.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	196	In summary, our observations indicate that Mpl-L administered immediately after a lethal myelosuppressive regimen promotes the survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells in vivo by attenuating p53-dependent apoptosis.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Myelosuppression is a toxicity-limiting component of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, and a major clinical problem in autologous bone marrow transplantation regimens.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Administration of Mpl-L during these DNA-damaging treatments should suppress the p53 response, thereby alleviating the severity of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia and the need for platelet transfusions.

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	4	The majority of inactivating mutations reside in the central core DNA binding domain (DBD)1 of p53 (2, 5).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	5	 These mutations can be divided into two main classes, DNA contact mutants, like R273H, where the mutation alters a residue involved in contact with DNA, and structural mutants, like R249S, which result in structural changes in the p53 core domain (6 to 8).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	6	 These mutations affect the function of p53 by distorting the structure and reducing the thermal stability of the protein (6 to 8).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This can alter the ability of p53 to bind to various p53 response elements in a variety of genes, hampering its transcriptional regulation (9).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In addition, these mutations may alter p53 structure, so that p53 can no longer induce apoptosis by binding to BclXL, thereby inhibiting its anti-apoptotic function (10).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	9	One potential therapeutic approach to cancer would be restoration of growth suppression activity to mutant p53.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Several approaches have been tried, ranging from micro-injection of monoclonal antibody 421, C-terminal peptide of p53 and small molecules (11 to 16).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Recently, small molecules and peptides, such as CP-31398, PRIMA1, and CDB3 peptide, have been shown to be effective in restoring p53 function (17 to 25).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Both PRIMA1 and CDB3 have been shown to restore p53 DNA-binding activity in vitro (18 to 21), whereas the effects for CP-31398 have been shown primarily in cell-based assays (17, 22 to 25).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Both CP-31398 and PRIMA1 have been shown to reduce tumor size in animal models (17, 18).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	14	 It is postulated that the two molecules perform similar tasks, but by different mechanisms.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	15	 PRIMA1 has been suggested to work more broadly to restore p53 DNA-binding activity, but the specific mechanism is not known (18).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	16	 CP-31398, on the other hand, has been suggested to stabilize p53 as a protectant against thermal denaturation and maintain monoclonal antibody 1620 epitope conformation in newly synthesized p53 (17).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Recently, CP-31398 has also been shown to stabilize wild type p53 in cells by inhibiting Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation (23).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Reports from other studies suggest that CP-31398 interacts with DNA and not with p53 in vitro, and it is proposed to act as a DNA-damaging agent (26).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Although it has been shown that the effects of CP-31398 on p53 do not depend on the DNA damage pathway (23), its p53-independent cellular growth suppression effects at higher concentrations and lack of demonstrated binding to p53 protein raise confusion about its mechanism of action (24 to 26).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Here we demonstrate that CP-31398 can promote mutant p53 to bind to p53 response elements in vivo using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In addition, using purified p53 core domain, we clearly demonstrate that CP-31398 can restore DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in vitro.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	22	 We also show that CP-31398 does not have any effects on the DNA-binding activity of the p53 homologs, p63 and p73.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In contrast, PRIMA1 was ineffective in restoring DNA-binding activity to isolated mutant p53 DNA binding domain.

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	168	 In the presence of 500 nM CP-31398 both mutants showed a dramatic increase in DNA binding, with the Bmax (R273H: 8890  plus or minus  1242 alone versus 108,047  plus or minus  8309 with CP-31398; R249S: 8031  plus or minus  739 alone versus 133,187  plus or minus  12,614 with CP-31398) increasing severalfold.

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	174	  To see if this effect was specific for the p53 consensus DNA binding sequence, the p53 DNA binding site from the Bax promoter was substituted for the consensus site in the assay.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	175	 The p53 binding site in the Bax promoter (referred to as the bax site) has been reported to have a lower affinity for p53, and it binds p53 to a much lesser extent than the consensus binding sequence (9, 29).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	176	 First we confirmed the effect of CP-31398 on wild type protein using the bax site (Fig.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	177	 As with the consensus DNA the affinity of wild type p53 (Kd) for the bax site did not change in the presence of 500 nM CP-31398 (106.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	178	71 with CP-31398), but the Bmax did (224,602  plus or minus  19,026 alone versus 353,797  plus or minus  26,649 with CP-31398).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	179	 We assayed an R273H mutant protein with the bax site (Fig.

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	189	  Effects of CP-31398 on p63 and p73 One potential issue with CP-31398 is that it tends to be cytotoxic at doses over 15  microg/ml in a p53-independent manner (17, 23 to 25).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Part of this cytotoxicity could be due to effects on the p53 homologs, p63 and p73.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	191	 To see if CP-31398 had any effect on p63 or p73, we cloned and expressed the DNA binding domains of both proteins as GST fusions (29) (Fig.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	192	 6A) and confirmed their activity in EMSA (Fig.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	193	 We then evaluated the effects of CP-31398 using the bax site in the binding assay, along with wild type p53 as a comparison.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	194	 We also tested the peptide CDB3 at similar concentrations as CP-31398 to see if it to would have an effect on p63 and p73 similar to its reported effects on p53 (19 to 21).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	195	 7A), CP-31398 and CDB3 altered the Bmax (Table I), but not the Kd of wild type p53 binding to the Bax DNA.

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	197	 This suggests that CP-31398 and CDB3 do not interact with either p63 or p73 DNA binding domain, thus excluding a role for activation of p53 homologs in the cytotoxicity of CP-31398.

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	206	Here we show that CP-31398 can promote p53-mediated apoptosis and induce the expression of p53-specific genes such as p21 and bax in cells with mutant p53 in a similar fashion as has been reported (22 to 25).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	207	 We also show that CP-31398 has the ability to restore sequence-specific DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in the compound-treated nuclear extract in vitro in a manner similar to previous reports (25).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	208	 In addition, using a ChIP assay, we demonstrate that CP-31398 can promote the binding of mutant p53 to the response elements in p53-regulated genes in cells.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The binding of p53 to both p21 and bax promoter, and the failure of p53 to bind the S9 ribosomal protein promoter, indicate that CP-31398 interacts specifically with p53, and not DNA as had been previously suggested (26).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	210	 CP-31398 can functionally restore mutant p53 to make capable of acting like wild type p53 and interact with both high (p21) and low (bax) affinity promoters (9, 30).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	211	 The relatively high concentrations of CP-31398 needed for cellular experiments reported here and elsewhere (22 to 26) are indicative of a possible unstable nature of CP-31398 (26).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	212	Our studies with the purified p53 DNA binding domain of wild type and mutant p53 clearly show that CP-31398 restores DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 core domain by increasing both Bmax and Kd values of the reaction.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Interestingly, the compound stimulates the DNA-binding activity of wild type protein without having any effects on affinity for DNA.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	214	 With the wild type protein, Bmax is increased (1.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	215	5-fold) but the Kd remains the same in the presence of the compound, whereas with both R273H and R249S mutants, Bmax is more greatly increased than Kd ( > 10-fold).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	216	 This indicates that CP-31398 acts as a "non-competitive agonist," binding to the proteins, and alters the rate of the reaction and the amount of protein capable of binding to DNA, but not affecting the affinity of the protein for DNA.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Such a result suggests an allosteric mechanism, where binding of the compound to a site away from the protein-DNA interface can cause the protein to be placed into a conformation capable of binding DNA (32).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	218	 As with CDB3, CP-31398 affects mutant protein binding to DNA in a similar way bringing the Kd of the mutant p53 for DNA to a similar level as wild type.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The variations in the effect are mainly due to the affinity of the individual mutants for the particular p53 DNA binding site.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	220	 R273H, which maintains a nearly wild type conformation, has the ability to transactivate from a consensus p53 DNA binding site but has a much reduced ability to transactivate and bind other sites like bax that have a much lower affinity for p53 than the consensus sequence (7 to 9).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	221	This non-competitive allosteric activation fits into the model suggested by Freidler et al.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	222	 (20), where CP-31398, like CDB3 peptide, functions as a chaperone, enables p53 to fold into an active conformation that is capable of binding DNA.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	223	 What occurs after DNA binding is a source of speculation.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	224	 By Freidler's model (20), the compound should be displaced by the structural rearrangement that p53 undergoes once it binds DNA.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	225	 (33) has shown that CDB3 binds to wild type and mutant (R249S and R273H) in the same manner, at a site that is away from the protein-DNA interface, and away from the site distorted by the R249S mutation.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Thus, CDB3 exerting its effect via a long range conformational change and binding to a site that is different than the natural ligand, DNA, is an allosteric mechanism.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	227	In addition, CP-31398 has been shown to inhibit MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53, possibly by blocking Mdm2 interaction with the core domain of p53 (23, 25).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Because binding of Mdm2 to the N terminus of p53 causes a conformational rearrangement of p53 and allows for access to its core domain, CP-31398 may prevent such rearrangements.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	229	 In addition, maintenance of wild type conformation may promote binding of the p53 core domain to BclXL (10).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	230	The major difference between CP-31398, CDB3, and PRIMA1, is that PRIMA1 seems not to bind to p53 core domain.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	231	 In our assay, PRIMA1 fails to stimulate DNA binding with just the DNA binding domain.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Others have reported that PRIMA1 only works with full-length protein and fails to interact with the DNA binding domain (18, 21).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	233	 A recent report (34) showed that PRIMA1 could induce apoptosis in the absence of new protein synthesis.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	234	 This suggests that compounds that alter the active conformation of p53 and turn it into a more wild type protein may also exert their influence by making p53 capable of interacting with BclXL and BH3 domain-containing proteins to help mediate mitochondrial depolarization (10, 34, and 35).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Given the nature of p53, it is likely that binding somewhere other than the DNA binding domain could exert effects on the DNA binding domain.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	236	 It has been suggested that binding occurs just outside of the DNA binding domain or in the tetramerization domain (18).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	237	 One possible effect is that it could promote and stabilize p53 tetramers in a conformation that is sufficient for the protein to function in DNA binding or in mitochondrial depolarization.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	238	CP-31398 and CDB3 appear to be more specific for p53 than p63 and p73.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Both p63 and p73 have homologous DNA binding domains as p53, but there are some amino acid differences between the proteins (29).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	240	 A comparison between models of p53 DNA binding domain and p63 DNA binding domain indicates that p63 has a more thermostable hydrophobic core, making the protein significantly more stable than p53 (29).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	241	 This is apparent from the fact that p63 and p73 protein can be expressed in soluble form at relatively high temperatures compared with p53 (29).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Interestingly, there are second site suppressor mutations that can restore DNA-binding activity to some oncogenic mutants of p53 (36 to 38).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Recently, a crystal structure of a quadruple mutant of p53 provides an explanation how loss of hydrogen bonds in V143A, a temperature-sensitive mutant, can be compensated by second site mutation N268D.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The suppressor mutation N268D not only increases the overall stability of the oncogenic mutant but also induces local change to the protein initially caused by the loss of two methyl groups of V143A (38).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	245	 This is a possible mechanism for compounds like CP-31398 and CDB3.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Their interaction with the p53 core may provide energetically favorable compensatory hydrogen bonds and increase overall stability of many oncogenic mutants and, by doing so, restore wild type function.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Given that the hydrophobic cores of p63 and p73 are stable, there may not be a site where the compounds can bind and act to give additional stability.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	248	We have shown that CP-31398 can affect the DNA-binding activity of both wild type and mutant p53 in vivo and in vitro.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	249	 We also have observed that DNA binding is restored to both DNA contact mutant (R273H) and structural mutant (R249S) by the compound, and the effect is more pronounced in a structural mutant (R249S).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	250	 These effects seem to be specific to p53, because both CP-31398 and CDB3 do not affect the activity of p63 and p73.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	251	 By developing a DNA binding assay with CP-31398 and mutant p53, we can potentially look for compounds that perform similar activities to CP-31398 and CDB3 but do not have the liabilities and side effects of these molecules.

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Viral onco-proteins, such as the adenoviral E1A and SV40 T antigen, possess high affinity for specific binding sites with p300 (6), which results in the loss of cell growth control, enhancement of DNA synthesis, and blocks in cellular differentiation (7).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	6	 There are data implicating altered p300 gene expression in an array of human tumors (5).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	7	 p300 contains three broad functional domains including: (i) an acetyltransferase domain that mediates substrate acetylation; (ii) a bromodomain, which is implicated in binding to acetylated amino acids; and (iii) a variety of LXXLL, PXXP, and other transactivation peptide-binding domains.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The coordinated function of these domains is thought to mediate the role of p300 as a bridge, scaffold, and/or catalyst for binding to transcriptional components and the activation of gene expression.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	9	The tetrameric nature of p53, its allosteric properties, the enzymatic activity of p300 involved in its activation of p53, and the multiple transactivation peptide-binding domains of p300 make the p300:p53 complex an attractive model to understand the dynamic nature of a biological machine, an important goal in the dissection of the proteome.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The molecular mechanism by which p53 tetramers interact with p300 and how this modulates acetylation are beginning to be defined biochemically.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Reconstitution of purified forms of the p300:p53 protein complex in vitro followed by validation in vivo have identified sequential stages in p300:p53 complex dynamics and include: (i) docking-dependent phosphorylation of the LXXLL motif at Thr-18 or Ser-20 by enzymes of the calcium-calmodulin superfamily such as CHK2 and CHK1 (8); (ii) stabilization of p300 binding to the p53 activation domain by phosphorylation at Thr-18 or Ser-20 (9); (iii) anchoring of p300 to the contiguous phospho-LXXLL and PXXP activation domains in p53 (10); (iv) sequence-specific DNA binding by p53, which induces a conformational change in the tetramer, forcing acetylation to be DNA-dependent and PXXP-dependent (10); and (v) acetylation of DNA-bound p53 that in turn stabilizes the p300:acetylated p53:DNA complex (11).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	12	 How this multidomain scaffold arranges itself onto an "octavalent" substrate such as p53 is not known, nor is it known how acetylation of the native p53 oligomer can be constrained in the absence of consensus site DNA.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The ability of IF-1 protein to bind to p300 and stimulate p53 acetylation by a novel allosteric mechanism (see also Ref.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	14	 22) further highlights the multifaceted and dynamic nature of the p300:p53 complex assembly.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	15	 To continue dissecting out how p300 can bind to p53, we have mapped the various Ser-20-phospho-LXXLL and PXXP peptide-binding domains of p300 and have found them to map to regions distinct from the classic C/H1 and C/H3 p53 activation-binding domains (10).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These peptide-binding regions in p300, in turn, are distinct from the binding of IRF-1 activation domain interfaces on p300 (see also Ref.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Together with mapping data from other approaches, these data identify at least eight peptide-binding minidomains of p300 that can contact p53 including C/H1, C/H3, IBiD,1 IHD, SPC-1, SPC-2, KIX, and Bromo.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	18	The major Ser-20-phospho-LXXLL p53-binding domains of p300 have been mapped to the C-terminal IBiD (12) and N-terminal IHD scaffolds (11).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Both of these miniproteins can function as dominant negative inhibitors of p300-coactivated stimulation of p53-depednent gene expression in cells (11).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, only the C-terminal IBiD domain has been examined structurally (12).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The IBiD scaffold was defined by mapping regions of p300 that bind to phosphorylated activation domain fragments from IRF-3, although the miniprotein can also bind to non-phosphorylated activation domain fragments of other proteins.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This apparent lack of "sequence specificity" in IBiD miniprotein binding to activation domain peptides is rationalized by the ability of unstructured activation domain peptides to acquire structure by an induced fit mechanism upon scaffold binding.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Thus, it may be the capacity of a peptide to form a helix that makes it a good IBiD-binding motif.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The structure and minimal LXXLL peptide binding activity of the N-terminal IHD miniprotein are not known, nor is it known whether the IHD scaffold has intrinsic peptide consensus site for selected polypeptides.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Characterization of IHD and determination of whether it has a stringent peptide-docking site consensus site will advance dissection of the p300:p53 complex assembly.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In this report, we define the minimal IHD scaffold to a 75-aminoacid fragment with homology to the minimal IBiD region of p300, demonstrate that IHD can contact the LXXLL region of p53 by a variety of assays including inhibition of IRF-1 reactivation of p53PRO, and demonstrate by phage-peptide display that the IHD miniprotein prefers a consensus peptide motif with significant homology to the LXXLL motif of p53.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These data indicate that IHD is a bona fide LXXLL-p53 scaffold that promotes the formation of transcriptionally active complex between p53 and the co-activator p300.

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	124	  One notable feature of p53 acetylation is the DNA dependence in the acetylation reaction (11).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	125	 These data suggest that DNA binding changes the conformation of p53 to permit a more stable docking of p300 to p53.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	126	 In fact, sequence-specific DNA can stabilize full-length p300 binding to p53 in the absence of acetyl-CoA (11).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	127	 We tested whether the purified IHD miniprotein bound more stably to p53 in the presence of consensus site DNA.

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	129	 These data suggest that the reason DNA stabilizes the p300:p53 complex can be attributed, at least in part, to an enhanced affinity of the IHD miniprotein for the LXXLL activation domain in p53.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	130	 The ability of DNA to change the conformation of p53 in the LXXLL domain identifies an allosteric effect in p53, in particular identifying an interaction between the LXXLL-containing transactivation domain and the core DNA-binding domain.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	131	We next evaluated whether IHD can bind to the transactivation domain of p53 as defined by its ability to interfere with MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, which binds to overlapping amino acids in the activation domain (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	132	 MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 (Fig.

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	136	 3C, lanes 4 and 5 versus lanes 2 and 3) can also be attenuated by IHD in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	137	 3D, lanes 2 to 4 versus lane 1).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Together, these data identify three biochemical properties of the IHD miniprotein (amino acids 401 to 566), suggestive of its ability to interact with the LXXLL transactivation domain of p53 tetramers: (i) enhanced affinity for serine 20 phosphorylated p53 tetramers; (ii) DNA-stimulated IHD-p53 tetramer complex stabilization; and (iii) sterical occlusion of MDM2 from the p53 transactivation domain and inhibition of MDM2-catalyzed ubiquitination.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	139	The LXXLL binding activity associated with IHD miniprotein was fine mapped by constructing progressive deletions of the IHD coding region (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	140	 This was required to determine which region of the 17-kDa IHD miniprotein was primarily responsible for LXXLL binding activity, especially in comparison with its homology domain in the C terminus, IBiD.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The IBiD domain of p300 was localized to a 46-amino-acid fragment that has homology to the extreme N terminus of IHD (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	142	 The GAL4-VP16 in vivo two-hybrid assay was used to evaluate the specific activity of the IHD miniprotein fragments, rather than in vitro-specific activity, since expression of the IHD deletion fragments from Escherichia coli proved relatively difficult (data not shown).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	143	 In comparing the in vivo-specific activity of the IHD miniprotein and its deletion derivatives for LXXLL-containing peptides, two other peptide-binding domains were evaluated: (i) IBiD, which binds to phosphorylated activation domain fragments from IRF-3 as well as non-phosphorylated fragments of other activation domains (12) and (ii) SPC-1 (site for proline contact (10), a C-terminal minidomain of p300 containing only half of the C/H3 domain and amino acid sequences without the classic C/H3 domain) that was identified previously as having LXXLL peptide binding activity despite lacking the N-terminal 56 amino acids of the standard C/H3 domain (164 amino acids in length).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	144	 As a control for the two-hybrid assay, MyoD fused to VP16 displayed affinity for its peptide sequence in inhibitor of DNA binding when fused to GAL4 (Fig.

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	161	 4E; data not shown), suggesting that competition for endogenous LXXLL-binding proteins can effect the GAL4-VP16 interaction.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	162	 The most extreme deletion of the IHD miniprotein (amino acids 401 to 427) well into the motif with homology to IBiD (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	163	 1B) inactivates the LXXLL binding activity associated with the miniprotein (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Interestingly, this region of IHD maps to the first helix in the IBiD domain required for IBiD activity (12) and suggests that the minimal IHD domain directly overlaps with a similar primary structure in IBiD, despite the fact that the entire 165-amino-acid fragment within IHD and IBiD share homology.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The IHD miniprotein that retained the most significant activity was IHD-(401 to 475) (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	166	 4), thus localizing the major LXXLL peptide binding activity to the N-terminal half rather than the C-terminal region of the 17-kDa IHD miniprotein.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	167	The specific activity of the IHD miniprotein in the direct LXXLL binding assay was compared with its ability to function as a dominant negative p300 inhibitor by attenuating p53-dependent transcription from the p21-luciferase promoter.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	168	 In this system, p300 can stimulate maximal p53-dependent transcription (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	169	 5A), which can be attenuated by transfection of increasing amounts of the IHD miniprotein encoding vector (amino acids 401 to 566) (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	170	 5B), consistent with its ability to bind to the p53 transactivation domain.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Since IHD-(401 to 566) cannot bind to the proline-repeat domain (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	172	 4C), the ability of IHD to inhibit p53 activity is presumably not due to its binding to the proline-repeat transactivation domain, which can also contact p300 directly.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Progressive deletions of IHD (401 to 533, 401 to 501, and 401 to 475) do not neutralize IHD activity as a p53 inhibitor (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	174	 However, deletions of IHD into the region with homology to the minimal IBiD fragment (IHD-(401 to 427)) lost activity as a p53 inhibitor (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	175	 There were some differences in the specific activity of IHD miniprotein deletion variants as p53 inhibitors; for example, the IHD derivative (amino acids 401 to 501) was not as effective as a dominant negative inhibitor of p53 as other IHD derivatives (amino acids 401 to 475 and amino acids 401 to 553), especially at intermediate levels of gene transfected (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	176	 These data suggest that polypeptide fragments encoded from amino acids 476 to 501 can affect the specific activity of IHD as a p53-binding domain and/or that factors in vivo are binding to it in trans to the region and competing it away from p53.

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	212	  We have shown independently that the genetic basis for IRF-1 cooperation with p53 as an inducer of the p21 promoter (16) is due to the ability of IRF-1 to bind to p300 and allosterically stimulate DNA-dependent acetylation of p53.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	213	2 Although p53PRO is inactive on its own due to removal of the prolinerich activation domain and inability to be acetylated by p300 when bound to DNA (10), transfected IRF-1 is effectively able to reactivate p53PRO in its ability to induce p21 expression (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	214	 7B, lane 4 versus lanes 5 and 2).

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	217	 These data indicate that p53 activity can be uncoupled from the proline-repeat activation domain, presumably by the ability of IRF-1 to enhance p300 contact with the LXXLL activation domain in p53, which in turn stabilizes and activates p53PRO.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	218	 This hypothesis can be tested using the IHD miniprotein.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	219	 If IRF-1 effects on activating p53PRO are due to the stabilization of the p300:LXXLL motif, then we would predict that IHD would block IRF-1 stimulatory effects.

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	224	 The attenuation by IHD of IRF-1-dependent p53PRO activity (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	225	 7C) can also be linked to the destabilization by IHD of p53PRO protein levels in the presence of IRF-1 protein (Fig.

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Using fixed amounts of p53PRO and the small IHD derivative (amino acids 401 to 475) (Fig.

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	232	 These data suggest that the LXXLL activation domain is indeed the target of IRF-1 stabilization of p53PRO and that the minimal IHD miniprotein can contact the LXXLL domain of p53 in vivo.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	233	Structural studies on the IBiD, C/H1, and C/H3 domains of p300 have demonstrated an interaction of the minimal peptide-binding domains with activation domain peptides of no apparent sequence similarity.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	234	 It is generally held that such small peptides acquire helical structure when bound to the peptide-binding scaffold.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Although our characterization of IHD indicates that it can bind to LXXLL-containing polypeptides, it is not yet clear whether the IHD miniprotein displays any sequence preference for the p53 sequence, LXXLL-containing peptides, or other alternate consensus sequences.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	236	 We have previously used phage-peptide display as an in vitro method for identifying novel protein-protein interfaces in MDM2-p53 and p300:p53 complexes (10, 14).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	237	 This technique has the advantage of fixing bait protein in a solid phase in a native conformation and incubating with a library containing random 12-mer peptides.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	238	 The 17-kDa His-tagged IHD miniprotein was captured in the solid phase with an anti-His monoclonal antibody and incubated with phage libraries through three rounds of selection.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Identical His-tagged bait capture methods identified proline repeat-containing peptides as preferentially enriched using full-length p300 (10).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	240	 In this latter study, it was relatively surprising that LXXLL-containing peptides were not selected given the number of LXXLL-binding domains present in p300.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	241	 When high affinity peptides were enriched after three rounds of selection, three general classes of peptides were identified.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	242	 In the first class of peptides (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	243	 8A), a striking similarity in the peptides isolated to the p53 activation domain identified critical consensus site contacts for IHD into three small motifs across the activation domain: PLSQ, T(F/Y)S, and SXLXXL.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	244	 These data suggest that the IHD miniprotein can display some relative specificity for p53 activation domain fragments, although other peptides with a match to this consensus can be identified using an e-motif search engine (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	245	 A second class of peptides (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	246	 8B) showed less of a similarity than class I peptides but did display the retention of a Gln residue (which is critical for full-length p300 to contact the serine 20 phosphorylated p53 activation domain), a core (T/S)(F/W)(S/T)(D/E) motif, and an LXXL motif.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The third class of peptides displayed less resemblance to p53 but maintained a Gln residue and a relatively loose consensus of (S/T)QXX(F/W/Y)(S/T)XXXXL.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	248	 A general consensus site developed for IHD was PLSQXFSX-LXXLL and suggests that either the miniprotein has a very high affinity for the p53 activation domain fragment or that such consensus site peptide fragments have the capacity to adopt a helical conformation upon IHD scaffold binding, giving rise to an apparent consensus site.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	249	As a means to begin answering these questions, in this report, we have fine-mapped one p53 docking site on p300, named IHD, and provided evidence that this minidomain of p300 is a bona fide polypeptide-binding domain that possesses an intrinsic ability to bind to peptides with homology to the p53 LXXLL activation domain.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	250	 One key feature of the IHD miniprotein is that it mimics full-length p300 in its stabilization by phosphorylation at the serine 20 residue (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Although serine 20 phosphorylation function was originally thought to be in the reduction of MDM2-binding to p53, biophysical studies have demonstrated that serine 20 phosphorylation has no impact on MDM2 binding (15).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Rather, this phosphorylation stabilizes p300-binding to p53, and as an indirect consequence, prevents MDM2 binding to p53 (23).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Genetic studies have shown that mutation of the serine 20 residue in cell lines or in mice models attenuates p53 apoptotic activity (24, 25), suggesting that phosphorylation at this residue is important for p53 function.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Further mutation of the equivalent serine 20 residue in murine p53 or knockout of the known serine 20 kinase, CHK2, have the same phenotype in mice; p53 protein can still be stabilized by irradiation but has a lower specific activity as transcription factor or apoptotic inducer (21, 25).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	255	 These genetic data can be reinterpreted to suggest that the role of serine 20 phosphorylation is to stabilize p300 binding based on the following data.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	256	 (i) p53 activity is attenuated by serine 20 phosphopeptide mimetics that bind to and neutralize p300 (9); (ii) full-length p300 is stabilized by phosphorylation of the p53 activation domain at serine 20 (9); and (iii) serine 20 phosphopeptides can block DNA-dependent acetylation of p53 by p300 (11).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	257	 In this report, we show that the minimal IHD miniprotein can bind preferentially to full-length p53 tetramers that are phosphorylated at serine 20 and that IHD binding can be further stimulated in binding to p53 by consensus site DNA (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	258	 This mimics full-length p300 properties and suggests that the IHD domain may be an important component of p53 stabilization to p300 after DNA damage via CHK2 phosphorylation at serine 20.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	259	Based on previous data, it was suggested that p300 minidomains such as IBiD do not necessarily prefer a specific polypeptide primary amino acid sequence.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Our work using phagepeptide display suggests that IHD can prefer a specific peptide sequence.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	261	 To find novel high affinity ligands for IHD domain, we screened phage display peptide libraries for IHD-binding phage and sequenced a series of clones encoding 12-mer peptides.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	262	 The peptide sequences showed surprisingly good homology with the previously established p300-binding domain on p53 (14 to 25 amino acids), confirming that the peptide PLSQETFSDLWKLLP region is crucial for the interaction between p300 and p53 and that IHD can be responsible for stabilizing p300:p53 complexes that are transcriptionally competent.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Underlined residues represent the match of the phasepeptides to the p53 activation domain.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	264	 The selection for the three submotif-containing peptides (LSQ.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	265	 L) is not common in our experience of this technique and therefore not due to the overenrichment or "stickiness" of this peptide class in the phage library.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	266	 For example, using full-length p300, we enriched proline-repeat peptides (PXXP), using DAPK3, we enriched p21-like peptides (RKKXT), and using ligand-complexed MDM2, we enriched a variety of peptides with little homology to the p53 activation domain (10, 14, 18).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Further, using ligand-free MDM2 as a control, we did acquire peptides with homology to the p53 activation domain but with the consensus TFXXXWXXL that fits with the known contacts in the MDM2-p53 activation domain structure (14).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	268	Another advantage of phage-peptide display is that peptide consensus sequences developed can be used to identify novel binding partners.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	269	 We have used this to identify HSP90 as a novel MDM2-binding protein that controls p53 unfolding and have identified novel cell cycle substrates of the interferon-induced kinase DAPK3 (14, 18).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Further, the proline-repeat peptides pulled out using p300 as a bait (10) identified a large panel of LXXLL containing transcription factors that, like p53, have flanking LXXLL motifs of a contiguous PXXP or PXPXP motif in their transactivation domain.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	271	 In examining the IHD consensus peptides for homology to other proteins in the databases, there are several other interesting transcription factors and viral onco-proteins that possess IHD consensus sites that could potentially interact also with p300 through this docking site domain.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	272	 These proteins include oncogenic Ras-related Rab 721, cyclin G, CHK2, SV40 large T antigen, DNA and RNA polymerases, Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 6 (EBNA-6), and more (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	273	 The result that large T-antigen could potentially bind p300 via IHD is of great interest since p53 responses are abrogated in the presence of T-antigen and SV40 infection culminates in the degradation of p53 and loss of proliferative control (19), thereby supporting the notion that T-antigen has another mechanism of disrupting the critical activities of tumor suppressor proteins.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	274	 In fact, T-antigen was reported to bind to p300 (20), and this may be mediated in part through the IHD domain.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	275	In summary, we have characterized the minimal IHD LXXLL peptide-binding region of p300 and determined that it can display similar characteristics of full-length p300 including affinity for LXXLL-containing peptides, DNA-stimulated binding to serine 20 phosphorylated p53 tetramers, and in vivo interaction with the LXXLL activation domain of p53.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Future work will involve determining the dominance in the known LXXLL-binding domains in p300 including C/H1, C/H3, IBiD, and IHD and how these domains effect DNA-dependent acetylation of p53.

0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	3	Although the p53 response to DNA damage is largely mediated by downstream proteins, there is increasing evidence that p53 can directly interact with DNA lesions.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	4	 p53 can bind single strand and double strand breaks (14), three-stranded DNA structures (15,16), extra base bulges (17) and several base/base mismatches in DNA (18).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Additionally, we have shown that p53 binds with extremely high affinity to Holliday junctions (16).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	6	 All of these lesions occur as a result of typical recombination, replication and repair processes as well as DNA damage caused by environmental factors.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	7	 For example, Holliday junctions are natural intermediates of homologous recombination; however, high levels of sister chromatid exchange following irradiation suggests the formation of these structures due to DNA damage (19).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Replication of molecules containing thymidine dimers could result in the insertion of additional nucleotides opposite the existing lesion.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Additionally, when two similar DNA molecules with a few non-identical bases undergo recombination, regions of extra base bulges and mismatches can be left behind.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Replication errors can also lead to the generation of mismatches and extra base bulges in DNA.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	11	 All of these lesions need to be repaired for cell cycle progression to occur.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The high affinity of p53 to several of these lesions strongly points to an important role in damage recognition as well as downstream repair and recombination pathways.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Thus, p53 response to lesions in DNA caused by normal metabolic processes and DNA damaging agents may be 2-fold: first, to transactive downstream genes that enable cell cycle arrest or apoptosis and, secondly, to recognize and bind these lesions to signal repair pathways.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	14	The importance of p53 DNA binding (both sequence dependent for transactivation and sequence independent for lesion recognition) suggests that this activity is tightly regulated by a number of factors to ensure proper p53 function at the correct times during the cell cycle.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	15	 p53 DNA binding activity is affected by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation and sumolation (reviewed in 20).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Binding by the monoclonal antibody, pAB421 (21,22), as well as interaction with single strand DNA (23) activates sequence-specific DNA binding.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The identification of several cellular and viral proteins that associate with p53 suggests that protein to protein interactions play an important role in the regulation of its DNA binding activity.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This is further supported by the demonstration that Ref-1 is a potent activator of p53 DNA binding activity (24).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	19	 (25) have shown that the high mobility group (HMG) protein HMG-1 stimulates sequence-specific p53 DNA binding.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	20	The HMG proteins are among the largest group of non-histone chromatin proteins.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	21	 HMG proteins can be classified into three groups: the HMG-1/2, HMG I(Y) and HMG-14/17 families (reviewed in 26).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The exact cellular functions of these proteins are not fully understood.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	23	 They are architectural elements that bind unusual structures in DNA and have low sequence specificity.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The HMG-1/2 family is the most abundant of this group of proteins.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	25	 They interact with DNA through two conserved DNA binding domains known as the HMG boxes (27,28) and preferentially bind DNA structures that contain sharp angles such as cruciforms, four-way junctions (29) as well as cisplatin-DNA adducts (30,31).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The HMG I(Y) proteins contain A-T hook domains that serve as DNA binding motifs and can recognize four-way junctions (32).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Both groups of proteins can induce bends in linear DNA templates as well as introduce supercoils in topologically constrained molecules (33).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	28	 There is growing evidence that these proteins may represent a new class of chaperone factors that can facilitate the interactions of other proteins with their respective target sequence.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	29	 For example, HMG-1 induces a structural change in the target sequence of the progesterone receptor, thus facilitating protein binding (34).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Additionally, HMG I(Y) has been shown to regulate long range enhancer-dependent transcription by altering DNA topology (35).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Finally, as mentioned above, HMG-1 can enhance sequence-specific binding of p53 (25).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Thus, this group of proteins seems to enable the  loading  of other proteins on their target sequences.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The ability of the HMG group proteins to recognize unusual DNA structures and their influence on various protein to DNA interactions, as well as the fact that HMG-1 stimulates the sequence-specific binding of p53, makes them good candidates for factors that might affect the lesion binding properties of p53.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Thus, it was critical to ask whether any of these HMG proteins influences p53 recognition of DNA damage.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In this study, the effects of two HMG group proteins, HMG-1 and HMG I(Y), on p53 binding to DNA lesions were examined.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Two different substrates, one containing three 3-cytosine bulges and the other resembling Holliday junctions, were used to monitor the effect of these HMG proteins on p53 DNA binding activity by gel retardation assays.

0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	171	 HMG I(Y) has been shown to preferentially bind the open form of the four-way junction and maintain the junctions in this configuration (50).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Previous studies from our laboratory have suggested that p53 may prefer to bind the DNA in the stacked X conformation as opposed to the open form (16).

0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	176	 It is possible that p53 actively associates and dissociates from the junction crossover and, when dissociated, HMG I(Y) could rapidly bind the junction, altering its conformation, thus preventing p53 re-association.

0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	185	 It was suggested that since HMG I(Y) plays an important role in genetic recombination and retroviral integration, it dissociates H1 from these structures to allow recombination events to proceed.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	186	 This may occur by direct recruitment of proteins for junction resolution or HMG I(Y) may act as a marker to signify the location of the four-way junction.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Displacement of p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 from Holliday junctions by HMG I(Y) may occur for similar reasons.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	188	 In the event of DNA damage by environmental factors there is an increase in the formation of four-way junctions due to illegitimate sister chromatid exchange.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	189	 In the cell, p53, hMSH2 to hMSH6 and HMG I(Y) can bind to these four-way structures.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	190	 We recognize that initial recognition of lesions would primarily be carried out by hMSH2 to hMSH6 and p53 interactions with such sites of damage may provide a backup mechanism for signaling repair.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The HMG proteins are more abundant in cells, hence, HMG I(Y) dissociation of p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 from certain lesions or structures would be expected to dominate.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	192	 However, following DNA damaging events the levels and stability of p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 may alter, causing changes in the HMG I(Y) effect.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Genetic studies altering HMG protein levels may be complicated to interpret with regard to, for example, p53-mediated genomic stability or hMSH2 to hMSH6 catalyzed repair, due to the multiple pathways that are involved.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	194	 These considerations underscore the need for further studies involving multiple proteins as an approach to learn how lesions are signaled in the cell.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	195	While p53/DNA lesion complexes form with high affinity it is possible that the protein is quite labile on the DNA, thus HMG I(Y) is readily able to dissociate these interactions.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	196	 The ability of p53 to form more stable complexes with DNA may require the protein to be post-translationally modified.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Several studies have shown that p53 binding properties are modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Purified p53 used in these studies was obtained from baculovirus-infected insect cells and was determined to be phosphorylated on at least one site.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Further phosphorylation and/or acetylation may result in conformation changes in p53 that will enable more stable binding.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Indeed, as mentioned above, p53 binding to lesions may function to bring the protein in close proximity to various kinases.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Studies are currently underway in our laboratory to test the effect of phosphorylating various serine residues with specific kinases on the lesion binding properties of p53.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	202	 It should be noted that in the presence of hMSH2 to hMSH6, p53 complexes with lesions is enhanced, suggesting that protein interactions in the vicinity of the lesion dictate DNA binding rather than the lability of p53.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	203	The effect of hMSH2 to hMSH6 on p53/Holliday junction complexes we observed here was in direct contrast to that of HMG I(Y), where the repair protein had a stimulatory effect on p53 binding.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The increase in p53 complexes also results in a concomitant decrease of the hMSH2 to hMSH6 complexes with the same substrate.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	205	 This reduction was seen even when molar excesses of hMSH2 to hMSH6 were added to the reactions (data not shown).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Additionally, when hMSH2 to hMSH6 was pre-incubated with the substrates followed by the addition of p53, enhancement of the p53/DNA complexes was observed (data not shown).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Similar effects were seen with the 3-cytosine bulge template that is a preferred substrate for hMSH2 to hMSH6.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Hence it appears that hMSH2 to hMSH6 is also able to load p53 on the 3-cytosine bulge substrate.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	209	 It is possible that p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 interact with each other at the lesion sites.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	210	 However, if this were the case, we would expect a novel band containing a ternary complex with both proteins to appear on the gel retardation assays.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	211	 No such complexes were detected in the presence of both proteins with either probe used.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Furthermore, immunoprecipitation assays did not reveal any interaction between the two proteins in solution (data not shown).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Thus, hMSH2 to hMSH6 appears to be either recruiting p53 to lesion sites or stabilizing p53/DNA interactions in some manner.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	214	 This may occur to ensure that the lesion is signaled to the necessary downstream proteins and cell cycle arrest or apoptosis pathways are executed.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	215	In the nucleus, DNA exists in several different configurations and a range of proteins can bind these various forms.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	216	 In this paper, we examined the dynamics between three proteins that bind Holliday junctions and have shown that they interact with each other in different ways.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	217	 p53 binding to these recombination intermediates is affected in opposite ways by HMG I(Y) and hMSH2 to hMSH6 HMG I(Y) dissociates while hMSH2 to hMSH6 promotes binding to Holliday junctions and 3-cytosine bulges.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Presumably, in the cellular environment, other proteins will further contribute and dictate specific interactions of these proteins on the DNA.

0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We showed that PRIMA-1 can restore wild type conformation and specific DNA binding to mutant p53 and trigger apoptosis, and has mutant p53-dependent anti-tumor activity in vivo (1).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	10	Here we have used the information available at the NCI database to evaluate the effect of PRIMA-1 on tumor cell lines of different origin and compare its mode of action with that of five known anticancer drugs currently used in the clinic: 5-fluorouracil; cisplatin; methotrexate; adriamycin and paclitaxel.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Our statistical analysis revealed that PRIMA-1 was consistently more effective in inhibiting growth of mutant p53-carrying cell lines as compared with wild type p53-carrying lines derived from various human tumors.

0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Thus, cells overexpressing wild-type p53 appear to be more resistant to treatment with a variety of drugs as compared with cells expressing low levels of wild-type p53.

0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Hence, rapidly proliferating cells with wild-type p53 status were more sensitive to the treatment with drugs such as thiopurine, macbecin II, PALA, dichlorallyl lawsone, deoxydoxorubicin, and N,N-dibenzyl daunomycin.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	45	 GI50 versus levels of p53 expression and cell population doubling time   Spectrum of action of PRIMA-1 in comparison to known anticancer drugs In order to investigate the correlation between PRIMA-1 growth suppression activity and mutant p53 expression levels, we selected 34 cell lines representing different tumor types (see Materials and methods).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Since PRIMA-1 reactivates mutant p53 and thus presumably requires a certain level of mutant p53 expression for its anti-tumor activity, we selected cell lines with mutant p53 levels exceeding 1 unit for further analysis (1 unit represents the level of wild-type p53 expression in the WMN cell line as determined by western blotting; see http//dtp.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	47	 We asked whether PRIMA-1 could suppress the growth of tumor cell lines in a mutant p53-dependent manner, and compared the effect of PRIMA-1 with five widely used chemotherapeutic drugs, 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, methotrexate, cisplatin and paclitaxel.

0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	57	 We found that resistance to PRIMA-1 was associated with expression of the IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) receptor (r = 0.

0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	59	 For the other drugs tested, resistance was associated with activity of the MDR (multidrug resistance) gene and with expression of different growth factors.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	60	 In non-small cell lung cancer cell lines resistance to PRIMA-1 was associated with high levels of the drug efflux pumps LRP (lung resistance protein; r = 0.

0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	76	Our in silico search among 2000 compounds of the NCI diversity set for compounds that inhibit cell growth in a mutant p53-dependent manner yielded eight compounds that showed higher correlation with mutant p53 expression than PRIMA-1.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	77	 However, these compounds did not score in our cellular screening assay (1).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	78	 There are several possible reasons for this discrepancy.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	79	 First, our cellular screening assay was designed to identify compounds that were active in the presence of mutant p53 but inactive in p53 null cells.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Therefore, compounds whose activity correlates with mutant p53 levels may not necessarily score in our assay.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	81	 This may also explain why PRIMA-1 did not show the best correlation between sensitivity to treatment and mutant p53 expression levels among the compounds in the diversity set.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	82	Second, we used only one concentration of compounds in our cellular screening, i.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	83	 It is obvious that compounds with GI50 values significantly higher or lower than 25  microM would not score as selective for mutant p53-expressing cells in this screening.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	84	 This was apparently the case for NSC321206 and NSC150117 that scored at ranking positions 2 and 3, respectively, in our in silico search but were toxic in a mutant p53-independent manner in our cellular screening (V.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Their average GI50 values were 400-fold (NSC321206) and 15-fold (NSC150117) lower than that for PRIMA.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	86	Third, it is relevant to consider the possibility that mutant p53 levels correlate with cell proliferation rate, as indicated by information in the NCI database.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	87	 This is consistent with previous studies showing that some p53 mutants have a growth stimulatory activity (16,17), which might at least in part be due to their ability to induce illegitimate expression of growth promoting genes like c-myc, NF-B, PCNA, and others (18 to 21).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	88	 It is conceivable that only some mutant p53 proteins stimulate cell proliferation.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Therefore, the correlation between mutant p53 levels and growth suppression by NSC117281 and other compounds that showed a similar correlation could simply reflect a preferential effect on rapidly dividing cells.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In contrast, sensitivity to PRIMA-1 did not correlate with cell proliferation rate.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	91	 This may indicate that PRIMA-1 targets a broader range of p53 mutants than those capable of stimulating cell growth.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	92	We observed a positive correlation between sensitivity to treatment with PRIMA-1 and levels of mutant p53 expression.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	93	 This is consistent with our previous study demonstrating that PRIMA-1 reactivates mutant p53 and preferentially kills mutant p53-expressing tumor cells (Bykov et al.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	94	 In contrast, our regression analysis of 44 selected anticancer agents showed a negative correlation between levels of mutant p53 and drug sensitivity in most cases.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Only a few compounds showed a positive correlation, although weaker than that for PRIMA-1.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	96	 For several compounds growth inhibition of tumor cells correlated positively with cell population doubling time, indicating that cell proliferation rate is a more important factor than p53 status for sensitivity to such drugs.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	97	We did not observe any significant negative correlations between GI50 values and wild-type p53 levels, indicating that overexpression of wild-type p53 renders cells more resistant to many drugs.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	98	 A plausible explanation is that tumor cells accumulate a number of apoptosis-evading genetic changes in order to survive high levels of wild-type p53, resulting in increased drug resistance.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	99	To compare sensitivity to PRIMA-1 with that of known anticancer drugs we selected cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, paclitaxel, and methotrexate which are widely used for cancer therapy.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Of these agents, cisplatin (22) and 5-fluorouracil (8) have been shown to preferentially affect cells carrying wild-type p53.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Only paclitaxel has some specificity towards cells expressing mutant p53 (7).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	102	 This unusual property of paclitaxel has made it an important component of frontline and adjuvant treatment in a number of chemotherapeutic regimens used in the clinic today (23).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Our analysis revealed that PRIMA-1 has an overall selectivity for mutant p53-carrying tumor cell lines.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	104	 In this respect PRIMA-1 is superior to paclitaxel, which also has such selectivity, but not for all cancer types studied.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	105	 However, paclitaxel showed a significant selectivity for mutant p53-carrying ovarian and renal carcinoma lines.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	106	 PRIMA-1 was the only agent that showed a mutant p53-selective effect on lung and colon carcinoma lines.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	107	 This is of importance in view of the fact that p53 mutations occur in almost 60% of lung carcinomas and around 50% of colon carcinomas (6).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	108	 A similar selectivity for mutant p53-expressing lines was observed for melanoma, although only around 10% of melanomas carry p53 mutation (6).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Finally, our analysis showed that 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin preferentially inhibited the growth of lines carrying wild-type p53, in agreement with previous studies (12).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	110	The database analysis provided several clues as to possible mechanisms of resistance against PRIMA-1.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	111	 One obvious mechanism is loss of mutant p53 expression.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	112	 In addition, it seems likely that increased expression of the IGF1 receptor or other receptors that mediate survival signalling could raise the apoptotic threshold and thus contribute to resistance.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Common mechanisms for resistance to chemotherapy, such as expression of the MDR gene or other drug efflux pumps (24) could presumably also make cells less sensitive to PRIMA-1.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	114	Our cluster analysis demonstrated that PRIMA-1 does not belong to any of the tight clusters of chemotherapeutic drugs formed in dendrogram.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	115	 PRIMA-1 clustered with purine analogs belonging to the group of DNA antimetabolites.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	116	 The clustering of that group was quite loose, indicating different mechanisms of action of drugs within the group.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	117	 PRIMA-1 does not have any structural resemblance to nucleotide analogs that would favor a mechanism of activity similar to thioguanine and thiopurine.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	118	 This argues that PRIMA-1 acts by mechanisms different from those of major groups of anticancer agents.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	119	Based on our analyses of information in the NCI database, we conclude that PRIMA-1 has preferential growth inhibitory activity on human tumor cell lines carrying mutant p53.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	120	 This distinguishes PRIMA-1 from the commonly used anticancer drugs.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Our results support the notion that PRIMA-1 or structural analogs of PRIMA-1 may serve as lead compounds for the development of novel anticancer drugs for more efficient treatment of tumors carrying mutant p53.

0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	4	The p53 tumor suppressor gene encodes one of the most intensively studied proteins.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	5	 This interest in p53 is engendered not by an essential role for p53 during normal growth and development, but by the contribution of p53 to tumor suppression.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Loss or alterations in the function of p53 have been found in most human cancers, including the major epithelial malignancies that may soon be responsible for most deaths in the Western world (1,2).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Understanding and treating these cancers has become a matter of some urgency, and the p53 pathway is an attractive candidate for the development of targeted cancer therapies.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	8	 But can such therapies be successfully developed? Compared with the kinases, the most popular and successful cancer drug targets to date, p53 remains a more elusive quarry.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Many functions have been ascribed to p53 that relate to activities as diverse as transcriptional activation, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, exonuclease activity, DNA repair and regulation of angiogenesis (3 to 6).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The ability of p53 to signal a variety of growth inhibitory responses, including the induction of cell-cycle arrest, senescence, differentiation and apoptosis (7,8), establish a central role for p53 as a master regulator of tumor suppression (9).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	11	 However, despite the efforts of many researchers over many years, the relative contributions of these activities to tumor suppression remain hotly disputed.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Over the past few years even the most unassailable  truths  about p53 have been called into question, leaving us with the uncomfortable feeling that the more we learn, the less we know.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Two examples of reasonably well-established facts about p53 that have recently become more complicated are the importance of p53 as a transcription factor and the role of apoptosis in tumor suppression, each of which we will discuss briefly in this review.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	14	Of all the activities of p53, none is more firmly accepted than the function of p53 as a transcription factor (10 to 12).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Assembling into a tetramer, p53 shows sequence specific DNA binding activity through its central domain (Figure 1), and activates the expression of genes that contain p53 binding sites in their promoters by virtue of interactions of the N-terminal domain of p53 with the transcriptional machinery.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Almost all tumor derived p53 mutants contain a point mutation within the DNA binding domain that prevents, or in some cases alters, the recognition of p53 binding sites.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In general, p53 mutants expressed in tumors lose the ability to activate expression of the target genes that are responsive to wild-type p53 although they may acquire unique transcriptional activities not shared by the wild-type protein and this by itself suggests that the transcriptional function of p53 is likely to be important for tumor suppression.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Identification of target genes that are activated by p53 has further supported this concept; of the hundreds of p53-inducible target genes that have been identified so far there is compelling evidence that several of these play a role in mediating the various downstream responses to p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The p21Waf1/Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor was amongst the first of the p53 targets to be identified, and deletion of p21Waf1/Cip1 in a number of cell systems strongly abrogates the ability of p53 to induce a G1 cell-cycle arrest (13,14).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	20	 More recently, the products of other transcriptional targets of p53 have been shown to play a role in mediating various p53 responses, including a large group of genes encoding proteins with apoptotic activity (3).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Analysis of a number of these genes indicated that knocking out any one individually failed to protect the cells completely from p53-induced death, suggesting that the response reflects the combined effect of a number of targets.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	22	 However, more recently, the BH3 domain protein PUMA has emerged as a promising candidate for a key p53-inducible apoptotic target (15,16).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	23	 PUMA was shown to be critical for p53-mediated cell death in a number of cells and tissues, with knock-out or knock-down of PUMA resulting in a severely impeded to apoptosis (17,18) and in some models, enhancing tumor development (19).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	24	 However, given the all-or-nothing threshold nature of the apoptotic response, it seems unwise to conclude that PUMA is the be-all and end-all to p53-induced apoptosis.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Indeed, it is clear that in some cells types inactivation of other p53 target genes, like NOXA, has an equally profound effect on the apoptotic response (18,20).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Taken together, it seems most likely that the coordinated activity of many of the p53-inducible apoptotic target genes will play a key role in governing the life and death decision in response to stresses that activate p53.

0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The p53 protein is a transcription factor that contains several well-defined domains.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	30	 At the N-terminus are the transactivation domain and a proline-rich region, which is required for apoptotic function.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Within the N-terminus are the interaction sites of p53 with components of the transcriptional machinery as well as ubiquitin ligase Mdm2.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The central domain harbors the sequence specific DNA binding region, where most of the tumor associated mutations occur.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This central region also contains binding sites for interaction with members of the Bcl2 protein family.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The C-terminal region contains the oligomerization domain as well as nuclear localisation and export signals.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Several sites within the N-terminal region have been shown to be phosphorylated and the C-terminal region contains numerous sites of modification which influence stability, localization and activity of p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	36	  Despite the strong evidence supporting the role of p53 as a transcription factor, there has been consistent debate over whether p53 may also have transcriptionally independent activities.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Certainly, p53 also shows transcriptional repressor functions that are strongly correlated with apoptosis (21 to 23).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, a number of early studies suggested that p53 may have an apoptotic function that is completely separate from the regulation of gene expression (24 to 27).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	39	 An explanation for this activity has been provided very recently with the observation that following stress, a proportion of p53 appears to function outside the nucleus, in the cytoplasm or at the mitochondria, and that p53 can be found in association with several members of the Bcl2 family of proteins (28).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The Bcl2 related proteins are the key components of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and fall into three main groups; those that can function to perturb mitochondrial membrane potential directly (Bax and Bak), the BH3-only proteins that directly or indirectly drive the activation of Bax and Bak, and the anti-apoptotic proteins that sequester pro-apoptotic family members and hold them inactive (such as Bcl2, BclxL and Mcl1).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The BH3-only proteins are further divided into two groups; those that bind Bax and Bak directly to activate them (the  activators , such as Bim and Bid) and those that bind the anti-apoptotic family members to release the activators (the  enablers  like Bad and Bik) (29,30) (Figure 2).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Unexpectedly, it would seem that p53 can function in a manner analogous to the BH3-only proteins, with evidence to support two broad, but not mutually exclusive, models.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In the first, p53 functions like an  enabler  BH3 domain protein, interacting with the anti-apoptotic proteins and presumably releasing pro-apoptotic BH3 domain proteins to drive apoptosis (Figure 2A and B) (31).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The second model is based on the recent observation that p53 can function in a manner more analogous to the  activator  BH3-only proteins, by directly activating the apoptotic function of Bax or Bak (Figure 2C and D) (32,33).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	45	 In either case, the remarkable parallels in the function between p53 and the BH3-only proteins is not reflected by any obvious amino acid sequence similarity, although it is possible that parts of p53 adopt a similar structure to the BH3 domain.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Interestingly, however, mutations in the DNA binding domain of p53 that are frequently found in tumors also prevent the interaction of p53 with BclxL (31), indicating that the loss of apoptotic activity of these mutants may derive from the concomitant failure to induce transcription and loss of this mitochondrial activity.

0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	49	 On the left, two possible roles for p53 as an  enabler  type BH3-only protein.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In these models p53 is able to disrupt the interaction between anti-apoptotic proteins (such as BclxL, Bcl2 and Mcl1) and pro-apoptotic proteins.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	51	 This could directly relieve the inhibition of Bax and Bak (A), or free  activator  type BH3 only proteins (Bid and Bim), which can then activate Bax and Bak (B).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	52	 On the right, models in which p53 functions as an  activator  type BH3-only protein.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Activation of Bax and Bak might involve binding and releasing them from interaction with the anti-apoptotic proteins (C).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Alternatively, p53 itself may be held inactive by interaction with the anti-apoptotic proteins.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	55	 In this case it is possible that other  enabler  BH3-only proteins like PUMA might be able to displace p53 from the anti-apoptotic proteins, thus allowing it to activate Bax/Bak (D).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Note that although there is evidence to support each of the models, not all the interactions indicated in the Figure have been confirmed.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	57	  Although in experimental systems the mitochondrial activity of p53 alone can be sufficient for cell death, it seems likely that under physiological conditions this function will cooperate with the ability of p53 to activate transcription of genes like PUMA to drive a full apoptotic response.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Although it is possible that PUMA and mitochondrial p53 activate independent apoptotic signals that combine to push the cell over an apoptotic threshold, it is interesting to consider a closer relationship between these two p53 activities.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	59	 One possibility is that the accumulation of mitochondrial p53 is an immediate response to stress, sensitizing the cells to further apoptotic signals like the expression of PUMA.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Recent studies have shown that in mice subjected to DNA damage treatment, a rapid p53 mitochondrial translocation (which precedes p53 target gene activation) triggers an early wave of apoptosis, which is followed later by a second wave that is transcription dependent (34).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	61	 In this study, mitochondrial p53 was found preferentially in radiosensitive organs or in cultured cells that respond to p53 by undergoing apoptosis, rather than a cell-cycle arrest.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	62	 These results suggest that the ability to accumulate mitochondrial p53 may be a distinguishing feature between radiosensitive and radioresistant organs and a determinant of whether or not a cell will die in response to p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	63	 However, another model has recently been proposed which intertwines the activity of p53 at the mitochondria and the function of PUMA even more closely (35).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	64	 As mentioned earlier, p53 can interact with the pro-survival BH3 proteins like BclxL, and it is possible that this interaction serves to inhibit the  activator  function of p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	65	 PUMA has a very high affinity for the pro-survival proteins and appears to function like an  enabler  BH3-only protein (36,37).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Therefore, when expressed at sufficiently high levels, PUMA may be able to dissociate p53 from the pro-survival proteins and thereby drive the activation of apoptosis (Figure 2D).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Clearly, this cannot be the only route through which PUMA functions, since PUMA induces apoptosis in p53-null cells too (15).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	68	 However, it is likely that the principal role for PUMA is to release the  enabler  proteins (which would now encompass Bid, Bim and p53) from the anti-apoptotic proteins to drive the activation of Bax and Bak.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	69	 This model nicely ties together the transcriptionally independent activity of p53 with the transcriptionally dependent activation of proteins like PUMA and suggests how the final apoptotic response may require both of these events.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	70	The ability of p53 to function at the mitochondria has also led to a reassessment of the consequences of how nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of p53 might be regulated.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Rather intriguingly, this brings us back to considering one of the main negative regulators of p53 function, Mdm2.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The role of Mdm2 in controlling p53 function is clear from numerous studies in cells and in mice, and stress-induced inhibition of Mdm2 function is key to the activation of p53 (38).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Mdm2 binds to the N-terminal region of p53 that also contains the transcriptional activation domain (Figure 1), and this interaction of Mdm2 with p53 can block the binding of other components of the transcriptional machinery and inhibit the ability of p53 to activate transcription.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Mdm2 can also directly repress transcription, in part through its ability to function as a ubiquitin ligase (E3) and ubiquitinate histones (39).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	75	 This E3 activity of Mdm2 is also critically important for the ubiquitination of p53, an activity that leads to the degradation and maintenance of low levels of p53 in unstressed cells.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The importance of the negative regulation of p53 by Mdm2 has been demonstrated in many systems, and it is generally accepted that inhibition of Mdm2 will result in the activation of p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	77	 It is, therefore, somewhat heretical to suggest that Mdm2 may also be enabling some p53 functions, but the observation that Mdm2 is required for p53 to export from the nucleus (40,41) suggests that Mdm2 activity might contribute to the mitochondrial or cytoplasmic activities of p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The mechanism through which Mdm2 drives nuclear export of p53 is not completely clear, although it is associated with ubiquitination of p53 (42,43) and many involve the unmasking of the nuclear export sequences that are present in the C-terminal region of p53 (Figure 1).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Ubiquitination of p53 by Mdm2, therefore, appears to have two roles, targeting of p53 to the proteasome for degradation and nuclear export.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Differentiation between these two responses depends on the extent of ubiquitination whereas mono-ubiquitination of p53 is sufficient for nuclear export, polyubiquitination is necessary for degradation (43).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Interestingly, in support of this model the p53 found at the mitochondria has been shown to be ubiquitin modified (44).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	82	The idea that Mdm2 may actually contribute to an apoptotic activity of p53 provides some rationale for the observed differences in apoptotic activity of the two most common polymorphic forms of p53, carrying either arginine or proline at amino acid residue 72.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The Arg72 variant shows an enhanced ability to interact with Mdm2 and Crm1 and is more efficiently exported from the nucleus and localized to the mitochondria than the Pro72 form (44).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Consistent with the importance for this localization of p53, the Arg72 variant shows significantly higher apoptotic activity.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Interestingly, the apoptotic defect of p53 proteins mutated in the N-terminus that had been ascribed to loss of transcriptional function (45 to 47) may also reflect a failure to bind Mdm2 and so relocalize to the mitochondria.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	86	Taken together, it seems that p53-induced apoptosis represents the culmination of many activities, including the activation of expression of a number of target genes, repression of gene expression and an ability to activate Bax or Bak in a transcriptionally independent manner.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Dissecting the relative importance of each of these functions to the overall apoptotic activity of p53 will be complex, and the identification of a mutant that could separate these functions would certainly be extremely helpful.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	88	The clarity of our vision of how p53 functions is becoming even more clouded with a growing appreciation of the importance of p53-induced responses other than apoptosis in preventing tumor development.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Certainly, the ability to induce cell death has been strongly linked to the function of p53 as a tumor suppressor (48,49).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Compelling studies showing that transformed cells are more sensitive to p53-mediated apoptosis, and that under conditions of Myc or E1A driven tumorigenesis in mice, blocking apoptosis by overexpression of Bcl2 (50) or loss of Apaf1 (51) could substitute for loss of p53, strongly suggest that the ability to induce cell death might be key to the success of p53 as a tumor suppressor.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	91	 In vivo model systems examining Myc-induced lymphomas also provide elegant support for a tumor suppressive role of PUMA in these studies loss of PUMA was as effective at accelerating tumor development as loss of p53 (19).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	92	 However, there is now accumulating evidence that simply preventing the apoptotic response to p53 is not the same as losing p53 function completely.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	93	 For example, the PUMA knock-out mice do not resemble p53-null animals with respect to tumor development, despite showing profound defects in their apoptotic response in many tissues (17,18).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	94	 These observations therefore suggest that other activities of p53, such as the induction of cell-cycle arrest or senescence and the contribution to the maintenance of genomic stability, also play an important role in tumor suppression.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	95	 As with apoptosis, pinning down the contribution of the cell-cycle arrest response to p53 tumor suppression has been complicated.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Although the deletion of p21WAF1/CIP1, one of the key mediators of the proliferative block induced by p53, can enhance susceptibility to cancer development in some models (52), loss of p21WAF1/CIP1 is not equivalent to loss of p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Indeed in some systems, loss of p21WAF1/CIP1 may even impede tumorigenesis, possibly as a reflection of tissue and system-dependent pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic activities of p21WAF1/CIP1 (53).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	98	 However, notwithstanding this complexity in the contribution of p21WAF1/CIP1, it seems clear that the proliferative block induced by p53 in the shape of cell-cycle arrest or senescence may be as important in preventing cancer development as the induction of cell death.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Some of this evidence has come from a reexamination of specific tumor derived p53 mutants that dissociate p53's apoptotic and cell-cycle responses.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Initial tissue culture studies indicated that while these mutants remain competent in the induction of cell-cycle arrest, they fail to induce apoptosis (54).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Interestingly, these p53 mutants function to enhance the transformation of cells in culture (55), adding further weight to the suggestion that apoptosis is the key tumor suppressor function of p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	102	 More recently, however, a knock-in mouse expressing one such mutant p53 was created and interestingly, despite showing a complete loss of p53-mediated apoptosis and a reduced p53-induced cell-cycle arrest, these mice retained some ability to resist tumor development (56).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Although clearly more susceptible to cancer than their wild-type littermates (suggesting apoptosis does indeed play some role), the incidence of tumor development was far less than that seen in p53-null mice, strongly indicating that the ability to induce a proliferative block, which was matched by a maintenance of genomic stability, is an important weapon in the tumor suppressive armoury of p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	104	 These model systems will encourage us to think again about which p53 activities we should be trying to restore for therapy should we concentrate on apoptosis, cell cycle progression or even senescence (57)? Even if the ability of p53 to induce a proliferative block can inhibit tumor development, will it also be true that reinstating such a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest can help to cure a cancer? More importantly, will attempts to modulate the proliferative block in tumor cells have effects on the apoptotic response? For example, the identification of p21WAF1/CIP1 as a survival factor that might ideally be inhibited as a part of tumor therapy (58) suggests that reactivating this p53 response may have unanticipated and undesirable consequences for tumor cell survival.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	105	Clearly, there are many questions that remain to be answered, but despite the obvious gaps in our understanding of exactly how p53 works, the role of p53 in tumor suppression is indisputable.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	106	 This has encouraged the development of numerous approaches to harnessing the power of p53 for tumor therapy, including gene therapy to directly express wild-type p53 (59) as well as the development of small molecules that can restore function to mutant p53 (60) or reactivate wild-type p53 (61).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The latter approach depends on the observation that many tumors that retain a wild-type p53 gene show defects in the pathways that allow the activation of p53 in response to stress, in most cases resulting in an inability to turn off Mdm2.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	108	 In these tumors, targeting Mdm2 would be expected to stabilize and activate p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	109	 One extremely promising approach has been to identify small molecule inhibitors of the Mdm2 to p53 interaction (62).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Although inhibition of protein to protein interactions is not usually a favourite target for drug development, in this case, the success of the Nutlin compounds may reflect the extremely tightly defined interaction of a small domain of p53 into a deep pocket in Mdm2 (63).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Other approaches include the use of antisense oligonucleotides to inihibit Mdm2 expression (64) and the identification of small molecules that inhibit the E3 activity of Mdm2 (65).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Interestingly, although the inhibition of Mdm2 activity should also hinder the mitochondrial function of p53 by preventing nuclear export, the results indicate that p53 activity can be restored with sufficient efficiency to induce an apoptotic response.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	113	Although promising, these approaches have by no means exhausted the potential of p53 as a therapeutic target.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	114	 As we discover more about p53, the list of possible drug targets that might allow for the reactivation of at least some facet of p53 tumor suppression also increases.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	115	 We look forward to a continuing boom in our understanding of the basic biology of p53 advancing, hand-in-hand, with an increased ability to exploit this knowledge for cancer therapy.

0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	17	 For example, the integrin 3/ss1 functions as a cell adhesion receptor for laminin-5 (epiligrin), a major ECM protein present in basement membrane (Xia et al.

0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	262	 These observations suggest that the acute suppression of p53 function in HMECs by HPV-16 E6 and by AS ODNs may promote sensitivity to rECM-induced apoptosis.

0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	268	 The mechanism by which the acute loss of p53 function might promote apoptosis is unknown.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	269	 However, we observe that immediately after suppression of p53 by HPV-16 E6, HMECs exhibited a high percentage of tetraploid cells (14%) and an increased sensitivity to apoptosis.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	270	 The tumor suppressor p53 is a critical component of the spindle checkpoint that ensures the maintenance of diploidy, and an increase in tetraploidy has been observed in cultured fibroblasts from p53-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (Cross et al.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	271	 We speculate that it is possible that a loss in the spindle checkpoint might promote the induction of apoptosis when early passage p53- HMEC cells are exposed to either survival or growth arrest signals.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Alternatively, p53 also plays an important role in differentiation, and therefore lack of p53 might result in cellular disregulation that promotes cell death.

0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Based on these observations, we speculate that the presence of collagen I/IV in a 1:1 ratio in our model system is not sufficient to induce apoptosis nor promote an acinar structure.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	284	 When laminin was added to collagen I/IV gels, early passage p53- HMEC-E6 cells formed organized branched tubular structures that terminated in spherical cell clusters and underwent apoptosis (Fig.

0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	298	 We hypothesize that utilization of nonimmortalized cells with low levels of 6ss4-integrin expression may account for differences between our results and those obtained by Howlett et al.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, March 8, 2002.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	4	p53 function as a tumor suppressor is linked to its role as a coordinator of a damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoint pathway whose action prevents the propagation of permanently damaged clones by the induction of apoptosis or growth arrest (1).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The biochemical activity of p53 linked with tumor suppression is its function as a sequence-specific DNA binding protein and transcription factor that controls the expression of a large panel of gene products implicated in normal growth control, DNA repair, cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and angiogenesis (2).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The stress-regulated transactivation function of p53 is driven by its sequence-specific DNA binding domain and is coordinated by specific protein protein interactions that can in turn be modulated by covalent and non-covalent modifications.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The central core domain of p53 from amino acids 90-295 contains the sequence-specific DNA binding domain (3).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Inactivating mutations in p53 at over 200 different amino acid positions within this core DNA binding domain have been detected in human cancers (4), and the mutation often results in the unfolding and accumulation of p53 protein in the nucleus of the cancer cell (5).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	9	 An oligomerization domain from amino acids 320-356 flanks the conserved core sequence-specific DNA binding domain and is required to assemble p53 into its tetrameric structure (6, 7).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	10	Regulatory domains at the N and C termini of p53 modulate protein protein interactions and DNA protein interactions that affect the rate of p53-dependent transcription (8).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The C terminus of p53 contains a negative regulatory domain whose phosphorylation at Ser315 by cyclin-dependent kinases (9) or acetylation at multiple lysine residues by p300 (10) stimulates the transcription activity of p53 in vivo.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The N-terminal regulatory domain of p53 contains the highly conserved BOX-I domain that directs the binding of p53 to proteins, including the positive effector p300 and the inhibitor MDM2, the balance of which regulates the tumor suppressor activity of p53.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Phosphorylation at Ser15, Thr18, and Ser20 can either reduce MDM2 binding (11, 12) or stabilize the p53 p300 transcription complex (13), resulting in a net activation of p53 function.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Thus, the concerted activation of the sequence-specific DNA binding function of p53 by post-translational modification of its C-terminal domain and the kinase-dependent stabilization of the p53 p300 complex provide a working model to explain the basic mechanism of how p53-dependent gene expression can be activated.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	15	By contrast to p53 activation reactions, inhibition of p53 activity is less understood but involves an MDM2-dependent pathway that functions in cycling cells to degrade p53 and keep its transcriptional activity relatively low.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	16	 MDM2 protein contains at least four independent functional domains, including: 1) an N-terminal domain that recognizes the BOX-I domain of p53 (14); 2) a central domain that binds to the tumor suppressor protein p14ARF; 3) a putative zinc binding domain (15); and 4) a RING-finger RNA binding domain (16).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The original localization of the primary MDM2 docking site on p53 protein in the N-terminal BOX-I domain was defined using small peptide-mimetics (17), crystallographic analysis (18), and mutational studies (15, 19, 36).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	18	 These studies revealed that a highly conserved hydrophobic series of amino acids within the N-terminal region of p53 from amino acids 14-27 interact with a hydrophobic binding pocket in the N-terminal domain of MDM2 protein.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The microinjection of monoclonal antibodies to the p53 binding interface of MDM2 protein can activate p53-dependent expression providing direct evidence that MDM2 is normally a negative regulator of p53 function in vivo (20, 21).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Scaffold proteins fused to the BOX-I domain of p53 can activate p53 function by virtue of binding to MDM2 protein (13, 22), providing additional evidence for the importance of this small BOX-I domain as an independent binding motif that is recognized by MDM2 protein in vivo.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The fact that RNA can simultaneously stabilize the p53 MDM2 protein complex and reduce the stability of the MDM2 BOX-I domain complex is internally consistent.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	146	 However, the reduced stability of the MDM2 BOX-I domain complex in the presence of zinc (Fig.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	148	 These latter data suggest that RNA or zinc induce distinct conformational changes in MDM2 protein.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Finally, although RNA and zinc reduce the binding of MDM2 protein to the BOX-I domain, a resistance to proteolysis of a 52- and a 45-kDa fragment was uniquely observed when MDM2 protein was incubated with zinc (Fig.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Together, these data suggest that the ability of RNA to stabilize the MDM2 tetrameric p53 complex and to inhibit the MDM2 BOX-I peptide complex (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	160	 3A) may be due to a conformational change in the MDM2 protein that is distinct from that induced by zinc.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The first involved using phage-peptide display to identify novel peptide domains that bind to the RNA MDM2 isoform and determining using a search engine whether such domains have a homology site in common with the core domain of p53.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	171	 A second approach was to determine using a search engine whether the tumor suppressor protein pRb, which contains an atypical and undefined interaction site for MDM2 (33), has a motif in common with the core domain of p53.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	172	In the first instance, the ligand-free form of MDM2 or the MDM2 RNA isoform was adsorbed on to the solid phase by capture using a MDM2-specific monoclonal antibody and subjected to three rounds of phage-peptide display using a 12-mer peptide library, as described previously for two phospho-specific monoclonal antibodies toward p53 (9, 28).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Phage-peptide display is a versatile technique that can give rise to high affinity peptide ligands that contain homology to bona fide binding proteins.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	174	 For example, phage-peptide display analysis using the ligand-free form of full-length MDM2 protein yielded a series of peptides with high homology to the BOX-I domain of p53 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	175	 The high affinity binding phage were purified and sequenced giving rise to two distinct classes of peptides.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The first class was obtained using ligand-free full-length MDM2 protein (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	177	 5A) and had homology to the BOX-I domain of p53 at residues critical for MDM2 binding (Phe19-X-X-X-Trp23-X-X-Leu26) (18).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	178	 These results are identical to the phage-peptide display performed on the N-terminal fragment of MDM2 protein fused to GST (34), except our analysis also included the Thr18 residue as being an important component of MDM2 binding giving rise to the consensus sequence Thr18-Phe19-X-X-X-Trp23-X-X-Leu26 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	179	 These latter data are consistent with the pronounced instability of the MDM2 p53 BOX-I domain complex containing a phosphate residue at Thr18 (26).

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	181	 A protein sequence with high homology to snRNP-U was obtained and no peptides were obtained with homology to the BOX-I domain of p53.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	182	 These data are consistent with the observation that RNA changes the conformation of MDM2 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	183	 4) and that MDM2 RNA complexes can bind to p53 lacking the BOX-I domain (25).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	184	 When snRNP-U and p53 were scanned for similar sites of homology, a motif with a significant degree of homology was found in between the conserved BOX-IV and BOX-V domains of p53 (Fig.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The peptide inserts in each phage were tested for specificity and sequenced to determine the insert peptide sequence.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	195	 The ligand-free form of MDM2 protein gave rise to the general consensus derived from the BOX-I domain of p53 (as indicated), whereas the RNA MDM2 isoform gave rise to the consensus sequence that matched most closely snRNP-U (as indicated).

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	200	As an independent approach, the C-terminal domain of pRb was scanned for putative homology motifs within the central coding region of p53, because this region of pRb has a non-canonical and undefined MDM2 docking site (33).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	201	 A striking degree of primary amino acid homology was observed between p53, snRNP-U, and pRb, with the p53 motif again residing in between the conserved BOX-IV and BOX-V domains (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	202	 A subsequent scan of polypeptides in a protein data base with this consensus motif identified a series of signaling proteins, including Wee1 and MCM5 (data not shown), producing the consensus site SGXLLGESXF (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Within p53, the SGXLLGESXF motif links the S9 and S10 -strands in the crystal structure of the p53 DNA complex (3) and is intriguingly defined by the DO-12 monoclonal antibody epitope (35).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The classic reversible unfolding/folding the p53 tetramer is defined by changes in the exposure of the cryptic epitopes of the monoclonal antibodies DO-11, PAb240, and DO-12, which reside in amino acid ranges 210-215, 224-231, and 255-270, respectively (5, 35).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	205	 As defined by the crystal structure of the p53 DNA complex (3), these cryptic epitopes are not buried but actually reside constrained on the surface of p53 protein.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	206	 It is interesting that just as p53 RNA complexes or p53 DNA complexes were reduced in binding to full-length MDM2 protein (Fig.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	221	 This loop + -sheet region also contains the epitope for the monoclonal antibody DO-12, which represents a conformationally flexible region in the central domain of p53 (3, 35).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	222	A final prediction of these studies would be that ligand-free MDM2 protein would bind better to the BOX-I domain and display little affinity for the DO-12 epitope peptide (S9-S10 linker peptide) containing the sequence SGNLLGRNSF.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	223	 By contrast, the RNA MDM2 complex would be predicted to switch specificity from the BOX-I domain and bind with a higher affinity to the S9-S10 linker peptide containing the SGNLLGRNSF polypeptide sequence.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Such a change in specificity is observed experimentally, with the MDM2 RNA complex displaying significant affinity for the DO-12 epitope peptide (Fig.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	229	 4), this ion had no affect on stimulating the MDM2 S9-S10 linker peptide complex (Fig.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	232	 The SGNLLGRNSF motif can be divided into two regions: 1) the SGXL motif is contained in the loop that bridges the S9 and S10 -sheets (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	233	 6C) and 2) the GESXF motif is contained within the S10 -sheet (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Marked deletion or multiple mutation of this linker region or the S10 -sheet was not performed, because this may unfold the entire subdomain and reduce MDM2 binding through global defects in the core domain structure.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	235	 In particular, three missense mutants were constructed: two with amino acids that fit the consensus between p53, snRNP-U, and pRb in the S9-S10 linker loop (Ser261 and Leu264) and a remaining one with an invariant amino acid in the SGNLLGRNSF consensus motif that extends into the S10 -sheet (Phe270).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Mutating the amino acids that are not in the surface loop may inactivate p53 (in fact mutation of Phe270 does impair p53 activity, see below), so the two surface loop mutants (alanine substitutions at Ser261 or at Leu264) were the first constructed that presumably will have little affect on the internal structure and activity of p53.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Alanine substitutions are generally thought to be more subtle than charged or aromatic residues, however, even single alanine substitutions in a reactive motif can either reduce or stimulate a protein protein interaction (58).

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	241	 The increased activity of the mutant p53 proteins cannot be attributed to changes in the half-life, because the wild-type p53 and the mutant p53 proteins have similar reduction in their half-life after transfection with MDM2 (data not shown, see Fig.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Additionally, although the ubiquitination of wild-type p53, p53S261A, and p53L264A proteins was most pronounced after co-transfection with the MDM2 gene (Fig.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	279	In summary, the characterization of these three mutant proteins in vivo with alanine substitutions in the central MDM2 interaction site has revealed differing degrees of enhancement of ubiquitination.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Although the alanine substitution is a common change made in a protein to bring about a reduction in the stability of a protein protein interaction, there have been instances where stabilization of a protein for its docking site by alanine mutation occurs (58, 63).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	281	 These data suggest that some protein protein interactions have evolved to maintain a lower affinity, but allowing reversibility in binding, and that binding affinity can be improved artificially.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Such an improvement has been reported with the MDM2 p53 BOX-I complex, where mutation has led to the improvement on MDM2 peptide binding affinity by many orders of magnitude (22, 34).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	283	We subsequently investigated whether the hyper-ubiquitination of p53F270A mutant protein was MDM2-depenent in vivo by examining the levels of ubiquitination using the p53F19A/F270A double mutant (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	284	 The hyper-ubiquitination of the p53F270A protein (Fig.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Furthermore, the p53F19A/F270A protein was not ubiquitinated after co-transfection of MDM2 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	287	 11A, lanes 4 and 6), under conditions where the p53F270A mutant protein showed increases in the ubiquitination pattern (Fig.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	289	 11B), indicating that changes in MDM2 protein levels cannot explain the increases in p53F270A mutant protein ubiquitination.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	290	 It is interesting, therefore, that wild-type p53 requires transfected MDM2 to catalyze its ubiquitination, whereas the p53F270A protein can rely on very small levels of endogenous MDM2 for its ubiquitination.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	296	We next examined whether the hyper-ubiquitination of p53F270A mutant protein was due to increases in MDM2 binding affinity for the mutant and whether the half-life of the hyper-ubiquitinated p53F270A protein was MDM2-dependent.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	297	 First, various p53 mutants were synthesized in reticulocyte lysates (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	298	 12) to determine whether MDM2 protein (SP fraction, Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	299	 1) binds with a higher affinity due to this alanine substituted mutant p53.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	300	 The p53F270A mutant protein formed the most stable complex with MDM2 protein of all the mutants tested (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	301	 It was relatively difficult to form a native protein protein complex in vitro between wild-type p53 protein synthesized in crude reticulocyte lysates and bacterially expressed MDM2 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	302	 12A, lane 2), so it is significant that a MDM2 p53F270A mutant protein complex can be detected at all.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Because MDM2 binds with a high affinity to 28 S rRNA (55), which is present in reticulocyte lysates, the lysate was treated after p53 protein synthesis with RNase, and this destabilized the MDM2 p53F270A mutant protein complex (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	304	 The MDM2 p53F270A mutant protein complex appeared MDM2-dependent, because the double-mutant protein p53F19A/F270A was not bound by MDM2 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Thus, enhanced ubiquitination of the p53F270A mutant protein in cells may be explained by the more stable interaction with an MDM2 RNA complex.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	330	Three major points will be discussed.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	331	 First, transfection of wild-type p53 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	332	 13A) induces endogenous MDM2 protein accumulation (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	333	 13D, lane 1) and the addition of cycloheximide results in rapid degradation of the endogenous MDM2 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	334	 This endogenous MDM2 protein appears incapable of promoting the ubiquitination of transfected wild-type p53 protein.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	335	 The transfected MDM2 results in ubiquitination of wild-type p53 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	336	 13A, lane 8 versus lane 1) and the addition of cycloheximide results in the degradation of the ubiquitinated p53 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	337	 13A, lanes 9-14) that mirrors the degradation of transfected MDM2 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	338	 The non-ubiquitinated p53 protein is not apparently degraded under these conditions (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	339	 13A, lanes 9-14), consistent with the fact that ubiquitination is required to target po53 for degradation.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	340	 Thus, the MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53 by the transfected MDM2 gene is rate-limiting and dependent upon the half-life of MDM2.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	341	Second, transfection of the p53F270A mutant protein resulting in its hyper-ubiquitination (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	342	 13B, lane 1) only marginally induces endogenous MDM2 protein accumulation (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	343	 13E, lane 1), consistent with its lower specific activity in reporter assays (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	344	 However, the addition of cycloheximide does not result in the rapid degradation of hyper-ubiquitinated-p53F270A mutant protein (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	345	 13B, lanes 2-7) under conditions where the endogenous MDM2 was degraded (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	346	 By contrast, the co-transfection of MDM2 with the p53F270A mutant switched the ubiquitination pattern of the p53F270A mutant protein (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	347	 13B, lane 8 versus lane 1), and the addition of cycloheximide resulted in degradation of the ubiquitinated p53F270A mutant protein (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	348	 13B, lanes 9-14) that mirrored the degradation of transfected MDM2 protein (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	349	 Additionally, the very high molecular species of p53F270A that actually increase in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	350	 13B, lanes 2-7 versus lane 1) were absent after transfection of MDM2 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	351	 These data indicate that the ubiquitination of the p53F270A mutant protein is being carried by a distinct mechanism in the presence of transfected or endogenous MDM2.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Consistent with this, the use of His-tagged ubiquitin in a transfection assay does not yield any hyper-ubiquitination of the p53F270A mutant protein (data not shown), suggesting that endogenous pools of ubiquitin are specifically recruited onto the p53F270A mutant protein.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	353	P53 protein is a conformationally dynamic allosterically regulated homo-tetramer that has multiple binding sites for regulatory protein co-factors.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	354	 As such, p53 protein forms that basis for a model oligomeric protein that can give insights into basic mechanisms of protein self-assembly, protein kinase function, transcription, and polyubiquitination mechanisms.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	355	 P53 protein contains independent sub-domains that direct sequence-specific DNA binding, nonspecific DNA binding, MDM2 or p300 binding, protein kinase binding, and homo-tetramerization.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	356	 When each domain is linked to the full-length protein, intradomain or allosteric regulation of p53-dependent activity can be observed.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	357	 For example, the polyproline domain in the N terminus of p53 negatively regulates MDM2 protein binding (29), whereas both the C- and N-terminal domains of p53 can regulate allosterically sequence-specific DNA binding (8, 37-40).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	358	MDM2 protein negatively regulates the tumor suppressor activity of p53 by a variety of overlapping mechanisms.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	359	 The binding of MDM2 to the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 can block p53-dependent transcription through steric mechanisms (41, 42).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	360	 MDM2 protein also normally promotes the polyubiquitination of p53 (43, 44), by which mechanism MDM2 can modulate the steady-state levels of p53 protein.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	361	 For example, under some conditions, the ubiquitination is associated with rapid degradation of p53 (45).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	362	 However, polyubiquitination of endogenous p53 also increases after certain types of DNA damage in normal human fibroblasts, indicating that ubiquitin modification does not always trigger the immediate turnover of p53 (46).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	363	 Nevertheless, the control of p53's degradation can involve the cytoplasmic transport of p53 protein by MDM2 where p53 is degraded by the proteasome pathway.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	364	 By contrast to the inhibitory affects of MDM2 on p53 protein levels, MDM2 protein can stimulate TAFII250-dependent expression from the cyclin A promoter indicating that MDM2 protein binding has distinct affects on different pathways (47, 48) and MDM2 can modulate E2F-dependent activity (64).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	365	The regulation of MDM2 and p53 polypeptide function has been facilitated historically by first dissecting the proteins into individual functional domains.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	366	 MDM2 protein contains several independent subdomains that either bind to the N-terminal BOX-I domain of p53, to the N terminus of the tumor suppressor p14ARF, to zinc, or to RNA.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	367	 This current study addresses the intradomain or allosteric regulation of full-length MDM2 protein and evidence that ligand binding by MDM2 protein switches its affinity and/or specificity from the BOX-I domain of p53 to the conformationally responsive loop flanked by the BOX-IV and BOX-V domains.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	368	 Three pieces of biochemical data have suggested previously that the MDM2 protein interface with tetrameric forms of p53 involves determinants outside the primary N-terminal BOX-I domain of p53.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	369	 The first was the observation that MDM2 does not bind to mutant forms of p53 with an altered core domain conformation (25, 49).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	370	 The second being the observation that full-length MDM2 protein does not bind to p53 DNA complexes in vitro, whereas the truncated N-terminal domain of MDM2 can bind stably to such p53 DNA complexes (18, 25).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	371	 The final being the observation that MDM2 RNA complexes can bind to p53 protein lacking the N-terminal BOX-I domain (25).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	372	 The determinants within the p53 tetramer that modulate MDM2 protein binding to the BOX-I domain or that stabilize MDM2 protein binding to sites outside the BOX-I domain were undefined prior to the studies described in this report.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	373	The first protein that was shown to bind to p53 was the SV40 T-antigen (50, 51), although details about the structure of this complex are lacking.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	374	 This interaction results in the inactivation of p53 function, and the binding occurs within the central domain of the p53 tetramer.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	375	 Point mutations that unfold the p53 tetramer destabilize the p53 T-antigen complex suggesting a non-linear binding interaction exists between the two proteins (52).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	376	 Additionally, classically purified T-antigen does not bind to p53 tetramers unless T-antigen is reconstituted with metal ions like zinc (53).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	377	 The purification of T-antigen results in the loss of the activating metal ion and the re-binding of zinc induces a pronounced conformational change in T-antigen that restores its binding interface with p53 (53).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	378	 A cellular protein that shares similar features to viral T-antigen is the p53 binding protein BP2.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	379	 This latter protein was identified in a yeast-two hybrid screen that attempted to define cellular proteins that interact with wild-type but not mutant forms of p53 (54).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	380	 Like T-antigen, BP2 interacts with p53 in the central domain and certain classes of mutations that can disrupt the p53 tetramer prevent stable binding of BP2 (52).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	381	 Thus, T-antigen and BP2 proteins form the precedent for polypeptides that interact in a relatively complex and dynamic fashion within the central domain of the folded p53 tetramer.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	382	 MDM2 protein interaction with p53 appears to be similarly sensitive to conformational effects.

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, October 9, 2003 , and in revised form, December 22, 2003.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	3	Regulation of WT-p53 protein is based on a strict physiological turnover including ubiquitination and degradation in the cytoplasm.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of p53 depends on nuclear export signals (NES)1 and nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) located in the N and C termini of the protein (7).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The main regulator of p53 is Mdm2, which interacts with the N-terminal of p53 thus blocking p53 transcriptional activation and promoting its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (8).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of p53 seems to be essential for its degradation by Mdm2 (9, 10).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Moreover, it has been demonstrated that Mdm2 expression is a key factor that efficiently promotes nuclear export of p53 (11, 12).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Important stimuli leading to p53 activation and stabilization such as DNA damage, which causes phosphorylation of the N-terminal NES (13), or p14ARF expression, which interferes with Mdm2 activity (14), efficiently inhibit p53 nuclear exclusion.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	9	 On the contrary, proteins like E1B55k (15), Mot-2 (16), Parc (17), or PSF-TFE3 (18) are able to down-regulate or destabilize p53 by cytoplasmic sequestration, thus emphasizing the importance of p53 relocalization as an effective means to control its function.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	10	The C-terminal domain of p53 has been characterized as a key domain involved in the control of p53 localization (19, 20).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Three NLSs and one NES are located within amino acids 316 and 384 of p53.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	12	 It has been proposed that p53 localization is mainly regulated by the NES masking/NES exposition switch (21).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Mdm2-driven ubiquitination or certain mutations of the p53 C-terminal region enhance p53 relocalization to the cytoplasm (22, 23).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	14	Mouse GTSE-1 (G2 and S phase-expressed), previously named B99, is a cell cycle-regulated protein that mainly localizes to the microtubules and is induced by WT-p53 upon DNA damage (24, 25).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	15	 We have recently shown that its human homologue, hGTSE-1 (26), is able to control DNA damage-induced apoptosis by down-regulating p53 function (27).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	16	 hGTSE-1 binds the C-terminal domain of p53 (355-393) and induces down-regulation of p53 levels and activity.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Although hGTSE-1 binding to p53 seems to be required for repressing p53 activity, it is unclear how hGTSE-1 regulates p53 stability.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	18	Here we report that hGTSE-1 protein accumulates after DNA damage through a p53-independent mechanism concomitant with its relocalization from cytoplasm to the nucleus.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	19	 By studying hGTSE-1 subcellular localization we found that it is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein containing an active NES in its C-terminal region.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	20	 We also demonstrate that in addition to decreasing p53 levels, hGTSE-1 expression promotes p53 localization to the cytoplasm.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Finally, we show that shuttling activity of hGTSE-1 as well as Mdm2 are both required for the regulation of p53 localization and levels.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	22	Cells treated with methyl methanesulfonate (Fluka) were incubated for 4 h with the drug followed by extensive washing and medium replacement until the end of the treatment.

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The staining was performed using specific antibodies incubated in 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline at 37  degrees C followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) as indicated.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	35	 For hGTSE-1 and GTSE-1 staining we used affinity purified polyclonal antibodies (24, 26).

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	45	To characterize the p53-dependent regulation of hGTSE-1 protein, we used human cell lines expressing a temperature-sensitive p53 allele (TS-p53), with a mutant conformation at 37  degrees C and a WT conformation at 32  degrees C.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	46	 1A, no differences in hGTSE-1 protein levels were observed between WT or mutant p53 conformations, indicating that the expression of hGTSE-1 protein is not induced by WT-p53.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	47	 This observation is supported by the fact that p53 failed to increase hGTSE-1 mRNA levels in Northern blot analysis in the same cellular system (data not shown).

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	54	  We then analyzed hGTSE-1 protein levels in response to DNA-damaging agents such as -radiation and ET in cells containing different forms of endogenous p53: MCF-7 (WT p53), T47D cells (mutant p53), and Saos-2 cells (p53 null).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	55	 1B, hGTSE-1 expression increased after -irradiation (400 rads) in all tested cell lines.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Similar results were obtained using 100  microM ET (data not shown), suggesting that hGTSE-1 protein levels increase after genotoxic stress independently of p53 status.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	57	 A time course experiment after ET treatment was performed to study the behavior of endogenous hGTSE-1 protein upon DNA damage in U2OS cells.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	58	 1C, Western blot analysis revealed that the hGTSE-1 protein increased 15-18 h after treatment with ET.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Furthermore, analysis of p53 response in this context showed that hGTSE-1 becomes accumulated with a slower kinetic compared with both p53 and the p53-induced protein p21Waf-1 (32), detected 3 and 6-9 h after ET treatment, respectively, indicating that hGTSE-1 increases in a late phase after DNA damage.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	60	By analyzing hGTSE-1 intracellular localization we observed that, similar to the murine protein, hGTSE-1 is a cytoplasmic protein localized to the microtubules (26).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Overexpression of hGTSE-1, however, revealed a small subpopulation of cells that, in addition to cytoplasmic staining, displayed nuclear staining (data not shown).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	62	 This observation prompted us to analyze whether a change in hGTSE-1 localization could be associated to a DNA damage response.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	63	 To this purpose, endogenous and ectopically expressed hGTSE-1 localization were analyzed in U2OS cells 24 h after ET treatment.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	64	 2A, ET treatment evidenced a significant fraction of cells with nuclear-localized hGTSE-1.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Scoring hGTSE-1 localization in cells treated with ET, as well as its localization in cells treated with other DNA damaging agents as methyl methanesulfonate (100  microM) or UV irradiation (20 J/m2) (see "Experimental Procedures"), indicated that DNA damage efficiently relocalized hGTSE-1 to the nucleus (Fig.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Finally, the kinetics of hGTSE-1 relocalization were monitored in U2OS cells ectopically expressing hGTSE-1 at different time points after ET treatment.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	67	 2C, ET treatment strongly enhanced hGTSE-1 relocalization to the nucleus 13-18 h after damage, coincident with the previous information related to the accumulation of the endogenous protein (Fig.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Altogether these observations indicate that hGTSE-1 becomes stabilized and relocalized to the nucleus in response to DNA damage signals.

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	77	 To this purpose, we analyzed the intracellular distribution of hGTSE-1 or its mouse homologue GTSE-1 in unstressed U2OS cells after treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB).

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	86	  Previous studies using a set of mouse GTSE-1 deletion mutants suggested that the C-terminal region of the protein was involved in controlling its localization.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	87	2 Analysis of the mouse GTSE-1 amino acid sequence revealed a conserved leucine-rich sequence (Fig.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	88	 3B) conforming to the criteria established for NESs, similar to that observed for HIV-1 Rev protein (33).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	89	 We generated human and mouse GTSE-1 constructs with a double-point mutation within the putative NES (hGTSE-1 NES- and GTSE-1 NES-, respectively) by changing isoleucine 628 and leucine 630 to alanine in hGTSE-1, and leucines 648 and 650 to alanine in GTSE-1 as indicated in Fig.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	90	 hGTSE-1 NES- and GTSE-1 NES- constructs were transfected in U2OS cells and 24 h later their localizations were assessed by immunofluorescence.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	91	 3C, both NES mutants displayed an enhanced nuclear localization, thus identifying the presence of an active NES within GTSE-1 proteins.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	92	 This result is in accordance with the enhanced nuclear localization of hGTSE-1 and GTSE-1 observed after LMB treatment, because such a drug inhibits nuclear export pathways that require the CRM1 receptor for leucine-rich NESs (34-36).

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	94	 However, point mutation of two putative NLSs starting on amino acids 235 and 542, failed to completely abolish nuclear localization of hGTSE-1 (data not shown), indicating that other signals or other factors could be involved in such activity.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	95	hGTSE-1 Overexpression Enhances Cytoplasmic Localization of p53 We have previously reported that hGTSE-1 is able to bind the C-terminal region of p53 and down-regulate its levels and activity (27).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Because the C-terminal region of p53 has been shown to be critical in regulating its stability (37) as well as its subcellular localization (21, 23) we studied the effect of hGTSE-1 expression with respect to p53 localization.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	97	To analyze the effect of hGTSE-1 expression on the subcellular localization of p53, we cotransfected hGTSE-1 and GFP-p53 expression vectors in human osteosarcoma cells lacking p53 (MG-63).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	98	 We chose the GFP-tagged p53 construct because it represents a sensible and broadly used method to detect p53 localization (10, 12, 19) and is poorly sensitive to hGTSE-1-induced degradation (see Fig.

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	143	 In addition, the increased accumulation of hGTSE-1 NES- in the nucleus when compared with the WT protein was biochemically demonstrated in this cell fractionation, supporting our data presented in Fig.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Altogether these data indicate that shuttling activity of hGTSE-1 is required for promoting nuclear export of p53.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	145	The inability of hGTSE-1 NES- in relocalizing p53 to the cytoplasm could be attributed to its defective shuttling activity because it can interact with p53 similarly to the WT protein, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments.

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	149	Previous results indicated that overexpression of hGTSE-1 down-regulates p53 protein levels (27).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Because p53 degradation is described to occur mainly in the cytoplasm (38), we investigated whether regulation of p53 protein stability via hGTSE-1 expression was linked to enhanced cytoplasmic localization of p53 by analyzing the effect of WT and NES-defective hGTSE-1 proteins on p53 levels.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	151	 To this purpose, p53 null MG-63 cells were transfected with vectors expressing WT or NES- hGTSE-1 and p53, together with an empty GFP vector used as transfection control.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	152	 To perform this experiment, we transfected low levels of untagged WT p53, to appreciate alterations in its stability, because we have observed that the stable GFP-p53 fusion protein does not represent a sensitive assay for hGTSE-1-dependent regulation (see Fig.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	153	 24 h later cell lysates were prepared and p53 protein levels were assessed by Western blotting.

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Finally, we investigated whether down-regulation of p53 levels by hGTSE-1 required proteasome activity.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Experiments were performed by adding the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to cells transfected in parallel to those shown in the left panel of Fig.

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	158	 5E (right panel), inhibition of proteasome abolished p53 down-regulation by WT hGTSE-1, indicating that proteasome activity is required for the control of p53 stability by hGTSE-1.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	159	Functional Mdm2 Is Required for hGTSE-1-dependent p53 Nuclear Export The obtained results suggest that hGTSE-1 is able to down-regulate p53 protein levels by a mechanism involving p53 cytoplasmic relocalization.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Mdm2 is the major regulator of p53 (4, 5) and strongly promotes p53 nuclear exclusion (11, 12).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	161	 For this reason we next analyzed the requirement of Mdm2 in the hGTSE-1-dependent regulation of p53 subcellular localization.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	162	Our first approach was to analyze the effect of hGTSE-1 in the subcellular localization of GFP-p53 in Mdm2-deficient cells (MEF p53-/-, Mdm2-/-).

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	186	 To this purpose cells were transfected with vectors expressing WT or NES- hGTSE-1 and p53, together with an empty GFP vector used as transfection control as performed in Fig.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Western blot analysis indicated that hGTSE-1 did not markedly affect p53 stability, suggesting that hGTSE-1 could regulate p53 levels by enhancing its cytoplasmic relocalization through an Mdm2-dependent mechanism.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	188	In unstressed cells, a number of positive and negative regulators maintain the steady-state level of p53.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Under stress conditions, p53 is activated by a variety of post-translational modifications that altogether lead to its rapid stabilization and accumulation in the nucleus (7).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	190	 These modifications are usually necessary for the association of p53 with factors involved in its stabilization and activation, such as Pin-1 (40) and/or for dissociation from factors that negatively regulate p53, like Mdm2 or JNK (41, 42).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	191	 On the contrary, during post-damage recovery, negative regulators play a critical role in down-regulating p53 levels and activity to restore its steady-state function.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	192	 It can be hypothesized that such a recovery phase requests for other regulators, like hGTSE-1, in addition to the most established ones.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	193	In this report we show that hGTSE-1 protein levels increase in response to several DNA-damaging agents.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Because we have recently demonstrated that hGTSE-1 expression attenuates DNA damage-induced apoptosis by controlling p53 function (27), increased levels of hGTSE-1 protein after DNA damage may be involved in negative feedback regulation of the p53 signaling pathway.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Consistent with this model, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of hGTSE-1 sensitizes cells to p53-dependent apoptosis upon DNA damage (27).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Thus, hGTSE-1 may play an important role in DNA damage response, by preventing prolonged p53 activation.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Further analysis of the behavior of hGTSE-1 allowed us to show that, after DNA damage, hGTSE-1 is clearly relocalized from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Time course experiments performed to dissect the kinetics of hGTSE-1 enhanced expression and nuclear accumulation after DNA damage, indicate that both occur with a slower rate when compared with p53 stabilization, activation, and p21Waf-1 induction.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	199	 This observation could imply that, at early time points after DNA damage, hGTSE-1 should not interfere with the p53 response, rather, it could play a critical role in controlling a later phase in the p53 response, most likely in the post-damage recovery phase.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	200	We show that hGTSE-1 actively shuttles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus as evidenced by the nuclear export inhibitor LMB, which caused clear nuclear accumulation of hGTSE-1.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Furthermore, mutation of the C-terminal NES (hGTSE-1 NES-) enhanced hGTSE-1 nuclear localization.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	202	Shuttling activity of hGTSE-1 therefore emerged as a potentially critical mechanism for controlling p53 localization and stability.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	203	 In line with this hypothesis, coexpression of hGTSE-1 and p53 (used as GFP-tagged protein) resulted in increased cytoplasmic distribution of p53 when compared with localization of p53 alone.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	204	 hGTSE-1 is known to interact with p53 in a region mapped between amino acids 355 and 393 (27), where two NLS are located (7).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination of lysine residues found within these NLSs results in enhanced cytoplasmic localization of p53 (23), suggesting that modification to this region could lead to p53 nuclear export.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	206	 In this context, physical interaction of hGTSE-1 with p53 could affect this region, enhancing p53 cytoplasmic localization.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Importantly, hGTSE-1 shuttling activity is required to promote p53 localization to the cytoplasm.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Our results clearly demonstrate that NES defective hGTSE-1 failed in enhancing p53 distribution to the cytoplasm, although its ability to associate p53 was comparable with WT hGTSE-1.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	209	 It is therefore conceivable that cytoplasmic redistribution of p53, as enhanced by hGTSE-1, is not merely because of alterations or modifications of the C-terminal domain of p53 caused by this interaction, rather, our data also indicate the requirement of hGTSE-1 shuttling activity.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Interestingly, Mdm2, known to efficiently promote p53 nuclear exclusion (11, 12) is also required for the hGTSE-1 effect on p53 localization, because we observed that hGTSE-1 WT shows an impaired ability in relocalizing p53 in Mdm2-deficient cells.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	211	Similarly to that observed for p53 relocalization, an intact NES and functional Mdm2 seem to be required by hGTSE-1 in regulation of p53 protein levels, indicating a relationship between the ability of hGTSE-1 to relocalize p53 to the cytoplasm and to regulate its stability.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Moreover, inhibition of proteasome activity prevents p53 protein down-regulation by hGTSE-1 expression, indicating that cytoplasmic localization of p53 could be accompanied by proteasome-dependent degradation.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	213	 The Mdm2 ring finger domain and its ability to ubiquitinate p53 have been shown to be critical in promoting p53 nuclear export (11, 12) and degradation in the cytoplasm (10, 38).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The possibility that hGTSE-1 could promote p53 nuclear export by enhancing Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination of p53 does not seem to be consistent with our data, because no detectable increase in p53 ubiquitination was observed in the in vivo ubiquitination assay (data not shown).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	215	 We thus favor the hypothesis that hGTSE-1 accelerates the p53 nuclear export process after Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	216	Nuclear accumulated hGTSE-1 looses its ability to regulate both localization and levels of p53, as demonstrated using NES defective hGTSE-1.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Therefore, we could hypothesize that nuclear accumulation of hGTSE-1, in response to DNA damage, could be because of the phosphorylation-dependent mechanism-inactivating NES function.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Subsequently, in the post-damage recovery phase, reactivation of hGTSE-1 NES activity through dephosphorylation could be required for the efficient regulatory function of hGTSE-1 on p53.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	219	It is conceivable that a similar function of hGTSE-1 takes place in unstressed cells during the cell cycle, because we have shown that it can control basal p53 levels preferentially during the S and G2 phases (27).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Moreover, p53 localization was reported to change during the cell cycle, with increased cytoplasmic distribution during S and G2 (43, 44), coincident with hGTSE-1 highest expression.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Together these data could suggest a physiological function of hGTSE-1 in regulating p53 stability and nuclear exclusion of p53 in unstressed cells, possibly during specific phases of the cell cycle that require additional and more stringent negative regulators.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	222	Our results indicate that after DNA damage hGTSE-1 is stabilized independently of p53 status, suggesting that in response to damage, hGTSE-1 could play specific functions in parallel to that involving p53 regulation.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	223	 In fact, the ability of hGTSE-1 to regulate the cell cycle progression is p53 independent (27).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Other proteins such as JNK (42), Pin-1 (40), or p38 kinase (45) play a role in p53 signaling although their regulation does not depend on p53, thus suggesting that p53 function is tightly controlled by independent signaling pathways.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	225	We present here a possible mechanism by which hGTSE-1 can regulate p53 after DNA damage, highlighting the relevance of its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling activity and functional requirement of Mdm2.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	226	 hGTSE-1, like its mouse homologue GTSE-1, is a cell cycle-regulated protein that maintains its S- and G2-specific expression even when induced by DNA-damaging agents (25).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	227	 We therefore propose a role of hGTSE-1 as part of a negative feedback loop involved in the control of DNA damage and during specific phases of the cell cycle that require more effective means to down-regulate p53 activity and levels.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, September 12, 2001, and in revised form, January 16, 2002.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	3	The importance of p53 as a tumor suppressor has been well documented.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Over half of all human cancers are mutated in the gene encoding p53, and many viruses can induce transformation of the host cell through p53 inactivation (Ref.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Furthermore, inheriting a germline p53 mutation characteristic of Li-Fraumeni syndrome confers a strong predisposition to cancer because 50% of those afflicted acquire cancer by age 30 (4, 5).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The role of p53 in tumorigenesis was also demonstrated in an animal tumor model, in which p53/ mice were found to be more prone to cancer development (primarily lymphomas) compared with their wild type (p53+/+) and heterozygous (p53+/) littermates (6, 7).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Loss of p53 or its function is therefore clearly linked to tumor formation.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	8	As "guardian of the genome," p53 is activated by a number of genotoxic and stress signals such as ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, ribonucleotide depletion, hypoxia, oxidative stress, heat shock, and exposure to nitric oxide (reviewed in Ref.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Critical to the tumor-suppressing function of activated p53 is its ability to bind sequence-specific DNA sites and induce the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This is illustrated by the fact that most p53 mutations occur in its DNA-binding domain and affect its sequence-specific DNA binding ability (1).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Such mutations (called "hot spot" mutations) can be divided into two categories; class I mutations affect residues that make direct contact with DNA, whereas class II mutations occur at residues crucial for maintaining the conformation of the DNA-binding domain (9).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	12	The consensus p53 binding site consists of two or more copies of the 10-bp half-site 5'-PuPuPuC(A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPy-3' separated by up to 13 bp (10).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Minor variations to this consensus sequence are found in all p53 target genes.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Each half-site consists of two inverted repeat 5-bp quarter sites.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	15	 p53 binds to this consensus DNA sequence as a pair of clamps, with the two monomers within each dimer binding to two consecutive quarter sites within a half-site (11).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The two dimers within the tetramer therefore bind to the two half-sites in juxtaposition to each other, resulting in overall enhanced stability of the p53-DNA complex.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The lack of such cooperative binding in a single dimer-half-site interaction accounts for the drastically reduced stability of the dimer-half-site complex relative to that of the tetramer-full site complex.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This is also reflected by the observation that in contrast to full sites, half-sites do not confer transcriptional responsiveness to p53.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	19	Although there is little doubt that tumors often arise through deletion or mutation of both p53 alleles (the two-hit model) (12), there is increasing evidence that a point mutation or deletion in a single allele could result in increased susceptibility to cancer (13-17).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In cases where both mutant and wild type p53 are expressed, it has been suggested that the mutant protein exerts a dominant negative effect over the wild type protein, essentially rendering the latter inactive (reviewed in Refs.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The end result is a drastic decrease in the level of functional p53, which in turn promotes genomic instability and cancer development.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	22	 That the mere reduction in functional p53 levels may be sufficient to promote tumorigenesis has also been recently shown in an animal tumor model in which heterozygous p53+/ mice containing a single wild type p53 allele develop tumors much earlier than those mice with two functional p53 alleles (17).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	23	The fact that many human tumors contain both a mutant and a wild type allele has led to speculations as to how mutant p53 can affect wild type p53 function.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	24	 It has been proposed (and generally believed) that in such tumors, the mutant p53 protein complexes with the wild type counterpart and drives the latter into a mutant conformation that is nonfunctional (i.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	25	 This model portrays mutant p53 as being dominant over wild type p53, leading to the so-called "dominant negative" effect.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Support for this model has come largely from experiments in which mutant and wild type p53 were found to be coprecipitatable when they are coexpressed (20).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	27	 More recent data suggest that the C-terminal oligomerization domain of p53 is absolutely required for the manifestation of this dominant negative effect, because p53 mutants without a functional tetramerization domain are not dominant negative and not oncogenic (21, 22).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Although it now seems clear that p53 mutants need to interact with wild type p53 to impart a dominant negative effect (23), there is no concrete evidence that this effect is the result of an induced conformational change of the wild type protein.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Indeed, it has been reported that mutant p53 proteins that have a wild type conformation (class I mutants) are also able to impart a dominant negative effect (24).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In corroboration with the above observation was the demonstration that the C-terminal oligomerization domain alone is sufficient to disrupt normal wild type p53 function (25, 26).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In view of the somewhat fragmentary and at times apparently contradictory information obtained thus far pertaining to the mechanistic aspects of the p53 dominant negative effect (reviewed in Refs.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	32	 18 and 19), a unifying concept that can accommodate most, if not all, of the observations made to date is badly needed.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Such information would provide a better understanding of the role of p53 mutants in tumor development and would lead to the design of more precise and effective therapeutic measures in restoring wild type p53 function.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	34	Cloning-- The full-length constructs used were pGEMhp53wtB (wild type tetrameric human p53-hp53) and pGEM A344 (dimeric human p53-A344), both gifts from T.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	67	p53 Dimerization Occurs Cotranslationally-- To gain a complete understanding of how p53 monomers reach a tetrameric state, we carried out in vitro experiments to study the biogenesis pathway of p53.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	68	 It was important to first determine whether p53 dimerization occurs cotranslationally or posttranslationally.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	69	 To this end, we used transcripts of a dimeric mutant named A344 for in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	70	 This mutant contains a point mutation at residue 344 (from leucine to alanine) that disrupts the dimer-dimer interface and results in the formation of dimeric rather than tetrameric p53 (27).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	71	 We reasoned that if p53 dimerization was a posttranslational event, then the efficiency of dimer formation would be strictly dependent on the concentration of the translated A344 protein (and hence the concentration of the transcripts) in the reaction.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Conversely, the efficiency of cotranslational dimer formation (i.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	73	 on the polysome) would not be affected by transcript concentration.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Accordingly, various amounts of A344 transcripts were translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and dimer formation in these reactions was assessed by direct half-site DNA binding analysis using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	75	2 Because monomeric p53 cannot bind DNA (22), the results should be relatively unambiguous.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	76	 1 shows that regardless of transcript concentration in the reactions (three serial 2-fold dilutions), the dimer/total A344 ratios remained relatively constant.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	77	 These results are consistent with the notion that p53 dimerization occurs cotranslationally rather than posttranslationally.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Low A344 transcript concentrations were serially diluted (2-fold; 6.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	81	78 ng/ microl) and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	82	 A, identical fixed volumes of each 35S-labeled translation mixture were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for total A344 protein expressed (upper panel) and by EMSA for dimeric A344 through its binding to a 32P-labeled half-site (H1) (lower panel).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	83	 B, similar to A except that the amounts of translation mixture analyzed were adjusted to compensate for the dilution factor such that all samples contained approximately the same amount of translated protein.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	84	 For EMSA analysis, the 35S signal was blocked such that it did not interfere with film exposure to 32P.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	85	To further confirm that p53 dimerization is a cotranslational event, we made use of another dimeric construct, A344N (Fig.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	86	 A344N is derived from A344 and has a small deletion at the N terminus (residues 2-30), making it migrate faster than A344 upon SDS-PAGE.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Like A344, A344N bound the consensus DNA half-site as dimeric p53 (Fig.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Furthermore, because of this deletion, A344N was unable to interact with the anti-p53 antibody DO-1, which readily recognized A344 (Fig.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Because DO-1 is capable of recognizing a monomer within a dimer (see below), it was used in coprecipitation studies to see whether cotranslation of the two constructs could lead to the formation of A344/A344N heterodimers detectable by this antibody.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The results show that under translation conditions using normal concentrations of RNA, where the two constructs formed dimers readily (as assessed by EMSA), DO-1 precipitated A344 but not A344N (Fig.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	91	 These data strongly suggest that p53 dimers form cotranslationally.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	92	 To rule out the possibility that A344/A344N heterodimers are unstable or undetectable, we cotranslated the two transcripts at high RNA concentrations.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	109	 We first translated various amounts of wild type human p53 (hp53) in vitro and assessed the formation of dimeric and tetrameric p53 by direct half-site DNA binding using EMSA.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	136	 These species should be clearly discernible using the antibody DO-1 for supershift experiments in EMSA.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	142	 However, we consistently found (hp53)4 to be somewhat under-represented (Fig.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	143	 This was likely due to DO-1 partially blocking the binding of (hp53)4 to the consensus sequence, thereby reducing the level of (hp53)4-bound DNA (Fig.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The binding of the (hp53)2/(hp53N)2 tetramer to DNA was apparently unaffected by DO-1, possibly because only one of the two dimers interacted with the antibody.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Overall, the results from the two sets of experiments involving dimeric and tetrameric constructs, respectively, are consistent with the idea that p53 biogenesis is a two-step process: cotranslational dimerization followed by posttranslational tetramerization.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	147	 This is in agreement with previous results on the folding of peptides from the tetramerization domain of p53 (29).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	148	Dimers within Tetramers, but Not Monomers within Dimers, Are Exchangeable-- Our demonstration that dimers are formed cotranslationally suggests that posttranslational exchange of monomeric subunits between dimers is probably not very efficient, if it occurs at all.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	149	 On the other hand, because dimer-dimer interaction (tetramerization) is a posttranslational event, there is a good possibility that dimeric subunit exchange between p53 tetramers can occur with a certain degree of efficiency (30).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	150	 This is an important consideration because it would imply that an equilibrium could exist between dimers and tetramers and that external factors or parameters could influence this equilibrium and hence p53 function.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	151	To test this hypothesis, it was first necessary to confirm the relative lack of monomeric exchange between dimers.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	152	 35S-Labeled A344 and A344N were translated separately, and cycloheximide was then added to halt further translation.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Incubation was continued for an additional hour to allow time for each reaction to reach equilibrium.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	154	 The two reactions were then mixed and incubated for 2 h, after which immunoprecipitation with DO-1 was carried out to look for heterodimer formation, which would be indicative of subunit exchange.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The results showed that no A344N could be coprecipitated with A344 (Fig.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	156	 5A), suggesting that exchange of monomers between dimers did not occur.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Therefore, the cotranslational formation of p53 dimers appears to be a one-way process.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	158	 This is also in agreement with our observation above that p53 monomers do not exist in solution.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	168	 After a 2-h incubation period, there was a clear increase of heterotetramer formation.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	169	 This shows that dimers within a tetramer of p53 can exchange with one another and that they are in equilibrium.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	170	 This equilibrium strongly favors tetramers over dimers because the vast majority of p53 present following translation and maturation is tetrameric (11).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Our demonstration of dimer exchange between tetramers is again congruent with the concept of p53 tetramerization being a posttranslational process involving the dimerization of dimers.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Our present demonstration that p53 tetramers are formed by posttranslational dimerization of dimers suggests that in cells (e.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Li-Fraumeni cells) containing a wild type and a mutant p53 allele, only a single species of heterotetramers would be generated: (wt-p53)2/(mu-p53)2.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Because we have recently established that the two dimers within a p53 tetramer are conformationally independent (31), it would be of interest to assess the binding of these heterotetramers to the consensus sequence (CON).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	176	 To this end, we cotranslated hp53N with five of the most common p53 mutants in human cancers (1), in addition to wild type hp53 as control.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Of the five mutants used, three are contact (class I) mutants (named H273, W248, and Q248) whose mutations lie in amino acids that directly associate with DNA, whereas two are conformational (class II) mutants (named S249 and H175) whose mutations destablilize the structure of the core domain of p53 (9).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	178	Immunoprecipitation of the cotranslation reactions with the DO-1 antibody reveals that like wild type p53, all five mutants efficiently complexed with hp53N (Fig.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	179	 As expected, all five mutant homotetramers manifest extremely low, if any, affinity for the p53 consensus sequence (Fig.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	181	 In contrast, the five heterotetramers manifested significant consensus sequence binding activity, ranging from 40 to 100% that of the control (hp53)2/(hp53N)2 tetramer (Figs.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Moreover, all five DNA-bound heterotetramers were stably bound, with half-lives ranging from 4.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	183	5 min (data not shown), which was significantly longer than that of a wild type dimer bound to a half-site (half-life, ~1 s) (11, 31).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Therefore, for both class I and class II mutants, the inability of the mutant dimeric subunit to bind CON does not negatively affect the capacity of the wild type dimer subunit to bind DNA.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	185	 It thus seems unlikely that in a mutant/wild type p53 heterotetramer, the mutant dimer imposes a mutant conformation upon the wild type dimer.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	197	 To address this issue, we chose a wide range of natural human p53 target sites (Table I).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	198	 These were taken from genes involved in cell cycle arrest (p21 and 14-3-3), apoptosis (cyclin G, Fas, PIDD, IGF-BP3, and bax), DNA repair (gadd45), and p53 stability (hdm2), whose transcription was found to occur in a p53- dependent manner.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	199	 The CON sequence was included as a reference and control.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	200	 7 (left panels), cotranslation of hp53 and hp53N (the wild type control) generated three tetrameric species ((hp53)4, (hp53)2/(hp53N)2, and (hp53N)4), all of which bound to each of the 10 sequences in the approximate ratio of 1:2:1 (the slight variation in migration rates between target sequences was due to size (charge) differences of these sequences).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	201	 However, cotranslation of the five mutants with hp53N revealed a very different scenario.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	202	 First, none of the mutant homotetramers were capable of efficient binding to any of the target sites (i.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	203	 the equivalent of the uppermost band shown in the control ((hp53)4) was either weak or not present at all in the mutant/hp53N cotranslations).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	204	 This was not unexpected because all of the mutants were known class I or class II mutants.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Second, and importantly, all five mutant p53/hp53N heterotetramers bind the 10 target sites relatively poorly compared with the wild type p53/hp53N heterotetramer, although the binding to CON was the least affected (Fig.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Reduced binding capacity of the heterotetramer was less pronounced for the mutant H273 but was clearly manifest for the other four mutants (H175, S249, Q248, and W248) (note different scales used).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	207	 We reason that the reduced binding to these natural p53 target sequences is likely due to the lack of significant input in the form of complementary (and cooperative) binding from the mutant dimeric partner.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	208	 A third interesting observation pertains to the extent of reduced binding of the heterotetramers to the different sequences.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	209	 In particular, all of the mutant heterotetramers show drastically reduced binding to promoter sequences that govern apoptosis, namely, PIDD, IGF-BP3, and bax, compared with the other promoters, such as p21, that regulate cell cycle progression.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	210	It is generally accepted that the p53 tetramer is a dimer of dimers.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	211	 However, precisely how this comes about has been an enigma.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	212	 It has been assumed that p53 comes off the polysome as monomers, which then dimerize in solution to form dimers; dimer-dimer interaction in turn leads to the formation of tetramers (34, 35).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	213	 The present study shows that this scenario is incorrect; we demonstrate that p53 dimerization occurs cotranslationally (i.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	214	 on the polysome), whereas tetramerization occurs posttranslationally (i.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	215	 In normal cells in which both p53 alleles are wild type, whether dimerization occurs cotranslationally or posttranslationally probably has no major theoretical ramifications.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	216	 However, this is not the case where the cell harbors a wild type and a mutant p53 allele.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Based on a posttranslational dimerization/posttranslational tetramerization mechanism (the currently accepted model), wild type p53 tetramers in such cells would comprise only of total p53.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	218	 On the other hand, the alternative mechanism (cotranslational dimerization/posttranslational tetramerization) would result in 1/4 of total p53 in these cells being wild type tetramers, a 4-fold difference that may well be sufficient to alter the fate of these cells upon exposure to genotoxic stress.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	219	 This is an important consideration in view of the recent observation that the mere reduction in p53 levels is sufficient to promote tumorigenesis (17).

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Stability of this binding is further enhanced by positive cooperative interaction between the two dimers.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Panel ii, mutant p53 homotetramers are unable to bind DNA (or bind DNA very poorly) because they have mutations either in residues that make direct contact with DNA (class I mutants) or in residues that are crucial for maintaining the conformation of the DNA-binding domain (class II mutants).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Panel iii, p53 dominant negative effect: the "incompetent partner" model.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	231	 In wild type p53/mutant p53 heterotetramers, it is unlikely that the mutant dimer imposes a conformational change on the wild type dimer, which can still bind to a half-site.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	232	 The inability of the mutant dimer to "properly" bind to the other half-site and to contribute significantly to positive cooperativity results in an unstable heterotetramer-DNA complex.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The extent of reduced positive cooperativity varies between target sequences.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	234	In concluding that p53 dimerization occurs cotranslationally, we are suggesting that neighboring nascent p53 chains on a polysome interact with each other prior to being released into the cytosol (Fig.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Such a dimerization scheme would be highly efficient because it would spare individual p53 subunits the need to search for their "partners" in a soluble pool.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Precisely how monomeric p53 nascent chains interact with each other is unclear at present.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Based on our current knowledge of the p53 dimerization domain, which is located at the C terminus of the protein (residues 323-356 (30, 36-38)), it would seem logical to deduce that interaction between neighboring chains occurs during the late stages of the translation process, close to the 3' end of the p53 transcript and just prior to release of the p53 chains from the polysome.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	238	 However, one cannot rule out the possibility that interaction between neighboring nascent chains first occurs at more upstream sites, which then gives way to more a stable interaction at the C-terminal oligomerization domain as soon as this becomes feasible.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Considering the highly hydrophobic nature of the oligomerization domain (30, 36-38), cotranslational dimerization would offer an efficient means by which hydrophobic residues from neighboring chains could quickly interact such that protein misfolding would be greatly minimized.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	240	In light of the model presented for the biogenesis, it is possible that the tetramerization process could represent a form of functional regulation.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Assuming that p53 is imported to the nucleus as a dimer, an attractive hypothesis would be that dimeric p53 represents a latent, inactive form of p53 requiring a signal to induce tetramerization and activation.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Then, following activation, degradation could be achieved by once again forming dimers to reveal a nuclear export sequence hidden in the tetramerization domain (34, 39, 40).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	243	 One way of accomplishing this could be through the posttranslational modification of p53.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	244	 To date, numerous posttranslational modifications have been described (reviewed in Ref.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	245	 In vitro, phosphorylation of Ser-315 and Ser-392 have been shown to affect p53 tetramerization (41, 42).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Others have suggested potential roles for SUMOylation and ubiquitination in p53 activation and degradation by altering its oligomeric state (39, 40, 43, 44).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Further experimentation is needed to properly address this issue.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	248	Perhaps the most important conclusion from these studies pertains to the so-called p53 dominant negative effect whereby a mutant p53 protein somehow negatively affects the function of the wild type counterpart (reviewed in Refs.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Our results suggest that in cells possessing a wild type and a mutant p53 allele, there is only one type of heterotetramer produced, namely wild type dimer/mutant dimer.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	250	 The mutant dimeric subunit within such a heterotetramer does not exert its negative effect by totally abrogating DNA binding of the complex.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Based on results from the present study and our previous observation that the two dimers within a tetramer are conformationally independent (31), we favor the idea that the mutant dimer does not cause a conformational change in the wild type dimer.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Rather, the lack of significant contribution (positive cooperativity) from the mutant partner leads to the overall weakened DNA binding of the heterotetramer (Fig.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Because such heterotetramers bind DNA stronger than wild type dimers alone, it is likely that some cooperativity still exists and that different target sites require varying degrees of dimer-dimer cooperativity within a p53 tetramer for DNA binding.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Our model (the "incompetent partner" model) also explains why small polypeptides corresponding to the p53 oligomerization domain alone could interfere with wild type p53 function (25, 26) (because they block wild type p53 tetramerization but not dimerization) and that mutants without a functional tetramerization domain are not oncogenic (22) (because they cannot interfere with wild type p53 tetramer formation).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	255	Although the present study clearly demonstrates that essentially all the wild type/mutant heterotetramers manifest reduced DNA binding affinity compared with the wild type protein, the extent of this reduction varies greatly and depends on both the mutant and the target sequence.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Of the five mutants examined, H273 appears to exert the least dominant negative effect over the wild type protein.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	257	 For example, its presence in the heterotetramer has little or no affect on the binding of the latter to the CON or p21 sequence, whereas the other heterotetramers bind to these sequences with greatly reduced efficiency.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	258	 This could explain why, unlike other p53 mutants, ectopically expressed mutant H273 is still capable of CON-dependent transactivation (45-47).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	259	 With the other sequences, however, H273 exerts a clear dominant negative effect on the wild type protein.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	260	 But here again, this effect is not as pronounced as those manifested by the other mutants.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	261	 It is interesting that H273, being the second most common p53 mutation in human cancer, is the least dominant negative by most accounts.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Our results indicate that mutants W248 and Q248 are the most dominant negative mutants of the five, which could in turn explain why Li-Fraumeni patients with mutations at Arg-248 rarely display loss of heterozygosity (48); apparently Arg-248 mutation in one allele is sufficient to incapacitate wild type p53 from the normal allele.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	263	Another striking observation pertains to the target sequences.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	264	 For all the five mutants used, the p21 sequence that regulates cell growth arrest is by far the least sensitive to the dominant negative effects of these mutants.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	265	 In sharp contrast, sequences that regulate apoptosis such as bax, PIDD, and IGF-BP3 all manifest very low affinity for the heterotetramers.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Additionally, we found the half-lives of the p21-heterotetramer complexes to be markedly longer (by 10-30-fold) than those of bax-, PIDD-, or IGF-BP3-heterotetramers (data not shown).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	267	 This bias was also demonstrable using wild type p53 (data not shown).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Such differential binding affinity explains recent transactivation studies showing that p53 mutants were more dominant negative for induction of apoptosis than for growth arrest in human cancer cell lines (49).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	269	 It also shows why mutants are not dominant negative in vivo when assayed for p53-dependent growth arrest (50, 51).

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	5	Prompt reconstitution of hematopoiesis after cytoreductive therapy is essential for patient recovery and may have a positive impact on long-term prognosis.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We examined the role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in hematopoietic recovery in vivo after treatment with the cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We used p53 knock-out (p53/) and wild-type (p53+/+) mice injected with 5-FU as the experimental model.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Analysis of the repopulation ability and clonogenic activity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their lineage-committed descendants showed a greater number of HSCs responsible for reconstitution of lethally irradiated recipients in p53/ bone marrow cells (BMCs) recovering after 5-FU treatment than in the corresponding p53+/+ BMCs.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In post-5-FU recovering BMCs, the percentage of HSC-enriched Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ cells was about threefold higher in p53/ than in p53+/+ cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Although the percentage of the most primitive HSCs (Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD34low/) did not depend on p53, the percentage of multipotential HSCs and committed progenitors (Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD34high/+) was almost fourfold higher in post-5-FU recovering p53/ BMCs than in their p53+/+ counterparts.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The pool of HSCs from 5-FU-treated p53/ BMCs was exhausted more slowly than that from the p53+/+ population as shown in vivo using pre-spleen colony-forming unit (CFU-S) assay and in vitro using long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) and methylcellulose replating assays.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Clonogenic activity of various lineage-specific descendants was significantly higher in post-5-FU regenerating p53/ BMCs than in p53+/+ BMCs, probably because of their increased sensitivity to growth factors.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Despite all these changes and the dramatic difference in sensitivity of p53/ and p53+/+ BMCs to 5-FU-induced apoptosis, lineage commitment and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors appeared to be independent of p53 status.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These studies suggest that suppression of p53 function facilitates hematopoietic reconstitution after cytoreductive therapy by: (1) delaying the exhaustion of the most primitive HSC pool, (2) stimulating the production of multipotential HSCs, (3) increasing the sensitivity of hematopoietic cells to growth factors, and (4) decreasing the sensitivity to apoptosis.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	15	HEMATOPOIESIS IS regulated by numerous growth factors, which act in concert to regulate proliferation (including self-renewal), differentiation, and apoptosis, thus generating a relatively constant pool of functionally mature blood cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	16	 However, normal hematopoiesis can be perturbed by a variety of factors such as infection, reduced oxygen concentration, irradiation, and drugs.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Cytostatics, which are routinely used as antineoplastic drugs, are toxic to bone marrow cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In light of the importance of prompt bone marrow repopulation for patient outcome, analyses of the mechanisms regulating this process hold promise in leading to novel therapies that facilitate hematopoietic repopulation after cytostatic treatment or bone marrow transplantation.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	19	The p53 tumor suppressor gene may be one of the key genes involved in regulating hematopoietic repopulation.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Although hematopoiesis in p53 knock-out (p53/) mice appears to proceed normally,1 numerous in vitro studies indicate that p53 is involved in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of the hematopoietic cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	21	2-7 Moreover, p53 deletions and mutations have been found at high frequency in acute leukemias and in chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	22	8 The p53 phosphoprotein acts not only as a transcriptional activator of genes containing p53 binding sites,9 but also as a potent inhibitor of transcription from many genes containing TATA boxes and lacking p53-binding sites.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	23	10 p53 plays a critical role in cell proliferation by modulating the expression of genes such as WAF-1, which are required for progression through the cell cycle.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	24	11 Furthermore, p53 is involved in the induction of apoptosis after DNA damage,12 possibly by transactivating bax, a proapoptotic member of the bcl-2 family.

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	177	The regeneration of mature blood cells after cytotoxic treatment results from the proliferative activity of a small number of HSCs that have a high, but limited, capacity for self-renewal.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	178	22,23 Despite much recent progress in identifying cytokines that regulate the proliferation of HSCs and lineage-specific descendants after cytoreductive therapy, the genetic mechanism responsible for the intrinsic control of self-renewal and differentiation of these cells remains largely undefined.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Increasing evidence points to the importance of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in regulating hematopoiesis.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	180	2-7 Using marrow cells from p53 knockout and wild-type mice, we found that p53 can have a profound effect on the proliferation and exhaustion of HSCs as well as on the proliferation of lineage-specific precursors in bone marrow regenerating after 5-FU treatment.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	181	 However, p53 had no measurable effects on lineage determination and differentiation of these cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Nevertheless, this 5-FU-induced dysregulation of cell growth does not appear to lead to leukemia and is not translated into any altered output of mature blood cells or altered commitment to any specific blood cell lineage, at least during our period of observation (5 months).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Our data also suggest that other regulatory mechanisms involving p16INK4a and WAF-1 may compensate the loss of function of p53.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	184	 The changes that occur in the stem cell population during the recovery from 5-FU treatment seem likely to reflect relevant physiological processes that are important during bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy procedures.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	185	Randall and Weissman24 reported that after 5-FU treatment, the number of HSCs (Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ Thy1.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	186	1low) in p53+/+ mice begins to increase on day 2, and approximately 50% of these cells are in S/G2/M phase on day 6.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Thus, BMCs for most of our studies were collected on day 6 after 5-FU injection.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The finding that fewer p53/ BMCs regenerating after 5-FU treatment are required to rescue long-term hematopoiesis in TBI-treated recipient mice suggests that these cells contain more HSCs than their p53+/+ counterparts.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Indeed, the percentage of Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ cells, which are highly enriched with HSCs,21 was almost threefold higher in p53/ than in p53+/+ BMCs recovering after 5-FU treatment.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	190	 No differences were observed in untreated mice.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	191	 However, the pool of HSCs can be subdivided into long-term reconstituting primitive HSCs (p-HSCs), with extensive self-renewal capacity, and transiently repopulating HSCs (t-HSCs) that only self-renew in mice for 3 to 6 weeks.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	192	25 Both populations are essential, at different times, for the rescue of hematopoiesis in TBI-treated animals.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Recently, the immunophenotype of both populations have been determined15 as Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD34low/ (p-HSCs) and Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD34high/+ (t-HSCs).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	194	 We found that the percentage of p-HSCs in p53/ and p53+/+ BMC populations is similar after 5-FU administration and also in untreated mice (data not shown).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	195	 However, 5-FU was responsible for an almost fourfold increase in the percentage of t-HSCs in p53/ BMCs as compared with p53+/+ BMCs.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Thus, it seems likely that the long-term repopulating capacity of 5-FU-treated p53/ BMCs results from the increased content of t-HSCs, which are essential for hematopoietic recovery during the critical initial weeks after transplantation until the p-HSC descendants become the major source of long-term hematopoiesis.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Moreover, p53/ mice contained five to eight times more BMCs than did p53+/+ mice, so that at 6 days after 5-FU treatment the number of p-HSCs and t-HSCs were five to eight times and 20 to 32 times higher, respectively, in the p53/ mice.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Bone marrows in long-term reconstituted animals transplanted with a 1:1 mixture of p53/ and p53+/+ BMCs regenerating after 5-FU contained 90% to 99% of p53/ cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Thus, even if the percentage of p-HSCs is similar in 5-FU-treated p53/ and p53+/+ mice, the long-term repopulating activity of the former cells is much higher, possibly because of the increased production of t-HSCs.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Apparently, p53 plays an important role in BMC regeneration after 5-FU treatment by controlling not only the total number of p-HSCs in the organism, but also the production of their early descendants, t-HSCs, which represent the "functional" subpopulation responsible for the actual repopulation.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	201	Because the increased production of t-HSCs may reduce the pool of p-HSCs, we investigated the role of p53 in the exhaustion of the HSC pool after 5-FU treatment.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Unfortunately, we could not use the in vivo BMC serial retransplantation assay, because most of the mice transplanted with p53/ BMCs developed lymphomas after 5 to 6 months, consistent with previous observations.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	203	1,26 Therefore, we used an in vivo pre-CFU-S assay and in vitro LTC-IC and methylcellulose replating assays.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Although p53/ and p53+/+ BMCs after 5-FU treatment developed similar numbers of CFU-S only p53/ BMCs regenerated cells forming pre-CFU-S.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Thus, p53 expression facilitates the exhaustion of cells forming pre-CFU-S, which are believed to belong to the p-HSC pool.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	206	27 LTC-IC assay and methylcellulose replating assay confirmed the longer duration of colony-forming ability in p53/ than in p53+/+ HSCs regenerating after 5-FU.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	207	 In summary, both in vivo and in vitro assays showed that the absence of p53 in BMCs regenerating after 5-FU treatment not only increases the pool of HSCs, but also delays their exhaustion.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The increase of the total number of p-HSCs in p53/ mice after 5-FU treatment may reflect the reduced sensitivity to apoptosis and increased proliferative capacity of p53/ BMCs.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The quiescent state of most p-HSC28 may explain the absence of any difference in the percentage of these cells after 5-FU treatment.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	210	 In contrast, most t-HSCs may represent cycling cells and, because p53/ cells have a proliferative advantage, the total number as well as the percentage of those cells in BMCs regenerating after 5-FU treatment is increased in p53/ mice as compared with p53+/+ mice.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	211	 In accord with this hypothesis, p53/ BMCs recovering after 5-FU treatment displayed a much higher multilineage clonogenic activity in the presence of growth factors.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	212	 This effect appeared to rest in the proliferative advantage of p53/ cells rather than the different number of precursor cells, because immunophenotypic analysis showed no significant differences in the content of lineage-specific precursors in p53/ and p53+/+ BMCs.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	213	 It is also possible that in the absence of p53, the production of t-HSCs from p-HSCs is increased by a different unknown mechanism.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	214	Our results suggest that p53 is a key regulator of the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells responsible for long- and short-term repopulation, whereas it does not affect lineage determination and differentiation of committed progenitor/precursor cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	215	 These findings raise the possibility that the manipulation of p53 expression might delay the decline of HSCs that occurs after chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation.

0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	4	Although the mechanisms underlying tumor formation in patients with FA are incompletely understood, epidemiologic and experimental observations raise a number of possibilities.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	5	 First, the development of malignant cells from primary cells frequently requires alterations in apoptosis or cell cycle control.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Because myeloid malignancies predominantly occur in the context of progressive apoptotic depletion of hematopoietic progenitors in patients with FA9 and in Fancc-/- mice,10 it has been hypothesized that leukemogenesis results from an accumulation of mutations that precipitates the emergence of apoptotic-resistant precursors.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Second, p53 is a pivotal sensor of genotoxic and nongenotoxic stress and activates signaling pathways that result in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The apoptosis in FANCC-deficient lymphoblasts has previously been shown to be due to activation of protein kinase R (PKR).
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	9	11 Because p53 is a downstream effector of PKR,12-14 inactivation or polymorphisms of p53 or proteins in the p53 pathway may be an important target for cellular transformation in FA-associated myeloid malignancies.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Third, patients with FA are predisposed to solid tumors, including epithelial and squamous cell carcinomas, which have a high rate of p53 alteration in sporadic malignancies.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	11	15,16 The risk of these solid tumors in patients with FA goes up markedly after 20 years of age and increases to a cumulative risk of 90% by 40 years of age.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	12	2 Finally, recent studies have positioned the FA proteins in a biochemical pathway that includes BRCA1 and BRCA2.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	13	17,18 In fact, truncating, hypomorphic mutations of BRCA2 were observed in the FA-D1 complementation group.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	14	18 Further, studies using Brca1 and Brca2 conditional knockout mice support a role for p53 in tumor progression.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	15	Although epidemiologic and biochemical data suggest a role for p53 in mediating apoptosis and cancer in FA, a previous study found that a dominant-negative p53 did not affect apoptosis in FANCC-deficient, immortalized lymphoblasts exposed to genotoxic stress.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	16	22 However, the use of immortalized cell lines that may have altered p53 function23 is an inherent limitation in those studies.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Therefore, to model endogenous stresses incurred by the organism in vivo, we performed a genetic intercross of Fancc and Trp53 mutant mice to characterize how these genes interact in mediating apoptosis and tumorigenesis.

0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	168	 There are at least 3 potential mechanisms to explain the cooperation between Trp53 and Fancc.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	169	 First, abnormalities in FA functions can lead to basal and genotoxic-induced chromosome instability.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	170	 In this model p53 is activated following stress to limit cell growth or to initiate apoptosis of oncogenic cells as a mechanism of tumor avoidance.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Thus, we speculate that the modestly increased p53 protein levels observed in Fancc-deficient cells in the current report (Figure 1) following genotoxic or nongenotoxic stress could be a result of intrinsic genomic instability present in these cells, which is detected by the signaling network that activates p53.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	172	 An important priority in future studies will be to examine the role of p53 in suppressing genetic mutations in Fancc-deficient mice using a marker of genetic instability such as hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	173	A second possibility is suggested by studies linking the function of the FA protein members with the BRCA1-dependent mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2, and the identification of BRCA2 mutations in the FA-D1 complementation group.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	174	 BRCA1 was reported to physically interact with p53.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	175	45,46 Further, mammary cells from Brca1 knockout mice undergo increased apoptosis that is alleviated in the absence of Trp53 and acquire mammary cell malignancies on loss of p53 function.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	176	19 Interestingly, like Fancc-/- mice, basal p53 protein was increased in Brca1 conditional mutant mice, compared to wild-type mice.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	177	21 In contrast, whereas Fancc-/- cells have slightly increased p53 activity following DNA damage, Brca1-/- cells have reduced levels of induced p53 protein compared to wild-type controls.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Therefore, although FA proteins functionally interact with BRCA1,17 based on the current and previously published21 murine models, the specific cooperation that p53 has with Fancc and Brca1, respectively, is distinct.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Studies have also demonstrated cooperation between BRCA2 and p53.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	180	 In one study, the activity and function of p53 in Brca2-deficient cells was elevated, analogous to our studies.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	181	47 Further, loss of p53 in conditional Brca2-deficient mice is associated with a decreased latency of tumorigenesis.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	182	20 The precise biochemical relationship between p53 and Brca2 may be due to an interaction of these proteins with the homologous recombination machinery, because a physical association between Brca2 and p53 has been demonstrated in a complex that also contains Rad51.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	183	48 These studies therefore raise the interesting possibility that Fancc also may functionally interact with p53 in a DNA repair or cell cycle pathway.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	184	Lastly, Fancc may affect the p53 network by negatively regulating PKR.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Fancc was recently shown to directly interact with the Hsp70 protein, and this interaction inhibits the function of PKR in executing apoptosis.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	186	35,49 Given that p53 is activated by PKR,13,14 these studies suggest the possibility that Fancc could function in a complex that is closely associated with regulating p53 function via PKR.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	187	Although Fancc-/- mice with intact Trp53 do not develop tumors, genetic loss of both Fancc and Trp53 results in a markedly shortened latency of tumorigenesis in a Trp53 gene dose-dependent fashion.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Further, the spectrum of tumors observed in the intercrossed mice overlaps with that observed in patients with FA.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The data are consistent with the hypothesis that loss of p53 or its effectors has an important role in malignant progression in human FA tumors, particularly considering that patients with FA are highly predisposed to head and neck cancers and epithelial malignancies.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	190	3 Others have shown that inactivation of p53 occurs in the majority of these types of malignancies, usually by either mutation15 or inactivation due to papilloma virus infection.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	191	50-54 Data from this report support the rationale for a thorough evaluation of the p53 pathway in malignancies in patients with FA.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	192	In summary, the present study in mice has identified p53 as an important cofactor with Fancc in suppressing tumorigenesis.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Our findings establish that p53 is an important modulator of apoptosis in Fancc-deficient mice in vitro and is consistent with the observations that mice mutant at both loci acquire tumors at an accelerated rate in vivo.

0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	6	The transcription factor P53 is a well-known tumor suppressor protein that induces cell growth arrest, apoptosis and senescence in response to various types of stress.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In unstressed cells, P53 is maintained at low levels by the action of the ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2 which earmarks P53 for degradation in the proteasome (3).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	8	 MDM2 can also bind to the transactivation domain of P53 thus reducing its transcriptional activity (4).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	9	 DNA damage or oncogenic stress, e.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	10	 caused by mutated CTNNB1 (ss-catenin), c-MYC or RAS lead to a stabilization of the P53 protein (5 to 7) and transcriptional activation of a battery of  caretaker  genes (8).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	11	RAS-mediated signal transduction pathways are involved in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis and differentiation, which constitute fundamental processes that are deregulated in tumors carrying mutated Ras genes (9 to 11).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The most common mutations in Ras affect the GTPase activity of the small monomeric G-protein resulting in the constitutively active molecule which may, amongst others, permanently stimulate cell-cycle progression via activation of MAP kinase and other effector pathways (9).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The tumorigenic transformation of cells by Ras oncogenes can be prevented by P53-controlled mechanisms: inappropriate stimulation of cell-cycle progression leads to an E2F-mediated upregulation of the tumor suppressor protein p14/19ARF which can bind MDM2 and inactivate its ability to initiate P53 degradation (7,12 to 14).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Thus, in human cells, P53 controls oncogenic RAS and activation of RAS in tumor cells is often accompanied by ablation of P53-dependent responses.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	15	Inactivation of P53 by mutation is frequently observed in human HCCs (15 to 17) whereas RAS and its downstream effector B-RAF are only very rarely mutated in human HCCs (2,18).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Liver tumors from mice, however, are hardly ever mutated in P53 (2,19) but rather harbor activating mutations in Ha-Ras (20,21) and B-Raf (22).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This evidence could indicate that murine P53 may not control the activated RAS oncoprotein in mouse liver as opposed to its human ortholog, suggesting that the P53 protein may differ in function between mice and men.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Although P53 shows high homology between the two species both in the overall amino acid sequence (74%) and the DNA binding domain (91%), the homology is less in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions and the polyproline domains (PPDs).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Mouse P53 lacks, for example, residues that constitute important phosphorylation sites in its human ortholog, e.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	20	 serine 37 and 46, amino acids which are relevant for the modulation of P53 stress response in cells, and proline 72 with a role in apoptotic responses (23,24).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	21	The aim of our present work was to investigate whether structural differences between human and mouse P53 proteins are critical determinants during hepatocarcinogenesis.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	22	 A potent tool to address this question is the transgenic hupki (human p53 knock-in) mouse, in which parts of the murine P53 gene are replaced by the respective human sequences (exons 4 to 9) containing serine 46, proline 72, and threonines 76 and 86 (25).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The Jackson Laboratory Repository designation for the knock-in allele is Trp53tm/Holl; it will be abbreviated as P53KI in the following, as opposed to the wild-type allele (P53+).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The humanized hupki P53 seems to carry out all normal functions of the mouse P53 investigated to this point (25 to 27).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	25	 We now analyzed the frequency of liver tumors induced by a single injection of N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) in C3H mice carrying the P53KI allele homozygously or heterozygously in comparison with C3H mice with the wild-type murine P53 (P53+/+).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	26	 C3H mice were chosen because of their high susceptibility to liver tumor formation (28).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In addition, the ploidy status of hepatocytes in normal liver and Ha-Ras mutation frequencies in liver tumors of mice of the different genotypes were analyzed.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	28	Induction of liver tumors An animal study was carried out according to the German guidelines for animal care and treatment.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	29	 A single dose of N-nitrosodiethylamine (10  microg/g body wt) was injected (i.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	30	) to 15 male C3H mice of each genotype (P53KI/KI, P53KI/+ and P53+/+) at 2 weeks of age.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	31	 After weaning, the mice were housed individually in macrolon cages and kept on a standard diet without further treatment.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	32	 All mice were killed 35 weeks after carcinogen treatment and livers were removed and weighed.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Normal appearing liver tissue was excised for isolation of nuclei; larger tumors were isolated and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at  to 70 degrees C.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The remaining liver lobes were frozen on dry ice or fixed in Carnoy's solution for preparation of tissue sections.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	35	Enzyme and immunohistochemistry Sections (10  microm thick) were prepared from frozen liver tissue with a cryostat microtome and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) staining was performed according to ref.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Transections of G6Pase-altered liver lesions were quantified using a computer-assisted digitizer system as previously described (31).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	37	P53 was stained immunohistochemically in sections (5  microm thick) from paraffin-embedded liver blocks as previously described (32).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In brief, the sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and incubated with a polyclonal, panspecific rabbit anti-P53 antibody (NCL-p53-CM1; Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle, UK; 1:1500 dilution).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Following incubation with a secondary goat anti-rabbit-IgG antibody coupled with biotin (Biospa, Milano, Italy; 1:200 dilution), the sections were incubated with streptavidin alkaline phosphatase conjugates (Biospa, Milano, Italy) for 30 min.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	40	 After washing the sections in phosphate-buffered saline, the bound antibody was visualized using the alkaline phosphatase substrate FastRedTM (Kem-En-Tech, Copenhagen, Denmark).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	41	 For glutamine synthetase (GS) staining, sections were incubated with a monoclonal anti-GS antibody (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany; 1:500 dilution) after blocking the endogenous peroxidase activity.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	42	 After incubation with the HRP-coupled anti-mouse-lgG secondary antibody (Sigma to Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany; 1:20 dilution) sections were stained with aminoethylcarbazole/H2O2 solution.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	44	Isolation of nuclei from mouse liver and FACS analysis For the isolation of liver nuclei a standard protocol was used (33).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	45	 About 100 to 280 mg normal tissue of 17 mouse livers were removed and transferred immediately into cold 0.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	46	25 M sucrose, 50 mM Tris to HCl, pH 7.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	47	 All subsequent operations were performed at a temperature near 0 degrees C.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The tissue was weighed and homogenized in a potter with a motor-driven Teflon pestle (Elvehjem Tissue Grinder, clearance 0.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	49	025 cm) in two volumes of ice-cold 0.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The homogenate was filtered through four layers of gauze, the liquid fraction mixed with two volumes of 2.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The preparation was underlaid by one volume of 2.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	52	3 M sucrose in TKM and centrifuged for 30 min at 126 000 gav at 4 degrees C (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA, OptimaTM TL Ultracentrifuge with a TLA 100.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The supernatant was discarded, the nuclear pellet taken up in 1 ml TKM buffer and the nuclei concentration determined.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	54	From each sample an aliquot of 100 000 nuclei was centrifuged and the nuclei were resuspended in 15  microl PI solution [0.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	55	1% (w/v) Triton X-100; 50  microg/ml propidium iodide].
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	56	 After 5 min of incubation, the DNA content of nuclei was measured by FACS analysis (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, USA).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	57	 From each sample 10 000 events were counted; triplicate measurements were made from each animal and averaged.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Data were analyzed with CellQuest 3.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	59	Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were carried out using the software package R, version 2.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Comparisons of relative liver weight, area fraction of G6Pase-altered lesions in liver and ploidy status between the three groups (P53KI/KI, P53+/+ and P53+/KI) were performed by Kruskal to Wallis rank sum tests.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Frequencies of Ha-Ras mutations in the three groups (P53KI/KI, P53+/+ and P53+/KI) were compared by Fisher's exact test for count data.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Neoplastic response in hupki (P53KI/KI) as compared with P53-wild-type (P53+/+) and P53 heterozygous (P53+/KI) mice.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	63	  The neoplastic response in liver was determined by enzyme-histochemical staining of frozen sections for G6Pase, which is, under most circumstances, decreased in activity in hepatocellular preneoplastic foci, adenomas and carcinomas, and is frequently employed as a marker for the identification of these lesions (35).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	64	 In this study the majority of liver lesions were of a G6Pase-negative phenotype but in addition, lesions were observed which showed increases rather than decreases in G6Pase activity, often with inhomogeneous staining patterns.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The fraction of G6Pase-altered tissue in liver was quantitatively evaluated and was found to range between 60 and 70% without significant difference between groups (Table I).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Therefore, if P53 has an effect on the development of liver tumors in mice, this effect does not differ between the endogenous mouse protein and its humanized P53 ortholog.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Distribution of nuclear ploidy of hepatocytes from hupki (P53KI/KI) as compared with P53-wild-type (P53+/+) and P53 heterozygous (P53+/KI) mice.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	68	  The role of P53 in maintaining genomic integrity is well established.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Mammalian cells show a P53-dependent growth arrest when they reach tetraploidy (36), and a failure of the P53 pathway can lead to aneuploidy (37,38).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	70	 P53 may thus play a role in the control of cellular ploidy and differences may exist in this activity between the murine and the human protein.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	71	 We therefore analyzed the ploidy distribution of nuclei isolated from non-tumorous liver tissue of DEN-treated P53+/+, P53KI/+ and P53KI/KI mice.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Nuclei were isolated and their DNA content was measured by FACS analysis after staining with propidium iodide.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Diploid nuclei formed the majority (45%) closely followed by tetraploid (33%) and octaploid nuclei (7%), without significant differences between mice from the three groups (Table II).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	74	Since hepatocytes are often binuclear or polynuclear, liver sections were stained with hematoxylin and scored microscopically for binuclear cells.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	75	 About 6% of hepatocytes were found to be binuclear (without correction for stereology) without apparent differences between genotypes.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	76	We have previously screened liver tumors from mice of the present study for the presence of mutation in B-Raf (22).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	77	 In the course of that study, Ha-Ras mutations were analyzed in parallel.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Since the emphasis of the study was on B-Raf and since no significant differences in the mutation frequencies between p53 genotypes were detectable, we did not discriminate in our previous publication between genotypes.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	79	 In Table III we now present Ha-Ras codon 61 mutation patterns of liver tumors grouped by genotype of the animals.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Point mutations in Ha-Ras codon 61 were detected in 40 to 50% of tumors without significant differences in frequencies and patterns between mice of the three genotypes.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Frequencies and patterns of Ha-ras mutations in liver tumours from hupki (P53KI/KI) as compared with P53-wild-type (P53+/+) and P53 heterozygous (P53+/KI) mice.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	82	  Mutation of P53 is often associated with nuclear accumulation of the protein.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Thus, immunohistochemical P53 staining is a common and fast method to indirectly score for the presence of P53 mutations in tumor tissues.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	84	 In this study, we analyzed 42 liver sections stained for P53, 14 of each genotype (P53+/+, P53+/KI and P53KI/KI), for P53 accumulation in tumor transections.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Altogether 347 tumor transections could be identified, but only 4 of these showed a positive P53 staining.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Nuclear staining, often indicative of P53 mutation, was not observed in these lesions (Figure 1), of which two were from P53+/+ mice and the other two were from P53KI/KI mice.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	87	 P53-positive lesions stained also positive for glutamine synthetase, which is indicative for activation of ss-catenin by mutation of the gene (39,40) (Figure 1).

0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	89	 P53 and glutamine synthetase (GS) colocalize in P53-positive mouse liver lesions.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Both proteins were stained on frozen sections by immunohistochemistry.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Note the cytoplasmic localization of P53.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	92	The humanized P53 protein contains several important phosphorylation sites which are possibly regulated differentially in mice and men.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The P53 proteins share a high homology between species and, although the post-transcriptional modifications of the mouse protein are not as well understood as those of the human counterpart, there is evidence that there are a number of species-specific sequence differences especially in the replaced PPD which possibly lead to a differential post-translational regulation of P53's function.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	94	Residue 72 is an important site for apoptosis and response to chemotherapy in human cells (50,51).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	95	 In humans, it is polymorphic, encoding arginine or proline, whereby the arginine variant (the more common form in Northern European populations) correlates with an enhanced response to apoptotic stimuli.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Comparing this sequence with mice is not straightforward since it lies in one of the most divergent parts of the protein [discussed in (52)], but at the corresponding position in mouse P53 (codon 69) there is an alanine.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	97	 In the hupki protein, this part of the sequence is human with an arginine at this site, but our data indicate that this does not induce a difference with respect to control of Ras-mutated cells by P53 since the prevalence of Ha-Ras mutated tumors was very similar in mice of all three P53 genotypes.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	98	Serine 46 in human cells and in hupki cells (M.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	99	, unpublished data) is phosphorylated by a yet unidentified kinase after massive DNA damage (24).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Substitution of serine 46 blocks the expression of P53AIP1 (P53 regulated apoptosis inducing protein 1) which is an important mediator of P53-dependent apoptosis (53).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The murine protein lacks this phosphorylation site.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Serine 46 might also provide a link of P53 to cell-cycle control since, based on sequence homologies, it could be a target for cyclin-dependent and MAP kinases in human cells (24).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Constitutive activation of MAP kinase signaling in Ras-mutated cells carrying the humanized KI alleles could therefore have a lead, by feedback inhibition, to fewer Ras-mutated tumors, an effect that was not detectable in our study.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	104	Murine threonines 76 and 86 in the PPD are expected sites of phosphorylation by MAP kinases (54,55).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Increased phosphorylation was detected after stimulation of cells with TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate) (54,56).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	106	 There is no equivalent to this site in the human sequence, but again our data show that the lack of this phosphorylation site affects neither the tumor response in liver nor Ha-Ras mutation prevalence of tumors.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	107	Liver lesions of the present study stained very infrequently positive for P53 (1%).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Accumulation of P53 is a hallmark of mutation of the gene.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Nuclear P53 accumulation, however, was not observed in the positively stained lesions.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Mutation within the DNA binding domain of P53 often results in loss of the protein's ability to act as a transcription factor.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	111	 As a result Mdm2, one of its target genes, is no longer transcribed which eliminates the feedback loop that negatively controls the intracellular concentration of P53 (57).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	112	 We therefore conclude that mutation of P53 was infrequent in the mouse liver tumors, irrespective of whether the mice harbored the murine or the humanized P53 alleles.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	113	 We also found that the rare P53-positive lesions we detected were simultaneously positive for glutamine synthetase which is absent from most normal hepatocytes except those in a small ring of cells directly located around the central veins (58).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Glutamine synthetase is overexpressed in hepatoma cells with an activated version of ss-catenin and may serve as marker indicating mutation of the gene (39,40).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	115	 ss-Catenin and P53 may in fact interact: activation of ss-catenin signaling provoked by LiCl treatment of cells or by mutation of the gene leads to stabilization of P53, cell-cycle arrest, and induction of senescence in endothelial cells (59) and mouse fibroblasts (60).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	116	 We therefore suggest that the accumulation of P53 protein in glutamine synthetase-positive liver lesions of this study may be caused by the presence of an activated form of ss-catenin in cells of these lesions.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	117	The results of our present study demonstrate that hupki mice behave like P53-wild-type mice with respect to hepatocarcinogenesis induced by our DEN treatment protocol.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	118	 There was no difference in tumor response, the Ha-ras mutation prevalence of tumors was similar and there was no indication of P53 mutations in liver tumors from hupki mice, in analogy to what has been demonstrated in mice with an unmodified P53 locus (19).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	119	 These findings do not support the hypothesis that P53 harboring the human polyproline and DNA binding domains has a growth control function that is lacking in normal murine P53 of mouse hepatocytes.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	120	 We cannot exclude the possibility that the segments of murine P53 that are not replaced in the hupki model could have had an influence on the outcome of this study (Figure 2).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Another possibility is that the hupki allele may have novel properties but nevertheless behaves like the mouse protein in the genetic environment of the mouse, either because other human-specific proteins that interact with P53 are missing or mouse-specific proteins block the control function mediated by the human allele.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	122	 The reason why the mutation prevalences in Ras and in P53 in liver tumors from mice and men are so different remains to be unveiled.

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, July 1, 2003 , and in revised form, December 1, 2003.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	4	The tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)1 promotes tumor formation in a variety of mice and tissue culture models, and this has been associated with the down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) (7).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	5	 TPA is known to activate but then down-regulate the diacylglyceroldependent PKC isoforms (7, 8).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We demonstrated that the tumor-promoting activities of TPA are mediated at least in part by down-regulating PKC (9 to 12).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing PKC in their epidermis are resistant to tumor promotion by TPA (13).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Increasing evidence suggests that PKC is a player in DNA damage response pathways.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	9	 PKC is activated in the DNA damage response by both tyrosine phosphorylation and cleavage of PKC to a 40-kDa constitutively active catalytic fragment (14, 15).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Furthermore, downregulation of PKC expression by inhibitors and siRNA has been associated with attenuation of the DNA damage-induced response (14, 16).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	11	Many chemotherapeutic drugs work by inducing cell death via the p53 pathway (17).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Previous studies have suggested that TPA can inhibit the DNA damage-mediated induction of p53 (18, 19).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Moreover, other studies with protein kinase inhibitors have suggested that PKC regulates the p53 pathway (20, 21).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In this report, we have examined the effect of PKC on p53 protein and gene expression and report that PKC is required for the basal transcription of the p53 gene.

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	94	  Our data implicated that p53 was involved in the TPAmediated rescue from apoptosis.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	95	 We were interested in the kinetics of the rescue by TPA.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	96	 We examined the kinetics of the TPA-induced prevention of CPT-induced PARP cleavage in ML-1 cells, and, as shown in Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	97	 1D, prevention of CPTinduced PARP cleavage can begin to be detected between 6 and 9 h.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	98	 This kinetics is important, because TPA treatment is known to initially activate PKC , but over time depletion of cellular PKC levels occurs via the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway (9, 10).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Therefore, we went on to examine the relationship between this TPA-mediated inhibition of apoptosis and the depletion of PKC to the ability of DNA-damaging drugs to induce p53 protein accumulation.

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	105	 The ability of TPA to inhibit p53 nuclear accumulation was not due to a change in p53 shuttling, since after TPA pretreatment there was no detectable accumulation of cytoplasmic p53 (data not shown).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	106	 2B, PKC is largely depleted by 6 h of TPA treatment in the ML-1 cells.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The kinetics of PKC depletion slightly preceded the disappearance of p53 induction observed in Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	108	 2A (compare lanes 4 to 9 for A and B), consistent with the inhibition of p53 induction being due to the depletion of PKC .
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	109	 2B is the CPT-induced appearance of the 40-kDa catalytically active fragment of PKC .
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	110	 This 40-kDa fragment is associated with apoptosis, and this catalytic fragment is equally depleted by TPA pretreatment (Fig.

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	128	 2C), suggesting that the effect of TPA on p53 nuclear accumulation was able to block different DNA damage sensor pathways evoked by different drugs.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Once again, depletion of PKC correlated with the block of p53 accumulation (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	130	 This was not a cell type-specific phenomenon, since the same correlation between the inhibition of p53 accumulation and PKC depletion was observed when H460 cells were treated with MC, DMC, and zeocin (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	131	To further investigate whether the effect of TPA on p53 and p53-dependent apoptosis was in fact dependent on the ability of TPA to down-regulate PKC , we took advantage of the observation that bryostatin 1 can specifically prevent the downregulation of PKC by TPA in certain cell lines under specific conditions (9, 32).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	132	 We examined the effect of TPA upon DNA damage-induced apoptosis in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, which also has wild type p53 (28).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	133	 3A, CPT strongly induced PARP cleavage, which was completely inhibited by TPA pretreatment for 24 h.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Importantly, the effect of TPA was overcome by bryostatin 1 (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Bryostatin 1 has been shown to prevent the tumor-promoting effects of TPA in a number of cell lines (9, 32).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	136	 3B, the addition of bryostatin 1 to MCF-7 cells was able to reverse the TPA-mediated depletion of PKC .
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Additionally, the TPA-mediated inhibition of p53 accumulation was rescued in the presence of bryostatin 1.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Thus, the antiapoptotic effect of TPA in the MCF-7 cells was probably due to the down-regulation of PKC .
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	139	Rottlerin is a compound that has been widely used to inhibit PKC (14, 16, 33).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	140	 We examined the effect of rottlerin upon the DNA damage-mediated induction of p53 in ML-1 cells.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	141	 This inhibition of PKC activity resulted in the inhibition of CPTmediated apoptosis as indicated by the lack of sub-G1 DNA content observed in the florescence-activated cell sorting analysis of cells treated with CPT together with rottlerin (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Consistent with the hypothesis that PKC was required for p53 accumulation, the specific PKC inhibitor, rottlerin, blocked the accumulation of p53 in response to several DNAdamaging agents (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	143	 This inhibition of p53 accumulation by rottlerin was evident in both the cytoplasmic as well as the nuclear extract (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	144	 3, D and E), demonstrating that the inhibition of p53 accumulation does not result from a change in p53 transport.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Treatment of ML-1 cells with the conventional PKC isotype-specific inhibitor GO6976 (11) had no effect on p53 induction by DNA-damaging agents (data not shown), indicating that down-regulation of conventional PKC isoforms does not play a role in the effects observed here.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	146	 These data suggest that the ability to suppress p53 accumulation is mediated by the inhibition of PKC .
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	147	Stabilization of p53 by Proteosome Inhibitors Is Blocked by TPA Treatment and Pharmacological Inhibition of PKC  The increase in the level of p53 after DNA damage has been demonstrated to occur at the post-transcriptional level, although some regulation of p53 at the level of transcription has been observed (34 to 36).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	148	 The ubiquitin proteosome pathway is involved in the degradation of p53, and after DNA damage the p53 protein is post-translationally modified so that it is no longer targeted for degradation (37).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	149	 The levels of p53 can therefore be increased chemically by using inhibitors of the proteosome pathway (4, 38, 39).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	150	 We reasoned that if TPA pretreatment of cells was inhibiting stabilization of p53 through increased degradation of the protein, then chemical inhibition of the proteosome pathway would be able to increase p53 levels even after the cells were pretreated with TPA.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	151	 However, surprisingly, we observed that TPA pretreatment of ML-1 cells completely inhibited the ability of the proteosome inhibitor LLnL to stabilize p53 (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Similarly, rottlerin was also able to prevent p53 accumulation induced by proteosome inhibition (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	153	 4B), implicating a requirement of PKC for synthesis of p53.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Therefore, the inhibitory effect of TPA and PKC inhibition on p53 protein accumulation was apparently not due to enhanced p53 degradation by a proteosome-mediated proteolysis pathway.

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	162	  Basal Transcription of p53 Is Blocked by TPA Treatment and Inhibition of PKC  In light of the proteosome inhibition data, it became clear that the ability of TPA to suppress p53 accumulation was not due to destabilization of the protein as is usually the case for down-regulation of p53 (37).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	163	 We therefore investigated whether TPA was down-regulating p53 transcription.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	164	 ML-1 cells were treated with TPA for increasing times, and RNA was extracted.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Northern blot analysis using a p53 probe was then carried out.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	166	 A clear reduction in the basal level of p53 transcript was evident with increasing time of TPA pretreatment, beginning after 8 h (Fig.

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Importantly, the inhibitory effect of TPA on p53 was maintained in cells treated with the various DNA-damaging agents (data not shown).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Slightly greater than 50% inhibition of p53 mRNA levels was observed after 8 h of TPA treatment.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Down-regulation of PKC expression by siRNA has been associated with attenuation of the DNA damage-induced response (14, 16).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	171	 We used siPKC as an additional means to confirm the requirement of PKC for the basal transcription of p53 (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	172	 With the siRNA to PKC , we were able to inhibit the level of PKC protein by 38% as determined from the densitometry scanning of Western blot analysis, and the basal p53 message (monitored by quantitative TaqMan RT-PCR) was inhibited by 35%.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Significantly, in addition to TPA, the PKC inhibitor also blocked p53 transcription (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Whereas the proteosome inhibitor LLnL did not affect the level of p53 mRNA, the reduction of p53 mRNA was evident in the presence of LLnL and the PKC inhibitor (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Inhibition of p53 mRNA by rottlerin was also associated with inhibition of transcription of p53 downstream target genes p21 and hdm2 activated in the presence of LLnL treatment (Fig.

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	218	In agreement with previously proposed models, our results support the idea that PKC is involved in a tumor suppressor pathway that involves p53 (19).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Recently a role for PKC in the accumulation of p53 and the induction of apoptosis in bovine endothelial cells has been shown (41).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Additionally, it has been shown previously that the tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 4--phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate transiently down-modulated p53 mRNA levels (42).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Using siRNA to inactivate PKC , we have demonstrated a direct requirement for PKC in controlling basal human p53 transcription.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	222	 In addition to demonstrating that TPA treatment does not decrease p53 message stability, we used a dominant negative PKC in co-transfection studies to extend the analysis of PKC inhibition.

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Our results show that the initiation of transcription from the p53 promoter can be blocked by the inhibition of PKC .
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Whereas our studies do not rule out an additional effect of TPA and PKC down-regulation upon p53 protein stability, they do reveal a novel mechanism for suppressing p53 expression that probably contributes to tumor promotion by phorbol esters.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	226	 In fact, our preliminary data show that TPA can increase the level of Mdm2 protein while the mdm2 mRNA remains constant.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	227	2 This suggests that an additional mechanism is also present to efficiently eliminate any existing p53.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	228	Our results raise several important questions regarding how tumor promoters might regulate the initiation of p53 transcription and suggest a model in which DNA damage in the presence of such tumor promoters could result in malignant transformation (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Repression of the p53 promoter has been suggested as a mechanism for tumor promotion (34, 43).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Damaged genes in tumor cells are usually thought to be the mechanistic drivers toward oncogenesis.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	231	 However, down-regulation of endogenous genes, specifically tumor suppressors, may also be a key regulatory mechanism resulting in tumor promotion.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Our data provide a transcriptional repression mechanism for tumor promotion by TPA and predict that agents that interfere with the activity of PKC may inhibit p53 responses.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	233	 We have begun to compare the DNA binding activity of transcription factors known to bind to the p53 promoter in extracts from cells before and after the inactivation of PKC .
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Presently, we have not found the DNA binding activity of any transcription factor inhibited and have confirmed the previous finding that NF-B is activated by TPA treatment in most (but not all) of the cell lines tested.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	235	3 Continued promoter studies are in progress to search for either a repressor or activator involved in p53 transcription that may be regulated by PKC .
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	236	 One possibility is the Ets-2 protein, because there is a binding site for this protein in the p53 promoter, and PKC regulates the level of Ets-2 protein (44).

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	240	 B, DNA damage, in the presence of inhibition of PKC , is unable to activate the p53 stabilization, because p53 mRNA is reduced, resulting in no p53 protein, and therefore genomic instability and malignant transformation are the result.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	241	Since activating the p53 apoptotic pathway is a checkpoint used by cells to avoid mutations from damaged DNA and is the target of many chemotherapeutic regimes, it is possible that agents with PKC -activating properties may provide synergistic cytotoxic activity.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Conversely, agents that have PKC -inactivating potential may drastically reduce chemotherapeutic drug efficacy.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	243	 In this regard, it is of interest that bryostatin 1, which is in clinical trials for several cancers (45), modulates the activity of PKC isoforms.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	244	 It may be that the antineoplastic properties of bryostatin 1 are due to effects upon PKC .
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Our findings demonstrate that focusing on the transcriptional regulation of p53 presents a novel targeted approach in the war against cancer and highlights the possibility that agents in the environment may adversely affect the p53 pathway by inhibiting the transcription of tumor suppressor genes.

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, December 27, 2001, and in revised form, February 15, 2002.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	4	Recent studies have implicated several proteins required for DNA damage recognition and repair in telomere maintenance.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The mammalian protein Ku, which binds double strand (ds)1 ends and is central to ds break repair has been shown to bind telomeric DNA directly (1, 2) and to associate with the two duplex telomere repeat binding factors TRF1 and TRF2 (3, 4).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Further, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the yeast homolog yKu is required for proper telomere function (5).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	7	 (6) revealed that the tumor suppressor protein p53 is involved in the maintenance of telomeric tract length in mice.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	8	 They observed that although the level of telomere-associated fluorescence in p53/ mouse embryo fibroblasts was equivalent to that of wild type cells, there was an increased heterogeneity of telomere lengths with some telomeres being longer than those seen in wild type cells whereas others were very short or lost entirely.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These shortened telomeres resulted in a high frequency of telomere-telomere fusions.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	10	The telomere-specific protein TRF2 plays a central role in concealing telomere ends from ds break recognition and repair factors (7, 8).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Expression of a dominant-negative allele of TRF2 in cultured human cells triggers changes typical of those induced by ds breaks: loss of the 3' single strand (ss) overhang, induction of end-to-end chromosome fusions (8), and induction of apoptosis through the p53/ATM-dependent DNA damage checkpoint pathway (7).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The induction of p53 is not dependent on DNA replication, suggesting that inhibition of TRF2 function at the telomeres signals p53 directly.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	13	Our recent studies of telomere architecture provide a possible structural solution to how telomere ends are hidden from DNA break repair/recognition factors.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These studies showed that mammalian telomeres are arranged into large duplex loops in vivo (t-loops) (9).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The formation of t-loops in vitro requires TRF2 and a telomeric junction, which consists of a 3' ss overhang of at least one TTAGGG repeat adjacent to the ds portion of the telomere (10).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The termini of the micronuclear chromosomes of Oxytricha nova (11), the telomeres of Trypanosoma brucei minichromosomes (12), and the telomeres of Pisum sativum2 have been shown to form looped structures in vivo whereas S.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	17	 cerevisiae telomeres appear to form fold-back structures (13-15).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	18	 It is plausible that telomeric looping is a common mechanism for protecting the termini of linear chromosomes.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	19	It has been proposed that the t-loop structure is formed by strand invasion of the G-rich ss overhang into the preceding duplex TTAGGG tract (9, 10).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This invasion would generate a D-loop, which would effectively hide the natural end of the DNA to protect it from the machinery that scans DNA for broken ends.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In addition, recent data support the possibility that some portion of the C-rich strand of the ss/ds telomeric junction may also invade the duplex, resulting in the formation of a Holliday junction-like structure at the base of the t-loop (Fig.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	22	 p53 tightly binds Holliday junctions in vitro and enhances their resolution by junction-cleaving enzymes (16).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Further, p53 has a strong affinity for ss DNA (17) and would presumably bind the ss telomeric overhang of the telomere.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The affinity of p53 for these structures points to the importance of investigating p53 binding to both the telomeric overhang and the t-loop junction as well as examining the influence of p53 on t-loop assembly by TRF2 in vitro.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	25	DNA Substrates and Proteins-- The model telomere contains 3 kb of plasmid sequences followed by 576 bp of duplex telomeric DNA, which terminates in a 54-nt telomeric overhang (5'-(TTAGGG)9-3') (10).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The overhang was removed by treatment with mung bean nuclease to create a telomeric tract that terminates in a blunt end (10).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Linear DNA substrates containing the 576-bp tract located internally were generated by cleavage of pRST5 plasmid with AflIII (New England Biolabs Inc.

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Beverly Emerson, and the protein was purified as described previously (22).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	39	Binding of p53 to Telomeric DNA-- To examine the binding of p53 to telomeric DNA, 25 ng of DNA was incubated with purified p53 at a ratio of 2-8 tetramers of p53 per DNA molecule in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	40	5) and 50 mM KCl for 20 min at room temperature.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The complexes were fixed by adding glutaraldehyde to a final concentration of 0.

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	44	Generation of t-Loops and Electron Microscopy-- t-Loops were formed on the model DNA by TRF2 as previously described (10).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Protein-free t-loops were generated by cross-linking the DNA with 4'-aminomethyltrioxsalen (AMT; Sigma) and UV light followed by treatment with 0.

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The DNA was purified by chromatography over a 2-ml column of Bio-Gel A-5m equilibrated with 10 mM Tris (pH 7.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The absence of any residual TRF2 was verified by EM.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	49	All samples were examined in a Philips EM400 or CM12 instrument.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Micrographs were scanned from negatives using a Nikon 4500AF multiformat film scanner.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The contrast was optimized and panels were arranged using Adobe Photoshop.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The location of p53 binding to the DNA molecules was measured using a Phillips CM-12 and Digital Micrograph software (Gatan Inc.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	53	Effect of p53 and Single Strand and Holliday Junction-binding Proteins on t-Loop Formation-- DNA (100 ng) was incubated with TRF2 (3 dimers per TTAGGG repeat) and either p53 (2-8 tetramers per DNA), E.

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The complexes were then cross-linked with AMT/UV, deproteinized, and purified as previously described (9, 10).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	56	p53 Binds to t-Loop Junction with High Affinity-- Recent data support a model of the t-loop junction in which both strands can insert to form a Holliday junction-like structure (Fig.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	57	 It was of interest to examine the ability of p53 to bind t-loop structures.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	58	 t-Loops were generated by incubation of the model telomere with TRF2, stabilization by AMT/UV photocross-linking, and protein removal (see "Experimental Procedures") (9).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	59	 p53 was incubated with the purified DNA, and the resulting complexes were examined by EM.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The purified DNA contained both looped (10  plus or minus  3%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) and unlooped (90  plus or minus  3%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) molecules.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Overall, 59% ( plus or minus 21%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) of the input DNA was bound by p53.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The p53 binding occurred at one end of the DNA, internally along the duplex repeats, or at the t-loop junction.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The p53 bound to the non-looped species showed a strong preference for the DNA ends (Fig.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Of the t-loops observed, 88% ( plus or minus 11%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) showed p53 bound exclusively at the t-loop junction (the junction of the loop and the linear tail) (Fig.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The mass of the p53 complex at the t-loop junction appeared consistent with the presence of one or two tetramers with a small portion of the molecules containing larger complexes.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Similarly, when TRF2 was incubated with the deproteinized, cross-linked DNA, binding was observed exclusively at the t-loop junction (100  plus or minus   < 1%, n = 100/sample, three experiments).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	67	 TRF1, however, rarely bound the junction, binding instead along the telomeric tract (data not shown).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	68	 These results demonstrate that p53 has a high affinity for the t-loop junction.

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	79	p53 Does Not Bind Telomeric DNA in a Sequence-dependent Manner-- Based on the observation that p53 binds to the t-loop junction, it was of interest to determine whether the association of p53 with the loop is sequence-specific.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	80	 It has been shown that p53 is capable of associating with DNA in both a sequence-dependent (reviewed in Refs.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	81	 23-25) and sequence-independent manner (26-27).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and EM were used to examine the affinity of p53 for duplex TTAGGG repeat tracts as well as for a model telomere containing a duplex tract adjacent to a ss 3' overhang containing TTAGGG repeats.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with p53 and a 200-bp DNA fragment consisting of tandem TTAGGG repeats.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Even with an input ratio of 30 tetramers per DNA molecule, p53 showed very low binding, and this was easily competed with nonspecific DNA (data not shown).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	85	The association of p53 with telomeric repeats was examined by EM.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	86	 p53 was incubated with a 96-repeat TTAGGG tract located in the center of a 3-kb DNA molecule.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	87	 At a ratio of 20 p53 tetramers per DNA molecule, 60% of the input template was bound by p53 with no molecule containing more than one p53 particle.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The location of p53 molecules along the DNA was measured from the micrographs, and the results revealed that of the bound DNA, 12% had p53 located within the telomeric tract, and the remaining 88% contained p53 randomly distributed along the length of the DNA (n = 200).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	89	 From these observations we conclude that p53 does not bind the TTAGGG repeat tract in a sequence-dependent manner.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	90	The binding of p53 to the natural telomeric overhang was examined by EM using a model telomere containing a terminal 576-bp duplex tract and an adjacent 54-nt 3' ss TTAGGG overhang (Fig.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	91	 1B; see "Experimental Procedures") (10).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Because p53 has been shown to bind ss DNA with high affinity, the non-telomeric end of the DNA terminated in a blunt end.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Conditions were optimized so that each DNA showed no more than one p53 particle bound (20 tetramers per DNA) (see "Experimental Procedures").
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Of the bound molecules, 68  plus or minus  9% (n = 100/sample, three experiments) contained p53 localized to the end of the DNA whereas the remainder (32  plus or minus  9% of the bound molecules, n = 100/sample, three experiments) showed p53 scattered at random along the length of the DNA (Fig.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Removal of the 3' overhang decreased the fraction of end-bound p53 to 6%, demonstrating that the end localization of p53 is most likely because of its association with the ss overhang.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Based on these data, we conclude that p53 binds to the ss telomeric overhang with strong affinity.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	97	TRF2-mediated t-Loop Formation Is Enhanced by p53-- It was of interest to examine the effect of p53 on the ability of TRF2 to form t-loops in vitro.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	98	 It is possible that p53 binding to the ss DNA overhang would inhibit loop formation by preventing TRF2 from localizing to the ss/ds junction, a critical step in t-loop assembly (10).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Alternately, binding to the ss overhang might enhance t-loop formation by facilitating the strand invasion event.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Studies from others have suggested that p53 has some strand transfer activity (28), which might either assist in TRF2-mediated loop formation or catalyze loop formation in the absence of TRF2.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Finally, p53 may stabilize loops once they are formed by binding to the t-loop junction either at the Holliday junction-like structure or the displaced ss portion of the D-loop.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	102	 To investigate these possibilities, p53 and TRF2 were incubated together with the model telomere DNA.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The number of t-loops assembled was monitored by EM.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	104	First, the possible interaction between p53 and TRF2 in the absence of DNA was examined.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	105	 To our knowledge, no evidence of such an association has been reported.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	106	 When p53 and TRF2 were coexpressed in SF9 cells and immunoprecipitated using standard techniques, no association was detected.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Similarly, when purified TRF2 was incubated with purified p53, the proteins failed to coimmunoprecipitate (data not shown).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	108	When TRF2 and p53 were incubated together with the model telomere DNA, smaller loops could have been obscured because of the presence of a large protein mass at the junction.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Thus, an alternative approach for scoring looped molecules was utilized.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Following assembly of the complexes, the DNA molecules were photocross-linked, deproteinized, and prepared for EM examination using a classic surface-spreading method with cytochrome c (see "Experimental Procedures").
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Looped structures were rarely seen on the DNA in the absence of TRF2 (3  plus or minus  1%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) or when treated with p53 alone (4  plus or minus  1%, n = 100/sample, three experiments).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	112	 When the incubations contained TRF2 and no p53, 13% ( plus or minus 3%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) of the input DNA was assembled into t-loops.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	113	 This number is slightly reduced from the number of t-loops usually observed (10), most likely because of the use of a buffer optimized for the binding of both proteins.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	114	 When both p53 and TRF2 were added to the reaction (four p53 tetramers per DNA and three TRF2 dimers per TTAGGG repeat) the number of t-loops rose significantly (24  plus or minus  3%, n = 100/sample, three experiments; p = 0.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Reduction of the level of p53 (two p53 tetramers per DNA) eliminated this increase in t-loop assembly (14  plus or minus   < 1%, n = 100/sample, two experiments).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	116	 No further rise in efficiency was detected with either increased levels of p53 (six or eight p53 tetramers per DNA; 23  plus or minus  1%, n = 100/sample, two experiments) or time of incubation (data not shown).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	117	One possible explanation for the increase in the number of t-loops observed in the presence of TRF2 and p53 is that the t-loops may be stabilized by p53.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	118	 In vitro, t-loops may form and dissociate throughout the incubation.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	119	 The association of p53 with the displaced ss or the Holliday junction-like portion of the t-loop junction might stabilize the looped form, thus increasing the fraction of loops present at any one time.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	120	 In this case, any ss or Holliday junction binding protein would be expected to produce the same effect.

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	122	 No increase in the number of t-loops was observed with the addition of SSB (14  plus or minus  1%, n = 100/sample, three experiments), T4 gene 32 protein (14  plus or minus  4%; n = 100/sample, three experiments), or human RPA (14  plus or minus  2%; n = 100/sample, three experiments) to the reaction.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Similarly two Holliday junction-binding proteins, human MSH2/6 and HMG(I)Y, were separately incubated with the model DNA and TRF2, the DNA prepared for EM.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Neither MSH2/6 nor HMG(I)Y showed any ability to enhance TRF2-mediated t-loop assembly in vitro (13  plus or minus  2 and 15  plus or minus  1%, respectively; n = 100/sample, three experiments).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	125	 These results suggest a more specific role for p53 in t-loop formation/stabilization.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	126	p53 may increase the numbers of t-loops by facilitating loop formation by TRF2.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Once bound to the overhang, p53 might assist in the strand invasion process.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Alternately, p53 might stabilize the assembled t-loops by binding directly to the t-loop junction (as contrasted to the displaced ss).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	129	 If binding to the overhang is responsible for the increase in t-loops, preincubation with p53 might be expected to further increase the numbers of t-loops formed as compared with preincubation with TRF2.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	130	 If, instead, p53 stabilizes the t-loop junction, preincubation with p53 would not be expected to further enhance t-loop formation.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	131	 To test these possibilities, p53 or TRF2 were first incubated individually with the model telomere DNA for 5 min followed by addition of the second protein for 15 min.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	132	 TRF2 assembled 13% ( plus or minus  < 1%, n = 100/sample, two experiments) of the DNA into t-loops in the absence of p53.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	133	 When the DNA was preincubated with p53 followed by addition of TRF2, the number of t-loops rose to 20% ( plus or minus 7%, n = 100/sample, two experiments).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Similarly, 19% ( plus or minus 2%, n = 100/sample, two experiments) of the DNA molecules were looped when preincubated with TRF2 followed by addition of p53.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Thus the order of addition of p53 and TRF2 with the model telomere DNA does not affect the ability of p53 to enhance loop frequency.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Together, these data suggest that the p53-dependent increase in t-loop observed by EM is not due simply to binding of p53 to the ss overhang but instead may involve a more direct role of p53 on loop formation or stabilization.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	137	TRF2 Does Not Exclude p53 from Binding the t-Loop Junction-- The larger mass of protein present at the base of the t-loop when both p53 and TRF2 were present in the reaction suggests that the proteins are capable of binding to the junction simultaneously.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	138	 This possibility was examined using immunoelectron microscopy.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	139	 TRF2 and p53 were incubated with the model telomere DNA.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	140	 p53 was then detected by addition of an anti-p53 polyclonal rabbit IgG followed by incubation with 10-nm gold particles conjugated to protein A.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	141	 There was no cross-reactivity of the antibody with TRF2 as seen by EM and Western blot; hence all labeled molecules must contain p53 (data not shown).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Because p53 is unable to assemble t-loops in the absence of TRF2 and we have previously shown that TRF2 binds all t-loop junctions, the looped molecules must also contain TRF2 (10).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	143	 All t-loop junctions that are labeled with gold particles, therefore, are presumed to contain both p53 and TRF2.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	144	By this approach, 100 individual molecules were placed into five classes: protein-free DNA (38%), DNA with a single protein complex bound at the end (23%), DNA with a single protein complex bound along the DNA not at the end (7%), DNA with protein bound at the base of a t-loop (14%), and DNA aggregates held together by a large protein mass (17%).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Each class was further divided into molecules that were gold-labeled (20%) and molecules that remained unlabeled (80%).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In these studies, gold particles were only observed on end-bound molecules, t-loops, and aggregates.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Of the t-loops detected, 86% were labeled with gold particles at the t-loop junction, demonstrating the association of both TRF2 and p53 (Fig.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	148	 In addition, 43% of the end-bound molecules were tagged with gold labels (Fig.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	149	 The labeled end bound complexes may contain both proteins or only p53.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	150	 These results provide direct evidence for the presence of p53 at TRF2-bound t-loop junctions.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The location of p53 binding within the junction, either to the displaced strand or the Holliday junction-like structure, could not be resolved using these methods.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	152	In this study we have used purified TRF2, p53, and a model telomere DNA to examine the binding of p53 to telomeric structures including the duplex repeats, the ss overhang, and a t-loop junction.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	153	 No evidence for preferential binding of p53 to duplex telomeric DNA was observed.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	154	 p53 does bind strongly to the ss overhang, as expected based on previous studies showing that p53 has a high affinity for ss DNA (17).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	155	 p53 also associates with the t-loop junction with high affinity and was found to cooperate with TRF2 in formation of t-loops on the model telomere template.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	156	 This produced a 2-fold increase in the frequency of t-loops as monitored by EM.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	157	 p53 was detected at the t-loop junction in the presence of TRF2 binding, suggesting that both proteins are present in a complex at the t-loop junction.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	158	It remains possible that the enhancement of TRF2-mediated t-loop formation by p53 results from its interactions with the overhang or junction.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Interactions of p53 with the junction may add stability and prevent t-loop loss in vitro.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	160	 t-Loops could be lost because of migration of the junction along the duplex repeat tract or dissociation of TRF2.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Association with the ss overhang may facilitate localization of TRF2 to the ss/ds overhang, which would result in an increase in loop assembly.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	4	Apoptosis is a multistage, genetically controlled process of selective cell deletion.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Protein kinases regulate the early stages of apoptosis by phosphorylating key proteins (12, 13), whereas caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, are the main effectors whose activation results in the characteristic morphological changes associated with programmed cell death such as membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation (14, 15).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	6	Members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family are activated by diverse stimuli and participate in multiple cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (16).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The novel PKC isoform, protein kinase C delta (PKC), has been shown to be associated with the response to DNA damage and other apoptotic stimuli in specific cell types (17 to 20).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The critical role of PKC in vascular SMC apoptosis and pathogenesis of a neointimal lesion has been recently demonstrated using PKC "knock-out" mice.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The PKC null mice developed exacerbated vein graft intimal lesions that contain fewer apoptotic vascular cells compared with the wild-type mice (21).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Furthermore, aortic SMCs isolated from PKC null mice are resistant to apoptotic stimuli including H2O2.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	11	 However, the mechanism by which PKC mediates SMC apoptosis remains to be defined.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	12	The tumor suppressor p53 is the master regulator of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In particular, an important role of p53 in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases is suggested by decreased p53 levels in human restenotic (22) and atherosclerotic lesions (23).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The importance of p53 is also confirmed in various animal models.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of p53 to rat carotid arteries inhibited neointimal formation following balloon injury (24), whereas target deletion of p53 led to larger intimal lesions in a mouse vein graft model (25).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	16	The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 has been shown to be activated by cellular stress, UV light radiation, growth factor withdrawal, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (26 to 29).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Upon activation, p38 phosphorylates various transcription factors but, of particular note, has been demonstrated to phosphorylate the tumor suppressor p53 (30).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	18	 p38 MAPK is also implicated in both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways (12, 31) However, its activity is likely cell type-specific, with most studies focusing predominantly on inflammatory cells (32).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	19	In this report we scrutinized the precise molecular mechanism of PKC-induced vascular SMC apoptosis and provide evidence that PKC activation leads to accumulation/modification of p53, which is essential for the induction of apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Moreover, the role of p38 as an intermediate in PKC-induced p53 accumulation and apoptosis has also been demonstrated.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In total, these studies provide an explicit link between PKC, p38 activation, and p53 modulation in the process of SMC apoptosis.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Briefly, plasmid DNA was introduced into A10 SMCs by using SuperFect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	45	 200  microM oligo was introduced to the media of cultured A10 SMCs, seeded 18 h earlier at equal density.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The efficacy of oligo uptake by SMCs was  > 90%, determined by using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled oligo provided by the manufacturer.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Briefly, SMCs were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Total protein concentration was determined by a modification of the method of Lowry, and the protein amount of each sample was then equalized.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Following primary antibody incubation and centrifugation, pellets were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer and one time with 50 mM Tris.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The final pellet was re-suspended in 30  microl of sample buffer and heated to 95  degrees C for 3 min.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	58	Overexpression of PKC Induces Apoptosis and Accumulation of the Tumor Suppressor p53 We next evaluated whether overexpression of PKC would be sufficient to induce vascular SMC apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	59	 To this end, we employed an adenovirus encoding full-length wild-type PKC (AdPKC), which led to a marked increase in cellular levels of PKC (Fig.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Additionally, AdPKC induced a small but significant elevation in the level of fragmented DNA and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	61	 To facilitate the activation of the ectopically expressed PKC, we treated A10 SMCs with 1 to 5  microM of PMA for 12 h.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	62	 At these concentrations, PMA alone did not induce apoptosis as indicated by the lack of fragmented DNA as well as the absence of activated caspase-3.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	63	 However, the PKC activator PMA, in combination with overexpression of PKC, resulted in an increase in DNA fragmentation by  > 3-fold (Fig.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	65	 These data establish that overexpression of PKC is sufficient to induce SMC apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Because p53 has been implicated in SMC apoptosis, we investigated whether the overexpression of PKC and its dramatic increase in SMC apoptosis were associated with an induction of p53.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	67	 2B, overexpression of PKC in A10 SMCs significantly increased p53 levels.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In parallel to the induction of apoptosis, the ability of AdPKC to induce p53 expression was further enhanced by PMA (Fig.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Next, we tested whether the PKC-induced p53 accumulation leads to enhanced p53-dependent gene transcription by using a luciferase reporter gene containing a p53-specific enhancer element (40, 41).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Co-transfection of a PKC expression vector significantly increased p53 reporter activity.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	71	 More importantly, the addition of the PKC activator PMA facilitated the effect of PKC on the p53 reporter, which is consistent with the ability of PKC to induce p53 expression and SMC apoptosis (Fig.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	218	 We have now demonstrated that in vascular SMCs the overexpression of PKC increased the accumulation of both the p53 protein and mRNA.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	219	 (55) found that the PKC inhibitor rottlerin increases p53 levels in cisplatin-treated HeLa cells, whereas the PKC activator phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate attenuates p53 levels in the same cell line.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Therefore, it is likely that PKC, paralleling its dual functions in apoptosis, plays multiple roles in regulating p53 expression, which is dependent upon the cell type and stimuli employed.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	221	Our findings that PMA alone did not induce apoptosis in control or AdNull-infected SMCs is seemingly surprising, because these cells express endogenous PKC, and PMA activates PKC.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The lack of cell death associated with PMA treatment may be related to the effect of PMA on other PKC isotypes.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	223	 We have shown previously that SMCs express at least eight isotypes of PKC, among which six can be activated by PMA (56).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Some of these PMA-sensitive PKC isoforms, such as PKC, are pro-apoptotic, whereas others, such as PKC, have been demonstrated to be anti-apoptotic in non-SMCs (57 to 59).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Our data show that overexpressing PKC shifts the PMA response in favor of apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	226	 However, the outcome of simultaneously activating multiple PKC isotypes, as may occur in control SMCs treated with PMA, appears to result in no net effect on cell death.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	227	The present study highlights another interesting finding that PKC stimulates p53 gene expression through p38 MAPK.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	228	 We showed that inhibition of p38 completely eliminated PKC-stimulated accumulation of p53 protein and mRNA.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Moreover, analyses using a p53 promoter reporter demonstrated that PKC up-regulated p53 promoter activity, also in a p38-dependent manner.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Several transcription factors have been identified to bind and regulate the murine p53 promoter, including NFB (60).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	231	 (61) showed in articular chondrocytes that NO-induced activation of p38 up-regulates p53 expression through NFB.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Moreover, the NFB pathway has been shown to be activated by PKC in several cell types (62 to 64).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Future studies are mandatory to directly test the role of NFBinPKC-induced p38-dependent transcriptional regulation of p53.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	234	In summary, our results demonstrate that PKC plays a pivotal role in the signal transduction pathway leading to vascular SMC apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The p38-dependent-accumulation and independent-phosphorylation of p53 by PKC contributes, at least in part, to SMC apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Given the critical role of apoptosis in intimal hyperplasia, it is possible that enhancement of PKC activity at different stages after vascular intervention may provide a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of restenosis.

0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	5	 p53 activity is tightly controlled at negligible levels in normal cells.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	6	 p53 protein is rapidly induced by DNA damage stimuli such as ionizing irradiation (13), UV light (14) and ribonucleotide depletion (15).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The induction of p53 is achieved through a post-translational mechanism that reduces p53 turnover.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Induced p53 functions as a transcription factor for downstream genes that function in pathways of cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and DNA repair.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Transactivation of the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) p21 is one of the better understood mechanisms of p53 in response to DNA damage (16).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In addition to cdk inhibition, p21 binds to proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The binding preferentially inhibits the processivity of DNA polymerase in DNA replication but not in DNA repair, which may contribute to coordinating growth arrest and DNA repair in the S phase (17).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	12	So far, more than 20 p53 downstream genes have been identified (18).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	13	 They are involved in diverse cellular activities, such as p21 in G1 growth arrest, 14-3-3 in a G2/M checkpoint, BAX and p53-induced genes (PIGs) in apoptosis, and GADD45 and XPE in DNA repair.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The common feature of these downstream genes is that they contain one or more p53 consensus binding sites in their regulatory regions.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The p53 consensus binding site contains two or more copies of a 10 bp half-site 5'-PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GpyPyPy-3' (19).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	16	 p53 protein binds to the complete consensus site as a tetramer.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Crystallographic analysis of p53 protein binding to its consensus DNA revealed that four evolutionarily conserved regions within the DNA binding domain directly contact the major and minor grooves of the p53 consensus DNA (20).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The residues that are most frequently mutated in human cancers make critical contributions to DNA binding by directly contacting DNA or fostering conformation to support DNA binding.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	19	 That  > 90% of p53 mutations are located within the sequence-specific DNA binding domain (5) indicates the importance of p53 DNA binding in response to DNA damage.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Therefore, it is important to understand how p53 binding to DNA is regulated.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	21	 p53 protein post-translational modifications and effects   p53-associated factors Although the DNA binding domain of p53 binds well to specific DNA (30), the binding is highly subject to regulation by other regions of p53 protein.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	22	 It has been hypothesized that p53 DNA binding is subject to allosteric regulation by C-terminal domains that lock p53 tetramers in a latent state for DNA binding (31).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Such inhibition can be overcome by C-terminal modifications other than phosphorylation, such as proteolytic truncation, alternative splicing and association with other cellular factors (32).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The potential for p53 regulation by p53-associated factors has been long implicated from in vitro DNA binding activation by PAb421, which recognizes C-terminal amino acids 372 to 381.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	25	 A number of cellular and viral proteins have been identified as p53-associated factors.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	26	 While the biological relevance of these associations remains to be verified, several cellular factors have been shown to bind to the C-terminal region of p53 and activate DNA binding activity.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	27	 14-3-3 is a p53 downstream gene that mediates G2 arrest by sequestering phosphorylated cdc25C (33).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Upon dephosphorylation of S376, 14-3-3 binds to p53 and enhances its DNA binding activity, thus forming a positive feedback loop for p53 (26).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	29	 c-Abl is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by DNA damage and mediates phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK (34,35).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Both JNK and p38 MAPK are kinases that phosphorylate p53 in a DNA damage-dependent manner.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	31	 reported that c-Abl is capable of binding to p53 and stabilizing its DNA binding (36).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	32	 While activation of p53 DNA binding by c-Abl is independent of its kinase activity, the direct activation of p53 DNA binding may synergize with the c-Abl kinase cascade-mediated p53 activation and amplify the response to DNA damage.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Although the N-terminal domain of p53 is frequently targeted for transcriptional repression by cellular and viral oncogenes (12,37,38), there is evidence that the N-terminal association may participate in regulation of p53 DNA binding in other ways.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Replication protein A (RPA) is a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein that binds to the N-terminus of p53.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	35	 An in vitro study by Miller et al.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	36	 showed that association with RPA blocks p53 binding to specific DNA (39).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The association between RPA and p53 can be disrupted with ssDNA or DNA repair-dependent phosphorylation of RPA (40).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	38	 While C-terminal associations are generally linked with enhanced DNA binding, the outcomes of the N-terminal interactions are less consistent.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	39	 found that Mdm2 protein association abolishes p53 binding to specific DNA in cell lysates as determined by means of the McKay assay (41).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	40	 However, the complex of p53 to DNA to Mdm2 was detected with purified recombinant proteins by EMSA (42).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Nevertheless, the authenticity and biological relevance of these associations need to be evaluated in the context of the general transcription machinery.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	42	 p53 is associated with several general transcription factors including TFIID, TFIIH and p300/CBP (43 to 45).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	43	 These transcription factors form multiprotein complexes that span the N- and C-terminal domains of the p53 protein.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	44	 For example, the p62 polypeptide component of TFIIH binds to the p53 N-terminus, whereas XPD and XPB of TFIIH bind the C-terminus.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	45	 It has been found that p53 DNA binding is stabilized by the association with TFIID and p300/CBP.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The association between p53 and these general transcription factors may more closely reflect the nature of p53 regulation in the chromatin context.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	47	Chromatin architecture Unfolding chromatin structure is required for transcription.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Histone acetyltransferase activity is associated with a number of transcriptional activators, such as p300/CBP (CREB binding protein), PCAF (p300/CBP associated factor) and TAFII250 (TATA binding protein associated factor) (46).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	49	 In addition to acetylating p53 protein at lysine 373 and 382 (28), binding to N-terminally phosphorylated p53 could position p300/CBP to open up nucleosomes for recruitment of other transcription factors to promoters of p53 downstream genes.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	50	 p53 binding sites in p53 downstream genes vary in position relative to the promoter.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Two p53 binding sites in the WAF-1 gene are located between 2 and 3 kb upstream of the transcription start site (16).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Two p53 binding sites are separated by 17 bp and located 1.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	53	5 kb downstream of the start site within the first intron of the Mdm2 gene (47).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	54	 p53 binding sites in the cyclin G gene are separated by a half kilobase interval in the first exon (48).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	55	 DNA loop formation was described as a mechanism of transactivation mediated by the stacking of tetramers through the central domain of p53 protein (49).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Recently, we have observed active DNA binding by p53 protein in the absence of PAb421 for the endogenous Mdm2 p53 binding sequence (two p53 binding sites separated by 17 bp) and for that sequence in which the two Mdm2 p53 binding sites were replaced with Waf-1 sites (121 and unpublished data).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Moreover, p53 binding to the double sites could not be fully competed by either single site.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	58	 p53 binding to DNA, like that of other DNA binding proteins, represents a dynamic on/off state (50).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	59	 The chance of dissociating two p53 to DNA complexes simultaneously is much lower than that for single binding.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Therefore, the formation of a multi-p53 to DNA complex may provide a stable scaffold for transcription machinery as well as enhance the complexity for p53 regulation.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	61	p53 binding to DNA is affected not only by DNA structure but also by chromatin and nuclear proteins.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	62	 High mobility group protein-1 (HMG-1) is a non-histone chromosomal protein that has been shown to activate p53 DNA binding (51), perhaps mediated by DNA bending that stabilizes p53 to DNA complex formation.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Unlike other p53 activators, HMG-1 is not present in the p53 to DNA complex.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	64	 HMG-1 may allow p53 to overcome an energy barrier to bend DNA in an intermediate step of p53 binding to DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	65	 DNA bending is a common mechanism for transactivation.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	66	 It helps not only the formation of stable DNA to protein complexes but also the assembly of transcription complexes in the chromatin context.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	67	 However, our understanding of p53 regulation at the chromatin level is largely limited to speculations from in vitro studies and will depend upon new development in technology for in vivo evidence.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Recently, Rubbi and Milner provided evidence that p53 is preferentially localized at sites of active RNA synthesis (52).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	69	 p53 protein also associates with the centrosome, first shown by Brown et al.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Deppert found that mutant p53 protein anchors to matrix associated regions (MAR elements) (54), but so far no one has demonstrated wild-type p53 associations with nuclear matrix or chromatin in situ.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	71	 With more powerful analytical microscopy and image analysis, p53 localization and associations in cells will be further defined and contribute to a better understanding of p53 regulation and activity.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	72	Redox modification Hainaut and Milner have shown that specific DNA binding of p53 is highly dependent upon the reduction state of p53 protein (55).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	73	 p53 protein has a unique zinc finger that is composed of C176, H179, C238 and C242.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The zinc finger forms a DNA binding interface by bridging two loop to helix structures in the DNA binding domain.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	75	 There are an additional seven cysteine residues involved in direct DNA binding and conformation in the DNA binding domain.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Mutations of these cysteine residues result in the loss of p53 DNA binding activity (56).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The presence of cysteine residues in these critical positions of p53 protein renders it susceptible to regulation by cellular redox status.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	78	 p53-specific binding to DNA requires a thiol reducing agent like dithiothreitol (DTT).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Oxidation of p53 by thiol oxidants like diamide abolishes p53 binding to specific DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	80	 A similar effect can be achieved by metal chelation since zinc binding is correlated with thiol reduction.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Considering oxidative stress caused by DNA damage and other genotoxic stimuli, it is essential for the cell to maintain a reductive state for p53 function.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The cellular redox state is maintained in a highly efficient manner by antioxidant molecules and enzymes like glutathione, thioredoxin and superoxide dismutase.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	83	 In addition to scavenging oxidants, they participate in transcription regulation in response to oxidative stress.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	84	 For example, thioredoxin as a thiol reducing molecule is capable of stimulating DNA binding activity of various transcription factors like NFB (57) and AP-1 (58).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	85	 More recently, thioredoxin has been shown to enhance p53 DNA binding and transactivation (59).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Further, p53 transcriptional activity is suppressed in yeast strains with thioredoxin reductase mutation or deletion (60,61).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	87	 More interestingly, p53 binding to specific DNA is activated by Ref-1, a dual functional protein that serves as an A/P endonuclease in BER and modulates DNA binding of various transcription factors in response to oxidative stress (62).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Since DNA damage is associated with the production of oxygen free radical species, the regulation of p53 by Ref-1 may provide a mechanism to coordinate DNA repair and redox states.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In addition to being modulated by redox proteins, p53 participates in redox metabolism by transactivation of reducing molecules like glutathione peroxidase and repression of oxidating molecules like nitric oxide synthase (63,64).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Accumulating evidence suggests that the p53 pathway integrates signals not only from DNA strand breaks but also from oxidative stress pathways.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	91	Single-stranded DNA In addition to activation by the above mechanisms, ssDNA stimulates p53 binding to specific DNA.

0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Deletion analysis revealed that the C-terminal domain of p53 protein binds to the end of the DNA strand, whereas the central domain contributes to binding the internal segment of ssDNA (67).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	97	 The inhibitory effect of the long oligonucleotides may be attributed to an ability to bind the central domain, therefore competing with specific DNA binding (68).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The binding site for ssDNA has been mapped to residues 361 to 382 of p53 protein, including the region of p53 activated by PAb421 binding and S378 phosphorylation.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	99	 These data imply that removal of negative control imposed by the C-terminal domain is the mechanism by which ssDNA binding activates p53.

0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	103	 This ssDNA is vulnerable to nuclease attack and active for DNA recombination.

0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Activation of p53 by ssDNA seems to be an attractive model for p53 to coordinate cellular response to DNA damage.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	108	 However, it is almost impossible for p53 activated at the damage site to transactivate distant downstream genes, and the short ssDNA generated by excision repair is rapidly degraded in the cell.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	109	 A more plausible model for ssDNA binding effects on p53 protein may be activation of p53 protein for enhanced non-sequence-dependent binding to adjacent dsDNA.

0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	126	 The following sections will discuss possible biological functions of p53 protein non-sequence-specific binding to DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	127	Is p53 a damage sensor? A prevalent hypothesis about the biological relevance of p53 binding to altered DNA structures is that p53 is a damage sensor.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Accordingly, p53 recognizes damaged DNA and recruits DNA repair machinery to the damaged site.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The identification of DNA repair proteins XPB and XPD as p53-associated factors as well as the phosphorylation of p53 protein by CAK (which in addition can activate p53 sequence-specific binding) strongly favor this idea.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Although p53 binding to damaged and mismatched DNA resembles mismatch repair sensor MSH2, there is no evidence to show that p53 protein participates in mismatch repair.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Each DNA repair machinery complex has its own factor to sense damaged DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The binding to damaged DNA by the sensor is avid and highly specific so as to target the appropriate DNA repair machinery to the particular type of DNA damage.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	133	 For example, XPC to hHR23B is a damage sensor for NER that binds specifically to pyrimidine dimers (with a Kd value of 5x10 to 9) and specifically recruits XPA and TFIIH to the damage site (82).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	134	 p53 protein offers no obvious specificity to a particular repair machinery as it binds to different types of DNA structures and to proteins involved in different types of repair, like XPB and XPD for NER, and Rad51 for DNA recombination.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Since DNA repair proteins already have components to sense DNA damage, the cell does not require p53 protein strictly as a damage sensor.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	136	Is p53 a DNA repair effector? If p53 protein is not primarily a damage sensor, is it directly involved in repair? Several biochemical properties associated with p53 non-sequence-specific binding to DNA have suggested a direct involvement in DNA repair.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	137	 p53 protein is able to mediate ssDNA reannealing and DNA strand transfer (66,71,83).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	138	 These activities resemble DNA strand invasion and single-strand annealing in homologous recombination.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Homologous recombination is a well conserved cellular mechanism to repair damaged DNA and to mediate chromatin exchange in crossover during normal cellular processes like antibody generation and meiosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Recombination is also a common cause of chromosomal abnormality in cancer development.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Results from in vivo studies show that both inter- and intra-chromosomal recombination are significantly inhibited by wild-type p53 (84,85).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	142	 This indicates that p53 may function as a regulator of DNA recombination by recognizing DNA ends and reannealing ssDNA to block abnormal recombination.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	143	 However, it is possible that DNA recombination can be enhanced by high levels of p53 protein through binding at the C-terminus.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	144	 This domain of mutant p53 remains intact in most cases, and stabilization of the mutant makes it highly available for this genetically destabilizing activity.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	145	 We have suggested that increased non-homologous recombination may contribute to the `gain of function' phenotype associated with p53 mutants as implicated by p53 C-terminal activation of topoisomerase I catalytic activity (86).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that p53 protein is capable of rejoining DNA with double strand breaks, indicating its role in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (80,87,88).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Although NHEJ is required in preventing chromosomal translocation (89,90), the lack of specificity of DNA end rejoining by p53 protein may contribute to its `gain of function' phenotype, as mutant p53 is equally active in rejoining DNA ends (87,88).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	148	Although p53 binds to ssDNA and mismatched DNA, there is no direct evidence to support the involvement of p53 in either NER or mismatch repair in cell free systems, and there are no obvious DNA repair defects in p53 knock out mice.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	149	 These observations suggest that p53 as guardian of the genome is not primarily involved in DNA repair.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	150	 recently provided evidence that p53 participates in BER (91).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Incorporation of radiolabeled dNTP into depurinated plasmids in nuclear extracts (indicative of BER activity) was enhanced in cells expressing wild-type p53 and reduced in cells expressing mutant p53 proteins.

0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	153	 have found that wild-type p53 protein possesses intrinsic 3' to 5' exonuclease activity in the presence of magnesium ions (92).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	154	 This activity is localized to the central domain of p53 protein based on deletion analysis and structural similarity to the catalytic domain of exonuclease III in Escherichia coli.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The 3' to 5' exonuclease activity is a common mechanism to ensure sequence fidelity during DNA replication and DNA repair.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	156	 This activity provides a molecular basis for p53 involvement not only in BER but also in other DNA repair machinery complexes where proofreading is necessary.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The exonuclease activity of p53 seems to be mutually exclusive to its specific DNA binding activity.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	158	 While the C-terminal domain negatively controls both specific DNA binding and exonuclease activity of p53, the exonuclease activity of p53 is inhibited by the activation events for specific DNA binding, such as phosphorylation or PAb421 association.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Inhibition of 3' to 5' exonuclease activity by PAb421 and phosphorylation events that activate p53 suggest its association with latent p53 proteins (81).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	160	 However, binding to non-specific DNA is also affected by these activation events.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	161	 As noted above, both latent and activated p53 proteins are capable of such binding, indicating a more general function of p53 proteins binding non-sequence-specifically to DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	162	Does p53 protein mediate an apoptosis checkpoint? If p53-mediated DNA repair is critical for maintaining genomic integrity, p53 and its related DNA repair function should be well conserved from bacteria to humans.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	163	 However, p53 and newly discovered members of the p53 gene family are present only in multicellular organisms.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	164	 While p73 and p63 family members bind to the p53 consensus (93,94), to date there are no reports of their capacity for non-sequence-specific binding, for example, to mismatched DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The p53 homolog in Drosophila is the most primitive relative of p53 identified so far.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Drosophila p53 mediates DNA damage-induced apoptosis but not growth arrest, suggesting that the primitive function of p53 is to mediate apoptosis in genome maintenance (95 to 97).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Eliminating cells with damaged DNA by apoptosis is vital for multicellular organisms to prevent genetic transformation (98).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	168	 It is generally accepted that p53-mediated apoptosis and p53-induced cell cycle checkpoints are the two major mechanisms of p53 protein activity as a tumor suppressor.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The p53-mediated cell cycle checkpoint is activated by checkpoint proteins well conserved in yeast such as ATM, ATR and Chk2.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	170	 However, the mechanism of p53-mediated apoptosis is largely unknown, despite the identification of apoptosis-related genes as downstream transcriptional targets of p53.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	171	 So far it is not clear why p53 mediates growth arrest in certain cells but apoptosis in others responding to the same DNA damage, or how a given cell type determines its response to different DNA damaging agents or even to different doses of the same agent.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Clearly, there are certain signals sensed by p53 protein that trigger the apoptosis pathway.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Given the role of p53 as a guardian of the genome, unrepaired DNA should be a legitimate signal for p53 protein to direct the cell towards the apoptosis pathway.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	174	 There is evidence that when DNA damage is not repaired, activation of p53 can lead to apoptosis (90).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Binding to sds-DNA as defined above suggests a biochemical basis whereby p53 protein might monitor an apoptosis checkpoint in response to a variety of types of DNA damage.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Rather than sensing the damage primarily to recruit repair proteins, p53 protein may sense the equilibrium between the amounts of damaged DNA and available DNA repair proteins.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	177	 This equilibrium would be dependent upon p53 protein modification state, the level of p53 protein accumulation, the level of DNA damage and the capacity of the damaged cell to repair.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Since sds-DNA is also targeted by DNA repair proteins like RPA and Rad51, it is tempting to propose that p53 proteins and DNA repair proteins are competing for sds-DNA dynamically, as reflected in the equation: [sds-DNA] + [p53]/[DNA repair proteins] Apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	179	 According to the scheme represented in Figure 2, DNA damage leads to accumulation of activated p53 proteins with increased affinity for DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Distinct p53 modifications may target different genes, such that certain cells with a higher capacity to repair or less capacity for rapid renewal might arrest, repair and survive.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Because the levels of repair proteins generally far exceed those of p53 protein, sites of damaged DNA would be occupied predominantly by DNA repair proteins if the damage is mild.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	182	 However, even limited levels of p53 protein may bind damaged DNA above the threshold of DNA repair protein availability.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Alternatively, high levels of p53 induced by DNA damage or oncogenic events could compete with DNA repair proteins for a limited amount of DNA lesions, triggering apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	184	 There is abundant evidence that apoptosis is highly correlated with the level of p53 protein and the extent of DNA damage (99).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Furthermore, increased apoptosis has been linked to p53 when DNA repair is inhibited by inactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a ubiquitous DNA binding protein involved in repair and possibly in apoptosis (100).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	186	 It is possible to test the proposed apoptotic checkpoint equation by microinjection of fluorescein-labeled sds-DNA into cells.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	187	 have reported that microinjection of a plasmid with a long gap or DNA with a 5' overhang into fibroblasts induced p53-dependent growth arrest (80).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Cells with apoptotic potential could be used to test the hypothesis that sds-DNA dosage and extent of association of p53 and sds-DNA are directly correlated with p53-dependent apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Comparison of fibroblasts refractory to apoptosis with epithelial cells competent for apoptosis might provide clues as to how cell type-specific transcriptional events lead to survival or apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	190	 While the apoptosis checkpoint controlled by p53 binding non-sequence-specifically to DNA is hypothetical, it provides a framework for explaining how p53-mediated apoptosis is dependent upon cell type or extent of DNA damage and why apoptosis is more likely to be induced in cells less robust for DNA repair proteins.

0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Cell type and/or DNA damage-specific responses are dependent upon transcriptional and non-transcriptional effects of DNA binding by p53 proteins.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	195	 An apoptosis checkpoint is determined by thresholds of p53 proteins and damaged DNA (sds-DNA) relative to a constant level of ubiquitous DNA repair proteins (see text).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	196	  The transcriptional and non-transcriptional p53-dependent arms of the p53 response to DNA damage could, theoretically, be exercised independently or cooperatively.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Mainly transcriptional events might occur in cases where p53 is induced at very low levels of sds-DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Non-transcriptional events might predominate in severely damaged cells because transcriptional activities of p53 protein are compromised by conformational changes due to oxidative stress (101).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Cell type-specific responses may require a cooperation of events in which accumulation of proteins encoded by p53 downstream target genes tip the balance toward survival (either due to reversible or prolonged cell cycle arrest) or apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	200	 While apoptosis can be regulated at the transcriptional level by p53, p53-dependent apoptosis can be achieved in a transcription-independent manner.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Examples of this are p53-mediated apoptosis in the presence of inhibitors of transcription and translation (102,103) and apoptosis mediated by p53 mutants lacking transcriptional activities (104).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Although the N-terminal proline-rich domain and the C-terminus of p53 protein are required for p53-dependent apoptosis (99,105), the central domain must participate in p53-mediated apoptosis, as tumor cells with p53 mutations are resistant to apoptosis in general.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Furthermore, certain p53 mutants (Ala143, His273) with substantial transactivation activities are defective in apoptosis (106,107).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Using a p53 DNA binding assay applicable to cells and tissues, we found that p53 mutant (His273) in human colon carcinoma cell SW480 has lost its ability to bind non-specific DNA while retaining the ability to bind specific DNA (unpublished data).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	205	 This associates the defect in p53 binding non-sequence-specifically to DNA with the defect in p53- mediated transcription-independent apoptosis and is worthy of exploration in other p53 mutants.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	206	Due to the lack of sequence-dependence, apoptosis mediated by sds-DNA binding should be through protein to protein interactions instead of transactivation.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Several lines of evidence coming from the laboratory of Harris and others indicate that DNA repair machinery is involved in p53-mediated apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	208	 p53-mediated apoptosis is abrogated in cells with either XPB or XPD mutations and can be restored by introduction of wild-type XP genes (108).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Attenuation of p53-mediated apoptosis was also observed in cells with a defect in WNR, a DNA helicase mutated in Werner syndrome (109).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	210	 At first glance, these observations seem contrary to the hypothesis above, since repair defects might be expected to result in a higher frequency of sds-DNA and increased p53 binding and apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	211	 However, the increased p53 binding to sds-DNA may occur, but apoptosis as its consequence may be blocked by the repair protein defect.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	212	 These repair protein defects may provide clues as to how the signal of p53 binding to sds-DNA is transduced and linked to the apoptosis pathway.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	213	 XPB and XPD mutants are associated with attenuated apoptosis whereas CSB mutants result in enhanced apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	214	 p53 protein has been found to be associated with XPB, XPD and CSB.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Inhibition of the helicase activities of these proteins by association with p53 suggests that enhancement of DNA repair is not the mechanism by which p53 maintains genomic integrity, at least not through the association with these repair proteins.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Since DNA repair is not necessary in cells committed to apoptosis, these associations may be primarily involved in apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	217	 The association between p53 and DNA repair proteins suggests transcription-independent apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Another possibility is that p53 binding non-sequence-specifically at sites of DNA damage mediates p53 modifications by the DNA repair machinery.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Such modifications may confer specificity of p53 DNA binding to transactivate pro-apoptotic genes.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from p53 modification by CAK, a component of TFIIH (25,110).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	221	 This would be a transcriptional means to convey the apoptotic signal if p53 protein dissociates from the complex upon modification.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The availability of functionally distinct p53 mutants and model systems such as the simpler organism Drosophila will provide tools to dissect the mechanism of p53-mediated apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	223	Clearly, p53 is a multifunctional protein with multiple potential modifications and biochemical properties.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	224	 A major challenge in the field is how to correlate its biochemical properties with its biological behaviors in cells and, more significantly, in vivo.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Remaining questions include: how are the transcriptional and non-transcriptional arms of p53 response to DNA damage coordinated in specific cell types; what is the nature of the interactions between p53 proteins and DNA repair proteins or other constitutive or induced proteins required for p53-dependent apoptosis; how do p53 and other proteins at the postulated apoptosis checkpoint trigger the next steps in the apoptosis cascade.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	226	 To answer these questions, DNA binding studies must be extended from the test tube to the cells, requiring increasing sensitivity.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Molecular profiling of p53 downstream genes by means of DNA chip technology, affinity assays of cellular p53 protein binding to a range of specific and non-specific DNA templates and identification of discrete p53 proteins modified through phosphorylation and acetylation by means of specific antibodies will make a powerful combination for defining the p53 pathway in response to different genotoxic stresses in cells and tissues.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Application of these approaches will permit defining the p53 response to DNA damage through sequence-specific and non-sequence-specific binding to DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	229	 It may reveal how p53 selectively turns on the expression of certain sets of genes through sequence-specific DNA binding or, in the face of overwhelming DNA damage, uses a variety of DNA repair machinery components to trigger apoptosis through non-sequence-specific DNA binding.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Finally, these approaches may uncover how specific post-translationally modified p53 proteins integrate the response to different upstream signals.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	231	 To fully understand how p53 proteins orchestrate the cellular response to DNA damage, it may be essential to view the location and extent of p53 binding to specific DNA and to damaged DNA and the association of p53 protein with other proteins in the chromatin context in cells responding to DNA damage.

0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	2	Intracellular p53 accumulation is the hallmark of the p53 activation pathway and results in p53 protein complexation, nuclear localization of p53 tetramers, and induction of their transcriptional activity.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	3	 The resulting complex pattern of p53 target genes depends on stress conditions and cell type context, as indicated by gene profiling using oligonucleotide microarrays.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	4	9 The broad spectrum of p53 transcriptional targets indicates the interference of p53 stress-signaling with multiple cellular functions.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	5	10 The list of targets includes genes encoding for proteins critically involved in cell-cycle regulation (p21, GADD45A), apoptosis (Bax, PUMA, CD95, TRAIL), and the intracellular redox state (PIG3, PIG12).
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	6	The mitochondrion plays a dual role in the cell as a regulator of apoptosis and as a cellular powerhouse, and multiple mitochondrial components are involved both in the regulatory processes of energy metabolism and in stress-induced apoptosis signaling.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	7	13,14 The molecular mechanism of mitochondrial energy transformation involves the electron transport chain, which consists of electron transfer complexes I-IV embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The electron transport chain serves to convert the high energy potential of electrons from NADH and FADH2 molecules into the energy of the proton gradient across the inner membrane, defined as the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, MTMP (DeltaPsiM; m).
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The MTMP level is proportional to the number of protons pumped to the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane during electron transport and reflects the mitochondrial activity of the cell.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	10	 It is the free energy of the proton gradient that finally drives the synthesis of ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate, occurring at the site of ATP synthase (complex V, F0/F1-ATPase).
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	11	14 Mitochondrial activity critically contributes to the intracellular redox state as the major source of reactive oxygen species, ROS, which are generated as a result of occasional escape of electrons from the electron transport chain.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	12	In p53-dependent proapoptotic signaling, the key events leading to activation of caspases and apoptotic cell death are the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and subsequent release of apoptogenic factors, especially of mitochondrial cytochrome c.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	13	17,18 Mitochondrial permeabilization is preceded by a complex decision phase, which involves integration of pro- and antiapoptotic signals and converges on the Bcl-2 family of proteins.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	14	18,19 Several genes encoding for proapoptotic Bcl-2 related proteins, including Bax and PUMA, are direct transcriptional targets of p53.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	15	20,21 It has recently been proposed that there is direct cooperation between Bax and mitochondrial ATP synthase during the process of mitochondrial cytochrome c release.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	16	22 Mitochondria are further involved critically at the later stages of apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction defines the irreversible stage of apoptosis, characterized by MTMP loss, redox shift, and increase of intracellular ROS levels.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	17	Mitochondrial involvement in proapoptotic p53 signaling has been largely investigated downstream of p53 activation in cellular systems overexpressing either wild-type (wt) or temperature-sensitive mutant p53.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	18	17,22 Here we address the contribution of mitochondrial components to the early stress signaling upstream of p53 activation.

0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	21	27-29 The results demonstrate that there is a strong dependence of stress-induced p53 activation on mitochondrial activity, which suggests that mitochondrial status is implicated in the mechanisms of chemoresistance in acute leukemia cells.

0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	234	 These data suggest that mitochondrial ROS may be implicated as second messengers between mitochondrial electron transport activity and stress-induced p53 activation.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	235	Redox-regulating oxidoreductases have recently emerged as a novel class of interaction partners of the p53 protein, indicating the importance of intracellular redox-regulating factors in the stress-induced p53-activation.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Chang et al63 identified WOX1 oxidoreductase as a proapoptotic protein, which became phosphorylated in response to stress or apoptotic stimuli and formed a complex with activated p53.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	237	 The p53 complex with a wild-type, but not mutant WOX1, translocated to the mitochondria and further to the nuclei to mediate apoptosis.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	238	 In a series of studies Asher et al6,64,65 demonstrated that NQO1 oxidoreductase regulates p53 in a MDM2-independent manner.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	239	 In addition, Anwar et al7 demonstrated that p53 stabilization requires the physical interaction of p53 with NQO1.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	240	 It was also shown that heat-shock protein HSP70B interacts with an immature form of NQO1 and is responsible for the stability and functionality of this oxidoreductase.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	241	47 We observed down-regulation of the HSP70B encoding gene and of the gene encoding for a component of the mitochondrial complex I with a NADH dehydrogenase activity, NDUFC1.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	242	 These changes, which indicate interference of oligomycin with cellular redox regulation at the transcriptional level, are of particular interest, as only a small number of genes were consistently down-regulated by oligomycin (Table 1).
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	243	 It remains to be elucidated, whether oxidoreductase-specific p53 regulation may be operative in the ROS-mediated linkage between mitochondrial activity and the p53 system.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	244	Quantification of intracellular MTMP levels provides a useful intrinsic determinant describing mitochondrial activity.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Heerdt et al66,67 have reported the dependence of intrinsic MTMP levels on the extent of growth arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Harper et al68 have found that decreased MTMP levels are characteristic of drug-resistant leukemia cell lines as compared to MTMP levels in their drug-sensitive counterparts.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	247	 It is of particular interest that chemoresistant cells have been found to switch their energy metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic energy sources, thus preserving energy supply while reducing mitochondrial activity.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	248	68 Our data suggest that this cellular metabolic strategy would decrease or abolish cellular stress sensitivity at the p53 level, thus providing a clinically-relevant mechanism of chemoresistance of the wt p53 cells.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	249	 It would be of interest to investigate whether differential MTMP levels observed in the primary ALL cells might be due to metabolic differences in these cells.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	250	Recent studies have indicated the impact of wt p53 on mitochondrial function.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Mouse embryos homozygous for a p53 null mutation showed mitochondrial deficiency at a stage in development when the embryo switches from an anaerobic to aerobic metabolism.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	252	69 In wt p53 cells, constitutive and stress-dependent colocalization of p53 with mitochondria have been reported.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	253	70,71 Mitochondrial targeting of the dominant-negative p53 mutant protein resulted in decreased MTMP levels.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	254	72 Our data provide experimental evidence that activation of the p53 system requires mitochondrial activity, and point to mitochondrial ROS as secondary messengers between respiratory chain and proapoptotic p53 machinery.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	255	 This linkage has potential clinical implications in the mechanisms of chemoresistance in normal and malignant cells.

0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	2	Loss of control of genomic stability is central in the development of cancer, and p53, by regulating normal responses to DNA damage and other forms of genotoxic stress, is a key element in maintaining genomic stability.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Thus, it is no surprise that functional p53 is lost in about half of all human cancers.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	4	 What about the other half? One possibility is that p53-independent regulatory mechanisms have been lost.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Another is that inactivation of p53-dependent pathways can occur at any of several different points and that p53 itself is merely the most common target.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	6	 For example, the p53 inhibitor Mdm2 is overexpressed in tumors independently of the p53 mutation.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Here, we review pathways that signal in to p53, in response to different forms of stress, and pathways that signal out, triggered by activated p53.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	8	 It is clear that p53 is the central component of a complex network of signaling pathways and that the other components of these pathways pose alternative targets for inactivation.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	9	 For additional recent reviews, see Refs.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	10	The amount of p53 protein increases in response to a variety of signals, such as damaged DNA, arrest of DNA or RNA synthesis, or nucleotide depletion.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The same stimuli also activate p53, which is mostly latent in the absence of stress.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The increase in the amount of protein is often achieved through an increase in the half-life, from ~30 min in untreated cells to ~150 min in, for example, UV-treated cells (3).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, an increase in the rate of translational initiation of p53 mRNA can also affect the steady-state level of the protein (for example, see Ref.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The ubiquitin pathway probably plays an important role in degrading p53 (5), and evidence for a ubiquitin-independent mechanism of degradation has also been presented (6).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	15	Recent evidence has also shown that the Mdm2 protein, which binds to p53, accelerates its degradation, possibly through the ubiquitin pathway (7, 8).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The fact that the mdm2 gene is a transcriptional target of p53 suggests a molecular basis for the commonly observed increased metabolic half-life of mutant p53 proteins defective in transactivation.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Thus, the stability of these mutant proteins appears to be due to their inability to up-regulate the expression of Mdm2, a protein involved in their degradation, rather than an intrinsic property conferring resistance to degradation per se.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	18	An increase in transactivation due to p53, with no increase in the level of the protein, was found in cells treated with low doses of UV radiation, and microinjection of an antibody to the C-terminal domain also stimulated p53-dependent transcription, even in the absence of DNA damage (9).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Chernov and Stark (10) found that sodium salicylate, which inhibits protein kinases inhibits the activation of p53, with no significant effect on the accumulation of the protein.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Several processes might be involved in activating p53 (1), including phosphorylation, glycosylation, binding to regulatory proteins, alternative splicing, and acetylation (11).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	21	How does p53 sense signals? Several known proteins are suspects.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPK),1 a plausible candidate, binds to and is activated by broken ends of DNA (12) and can phosphorylate residues 15 and 37 of p53 in a DNA-dependent manner in vitro (13).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The phosphorylation of serine 15 affects the transactivation and growth arrest functions of p53 in some cells (14).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	24	 However, cells lacking DNAPK show no defect in the p53-mediated inhibition of the cell cycle, revealing that if DNAPK has any role in regulating p53 at all, other components must be able to compensate for its loss (15).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	25	Many protein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate p53 in vitro and are candidates for upstream regulators (1).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	26	 However, very little in vivo evidence exists for the role of phosphorylation in regulating p53.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Recent work showing that p53 can be acetylated in vitro is intriguing and suggests the possibility of an additional mechanism of regulation (11).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, it is still necessary to show that acetylation occurs in response to stress.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	29	Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) has long been known to have a role in recognizing DNA damage and in DNA repair.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	30	 PARP-null Chinese hamster cells are defective in activating p53 and resistant to apoptosis induced by DNA damage (16).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	31	 However, embryo fibroblasts from PARP-null mice have normal DNA repair and DNA damage-induced apoptosis (17), and although there is a significant decrease in the induction of p53 protein after DNA damage or nucleotide depletion, there is no change in p53 activity or in the cellular responses to stress (18).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Therefore, although PARP is involved in increasing the amount of p53 protein in mouse fibroblasts, other signaling pathways must be more important in activating p53 in response to DNA damage, consistent with experiments showing at least two levels of 53 regulation (9, 10).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Loss of ATM, the product of the ataxia telangiectasia gene, slows the induction of p53 protein in response to the DNA strand breaks caused by -radiation but not in response to the pyrimidine dimers caused by UV radiation (19, 20).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Similarly, p53 is induced normally in human ATM-null cells after treatment with N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), which blocks de novo UMP biosynthesis, or adriamycin, which damages DNA.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	35	2 p53 and ATM may both be components of complexes that function in recombination (21).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Similarly, the gene product involved in Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) has also been placed upstream of p53 in the pathway that responds to ionizing radiation but not in the responses to other DNA-damaging agents (22).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Because the defects in p53 induction in ATM-null, NBS-null, and PARP-null cells are partial or selective for certain kinds of DNA damage, these gene products are involved in some but not all of the signals.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Double or triple knock-outs should have a more profound (perhaps even a complete) defect in p53 induction in response to DNA damage.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Similar partial defects in p53 signaling have been observed in Fanconi anemia syndrome (FAS) and Bloom's syndrome (BLS) fibroblasts, suggesting that many pathways regulate p53 (20, 23).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	40	Recently a role for oncogenic Ras and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway in p53 modulation and function has been revealed in both human and rodent cells.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	41	 High expression of Ras or activation of the Mos/MAPK pathway induces wild-type p53 levels and causes a permanent growth arrest, similar to cellular senescence (24, 25).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Cells lacking p53 can tolerate high levels of MAPK and display loss of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and enhanced genomic instability (24).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In a cell line defective in the MAP kinase pathway and in p53 expression, increased expression of the MAP kinase ERK2 restores the normal levels of p53, clearly placing ERK2 in a pathway that regulates the steady-state level of p53.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	44	3 MAPK has been shown to phosphorylate residue 73 or 83 of murine p53 in vitro, and this phosphorylation may be important in stabilizing the protein (26).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Other kinases, such as DNAPK II, cyclin A-Cdc2, and cyclin B-Cdc2, are known to phosphorylate the p53 protein in vitro and may play a role in stabilizing it (14, 27).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The mechanisms of p53 induction in response to different types of stress are still largely unknown.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	47	p53 is involved in several different aspects of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, control of genome integrity, and DNA repair (1, 2).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	48	 How does it regulate so many different processes? p53 is a tetramer that can bind to specific sequences and thus transactivate a group of genes (reviewed in Ref.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	49	 1; for example, p21/waf1, gadd45, mdm2, cyclin G, bax, and IGF-BP3).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Several groups have found that active p53 is sensed differently at different promoters, resulting in differential DNA binding and transactivation (for example, see Ref.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	51	 p53 can also inhibit the expression of some genes (for example, see topoisomerase IIa (29)).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Furthermore, some p53-dependent phenotypes do not involve transcriptional regulation at all (for example, see Ref.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	53	The G1-S Transition-- Antibodies recognizing the C terminus of p53 prevent serum-stimulated fibroblasts from entering S phase (31).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	54	 This result, originally interpreted as evidence that a positive function of p53 was required, posed a paradox when overexpression of wild-type p53 was found to cause growth arrest (32).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The paradox was resolved when it was found that these antibodies activate rather than inhibit p53 (9).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	56	 It is now understood more clearly that p53 mediates G1 arrest in response to DNA damage caused by UV or -radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, or nucleotide deprivation (33-35).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The cell-type variability in p53-dependent G1 arrest is illustrated by studies with -radiation, which in normal diploid fibroblasts causes long-term, p53-dependent arrest associated with prolonged induction of p21/Waf1 (36).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The irreversibility of this arrest depends on the inability of these cells to repair even a small number of double-strand DNA breaks, so that the activating signal persists (37).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	59	 In contrast, -irradiation of HT1080 cells, derived from a fibrosarcoma with wild-type p53, causes a transient G1 arrest (38), whereas the colorectal tumor line RKO and the breast tumor line MCF7, which also have wild-type p53, fail to arrest in G1 following irradiation (39).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	60	 These differences may indicate that tumor formation may involve the inactivation of components upstream or downstream of p53, causing the cellular response to DNA damage to fail.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	61	 For example, -irradiation activates p53 to turn on the transcription of p21/Waf1, which binds to and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases, causing hypophosphorylation of Rb, thus preventing the release of E2F and blocking the G1-S transition (Fig.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Alteration of any of these downstream components may have an effect similar to that of inactivating p53 itself in preventing the pathway from functioning.

0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The RAS-MAP kinase pathway is involved in establishing basal levels of p53 and may also affect function.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Some of the cellular functions affected by p53 can be compromised by deregulated expression of Myc, Bcl2, E1B, or E2F.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The control of p53 activity includes an autoregulatory loop involving Mdm2.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The intact set of p53-dependent pathways helps to maintain genomic integrity by eliminating damaged cells, either by arresting them permanently or through apoptosis.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	71	 p53 also helps to regulate entry into mitosis, spindle formation, and centrosome integrity, cell cycle checkpoints that are likely to be involved in preventing DNA damage from occurring.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	72	The Spindle Checkpoint-- p53 is involved in a checkpoint that blocks the re-replication of DNA when the mitotic spindle has been damaged.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	73	 When the DNA content of embryo fibroblasts was measured after treatment with nocodazole or other inhibitors of microtubule assembly, it was found that normal fibroblasts arrest with a 4 N content of DNA, whereas p53-null fibroblasts attain DNA contents of 8 or 16 N (40).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Spindle destruction might block progression through mitosis, or re-replication might be controlled by blocking entry into S phase.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	75	 In a murine cell line with wild-type p53, nocodazole causes transient mitotic arrest, followed by entry into G1 without chromosome segregation (41).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	76	 p53 is induced after mitosis is complete.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The conclusion that the p53 induced in response to spindle damage blocks entry into S phase was also reached by analyzing DNA synthesis in fibroblasts exposed to nocodazole or colcemid (42).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Interestingly, fibroblasts from p21/Waf1-null mice do not re-replicate their DNA when treated with spindle poisons, consistent with the observation that G1 arrest in response to a number of agents is only partially abrogated in these cells (43).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Therefore, p53 must also utilize p21-independent mechanisms to arrest cells in G1 and thus to inhibit re-replication in response to spindle poisons.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	80	Centrosome Homeostasis-- Embryo fibroblasts from p53-null mice acquire more than two centrosomes, leading to mitosis with more than two spindle poles and frequent mitotic failure (44).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	81	 p53 is associated with centrosomes and thus may affect centrosome duplication directly (45).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Alternatively, improper duplication of centrosomes may signal p53 activation, which could in turn cause arrest in G2 or G1.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	83	 It is intriguing that MAP kinase and Cdc2, both capable of phosphorylating p53, are also bound to centrosomes (1, 26, 46, 47) and, like p53, MAP kinase is important for centrosome homeostasis (46).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	84	The G2-M Transition-- In both human and mouse fibroblasts, overexpression of wild-type p53 can inhibit entry into mitosis (48, 49).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Recent results show that this property of p53 is important in a novel cell cycle checkpoint that controls entry into mitosis when DNA synthesis is blocked.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	86	4 In hydroxyurea-treated cells in which synthesis of dNTPs is blocked very rapidly, p53 plays a vital role in inhibiting premature entry into mitosis.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts do not attempt mitosis in hydroxyurea.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	88	 In contrast, p53-null mouse embryo fibroblasts continue to attempt mitosis, entering metaphase with condensed chromatin and high levels of phosphorylated histone H1.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	89	 However, cytokinesis cannot occur and mitosis is aborted, presumably because the spindles cannot segregate incompletely replicated DNA.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Presumably, these responses are present to prevent the segregation of damaged or incompletely synthesized DNA.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	91	p53 plays a role in triggering apoptosis in certain cell types, e.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Stimuli such as DNA damage, withdrawal of growth factors, and expression of Myc or E1A can also cause p53-dependent apoptosis (50-54).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	93	 p53 must be able to function as a transcription factor to block the G1-S transition, but p53-mediated apoptosis does not necessarily require transcriptional activation, because inhibition of transcription by actinomycin D or translation by cycloheximide does not always affect p53-dependent apoptosis (30, 54).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Furthermore, inhibitors of protein phosphatases induce p53-dependent apoptosis in the absence of transactivation (55).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	95	 However, the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Igf-Bp3 are transcriptional targets of p53, suggesting that transactivation by p53 is important in inducing apoptosis in some circumstances.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	96	 In addition, the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and the adenovirus 19-kDa E1B protein can prevent p53-mediated apoptosis (53, 56).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	97	p53 induces apoptosis in some cell types but cell cycle arrest in others, in response to the same stimulus.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Although the mechanisms of such divergent responses are not known, deletion of p21/Waf1 can cause cells that would otherwise undergo p53-dependent cell cycle arrest to undergo apoptosis instead, underscoring the major role of genetic background in determining these cellular responses (57).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Several variables, such as the extent of DNA damage and the levels of p53, also affect the choice between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (58).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Also, cross-talk between the p53 and Rb pathways may be important in determining the biological responses to DNA damage.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	101	 For example, the inactivation of Rb results in the loss of G1 arrest and induction of apoptosis after DNA damage (59).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	102	 This might be explained by the release of E2F (Fig.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	103	 1), which when overexpressed on its own can induce apoptosis (60).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Furthermore, overexpression of Rb blocks p53-mediated apoptosis (61).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Thus, modulation of Rb and E2F through p53 signaling in response to DNA damage may play a central role in determining the balance between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	106	p53-dependent cell cycle control maintains genetic integrity in populations of cells.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Gene amplification is a widely used model to study genetic integrity.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	108	 In most transformed or immortalized cells, drugs such as PALA or methotrexate, which inhibit the synthesis of nucleotide precursors, select for the amplification of target genes whose products overcome the inhibition, carbamyl-P synthetase/aspartate transcarbamylase/dihydro-orotase (CAD) in the case of PALA and dihydrofolate reductase for methotrexate (62).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	109	 However, normal cells (63) and rare cell lines, such as REF52 (64), do not give rise to resistant colonies in these drugs.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The function of p53 is lost frequently during the process of tumorigenesis (65) and in the spontaneous immortalization of primary cells (66), indicating that p53 can be the main factor determining permissivity for gene amplification.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Indeed, embryo fibroblasts from p53-null mice are permissive for gene amplification (67), and primary human cells from Li-Fraumeni patients became permissive as soon as they lost their single copy of wild-type p53 (67, 68).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Transformation of REF52 cells with either SV40 large T antigen or activated Ras plus E1A abolishes p53-dependent cell cycle control and allows these cells to become permissive for gene amplification (64).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	113	 What signal is generated as a part of the mechanism of gene amplification that could activate p53-dependent pathways and prevent the propagation of drug-resistant cells? The current model of amplification involves, as an essential early step, multiple bridge-breakage-fusion cycles in which broken DNA is formed throughout an entire lineage of daughter cells (69, 70).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	114	 The importance of DNA damage in regulating early stages of gene amplification was demonstrated with REF52 cells transfected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of SV40 large T antigen (71).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	115	 When these cells are selected with PALA at low temperature, active large T antigen inactivates p53, rendering the cells permissive for gene amplification.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Restoration of p53 by inactivating large T antigen at a higher temperature very early in the process of forming PALA-resistant colonies stably arrests all cells containing newly amplified DNA.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	117	Human cell lines can achieve resistance to PALA by mechanisms other than gene amplification in situ, which is by far the most common mechanism in rodent cells.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Most PALA-resistant colonies, from several different human cell lines, either do not contain amplified CAD DNA at all or increase the copy number of CAD as isochromosomes 2p (72).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	119	 However, in both cases, p53-dependent pathways are still involved.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	120	 The depletion of pyrimidine nucleotides caused by PALA generates a signal for p53 induction before any DNA damage occurs (35), arresting the cells and preventing PALA-resistant colonies from forming.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Recent work has shown that overexpressing endogenous or exogenous N-Myc allows REF52 cells to overcome the p53-dependent cell cycle arrest caused by DNA damage, making these cells permissive for gene amplification (73).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	122	 This observation emphasizes the fact that p53-dependent pathways can be inhibited at any of several different points (Fig.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	123	p53 signaling pathways connect with tumor suppressors and oncogenes known to influence the cell cycle machinery (Fig.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Alterations in components either upstream or downstream of p53 may be analogous to inactivation of p53 itself, preventing all or a part of the entire pathway from functioning and leading to deregulation of cell cycle controls, genomic instability, and the development of cancer.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	125	 In addition, the recently discovered protein p73, which has a high degree of structural and functional homology to p53, may be another important target for inactivation during the development of cancer (74).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	126	 It remains to be determined if p73 affects signals impinging on or emanating from p53 or if it is a central component of its own independent signaling network.

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, September 8, 2003 , and in revised form, January 20, 2004.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	4	Chk2 has been demonstrated to form stable complexes with p53 (16) and was proposed to activate p53 via its kinase activity toward Ser-20 on p53 (10, 11).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Furthermore, Chk2 has been identified in a subset of Li Fraumeni patients with normal p53 alleles, making it a potential tumor suppressor protein (17 to 19).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	6	 How endogenous Chk2 functions in this capacity has been the focus of many recent studies.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Chk2-/- murine embryonic stem cells have been examined and reported to be unable to maintain IR-induced G2 arrest, and murine Chk2-/- thymocytes and mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) have been shown to have an attenuated apoptotic response (12).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The role of Chk2 in the G1 cell cycle checkpoint in the murine model has been controversial with some groups reporting its requirement, whereas others are reporting it as unnecessary for the p53-mediated G1/S arrest (12 to 15).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	9	The role of Chk2 in the human p53 responses has recently been questioned.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	10	 (20) have purified Chk2 from DNA damaged human cells and demonstrate that p53 phosphorylation is not enhanced after IR.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Furthermore, following introduction of Chk2 short interfering RNA into three different human tumor cell lines, p53 was still found to be stabilized and active after IR.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Concurrently, Jallepalli et al.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	13	 (21) disrupted the Chk2 gene in human cancer cells and found that p53 Ser-20 phosphorylation, stabilization, and transcriptional activation as well as its cell cycle-mediated arrest and apoptotic responses remained intact.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These two reports call into question the role of Chk2 in human cells and further question whether Chk2 lies upstream of the p53-dependent apoptotic response because it seems clear that it does lie upstream in the murine system.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	15	 More recently, however, Craig et al.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	16	 (22) have demonstrated that Chk2 is regulated by allosteric effects of p53 and that its kinase-dependent phosphorylation of p53 requires conformational docking sites on p53, lending evidence again to a role for human p53 as a target of Chk2 phosphorylation.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	17	Because disruption of the p53 tumor suppressor is often found in many human cancers, understanding the mechanism of p53 activation is essential to our progress in the treatment of cancer.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	18	 We have recently reported that DNA-PK and Chk2 are both required for p53-mediated apoptosis in MEFs and that they function in a pathway that uses latent p53 to mediate this response (8, 13).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In this study, we used various approaches to establish the link between these two kinases in p53 activation following DNA damage.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	20	 We show that Chk2 and DNA-PK act synergistically and in parallel to activate p53 (including human p53) as measured by its ability to bind its consensus DNA target sequence.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The p53 target of these two kinases is a latent (preexisting) population of p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The gene mutated in ATM is not involved in this p53 activation.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Our results are consistent with a model in which the immediate actions of DNA-PK and Chk2 on latent p53 following DNA damage are the first events that dictate the subsequent cellular apoptotic response.

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	50	  ATM Is Not Required for Activation of p53 Sequence-specific Binding in Vitro We previously reported that whereas both DNA-PK and Chk2 are required for activating latent p53-mediated apoptosis in MEFs, ATM is dispensable for this activity (8, 13).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	51	 We now seek to determine whether the in vitro system required ATM to activate p53 DNA binding and establish whether this system reflects the observed apoptotic situation in MEFs.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	52	To this end, nuclear cell extracts were prepared from an ataxia telangiectasia (A-T)-lymphoblastoid cell line and examined for their ability to activate p53 DNA binding in the cell-free translation system.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The p53 in these A-T cells is highly unstable, and therefore, no endogenous p53 protein was detectable by EMSA (Fig.

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	56	 This finding suggests that ATM, although necessary for the stabilization of p53, is not required for the activation of p53 DNA binding.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	57	 In an independent experiment, A-T cells were treated with leptomycin B to determine whether accumulation of p53 by stabilization alone was enough to activate p53 DNA binding and it was found that it was not (data not shown).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	58	 This finding is consistent with our previous results, demonstrating that Chk2 functions independently of ATM to activate the p53-apoptotic response (13).

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	64	 A number of experimental approaches were taken to examine the sequence of events in the activation of p53 by DNA-PK and Chk2.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	65	Using the in vitro system, the fungal metabolite wortmannin was employed to inhibit DNA-PK before and after the addition of various components in the pathway.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	66	 3A, DNA-PK activity is required to activate p53 because inhibition of DNA-PK prior to its incubation with p53 prevented p53 DNA binding (compare lanes 3 and 4).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	67	 By contrast, if DNA-PK and p53 are allowed to interact and then DNA-PK is inhibited by wortmannin prior to Chk2 addition, p53 binding can still be observed (Fig.

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane was probed with an anti-phosphothreonine 68 antibody or for total Chk2 protein.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	85	  We have previously demonstrated that Ser-15 on latent p53 is a target of DNA-PK immediately following DNA damage and that this residue plays a role in IR-induced apoptosis of MEFs (8).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	86	 To determine whether Ser-15 is also involved in the in vitro activation of p53 by DNA-PK, two Ser-15 mutants of p53, S15A and S15D, were tested in our in vitro activation assays.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Because S15D mimics phospho-Ser-15, it was expected to be active even in the absence of DNA-PK, whereas S15A would be innately inactive.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Unexpectedly, we found that for both mutants, Chk2 was absolutely required but DNA-PK was dispensable for activation of DNA binding (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	89	 This finding suggests that conformational changes in p53 brought on by Ser-15 phosphorylation, rather than a difference in charge, are responsible for DNA-PK-induced activation of p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The observation that, for both S15A and S15D mutants, Chk2 alone was able to activate DNA binding in the absence of DNA-PK also strongly argues for the independence of Chk2 from DNA-PK.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	91	 It further implies that upon DNA damage, p53 is probably first acted on by DNA-PK before being further modified by Chk2.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	92	We also altered a few other serine phosphorylation sites on p53 to see whether these mutations would affect p53 activation by DNA-PK and Chk2 in any way.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	93	 These included two N-terminal phosphorylation sites, Ser-20 (a known target site of Chk2) and Ser-37 (another known DNA-PK target site), and two C-terminal phosphorylation sites, Ser-315 and Ser-392.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	94	 None of these mutations was found to alleviate the dependence on DNA-PK or Chk2 for p53 activation (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	95	 It is also interesting that the mutation of p53 at Ser-20, a known Chk2 target site, to either alanine (simulating the unphosphorylated state) or aspartic acid (simulating constitutive phosphorylation) had no effect on its requirement for Chk2, which in turn suggests that Ser-20 is not the target of Chk2 for p53 activation in vitro.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	96	That DNA-PK and Chk2 probably act on p53 independently of each other was further suggested by the following observations.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	97	 First, Chk2+/+ and Chk2-/- MEFs displayed similar levels of DNA-PK-dependent Ser-15 phosphorylation upon IR (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Second, Chk2 phosphorylation at Thr-68, often used as a measure of Chk2 activation (25 to 28), was found to be immediate and at comparable levels between human cells with and without DNA-PK (M059K and M059J, respectively) upon -irradiation (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	99	 3E), These observations, combined with those from the wortmannin and S15A and S15D studies described above (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	100	 3, A and B, respectively) have led us to conclude that DNA-PK and Chk2 work sequentially and independently of one another in activating p53 upon DNA damage.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	101	Latent but Not Inducible p53 Requires Chk2 and DNA-PK for in Vitro DNA Binding We have recently reported that the latent population of p53 is sufficient to mediate the Chk2 and DNA-PK-directed p53 apoptotic response (7, 13).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	102	 To determine whether it is the latent population of p53 whose DNA binding activity is regulated by DNA-PK and Chk2, wild-type, Chk2 null, and DNA-PK null MEFs were exposed to IR in the presence and absence of cycloheximide.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Treatment of the cells with cycloheximide blocks translation of any new p53 protein and allows us to assess the DNA binding activity of preexisting (latent) p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	104	 4 clearly shows that the latent p53 population in wild-type MEFs are activated to bind DNA upon IR.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	105	 In contrast, only the induced but not the latent population of p53 was activated in DNA-PK-/- cells.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	106	 This finding is consistent with our previous contention that DNA-PK targets latent p53, whereas ATM targets induced p53 (8, 13).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Likewise, an examination of wild-type versus Chk2-/- cells yielded the same results, suggesting that Chk2 is absolutely required for latent p53 binding to its consensus sequence (Fig.

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	109	 DNA-PK and Chk2 are required for activation of latent p53 DNA binding following DNA damage.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Wild-type, DNA-PK-/-, or Chk2-/- MEFs were mock-treated (CTRL), -irradiated (IR), cycloheximide-treated (CHX), or CHX-treated followed by IR (CHR + IR).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Nuclear extracts were then prepared and assayed for p53 DNA binding by EMSA.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	112	To examine the role of Chk2 upstream of p53, we utilized an in vitro cell free translation system whereby p53 activation could be assessed by its ability to bind its consensus sequence This system was previously used to demonstrate that DNA-PK acts upstream of p53 in response to DNA damage and that an unknown factor (also activated by DNA damage) was also involved in this process.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	113	 We now show that this unknown factor is Chk2.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	114	 These two kinases work synergistically to activate p53 DNA binding that is demonstrable in vitro.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Whether the p53 binding is an actual indication of p53 transcriptional activity or simply a readout for some conformation change in the p53 protein induced by Chk2 and DNA-PK is unclear at present.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	116	 What is clear, however, is that Chk2 and DNA-PK together are capable of activating p53 including human p53 in vitro.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	117	The observation that human ATM cell extract was also capable of promoting p53 DNA binding is also consistent with our previous demonstration that Chk2 activates p53-mediated apoptosis independently of the ATM protein.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Here again the results indicate that, although ATM is necessary to stabilize the p53 protein, the ability of Chk2 and DNA-PK to activate p53 does not require ATM.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	119	 This also underscores the need to consider stabilization and activation of p53 as two separate events.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	120	The independent nature of DNA-PK and Chk2 in activating p53 in vitro and the sequential order of their involvement were determined using a number of approaches.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	121	 We used wortmannin to show that DNA-PK must act upon p53 since inhibition of its kinase activity completely abolished p53 binding.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	122	 However, if DNA-PK was first allowed to interact with p53, the subsequent addition of wortmannin did not interfere with the activating effect of Chk2 that was added later.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	123	 This indicates that DNA-PK is not required upstream of Chk2 to promote p53 activation.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	124	 The demonstration that Ser-15 is phosphorylated by DNA-PK equally well in Chk2+/+ and Chk2-/- cells further attests to the complete independence of action of these two kinases.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	125	Further evidence for a parallel and sequential mechanism of p53 activation by DNA-PK and Chk2 comes from the observation that the two p53 Ser-15 mutants, S15A and S15D, do not require DNA-PK and can be activated by Chk2 alone.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Although this result is expected for the S15D mutant, which mimics phospho-Ser-15, it came initially as a surprise in the case of the S15A mutant.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	127	 The most logical explanation for both of these mutants being able to bypass the DNA-PK requirement is that modification of serine 15 by any means (phosphorylation or mutation) leads to an altered conformation of p53, which is recognizable by Chk2.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Indeed, previous work by Shieh et al.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	129	 (29) shows that phosphorylation at the serine 15 site by DNA-PK alters the tertiary structure of p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	130	 (22) demonstrated that two peptides derived from the DNA binding domain of p53 could bind Chk2 and allosterically stimulate the phosphorylation of full-length p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Based on our present findings, we contend that the reason why full-length p53 by itself cannot activate Chk2 is probably because these Chk2-docking sites on native p53 are cryptic and are exposed only after phosphorylation of Ser-15 by DNA-PK.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Thus, the initial modification of p53 by DNA-PK is a prerequisite for its subsequent modification by Chk2 with the two events probably occurring quickly in tandem and resulting in full p53 activation.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	133	Finally, our study suggests that it is the latent population of p53 that is activated by DNA-PK and Chk2 upon DNA damage.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	134	 This finding is consistent with our previous observation that latent p53 becomes phosphorylated at serine 15 immediately upon IR treatment and that latent p53, rather than inducible p53, is sufficient to induce apoptosis in a DNA-PK-dependent and Chk2-dependent manner.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Therefore, it therefore appears that the fate of the cell (cell growth arrest or apoptosis) is determined very early on, possibly immediately following DNA damage.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Depending on the nature and extent of DNA damage, p53 that appears later on the scene (inducible p53) may then be modified by other kinases such as ATM or ATR and may have a function that is distinct from that of the latent population of p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	137	In summary, results from our investigation are consistent with a model wherein upon DNA damage, DNA-PK, and Chk2 act synergistically and sequentially (with DNA-PK followed by Chk2) on a latent population of p53 (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The modified p53 manifests DNA binding activity in vitro, which may reflect the actual event in vivo or an altered conformational state that is unrelated to its DNA binding activity.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	139	 In either case, the extent of such modifications on this latent population of p53 probably dictates the subsequent course of action and, depending on the cell context, can lead to apoptosis.

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Immediately following DNA damage, DNA-PK is activated by strand breaks and phosphorylates a latent (preexisting) population of p53 on Ser-15.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	143	 This induces a conformational change in the p53 protein such that it is recognized by the Chk2 kinase, which then phosphorylates (and activates) the latent p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	144	 The severity and nature of DNA damage incurred dictates the extent of this latent p53 activation, which in many cell types probably represents the first obligatory event that leads to apoptosis.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Under circumstances where cell growth arrest or DNA repair is the preferred outcome, a separate pathway (data not shown) involving inducible p53 and mediated by ATM, ATR, or other kinases comes into play.

0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	6	A number of transcriptional co-activators and co-repressor complexes that bind p53 in vivo possess histone-modifying activities (16 to 20) suggesting that targeted chromatin remodelling may be important for p53 function as a transcription factor.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Moreover, in several cases the ability of a protein to act as a transcriptional co-activator or co-repressor has been shown to be dependent upon its enzymatic activity (21,22).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases also target non-histone proteins for acetylation/deacetylation and, interestingly, such targets include p53 (16 to 19,23,24).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	9	 p53 is regulated by multiple post-translational modifications, including acetylation at a number of sites in its C-terminus (19,23,24).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The co-activator and HAT p300 directly acetylates p53 at several lysine residues and acetylation has been reported to affect aspects of p53 function including DNA-binding (19,23,24), stability (25,26) and subcellular localization (27,28).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Since p53 is a substrate for HATs and HDACs (16 to 19,23 to 26) it is quite likely that changes in p53-dependent transcription upon recruitment of these activities may not necessarily be due to changes in histone acetylation.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	12	 A number of studies have addressed this issue directly and for some p53 target genes histone modification rather than modification of p53 is important for p53-dependent changes in gene expression (20,29 to 31).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	13	p53 can activate or repress transcription of a variety of cellular genes (32,33).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	14	 p53-induced growth arrest seems to be mediated by transactivation of the p21 gene and several independent studies have sought to understand the mechanisms by which p53 regulates p21 transcription.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Using a reconstituted in vitro transcription system with a chromatin-assembled p21 promoter, Epsinosa and Emerson found that the ability of p53 and p300 to activate p21 transcription is dependent upon cooperation to overcome the repressive effects of chromatin packing rather than acetylation of p53 by p300 (29).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that p53 recruits p300 to the p21 promoter thereby enabling targeted acetylation of chromatin-assembled core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (29).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	17	Barlev and colleagues investigated how acetylation of p53 increases transcription of p21 in vivo (30).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Following gamma irradiation they used chromatin immunoprecipitation to analyse the effects of p53 acetylation status on the association of p53 and of non-acetylatable p53 mutants with the endogenous p21 promoter (30).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Consistent with the results of Epsinosa and Emerson, acetylation of p53 had no discernible effect on p53 binding to the endogenous p21 promoter.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Exploring other possibilities, they found that acetylation of p53 promotes the association of the co-activators CBP and TRRAP with the p21 promoter (30).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	21	 While CBP has intrinsic HAT activity (34), TRRAP is a component of multiple co-activator complexes with HAT activity including PCAF, TFTC, STAGA and Tip60 complexes (35,36).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Recruitment of CBP and TRRAP by acetylated p53 correlated with elevated levels of acetylated H3 and H4 at the endogenous p21 promoter (30).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In another study, a variety of p53 mutants expressed in stable cell lines were analysed for their ability to activate endogenous p21 transcription (37).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	24	 While ChIP analysis revealed that the abilities of most of the mutants to bind to the p21 promoter was equivalent to that of wild-type p53, differences in their ability to activate transcription correlated directly with the extent of histone acetylation and levels of p300/CBP at the p21 promoter (37).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In further support of the importance of chromatin remodelling in p53-mediated regulation of p21 transcription, Lagger et al.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	26	 have discovered recently that p53 and the histone deacetylase HDAC1 are antagonistic regulators of p21 gene expression in vivo and that p53 can displace HDAC1 from the p21 promoter (38).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Other transcriptional targets of p53 include mdm2.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Here transcriptional activation is dependent on recruitment of TRRAP, correlating with increased histone acetylation suggesting that chromatin remodelling is also important for p53-dependent regulation of mdm2 transcription (31).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	29	p53 also interacts with histone deacetylase complexes in vivo and work by Murphy et al.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	30	 indicates that such interactions may be important for transcriptional repression by p53 (20).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	31	 p53 recruits the transcriptional co-repressor mSin3a, which binds HDAC1, to the endogenous Map4 promoter, and this was found to correlate with histone deacetylation and reduced transcription (20).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A abrogated the ability of p53 to repress transcription of the p53 target genes Map4 and stathmin (20).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	33	Several subunits of the ATP-dependent remodelling complex SWI/SNF have also been shown to bind p53 and p53 can recruit hSNF and hBRG1 to the endogenous p21 promoter in vivo (39).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Moreover, whilst over-expression of hSNF5 and BRG1 stimulated p53-dependent transcription of a reporter construct, dominant-negative forms of hSNF5 and BRG1 repressed transcription, p53-induced growth arrest and apoptosis (39).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	35	It is apparent from these and other studies that regulation of local chromatin structure by p53, mediated through the varying actions of histone deacetylases, HATs and ATP-dependent remodelling complexes, is important for p53 function as a transcription factor.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	36	 This is summarized in Figure 1, which shows a schematic of both transcriptional repression and transcriptional activation by p53 through local changes in chromatin structure.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	37	 There is evidence that the mechanisms by which p53 activates or represses transcription may differ for different genes and that chromatin remodelling may be more important for changes in gene expression at some genes than others (31,40).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The majority of studies have focused on the p21 gene and further work is required to look at the relative contribution of chromatin remodelling to p53-mediated changes in transcription at different p53 target genes.

0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	43	Although it is well documented that efficient NER requires p53 (46) its exact role has been difficult to define.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Significantly, NER reconstituted in vitro with naked DNA has no requirement for p53 (47) but p53 is necessary for efficient NER in its natural context of chromatin and notably only for GGR (48,49).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Moreover, the effect of p53 on the efficiency of GGR is much greater for CPDs than 6-4 photoproducts (48,49).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	46	 CPDs are often located within nucleosomes and are thus much more dependent on chromatin relaxation for their repair than 6-4 photoproducts, which are only found in linker DNA (50).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Together the data are clearly suggestive that p53 may function in NER by facilitating access to the chromatin for GGR.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Using microscopy Rubbi and Milner asked if p53 can induce global chromatin relaxation for GGR and demonstrated that p53 is required for global chromatin relaxation induced by UV-irradiation (Figure 2) (43).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Interestingly, the UV dose of 4 J/m2 used in this study is half the minimum dose necessary to activate p53 as a transcription factor (51 to 53).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	50	 This suggests that p53-dependent global chromatin relaxation is due to transcription-independent effects of p53.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Furthermore, xeroderma pigmentosum cells deficient in p48, XPC or XPA all showed normal UV-induced global chromatin relaxation for GGR (43) thus demonstrating that the p53 requirement for global chromatin relaxation is not mediated by p48 or XPC transcriptional targets of p53.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Under conditions in which p53 is activated as a transcription factor it is likely that p53 also has additional roles in NER (and perhaps chromatin accessibility) through the transcriptional induction of repair factors such as p48 and XPC (54 to 57).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Recent work from Ford and colleagues has shown that p48 can rapidly co-localize with CPD-containing foci following localized UV-irradiation and that p48 facilitates localization of XPC at such foci, leading to the suggestion that p48 may remodel chromatin thereby enabling the recognition of CPDs by XPC (56,57).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Here it is important to distinguish between chromatin relaxation and chromatin remodelling, and to note that p48 is dispensable for p53-dependent chromatin relaxation (43) (see above) but may facilitate chromatin remodelling (56,57).

0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Recruitment of p300 and p53-dependent acetylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 may be involved in the ability of p53 to induce global chromatin relaxation but it is likely additional histone acetylation and other factors are also required (see text and ref.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	59	  The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A overcomes the requirement for p53 suggesting that p53 may induce global chromatin relaxation through changes in histone acetylation (43).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Following UV irradiation, histone acetylation increases (58), moreover, by comparison of p53+/+ and p53 to / to  cells and selective depletion of functional p53 by antibody microinjection Rubbi and Milner showed that UV-induced acetylation at lysine 9 of histone H3 is p53-dependent (43).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The histone acetyltransferase p300 co-localizes with p53 to sites of NER and inhibition of p300 by antibody microinjection inhibits NER suggesting that p53-dependent recruitment of p300 HAT activity may be mechanistically involved in the ability of p53 to induce global chromatin relaxation (43).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	62	It is also worth considering what happens after DNA repair.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Clearly, there is a need to restore the chromatin to its original state of condensation, which will help protect the genome from incurring further damage.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The transient nature of the relaxed chromatin state is indicated by the temporal profile of histone acetylation post-UV irradiation (43,58,59).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	65	 It will be interesting to see whether p53 has an active role in chromatin condensation once repair is complete.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	66	The UV dosage of 10 J/m2 used in this study should also be sufficient to activate p53 as a transcription factor so these site-specific effects on histone H3 acetylation may also be mechanistically involved in p53-regulated transcription.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Indeed, acetylation at K9 and K14, both of which are regulated by p53, has been associated with chromatin relaxation for transcription (12).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Changes in histone acetylation have been observed previously at p53 target genes and there is evidence for differential core histone acetylation at different genes (61).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Our own results identify differential effects of p53 upon individual residues within histone H3, a key determinant of chromatin organization.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	70	 p53 also influences histone H3 modification under normal growth conditions in which p53 is not activated as a transcription factor (observations summarized in Figure 3, see ref.

0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The remarkable specificity of the effects of p53 on histone modification, with evidence of differential effects of p53 on the same modification of different residues of the same core histone (Figure 3 and ref.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	77	 59), indicate that such a complex problem will prove difficult to resolve.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	78	 This is especially the case because the same modification on different residues can have very different functional consequences (12).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	79	 There are now 28 different histone residues known to be post-translationally modified (63).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Which of these modifications are influenced by p53 and deciphering the consequences of these modifications when they occur is an enormous task but progress in both these areas should greatly facilitate our understanding of the reciprocal relationship between chromatin remodelling and p53 function(s).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	81	The mitotic kinase AIM1/Aurora B appears to be the principal kinase involved in the phosphorylation of S10 H3 for initiation of chromosomal condensation in late G2 (10,67).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Significantly, AIM1/Aurora B is over-expressed in many human cancer cell lines and abnormalities in S10 phosphorylation have been shown to cause chromosomal abnormalities and segregation defects resulting in aneuploidy (7,10,68).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Loss of p53 also causes abnormalities in S10 H3 phosphorylation (59).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Under constitutive growth conditions, we consistently found that total levels of S10P H3 were at least several fold higher in the absence of p53 (59).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Moreover, whereas total levels of S10P H3 remained relatively constant in response to various treatments in p53+/+ cells, in the absence of p53 levels of S10P H3 were found to vary enormously in a tight inverse relationship with total levels of acetylated K9 H3 (59).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	86	 It seems that in the absence of p53, S10P levels are dictated to a large extent by the levels of acetylated K9.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Such dependency upon the levels of another modification is potentially very dangerous for the cell as it may not allow appropriate regulation of S10 phosphorylation, which is critical for proper chromosomal condensation for mitosis and the maintenance of a normal ploidy.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Abnormal S10P H3 levels were also observed in p53 to / to  cells following release from nocodazole-induced G2/M arrest and this correlated with impaired cell cycle recovery (59), possibly due to defective chromosomal management.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	89	Abnormalities in S10 phosphorylation in the absence of p53 may contribute to the development of aneuploidy, a critical step in carcinogenesis (69).

0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	95	  Research into chromatin modification has exploded in recent years and while the original correlation of increased histone acetylation with a more relaxed chromatin structure still applies (70) it is also clear that this is something of an oversimplification.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	96	 A histone code exists with proteins able to distinguish between different modifications through modification-specific binding domains (such as chromo- and bromodomains) (71,72) and through a combinatorial approach even the same modification on different residues (4,12).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	97	 As the case of methylated K9 and K4 of histone H3 exemplifies, the same modification of different residues of the same histone cannot be presumed equivalent (6).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Clearly there is a need to define in detail the pattern of modification at specific genes.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	99	 For example, how does the pattern of histone modification differ between a gene repressed by p53 and a gene activated by p53?

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	163	 3), dissociate the p53 tetramer (29), and/or cause conformational changes in the extreme C terminus and tetramerization domains of the tumor suppressor (30).
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Such effects by S100B may work synergistically with the hdm2 protein/pathways, which are involved in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 (37), although this concept needs to be rigorously established.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Nonetheless, an important distinction between these two negative regulatory proteins (hdm2 versus S100B) is that the S100B interaction with the C terminus of p53 is Ca2+-dependent (21) and links p53 biology to calcium-mediated signaling pathways and extracellular growth responses, whereas, hdm2 binds the N terminus of p53 in a calcium-independent manner and is regulated by other proteins (i.

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	167	It is important to understand how cancer cells, such as those in malignant melanoma, can proliferate even though they have wild-type p53.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	168	 One possible explanation for this paradigm is that elevated levels of the proteins that negatively regulate p53, such as S100B, may be a culprit.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Specifically, the overall effect of elevated S100B levels on wild-type p53 could mimic cellular aberrations such as gene amplification and mutations that are encountered with non-functional mutants of p53.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Specifically, several melanomas have wild-type p53 and higher than normal levels of S100B, and the prognosis for patients such as these is generally poorer than for those with lower S100B levels (39 to 41).
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	171	 For primary skin cancer cells, we show that there is a direct interaction between p53 and S100B and that functional wild-type p53 levels can be restored when S100B levels are lowered by siRNA (Fig.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	172	 This result directly implicates S100B in the down-regulation of wild-type p53 and is consistent with the large decreases in p53 protein levels observed previously in transient co-transfections of p53 and S100B (23).
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	173	 With these results in mind, perhaps a small molecule inhibitor that binds S100B, blocks the S100B-p53 interaction, and restores wild-type p53 levels (i.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	174	 an siRNAS100B mimic) could be useful in therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancers with elevated S100B, such as some forms of malignant melanoma and glioma.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	5	The amount of p53 in cells is principally determined by the rate at which it is degraded.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The sequence-specific trancriptional induction of the mdm2 gene results in a product, MDM2, which binds to p53 and stimulates the addition of ubiquitin groups to the C-terminus of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The ubiquitinated p53 is detected and degraded by the proteasome (2).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In normal cells, p53 gene expression is low.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In stress conditions or following DNA damage, post-translational changes in p53 or MDM2 can disrupt the balance and allow p53 activation.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	10	 p53 can be modified by phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation or addition of ribose, and these events can regulate p53 function (1).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	11	p53 action is a transcriptional activator role, forming tetramers that bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner by using a highly conserved DNA-binding domain.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The transcriptional targets of p53 include genes implicated in cell cycle regulation, including p21, gadd45 and 14-3-3 (3,4).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	13	 p53 also induces the transcription of proapoptotic genes, such as fas, noxa, killer/dr5 and bax, which leads to caspase activation with the help of death-inducing signalling complex (at the cell membrane level) or the apoptosome (at the mitochondrial level) (5 to 7).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	14	In many models, the transactivation function is not essential for p53-dependent apoptosis (8 to 10) but the transrepression function may be important (11,12).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Indeed, p53 represses the transcription of a number of genes, including those involved in regulatory cascades mediating cell proliferation (cyclin B and RNA polymerase I) and apoptosis (bcl-2).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Furthermore, p53-mediated repression of genes involved in cytoskeleton organization (stathmin and map4), leading to a decrease in microtubule polymerization, participates in both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (13).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In contrast to the information available concerning p53 as an activator, the mechanism by which repression occurs is less well documented (14,15).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This is due in a large part to there being no identified consensus p53-binding site within repressed promoters (16,17).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The genes up- and down-regulated by p53 are not the same; induced genes being principally pro-apoptotic and repressed genes being anti-apoptotic or important for cell survival.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	20	 It has been shown that p53 can lead to transcription-independent caspase activation (18), probably through a direct effect on the release of apoptogenic molecules from mitochondria (19).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, the physiological relevance of this apparently redundant pro-apoptotic property and the determinism of choice between them are unknown.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	22	We have previously shown that large tumour (LT) inactivation leads to p53-mediated apoptosis in rat embryo fibroblasts (e.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Moreover, whereas bcl-2 overexpression inhibits apoptosis, caspase inhibition surprisingly both accelerates apoptosis and abolishes the protective effect of Bcl-2 (22).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Z-Val-Ala-DL-Asp-Fluromethylketone (ZVAD)-mediated caspase inhibition changed the outcome of p53 activation from Bcl-2-regulated apoptosis to mitochondria- and caspase-independent cell death, a phenomenon that had not been described previously (23).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	26	Indeed, even though it is clear today that physiological cell death can occur in the complete absence of caspases, only a few cases of apoptotic death without caspase activation have been reported, most often caspase-independent cell death is related to paraptosis, autophagy or non-lysosomal cell death (24,25).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Moreover, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) controlled by Bcl-2 family proteins resides at the heart of several alternative death pathways whatever be their apoptotic or necrotic feature.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Therefore, the p53-induced cell death program in the presence of ZVAD appears to differ from most caspase-independent alternative pathways: on the one hand by its apoptosis-like nature and on the other hand by being MOMP-independent and insensitive to Bcl-2 protection.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	29	Here, we show that ZVAD treatment affects the cell death commitment decision by modulating the apoptotic functions of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Indeed, in the absence of a caspase inhibitor, p53 activation promotes Bcl-2-sensitive apoptosis through transactivation-dependent signalling that is associated with a rapid MDM2-mediated degradation of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In contrast, caspase inhibition triggers a Bcl-2-insensitive pathway involving the stabilization of p53 and transrepression-dependent signalling.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	32	 A global study of the transcriptome led to the identification of genes differentially regulated by p53 according to these two signalling pathways.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	33	The REtsAF-Bcl-2 cell line has been described previously (22,27).

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	125	 This coincides with the increased rate of apoptosis reported previously (22).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	126	p53 can induce transcriptional activation-dependent or -independent apoptotic processes The stabilization of p53 by ZVAD may lead to increased p53 transactivation activity of p53 and thereby explain the accelerated death process observed in this condition.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	127	 To test this hypothesis, mRNAs of three p53 target genes (p21, bax and mdm2) were assayed by RT to PCR.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	131	 To confirm that this effect was not a result of ZVAD directly, and independent of p53, we compared mRNA levels at permissive temperature in the presence and absence of ZVAD 24 h after addition (Figure 2A, in frame).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The intensity of the p21, bax and mdm2 mRNAs was very weak consistent with these genes being poorly expressed in the absence of active p53.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	149	 p21 and Bax proteins followed the abundance of their messengers: the proteins accumulated at restrictive temperature, both in the absence and presence of ZVAD, even though the increases observed in the presence of ZVAD were lower than those detected in the absence of ZVAD.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	151	5 degrees C), changes in the MDM2 protein level differed from those in the amount of messenger: in the absence of ZVAD, the amount of MDM2 gradually declined whereas messenger levels were maintained; in the presence of ZVAD, MDM2 levels were stable whereas the messenger decreased (cf.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	152	 This discrepancy between protein and messenger changes suggests post-transcriptional regulation of MDM2.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	153	 We confirmed that, like for mRNA levels, ZVAD had no effect on Bax proteins in the absence of active p53 (Figure 2B, in frame).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	154	 In this condition MDM2 and p21 proteins are to weak to be detectable.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	155	Thus p53 activation at restrictive temperature induces the transactivation of target genes.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	156	 This transactivation is attenuated in the presence of ZVAD despite a greater abundance of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	157	 MDM2 and p53 proteins present similar fates: the lower protein concentrations in the absence of ZVAD may be due to the ubiquitin ligase function of MDM2 for itself and p53 promoting proteasomal degradation; the stabilization of both p53 and MDM2, in the presence of ZVAD, might be a consequence of less efficient entry into the proteasome when caspases are inhibited.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	158	p53-mediated transcriptional repression is involved in the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway Surprisingly, p53 accumulation in the presence of ZVAD is associated with a reduced transactivation of its target genes.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Therefore, we investigated whether the accelerated apoptosis induced by ZVAD involves the transcriptional repression activity of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	160	 We tested the transcription of the map4 and stathmin genes in REtsAF-Bcl-2 cells by northern blotting.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The products of these genes regulate microtubule polymerization, and their transcription is negatively regulated by p53 (13,36).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	162	 The map4 mRNA is subject to alternative splicing but the messenger studied was the full-length form (6.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	163	 We found that p53 activation at 39.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	164	5 degrees C correlated with a transient decrease in both map4 and stathmin mRNA levels and that the decrease was greater in the presence of ZVAD (Figure 3).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	165	 This suggests that ZVAD-induced apoptosis results from an increased transrepression activity of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Also, regulation of the amount of p53, involving one or more caspase(s), may affect which p53 functions are involved: increased amounts of p53 are associated with greater transrepression versus transactivation activity.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	188	 However, similar microarray studies have shown previously that the pattern of expression of p53-target genes is dependent on p53 activation status; not all known p53 targets are simultaneously activated in any given condition (37 to 39).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Many genes not previously identified as p53-direct-targets were also regulated by p53 induction.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Some of them have been described in other similar studies, as ATPase, H + transporting and hsp70 genes were repressed, and amyloid protein precursor and annexin genes were activated (37 to 39).

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	220	In conclusion, transcriptosome analysis indicates that the ZVAD-mediated commitment to an alternative Bcl-2-insensitive programme was associated with a shift from a transactivation function towards a transrepression activity of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	221	 This is consistent with the RT to PCR and northern-blot findings.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	222	Caspase inhibition modulates biochemical properties The activation of the alternative pathway is associated with an increased stability, and accumulation, of p53 protein at restrictive temperature.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	223	 This was expected to result in stronger induction of the p53-target genes, explaining the accelerating effect of ZVAD on p53-induced apoptosis.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Surprisingly, we found that ZVAD-induced p53 accumulation is accompanied by a reduced transcriptional activation of its effectors.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	225	 This discrepancy indicates both that the caspase inhibitor modulates p53 properties and that a transactivation-independent apoptotic function of p53 is required to trigger the alternative pathway.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	226	Several studies are consistent with p53 promoting apoptosis through its transcriptional repression activity (12,15,36,41 to 43): certain mutants or deleted forms of p53 that are unable to induce apoptosis have been found to be deficient in transrepression but not in transactivation (44,45); also, a positive association between p53-dependent repression and apoptosis has been demonstrated in some models (15,46).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	227	Therefore, we evaluated the transrepression activity of p53 at restrictive temperature both in the presence and absence of the caspase inhibitor.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	228	 We found that genes known to be repressed by p53 (map4 and stathmin) were down-regulated by p53 activation both in the presence and absence of ZVAD.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	229	 However, transrepression, which was only transient in the absence of ZVAD, was sustained and stronger in the presence of ZVAD, suggesting that its duration can be determined by the amount of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	230	We then conducted a large-scale study of the transcriptome.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	231	 We showed that caspase inhibition leads to extensive changes in the pattern of regulated genes after p53 activation at restrictive temperature.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	232	 The microarray analysis indicated that 86% (clusters 1 and 2) of the 94 genes modulated by ZVAD were more repressed or less activated in the presence of the drug; in other words, these genes are less expressed when caspases were inactive.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Thus, the inhibition of caspases modifies the contribution of the different transcription activities of p53 to apoptosis the onset of the Bcl-2-insentive process is associated with both a decrease in transactivation and an increase in transrepression.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Interestingly, none of the genes activated in the absence of ZVAD became repressed after addition of the drug and none of the repressed genes became activated in the presence of ZVAD.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	235	 This is consistent with p53-mediated transactivation and transrepression affecting different clusters of genes (as explained in Introduction).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	236	Various different mechanisms have been described to account for p53-mediated repression.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Inhibition of the NF-Y transcription factor (47,48) or up-regulation of p21 which leads to hypophosphorylation of Rb and transcriptional repression via E2F1 binding (49), has been implicated.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	238	 However, there is evidence that p53 can promote sequence-specific repression by binding proteins, like HDAC, that possess deacetylase and chromatin condensation properties.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	239	 According to this model, our data suggest that the composition of transcriptional machinery complexes recruited by p53 on promoters might be modulated by a ZVAD-sensitive protease.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Indeed, p53 can activate transcription through interaction with coactivators, e.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Both of these proteins have histone acetylase (HAT) activity, which is critical for the transactivation function of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Conversely, to repress transcription p53 recruits histone deacetylases through a physical association with mSin3a.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	243	 The time course of p53 association with mSin3a and p300 might differ according to the presence or absence of ZVAD.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Interestingly, the C-terminal mSin3a-interaction domain and tetramerization domain of p53 overlap (43).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Therefore, this interaction could contribute to the decrease in p53 transactivation in favour of increased transrepression.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	246	 How ZVAD promotes the formation of this complex on promoters of p53-repressed genes remains unclear.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	247	Nevertheless, the fact that a large number of genes are repressed in the presence of ZVAD suggests that these down-regulations may also be involved, at least in part, p53 indirectly controlling either the expression or the activity of other transcription factors.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	248	Function of genes modulated by ZVAD The most striking transcriptional modification associated with the commitment to the alternative apoptotic pathway is increased repression.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	249	 We then focused on the function of genes that were down-regulated in the presence of ZVAD in order to elucidate the signalling of this new apoptotic pathway (see Figure 5 and Table 2).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	250	Most of the genes affected were more repressed in the presence of ZVAD, and they included genes encoding components of the extracellular matrix and those of the cytoskeleton (procollagen, myosin and others).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	251	 This is consistent with the caspase inhibitor accelerating the commitment to apoptosis.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Indeed, we observed that morphological changes including the loss of adherence, cell shrinking and cell rounding were more rapid in the presence than in the absence of ZVAD.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	253	 These events involve major alterations of both the cytoskeleton and the interactions between the cell and the extracellular matrix.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	254	Numerous genes were not regulated by p53 in the absence of ZVAD but were repressed by p53 when caspases were inhibited.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	255	 These genes are thus specifically implicated in the alternative pathway.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	256	 They include genes encoding regulators of transcription, e.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	257	 the high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 1 and the transcription factor E2a.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Interestingly, high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 1 gene (hmgn1), encodes an activator of transcription which binds to the minor groove of DNA, promoting transcription by inducing a conformational change of the chromatin (50).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	259	 The hmg 17 gene, another member of the high-mobility group family, is a known primary target of p53 (51).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Possibly hmgn1 is also a direct target of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	261	 The down-regulation of this type of transcription factor could trigger a process of amplification contributing to the overall transactivation decrease observed in the presence of ZVAD.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Indeed, most of the genes identified in our analysis have not been reported to be p53 targets and our approach does not discriminate between genes directly repressed by p53 in a sequence-specific manner and genes repressed indirectly by a cascade of regulations.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Another type of gene identified in our study was regulators of cell cycle (including growth arrest specific 6, polymerase beta and cell division cycle 2 homolog A).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	264	 This is consistent with the established ability of p53 to arrest the cell cycle through transcriptional regulation.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Furthermore, the commitment of REtsAF-Bcl-2 cells to apoptosis is associated with an inability to respond appropriately to p53-induced negative regulators of the cell cycle (52).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	266	Surprisingly, 94 genes regulated by ZVAD included few genes known to be involved in apoptosis.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	267	 There are several possible explanations: (i) many apoptotic genes were not represented on the array used, (ii) the signals given by these genes do not pass the statistical tests, (iii) the apoptotic genes were among the unidentified regulated genes and (iv) the Bcl-2- and caspase-insensitive pathway involves unidentified genes.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	268	p53 protein level determines activated biochemical properties Activation of the alternative pathway was associated with an increased stability of p53 at restrictive temperature.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	269	 There was a parallel accumulation of MDM2, a consequence of a post-transcriptional mechanism.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Presumably, these two proteins do not pass as rapidly to the proteasome as they do at restrictive temperature in the absence of ZVAD.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	271	Control of p53 stability appears to be central in the determination of the p53 apoptotic pathway.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Numerous studies show that the heterogeneous responses of gene transcription to p53 activation by diverse agents could be due to p53 protein levels differing according to the nature of the stress signal (37).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	273	 In our model, target genes can be transactivated by p53 in a transient manner, the transient nature being determined by MDM2-mediated degradation of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	274	 In contrast, it could be argued that transcriptional repression is effective only if repression complexes are present on the promoters of repressed genes for prolonged periods (43,53).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	275	 By protecting p53 from degradation, caspase inhibition may therefore enhance the effectiveness of p53 as a transrepressor.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Note that two components of the proteasome were repressed in the presence of ZVAD (cluster 2 of DNA chip analysis), and this may contribute to the decrease in p53 and MDM2 proteasomal degradation in this condition.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	277	However, the effect of caspase inhibition appears to be more puzzling.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Unlike the effect on transrepression, p53 accumulation does not promote greater transactivation efficiency.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	279	 As MDM2 also accumulates in the presence of ZVAD, probably as the result of inhibition of its proteasome-mediated degradation, it is possible that ZVAD blocks the caspase-mediated inactivation of a component which regulates, via MDM2, the stability and the apoptotic function of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	280	 (54) report that Rb, MDM2 and p53 can interact in a ternary complex in which Rb regulates the apoptotic function of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	281	The modification of the p53 protein itself depends on the types of stress (38): different types of DNA damage activate different protein kinases which phosphorylate different serine or threonine residues on the protein.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	282	 The presence or absence of ZVAD may similarly cause different types of post-transcriptional modification.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Whether these modifications qualitatively influence the outcome of p53 activation remains unclear.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Thus, the overall transcription pattern of a cell might depend on the nature of qualitative and quantitative p53 status.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	285	It is important to note that the effect of ZVAD is specific for p53 and not for LT antigen.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Indeed, a dominant-negative form of p53 abolishes the proapoptotic action of ZVAD and ZVAD also potentiates p53-induced apoptosis in rat primary fibroblasts which do not express LT (23).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	287	 This latter observation reinforces the idea that the caspase-dependent control of p53 activity has a physiological relevance.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Nevertheless, this needs to be tested in human cells.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	289	Further analysis and cataloguing of p53 targets genes regulated in response to various conditions (like ZVAD) may help to connect p53 activation to the apoptotic network.

0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	0	Identification of a Novel p53 Functional Domain That Is Necessary for Mediating Apoptosis* Jianhui Zhu, Wenjing Zhou, Jieyuan Jiang, and Xinbin Chen.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Program in Gene Regulation, Institute of Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, Georgia 30912.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	2	The ability of p53 to induce apoptosis requires its sequence-specific DNA binding activity; however, the transactivation-deficient p53(Gln22-Ser23) can still induce apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Previously, we have shown that the region between residues 23 and 97 in p53 is necessary for such activity.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In an effort to more precisely map a domain necessary for apoptosis within the N terminus, we found that deletion of the N-terminal 23 amino acids compromises, but does not abolish, p53 induction of apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Surprisingly, p53(1-42), which lacks the N-terminal 42 amino acids and the previously defined activation domain, retains the ability to induce apoptosis to an even higher level than wild-type p53.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	6	 A more extensive deletion, which eliminates the N-terminal 63 amino acids, renders p53 completely inert in mediating apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In addition, we found that both p53(1-42) and p53(Gln22-Ser23) can activate a subset of cellular p53 targets.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Furthermore, we showed that residues 53 and 54 are critical for the apoptotic and transcriptional activities of both p53(1-42) and p53(Gln22-Ser23).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Taken together, these data suggest that within residues 43-63 lie an apoptotic domain as well as another transcriptional activation domain.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We therefore postulate that the apoptotic activity in p53(Gln22-Ser23) and p53(1-42) is still transcription-dependent.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	11	The p53 tumor suppressor protein serves as a checkpoint in maintaining genome stability (1-3).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Several different biological responses that could play a role in maintaining genome stability have been strongly correlated with wild-type p53 function (1, 3).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Following stress conditions such as in the presence of damaged DNA or insufficient growth and survival factors, the cellular levels of p53 increase.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This leads to one of at least three well understood cellular responses as follows: cell cycle arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Several factors have been shown to determine how a cell responds to the accumulation of p53, e.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	16	 cell type and the presence of several cellular and viral proteins (4-8).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In addition, the levels of p53 in a given cell can dictate the response of the cell such that lower levels of p53 result in cell cycle arrest (9) or differentiation (10), whereas higher levels result in apoptosis (9, 10).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	18	The functional domains of p53 have been subjected to extensive analysis (1, 3, 4).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A transcriptional activation domain has been shown to lie within N-terminal residues 1-42 (11, 12).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Within this region there are a number of acidic and hydrophobic residues, characteristics of the acidic activator family of transcriptional factors (13).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Indeed, a double point mutation of the two hydrophobic amino acids at residues 22 and 23 renders p53 transcriptionally inactive (14).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These two residues presumably are required for the interaction of the activation domain with the TATA box binding protein and/or TATA box binding protein-associated factors (15-18).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	23	It is well established that as a transcriptional activator, p53 up-regulates p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (19-21), which leads to p53-dependent G1 arrest.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	24	 However, it is not certain what function(s) of p53 is required for apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The transactivation function of p53 was shown to be required in some experimental protocols (22-24).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	26	 There are several candidate genes that play roles in apoptosis that can be activated in response to p53 induction, such as BAX (25), IGFBP3 (26), PAG608 (27), KILLER/DR5 (28), and several redox-related PIGs genes (29).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Several other studies, including our own observations, have provided evidence that p53 might have a transcription-independent function in apoptosis (9, 30-32).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Recently, the proline-rich region between residues 60 and 90, which comprises five "PXXP" motifs (where P represents proline and X any amino acid), was found to be necessary for efficient growth suppression (33) and apoptosis (34) and to serve as a docking site for transactivation-independent growth arrest induced by GAS1 (35).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	29	Previously, we showed that the region between residues 23 and 97 is necessary for apoptosis (9).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	30	 To more precisely map such a domain in the N terminus necessary for apoptosis, we have made several new mutants.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Analyses of these mutants lead to identification of a novel domain between residues 43 and 63 that can mediate apoptosis and activate cellular p53 targets.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	32	 We also found that a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 completely abolishes both the transcriptional and apoptotic activities mediated by this novel domain.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Thus, we hypothesize that a transcriptional activity located in this novel domain regulates a subset of cellular p53 targets that are responsible for apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	34	Plasmids and Mutagenesis-- Mutant p53 cDNAs were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the full-length wild-type p53 cDNA as a template.

0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Since both residues 22 and 23 are critical for p53 transcriptional activity (14), we decided to determine whether p53(1-23), which deletes the N-terminal 23 amino acids, would also be able to induce apoptosis and activate cellular p53 targets.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	81	We have previously established a cell line that expresses high levels of wild-type p53 called p53-3 (9).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	82	 This line was established using a tetracycline-regulated expression system as described previously (42).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	83	 By using similar techniques, we established nine stable cell lines that express p53(1-23).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Three representative cell lines, p53(1-23)-9, -10, and -23, are shown in Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Western blot analysis showed that these cell lines express p53(1-23) at levels comparable to wild-type p53 in p53-3 cells (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	86	 To characterize p53(1-23), we looked at its transcriptional and apoptotic activities and the growth rate of the cell line p53(1-23)-9.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The transcriptional activity was determined by monitoring the expression of the endogenous gene, p21, a well defined transcriptional target of p53 (19).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	88	 We found that p53(1-23) is still capable of activating p21, albeit to a much less degree than wild-type p53 (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Next, the growth rates of p53(1-23)-9 cells under both uninduced and induced conditions were determined, and these cells failed to multiply following p53 expression (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	90	 To exclude potential effects of the regulator tetracycline and/or the tet-vp16 transactivator (42) on cell growth, we analyzed the growth rate of the cell line H24-1, which was similarly established but did not express any protein.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The results showed that the growth rates of H24-1 cells under both the uninduced (+tet) and induced (tet) conditions were nearly identical (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	92	 1C), indicating that both tetracycline and tet-vp16 transactivator have no effect on cell growth.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	93	 It is well established that the percentage of cells containing a sub-G1 DNA content reflects the extent to which cells are undergoing apoptosis (9, 23, 31).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Since p53 can induce apoptosis in H1299 cells (9, 31), FACS analysis was used to observe the extent of apoptosis by determining the distribution of cells in each phase of the cell cycle.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The results showed that 18% of cells expressing p53(1-23) had a sub-G1 DNA content 3 days after induction of this mutant, compared with less than 5% of the same cells expressing no p53 (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Trypan blue exclusion assay showed that 15% of cells were dead, which is consistent with FACS analysis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	97	 In contrast, about 45 and 30% of cells had a sub-G1 DNA content at day 3 following expression of either wild-type p53 or transactivation-deficient p53(Gln22-Ser23), respectively (Table I).

0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	114	 To this end, we established 16 individual stable cell lines that inducibly express p53(1-42) that lacks the N-terminal 42 amino acids.

0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Since p53(1-42) lacks the previously defined activation domain and only minimally activates p21 as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	143	 2A), it appears that it can induce apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	144	 To ascertain whether p53(1-42) contains a transcriptional activity, the expression patterns of four well defined cellular p53 targets, p21, MDM2, GADD45, and BAX, were analyzed in cells expressing p53(1-42) by Northern blot analysis (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The expression levels of these genes in cells with or without p53 were quantitated by PhosphorImage scanner, and the fold increase of their relative mRNAs was calculated after normalization to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels (Table II).

0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	163	The above observations raise the following question: why does p53(Gln22-Ser23) fail to activate these well-defined p53 transcriptional targets (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	164	 4A; Table II) despite the fact that it still contains an intact activation domain II? One of the possibilities is that p53(Gln22-Ser23) might be still able to activate a subset of p53 transcriptional targets which have yet been identified.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	165	 To this end, we tested the expression patterns of several potential p53 targets identified in our laboratory.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	166	 We found that one putative p53 transcriptional target, MCG14, was activated by p53(Gln22-Ser23) to a level comparable to that by wild-type p53, p53(1-42), p53(64-91), and p53(364-393) (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	167	Since a double point mutation at residues 22 and 23 abolishes the transcriptional activity of the activation domain I (14), we looked for analogous hydrophobic amino acids within the activation domain II.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Two were found: tryptophan at residue 53 and phenylalanine at residue 54.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	169	 We therefore made identical mutations in these two amino acids in p53(Gln22-Ser23) or p53(1-42), changing tryptophan 53 to glutamine and phenylalanine 54 to serine to generate p53(Gln22-Ser23/Gln53-Ser54) and p53(1-42/Gln53-Ser54).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	170	 We then established a number of cell lines that inducibly express these mutants, and their ability to induce apoptosis and activate cellular p53 targets were similarly analyzed as above.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Three representative cell lines that express either p53(Gln22-Ser23/Gln53-Ser54) or p53(1-42/Gln53-Ser54) are shown in Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	172	 As expected, Western blot analysis showed that p21 was not activated by either of these mutants (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	173	 In addition, these mutants were unable to induce apoptosis, as demonstrated by the rate of cell growth (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	174	 5, B and D), trypan blue exclusion assay, and FACS analysis (Table I).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Furthermore, the putative cellular p53 target MCG14, which can be activated by p53(1-42) and p53(Gln22-Ser23) (Fig.

0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	177	 These results indicate that residues 53 and 54 are critical for the novel domain within residues 43-63 to induce apoptosis and activate cellular p53 targets.

0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	184	 The experiments were performed in an identical manner to those in Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	185	The p53 protein has been divided into several functional domains (1, 3, 4) as follows: (a) an activation domain which lies within residues 1-42 that has been shown to be required for both transcriptional activation and repression (11, 12, 14, 44); (b) a newly identified proline-rich domain within residues 64-91 which is necessary for efficient growth suppression (33), apoptosis (34), and for mediating GAS1-dependent growth arrest (35); (c) a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain which lies within the central, conserved portion of the protein (1, 3); (d) a nuclear localization signal which lies within residues 316-325 (1, 3); (e) a tetramerization domain which lies within residues 334-356 (1, 3); and (f) a C-terminal basic domain which binds DNA nonspecifically and regulates the sequence-specific DNA binding activity (1, 3).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	186	Here we found that within residues 43-63 lies another novel domain that is necessary for apoptosis on the basis of the following observations: (i) p53(1-42), which lacks the N-terminal 42 amino acids and the previously defined activation domain, contains a strong apoptotic activity; (ii) p53(1-63), which lacks the N-terminal 63 amino acids but contains intact PXXP motifs, has no apoptotic activity; (iii) a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 renders both p53(1-42/Gln53-Ser54) and p53(Gln22-Ser23/Gln53-Ser54) completely inert in inducing apoptosis; and (iv) codon 53 is one of the frequently mutated sites outside the DNA binding domain in the p53 gene in human tumors (45), which underscores the importance of the apoptotic function within residues 43-63 in p53 tumor suppression.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	187	How does this novel domain mediate an apoptotic activity? Previously, it was shown that p53(Gln22-Ser23), which cannot activate several cellular p53 targets (9, 14, 22, 31, 43), is still capable of inducing apoptosis (9, 31, 34), and a p53 mutant, which lacks the proline-rich region, is capable of activating several p53 targets (33, 34) but cannot induce apoptosis (33, 34).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	188	 These results lead to a hypothesis that p53 has both transcription-dependent and -independent functions in apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	189	 However, it is well established that p53 mutants that are defective in sequence-specific DNA binding activity are also inert in inducing apoptosis (1, 3, 4), suggesting that p53 sequence-specific DNA binding activity and possibly its sequence-specific transcriptional activity are required for inducing apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Here we found that p53(1-42), which lacks the entire previously defined activation domain I, not only induces apoptosis, but also activates the MDM2, BAX, and GADD45 genes through its activation domain II located between residues 43 and 63 (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Since p53(Gln22-Ser23) contains an intact activation domain II, we hypothesized that it might still contain transcriptional activity.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Indeed, we found that p53(Gln22-Ser23) can activate one of the putative p53 targets, MCG14.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Furthermore, a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 completely abolishes the ability of both p53(Gln22-Ser23/Gln53-Ser54) and p53(1-42/Gln53-Ser54) to activate MCG14 and induce apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Consistent with our results, Candau et al.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	195	 (46) recently showed that within residues 40-83 lies a sub-activation domain, which can activate a reporter gene under control of a promoter with a p53-responsive element when p53 is cotransfected, and a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 also abolished the transcriptional activity of the sub-activation domain.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	196	 These results suggest that p53 has two independent activation domains.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	197	 A second activation domain within a transcription factor is not without precedent.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Herpes simplex virus protein VP16 also contains two independent activation domains (47).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Thus, it appears that in response to various stress conditions and their subsequent modifications, the two independent activation domains might serve as an intrinsic factor of p53 that determines whether a given p53 target is activated.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Although BAX, MDM2, and GADD45 are the activation domain II-regulated gene products, these cellular p53 targets might not mediate the p53-dependent apoptosis on the basis of two observations: (i) these genes were not activated by p53(Gln22-Ser23) which is competent in inducing apoptosis (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	201	 4A; Table II); (ii) these genes were activated by p53(62-91) which is defective in inducing apoptosis (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Since cell type has been shown to influence the cellular response (cell cycle arrest or apoptosis) to p53 (1, 4, 8), cellular genetic background might then determine the modification of the two activation domains.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Therefore, the results obtained in H1299 cells need to be confirmed in other cell types.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	204	It is intriguing that although p53(Gln22-Ser23) contains an intact activation domain II, it fails to activate BAX, GADD45, and MDM2 (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Since both p53(1-23) and p53(1-42) can activate these p53 targets, it suggests that the presence of the first 23 amino acids may mask the ability of the activation domain II in p53(Gln22-Ser23) to activate these cellular p53 targets.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Alternatively, it is also possible that when the activation domain I is inactivated by a double point mutation at residues 22 and 23, the N-terminal 42 residues might then inhibit or block interaction of a co-activator (or an adaptor) with the activation domain II that is required for activation of some p53 targets, such as MDM2, p21, BAX, and GADD45, but not for activation of other p53 targets, such as MCG14.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	207	 It is important to note that although the activation domain I is primarily responsible for activation of p21, the level of p21 in cells expressing either p53(1-23) and p53(1-42) was slightly increased upon p53 induction (Figs.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	208	 1A and 2A), suggesting that the activation domain II can weakly activate p21.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Furthermore, our preliminary studies showed that activation of p21 was compromised by a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 when p53(Gln53-Ser54) was expressed at a low to intermediate level,3 consistent with the idea that the activation domain II contributes to the activation of p21.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Since several clones that express various expression levels of the target genes are required for determining the function of the targets (48), these results remain to be confirmed.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	211	Previously, it was shown that overexpression of p21 can protect human colorectal carcinoma RKO cells from prostaglandin A2-mediated apoptosis (49).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Lack of p21 expression due to homologous deletion of the p21 gene also renders HCT116 colorectal cancer cells susceptible to apoptosis following treatment with either -radiation or chemotherapeutic agents (50).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	213	 In addition, a significant fraction of tumors in mice deriving from p21/ HCT116 cancer cells were completely cured, and all tumors deriving from p21+/+ cancer cells underwent regrowth after treatment with -radiation (50).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	214	 It is interesting to note that p53(Gln22-Ser23) and p53(1-42), both of which lack a functional activation domain I, cannot significantly activate p21 (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	215	 2 and 4; Table II) but can induce apoptosis (Table I).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The strong apoptotic activity conferred by p53(1-42) might be due to its failure of activating p21.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Thus, we have generated a mutant, p53(1-42), that might be better than wild-type p53 in the elimination of cancer cells and therefore a potential candidate for gene therapy.

0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	3	Many chemotherapeutic drugs, including Vp16 and mitomycin C, induce cells to undergo apoptosis through damage of nuclear DNA.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The activation of wild type p53, a major tumor suppressor protein, which is implicated in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and apoptosis (1-3), has been reported to be involved in the process of apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents (3, 4).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The increase in p53 levels after DNA damage results in large part from stabilization of the p53 protein against degradation, and accumulation of p53 occurs because of this increased protein stability in the presence of ongoing translation (4).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Acute overexpression of wild type p53 mediated by adenovirus facilitates the ability of DNA-damaging drugs to induce death of cancer and normal cells (5).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	7	 As a transcription factor, p53 protein enhances the transcription rate of several genes including p21WAF1, GADD45, and 14-3-3, which are genes involved in cell cycle arrest (6-8), and Bax, CD95, Noxa, PUMA, and p53AIP1, which are related to p53-dependent apoptosis (9-13).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	8	Studies in a variety of cell types have suggested that ROS formation may be directly related to the ability of DNA-damaging agents to induce apoptosis (14).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Other studies indicate that ROS are downstream mediators of p53-dependent apoptosis (15, 16).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	10	 p53 acts to regulate the intracellular redox state and induces apoptosis by a pathway that is dependent on ROS production (17).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	11	 p53 results in apoptosis through a multi-step process, including the transcriptional induction of redox-related genes, the generation of ROS, and the oxidative degradation of mitochondrial components, leading to apoptosis (15).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	12	 There is also evidence that ROS could regulate apoptosis as a signal transmitter or mediator (16, 18, 19).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, other studies indicate that apoptosis can be induced in the absence of any detectable oxidative stress when cells are treated with VP-16 and cisplatin (20), and oxidative stress can inhibit apoptosis in human lymphoma cells (21).

0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	236	 p53 gene status modulates the chemosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	237	 DNA damage induced by the DNA-damaging agents Vp16 or mitomycin C activates p53 mainly through protein modification events such as phosphorylation, which results in p53 protein stabilization and accumulation of p53 protein due to the decrease of its degradation (4) (Fig.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	238	 HepG2 cells transfected with a mutant p53 expression vector (HepG2-mtp53), which encodes a mutant p53 protein, decreasing wild type p53 function, are more resistant to Vp16-induced apoptosis than HepG2 cells transfected with empty vector (HepG2-neo) (Fig.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	239	 This indicates that apoptosis induced by Vp16 in HepG2 cells is p53-dependent.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	240	 HepG2 cells overexpressing catalase as mediated by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer (Ad-Cat) show a lower level of basal or induced p53 protein than control (Ad-LacZ) cells.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Lowering of p53 levels is likely to be the mechanism whereby catalase overexpression protects HepG2 cells from apoptosis induced by the DNA-damaging agents, whereas the latter induce apoptosis by elevating p53 levels.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	242	 There are no differences in p53 mRNA levels between catalase-overexpressing cells and control cells with or without treatment by DNA-damaging agents, and the p53 mRNA level did not change after treatment with Vp16 even though p53 protein levels were strongly increased.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Thus, the decrease in p53 protein levels by catalase overexpression or the increase in p53 levels by treatment with Vp16 is due to posttranscriptional effects.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	244	 P21 is a downstream gene target of p53 and is regulated by p53 (27).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	245	 HepG2 cells overexpressing catalase also display a lower level of p21 protein than control cells either in the absence or presence of treatment with DNA-damaging agents.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Lower levels of p21 protein in the presence of catalase may reflect the lower levels of p53 protein in the presence of catalase.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The results of synthesis experiments indicate that overexpression of catalase does not change the rate of p53 protein synthesis; however, pulse-chase experiments did reveal that p53 protein degradation was increased in cells infected with Ad-Cat compared with cells infected with Ad-LacZ.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	248	By adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, Johnson et al.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	249	 (17) find that cells sensitive to p53-mediated apoptosis produced ROS concomitantly with p53 overexpression, whereas cells resistant to p53 failed to produce ROS.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	250	 In sensitive cells, both ROS production and apoptosis were inhibited by antioxidant treatment.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	251	 These results suggest that p53 acts to regulate the intracellular redox state and induces apoptosis by a pathway that is dependent on ROS production (17).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	252	 In our experiments, removing H2O2 by expression of catalase causes the p53 protein level to decrease, and this is associated with resistance to apoptosis induced by Vp16 or mitomycin C.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	253	 This suggests that, at least in HepG2 cells, H2O2 regulates apoptosis by modulating p53 levels, and H2O2 acts upstream of p53.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	254	As a result of a high turnover rate, the p53 protein has a half-life of ~30-60 min and is maintained at low levels in normal proliferating cells (28).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In response to genotoxic stress or oncogenic signaling, p53 levels rapidly increase, mainly through protein stabilization.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	256	 An important regulator of the p53 level is MDM2, which possesses intrinsic E3 ligase activity and, thus, promotes p53 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via proteasome-mediated proteolysis (29).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Overexpression of catalase did increase p53 protein degradation, and the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and MG115 but not the calpain inhibitor calpeptin could partially block the p53 protein lowering caused by overexpression of catalase.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	258	 This is consistent with the overall mechanism that catalase lowers p53 levels by accelerating p53 degradation.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	259	How overexpression of catalase specifically down-regulates p53 protein or enhances p53 turnover is not clear.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Because H2O2 is a specific substrate of catalase, catalase down-regulation of p53 protein would appear to involve some function or action of H2O2.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	261	 One hypothesis is the H2O2 may increase the level of phosphorylated p53 by stimulating certain protein kinases implicated in the phosphorylation of p53 or by inhibiting the activity of protein phosphatases that convert pp53 to the less stable nonphosphorylated state.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Once p53 protein is phosphorylated, its half-life is increased, which causes p53 accumulation (30).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	263	 If ROS indeed modulate the actions of p53 kinases or p53 phosphatases, overexpression of catalase may decrease p53 accumulation by removing ROS such as H2O2.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Using a specific antibody for detecting phosphorylated p53 on serine 20, we found that overexpression of catalase did prevent phosphorylation of p53 induced by Vp16, and low levels of pp53 were associated with low levels of total p53.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	265	 However, the general phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, did not prevent the effect of catalase on down-regulation of p53 or pp53.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	266	 This suggests that catalase may inhibit activity of p53 kinases, which may be activated by H2O2.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Recent studies indicate that ROS such as H2O2-induced phosphorylation of p53 can be mediated in part by polo-like kinase-3 (30).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Further studies will be necessary on the effects of ROS and of catalase on the activities of protein kinases implicated in phosphorylation of p53 and on protein phosphatases implicated in the dephosphorylation of pp53.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Chromium and vanadate metals that can cause oxidative stress are believed to modulate p53 through H2O2 (31, 32).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	270	 H2O2 may also cause certain modifications of the p53 protein structure, e.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	271	 thiol oxidation, such that the protein is not an effective substrate for proteolysis.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Such putative, stabilizing modifications would be prevented by rapid removal of H2O2 by catalase.

0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	4	In response to stress, the p53-MDM2 interaction must be disrupted to enable p53 to associate with factors needed for activation of its target genes.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Stress-induced p53 activation involves post-translational modification of p53 on multiple sites by phosphorylation, acetylation, and sumoylation (2, 5) and modifications to MDM2 that can enhance MDM2 autoubiquitination and degradation (6).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	6	 With regard to p53 modifications, phosphorylation has been studied most intensively and has been proposed to play a critical role in the stabilization and activation of the tumor suppressor.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	7	 These studies have been greatly facilitated by the availability of antibodies that recognize p53 modified on specific phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues (for review, see Ref.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Multiple serine (6, 9, 15, 20, 33, 37, 46, 315, 371, 376, 378, and 392) and three threonine residues (18, 55, and 81) have been reported to undergo phosphorylation in response to diverse stresses.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Multiple serine/threonine kinases have been implicated in the upstream signaling leading to p53 phosphorylation (ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Chk1, Chk2, CK1, p38, CDK2, PKC, JNK), but the precise mechanism of this signaling and its regulation are not well understood (8, 9).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Residues from the N-terminal MDM2 binding domain of p53 (Ser20 and Thr18) have been shown to play a critical role in the interaction between the two proteins and their stress-induced phosphorylation decreases substantially the affinity between p53 and MDM2 when analyzed in vitro using peptide substrates (10 to 12).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These and other studies (7, 13) have led to the conclusion that phosphorylation of p53 is a key mechanism responsible for activation of the tumor suppressor in response to cellular stress.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	12	In addition to its proposed role in abrogation of p53-MDM2 binding and stabilization of the protein, p53 phosphorylation has also been implicated in regulation of its activity.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, this aspect of p53 phosphorylation is still poorly understood and controversial.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Transcriptional activity of p53 is of principal importance for its function as a tumor suppressor.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	15	 It has been suggested that phosphorylation at specific residues can affect the transcriptional activity of p53 and/or its selectivity toward different subset of genes thus determining the specific type of cellular response to stress (5, 8).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Activity of p53 as a transcription factor may be influenced by several factors: (a) ability to form active tetramers, (b) sequence-specific DNA binding, and (c) interaction with other components of the transcriptional machinery.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	17	 It has been reported that Ser315 and Ser392 phosphorylation may regulate the oligomerization of p53 and thus its sequence-specific DNA binding (14 to 16).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Ser15 phosphorylation has been shown to enhance the interaction of p53 with transcriptional co-activators CBP and PCAF (10, 17 to 19).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Stress-induced phosphorylation of Ser46 has been implicated in the activation of p53-dependent apoptotic response (20, 21).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Recently, prolyl isomerase Pin1 has been reported to bind p53 and enhance its DNA binding and transcriptional activity.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This binding is dependent on DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of p53 (22, 23).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Taken together, these observations suggest that p53 phosphorylation may play an important role not only in stabilization of p53 but also in modulation of its transcriptional activity.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	23	 On the other hand, experiments in which almost all phosphorylation sites in p53 have been mutated demonstrated that transiently expressed phosphorylated and unphosphorylated p53 do not differ significantly in their stability or ability to transactivate reporter genes in p53-null cells (24).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Furthermore, studies using mouse mutants with substitutions of Ser15 or Ser20 suggest that these residues are not essential for p53 activation (25 to 27).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	25	Recently, we reported the identification of the first potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of p53-MDM2 interaction, the nutlins (28).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These compounds bind MDM2 in the p53 binding pocket with high selectivity and can release p53 from negative control leading to effective stabilization of p53 and activation of the p53 pathway in vitro and in vivo.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Nutlins are non-genotoxic and activate p53 by preventing it from binding to MDM2 (28).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	28	 They do not bind to p53 protein and do not interfere with its activities.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Treatment of cultured cells with MDM2 antagonists cause accumulation of p53 protein that is free of phosphorylation on Ser15 (28).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Therefore, nutlins may represent valuable molecular tools for studying the role of p53 phosphorylation in its natural cellular context.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Here, we show that p53 induced by the MDM2 antagonist, nutlin-3, is not phosphorylated on six key serine residues.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Despite the lack of detectable phosphorylation, nutlin-induced p53 showed equal or better sequence-specific DNA binding, ability to transactivate p53 target genes, and p53-dependent apoptotic activity than phosphorylated p53 induced by the genotoxic drugs doxorubicin and etoposide.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Our results provide further support to the notion that separating MDM2 from p53 is an important step in p53 activation, but phosphorylation is not required for execution of p53 biological functions.

0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	68	 This observation is consistent with the notion that MDM2 antagonists are non-genotoxic and should not activate the damage-responsive kinases that trigger p53 phosphorylation.

0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	181	 The fact that nutlin-induced p53 is not phosphorylated on six highly conserved phosphorylation sites makes it unlikely that other potential sites could be phosphorylated by MDM2 antagonists.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that p53 stabilized by nutlin-3 is free of phosphorylation and perhaps from other post-translational modifications.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	183	Nutlin-induced p53 in HCT116 and RKO cells showed comparable binding activity to its consensus DNA sequence indicating an equivalent transactivation potential (Fig.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	184	 However, transactivation properties depend on multiple factors and are best measured on native p53-regulated genes in vivo.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	185	 To this end, we examined the activation of three different p53 target genes by quantitative PCR.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	186	 All three have been reported as immediate downstream genes directly regulated by p53.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	187	 This test revealed that unphosphorylated nutlin-induced p53 had equal or superior activity (Fig.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Together with the previous result, this experiment confirmed that the phosphorylation status does not confer to p53 higher transactivation potency.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	189	 On the contrary, it appears that unphosphorylated p53 is an equivalent or possibly better activator of all three genes in both cell lines.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Only MIC-1 is activated slightly higher by doxorubicin in RKO cells.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	191	Although we did not see effects of p53 phosphorylation on the transcriptional activity of p53 on three genes in two cell lines, we cannot exclude the possibility that differences might be detected in the large constellation of p53 regulated genes or under specific conditions in specific tissues or cell lines.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	192	 However, the results from a recent study published during the preparation of our manuscript render this possibility unlikely.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	193	 (42) have used isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside-induced p14ARF as a means to sequester MDM2 and stabilize p53 in the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	194	 ARF-induced p53 has been found phosphorylation-free on five N-terminal serine residues (Ser6, Ser9, Ser15, Ser20, and Ser37) but still phosphorylated on the C-terminal Ser392.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Comparison of the global gene expression activated by this partially phosphorylated p53 with fully phosphorylated doxorubicin-induced p53 by DNA array analysis revealed that most genes are up-regulated similarly.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	196	 These authors concluded that N-terminal phosphorylation is not required for transcriptional activation of most p53 target genes.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The data from this and our study derived by different tools in different cell systems support the conclusion that p53 phosphorylation is dispensable for transcriptional activation of p53-regulated genes in vivo.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	198	It has been established that p53 functions primarily as a transcription factor that regulates multiple genes involved in regulation of cell growth and homeostasis.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	199	 However, transcription-independent p53 functions have also been reported to mediate apoptosis under some experimental conditions (36, 37).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	200	 p53 can bind directly to mitochondrial proteins and induce apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner (43).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Apoptotic activity of p53 is the most complex and least understood of its functions.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	202	 There are multiple and frequently overlapping apoptotic pathways downstream of p53, and studying one or several of them may not be of significant value.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Fortunately, all apoptotic pathways converge at the point of irreversible commitment to apoptosis.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	204	 This can be quantified by measuring an established apoptotic marker such as annexin V reactivity.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Treatment of HCT116 and RKO cells with the active enantiomer of nutlin-3 for 48 h induced apoptosis in a substantial fraction of the cell population that is p53-dependent, since the inactive enantiomer did not contribute to apoptosis (Fig.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The apoptotic fraction in etoposide-treated cells was slightly higher, while doxorubicin induced massive apoptosis (90%) in both cell lines.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	207	 We found that a significant fraction of the apoptosis induced at high doses was p53-independent by comparing the apoptotic fractions in isogenic variants containing (RKO) and lacking (RKO-R) a functional p53 pathway (Fig.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	208	 If the apoptotic activity of doxorubicin and etoposide in RKO-R cells is subtracted from their activity in the parental RKO cell line, the residual activity should represent the p53-dependent component of the apoptotic activity of both drugs.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The maximal residual (p53-dependent) activity for both doxorubicin and etoposide is equal or lower than the activity of nutlin-3a.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	210	 This result suggests that the p53-dependent apoptotic activity of nutlin-induced unphosphorylated p53 is equal or better than the activity of phosphorylated p53 induced by doxorubicin or etoposide.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	211	 However, one needs to acknowledge that such normalization for p53-independent activity could only be used as an approximation, since both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms may utilize the same apoptotic pathways.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Despite the possible inaccuracy, to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to reveal differences in the apoptotic activity of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated p53.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Further studies, however, are needed to assess the possible effect of phosphorylation on transcription-independent apoptotic activity of p53.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	214	Comparison of the activities of p53 phosphorylated on six key serine residues in response to genotoxic insult with unphosphorylated p53 induced by MDM2 antagonists revealed that phosphorylation status of p53 does not affect the main functions of the tumor suppressor.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Unphosphorylated p53 is indistinguishable from phosphorylated p53 by its ability to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and activate transcription of target genes and apoptosis in vivo.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	216	 This study confirms and extends previous observations (24, 42) using an experimental system that allows assessing p53 function in its natural cellular context and reinforces the notion that phosphorylation is dispensable for activation of p53 as a transcription factor.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	217	 The data also demonstrate the importance of separating MDM2 from p53 as a key requirement for p53 activation.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	218	 They raise the question of how this is achieved in vivo in light of studies showing that p53 mutants that cannot be phosphorylated can nonetheless be activated equivalently to wild-type p53 (24).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Recent studies imply that a key event may actually be the damage-induced phosphorylation of MDM2 itself, which triggers the preferential degradation of MDM2.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	220	 This provides an effective and rapid means for removing MDM2 from p53 in vivo and for enabling p53 to engage the transcriptional apparatus for target gene induction (6).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	221	The possibility still remains that phosphorylation of p53 may affect p53 activity independent of transcription (e.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	222	 in p53-dependent apoptotic pathways).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	223	 However, previously published data from our laboratory does not support this possibility.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Treatment of the SJSA-1 osteosarcoma cell line with 10  microM nutlin-3a leads to massive apoptotic death (28) comparable with that in doxorubicin-treated RKO cells (Fig.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	225	 This higher responsiveness to MDM2 antagonists is most likely due to the fact that mdm2 gene amplification in SJSA-1 cells is the only defect in the p53 pathway, while cell lines with normal MDM2 level (e.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	226	 HCT116 and RKO) are likely to have defects in the p53-dependent apoptotic pathways.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	227	The conclusion that p53 phosphorylation is not essential for execution of its major functions in the p53 pathway has one important implication for cancer therapy.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	228	 We have shown that MDM2 antagonists can stabilize p53 and inhibit tumor growth in mouse xenografts models of human cancer (28).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	229	 However, these drugs are non-genotoxic and do not cause phosphorylation of p53.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	230	 If p53 phosphorylation is important for modulation of its transcriptional activity then the effectiveness of MDM2 antagonists may be limited.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Our data support the utility of MDM2 antagonists as single therapeutic agents in treating tumors with wild-type p53 that have retained intact signaling downstream of p53.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	4	The p53 tumor suppressor is an important regulator of cellular response to stress, abnormal cell proliferation, and DNA damage.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In normal cells, p53 is maintained at a very low level because of rapid degradation through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway (1).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In response to different stress stimuli including ionizing radiation, UV, and hypoxia, p53 is activated and stabilized as a transcription factor.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Activated p53 induces the expression of p21WAF1, gadd45, bax, p53AIP, PUMA, and others, which in turn induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (2).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	8	The level of p53 in cells is mainly regulated at the post-transcriptional level by the MDM21 oncoprotein.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	9	 MDM2 binds to p53 and promotes its ubiquitination by acting as a ubiquitin E3 ligase (3-5).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Expression of MDM2 is activated by p53 at the transcription level (6, 7), forming a negative feedback loop to maintain p53 at low levels.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	11	 To date, most stress signals that activate p53 are known to interfere with the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 degradation by phosphorylation of p53, induction of the MDM2 inhibitor ARF, or inhibition of MDM2 expression (1, 2).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Phosphorylation of MDM2 by ATM may also play a role in p53 activation after DNA damage (8).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The MDM2-binding domain in the N terminus of p53 contains several phosphorylation sites (9, 10).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Recent studies (11, 12) suggest that after DNA damage, the phosphorylation of Ser-15 by the ATM kinase and Ser-20 by human Chk2 plays important roles in p53 stabilization by interfering with MDM2 binding.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	15	Previous reports (13-17) show that heat shock (1 h at 43  degrees C) also induces p53 accumulation in wild type p53 cell lines and contributes to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Heat shock is clinically useful in facilitating the treatment of certain tumors such as gliomas in combination with chemotherapy or ionizing radiation (18-20).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Therefore, investigating the mechanism of p53 accumulation after heat shock is important in understanding p53 response to a physiologically relevant stress.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	18	 A previous study (22) suggests that p53 accumulation in response to heat is not the result of a general stress-induced increase in protein synthesis, because heat causes a reduction in overall cellular protein synthesis.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Heat shock has been reported to induce DNA damage (21), suggesting that it may stabilize and activate p53 in part through the DNA damage response pathways.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	20	 A recent study shows (15) an increase in p53 mRNA level after heat treatment of A-172 glioma cells, suggesting a mechanism of induction at the transcriptional level.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	21	Stabilization of p53 also occurs in tumor cells with mutated p53, which result in an accumulation to high levels.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Missense mutations of p53 in the DNA-binding core domain cause conformational change and stable association with molecular chaperones such as hsp70 and hsp90 (23, 24).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	23	 hsp90 binding has been shown to contribute to the accumulation of mutant p53 and many other client proteins (25-27).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Our recent studies show (28, 29) that binding of hsp90 inhibits the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in the stabilization of both mutant p53 and MDM2.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	25	 hsp90 appears to inactivate MDM2 by blocking the central domain of MDM2 normally involved in regulation by ARF, thereby mimicking the effect of ARF to prevent mutant p53 degradation (29).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	26	Although the role of hsp90 in mutant p53 stabilization is well established, there is no evidence to date that it contributes to the stabilization of wild type p53 during stress.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Molecular chaperones only associate with certain proteins in a transient manner during folding or during heat shock response.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Wild type p53 does not form stable complex with hsp90 in normal growth conditions.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Because DNA damage does not induce p53 conformational change, hsp90 is unlikely to play a role in DNA damage response.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, p53 is a structurally unstable protein and undergoes conformational change (denaturation) at temperatures above 40  degrees C in vitro (30).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	31	 (31) also indicates that heat shock alters the conformation of wild type p53, allowing the formation of the p53 hsc70 complex.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Therefore, it is possible that hsp90 binding also interacts with wild type p53 after heat shock and plays a role in stabilizing p53 through mechanisms similar to the stabilization of mutant p53.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The results showed that p53 mRNA level in A-172 and MCF-7 cells did not change after heat shock (Fig.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Therefore, increased p53 protein expression was not attributed to increase in transcription.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	84	 To test whether p53 was stabilized after heat shock, A-172 cells were treated with heat shock and the proteasome inhibitor MG132.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	85	 The magnitude of p53 accumulation after MG132 treatment provided an indication of how rapidly p53 was degraded by ubiquitin-dependent proteasomes.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The result showed that in control cells, a 4-h treatment with MG132 caused a significant increase in p53 level.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	96	Because p53 turnover is regulated by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, we examined the level of p53 ubiquitination by direct lysis in SDS sample buffer, which preserved polyubiquitinated forms of p53.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Western blot of such lysate showed that the high molecular weight bands of ubiquitinated p53 were significantly reduced immediately after heat shock (Fig.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	98	 There was significant recovery of p53 ubiquitination at 4 h after heat shock, which may be because of high level MDM2 expression at this time point and the start of a recovery process (Fig.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Therefore, the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 ubiquitination was inhibited after heat shock, consistent with the increase in p53 stability.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	125	Similar to A-172 cells, heat shock also caused over 3-fold induction of p53 protein level in normal lymphocytes.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Although Ser-15 phosphorylation level did not change in ATM-deficient lymphocytes after heat shock, p53 level was still moderately increased ( < 3-fold) (Fig.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Therefore, phosphorylation of Ser-15 by ATM contributed to but was not absolutely required for p53 accumulation after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	128	 This result also suggested that additional mechanisms contribute to p53 stabilization after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	129	p53 Conformational Change after Heat Shock-- To test the hypothesis that heat shock caused wild type p53 conformational change, p53 was precipitated by mutant-specific Pab240 and wild type-specific Pab1620 antibodies (35).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Pab240 recognizes hydrophobic peptide sequences of p53 normally packed inside the DNA-binding core domain (36); therefore, the exposure of the Pab240 epitope is indicative of misfolded p53.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The result showed that in control A-172 cells, p53 could be precipitated efficiently by Pab1620 but weakly by Pab240 (Fig.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Conversely, heat shock significantly increased reaction with Pab240 when the cells were harvested 2 h after heat shock treatment (Fig.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	133	 5A), although a significant fraction of p53 also retained Pab1620 reactivity.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	134	 At 4 h after heat shock, which was the highest point of p53 accumulation, p53 reactivity to Pab1620 increased strongly and Pab240 reactivity reduced significantly.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Therefore, there was rapid recovery of p53 conformation back to the wild type status after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	136	 The result also showed that change of p53 conformation correlated with the level of p53 ubiquitination (Fig.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Disruption of hsp90 mutant p53 binding leads to destabilization of p53 through ubiquitin-dependent proteasomes (25, 27, 29, 37).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Because heat shock induced significant conformational change in wild type p53, we asked whether hsp90 also regulates wild type p53 stability by binding to p53 and preventing its degradation by MDM2.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	147	To test the binding between hsp90 and p53, conformation-independent Pab1801 antibody was used to precipitate p53 from cell lysate harvested 2 and 4 h after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Coprecipitated hsp90 was detected by Western blot of the p53 precipitate using hsp90-specific antibody.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	149	 The results showed that hsp90 did not coprecipitate with wild type p53 in the control A-172 cultures without heat shock treatment (Fig.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	150	 However, significant amounts of hsp90 coprecipitated with the mutant p53 protein in DLD-1 cells at 37  degrees C and also with wild type p53 in the heat-treated A-172 cells (Fig.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The binding between p53 and hsp90 was stronger at 2 h after heat shock than 4 h, because more p53 was present in the 4-h lysate yet the amount of hsp90 coprecipitated did not increase (Fig.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	152	 This was consistent with the significant recovery of wild type p53 conformation and ubiquitination level observed at this time point.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Therefore, heat shock induced transient association between wild type p53 and hsp90.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	156	 A-172, NC-607, and AT-29 cells were treated with heat shock in the presence or absence of the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The level of p53 was measured by Western blot 4 h after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The results showed that without heat shock, geldanamycin treatment did not significantly affect p53 level.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	159	 However, geldanamycin prevented the accumulation of p53 after heat shock in ATM-deficient AT-29 cells (Fig.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	168	The results described above show that short term exposure to elevated temperature causes accumulation and activation of wild type p53.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Increased p53 expression level is not because of induction of p53 transcription, because its mRNA level does not change after heat stress.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Similar to other forms of p53 stress response, reduced ubiquitination and degradation appears to be the major cause of its accumulation after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The stabilized p53 is functional in inducing expression of downstream target genes and has been shown to contribute to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis response after heat shock (13, 15).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Therefore, p53 activation after heat shock is a functionally relevant response to environmental stress.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	173	Ubiquitination and degradation of p53 is mainly regulated by MDM2.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Many p53 responses to environmental or cellular stresses cause p53 stabilization by interfering with MDM2 function.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Phosphorylation of p53 and MDM2, inhibition of MDM2 expression, and inactivation of MDM2 by expression of ARF have all been implicated in wild type p53 accumulation (1, 38).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Furthermore, stabilization of mutant p53 involves binding to molecular chaperones hsp90 (25, 27, 37).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	177	 hsp90-mutant p53 complex is resistant to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, because MDM2 bound to p53 in such a complex is inactivated by hsp90 (29).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	178	 hsp90 appears to conceal the ARF binding site on MDM2 in hsp90 p53 MDM2 complexes and prevent MDM2 from ubiquitinating p53 and itself.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	179	 As a result, both MDM2 and mutant p53 become stabilized in tumor cells expressing mutant p53 (28).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	180	 We previously showed that dissociation of hsp90 by geldanamycin treatment restores the ubiquitination and degradation of mutant p53 (29).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Therefore, hsp90-mutant p53 complex also causes p53 stabilization by interfering with MDM2 activity.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	182	Molecular chaperones such as hsp70 and hsp90 recognize exposed hydrophobic regions in misfolded proteins, nascent polypeptides, and ligand binding sites of steroid hormone receptors (26, 39).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Wild type p53 is a structurally unstable protein and readily undergoes conformational change above 40  degrees C in vitro (30).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Point mutations in the DNA-binding domain disrupt proper folding and cause structural change at physiological temperatures.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Different mutations lead to different temperature sensitivities; some mutations (such as the Val-138) remain functional and conformationally wild type at 32  degrees C and lose activity at 39  degrees C (40).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Many hot spot mutations found in human tumors cause significant conformational changes and complete loss of activity at physiological temperature (41).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Therefore, it is conceivable that heat shock also causes transient conformational change of wild type p53 similar to the misfolding caused by structural mutations, resulting in binding by hsp90.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	188	We suggest that heat shock causes a transient misfolding of wild type p53, which attracts binding by hsp90.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	189	 hsp90 binding would prevent p53 aggregation and facilitate the refolding process.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	190	 However, hsp90 binding would also prevent MDM2-mediated degradation in a manner similar to stabilization of mutant p53 by hsp90 at 37  degrees C.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Unlike mutant p53, which cannot fold properly even in the presence of molecular chaperones, heat-denatured wild type p53 can be efficiently refolded by chaperones at 37  degrees C.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Therefore, the conformational change after heat shock is transient, and p53 level begins to decrease several hours after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	193	 This correlates with return of normal p53 ubiquitination level.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	194	However, hsp90 appears not to be the only regulator of p53 stabilization after heat shock, because the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin did not cause a complete block in p53 accumulation in ATM wild type cell lines.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	195	 We found that heat shock also induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and Ser-20, which are sites important for regulating the stability and transcription activity of p53 (1).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Phosphorylation of Ser-15 and Ser-20 is dependent on ATM kinase activity and ATM-mediated activation of human Chk2 kinase, suggesting that heat shock can activate the ATM kinase and induce p53 accumulation in part through phosphorylation.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	197	 A previous study (21) shows that heat shock causes low levels of DNA damage.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Our results also showed that heat shock only induced phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 and Ser-20, whereas the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin induced stronger phosphorylation of Ser-15 and Ser-20 as well as an additional phosphorylation at Ser-46.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	199	 This is consistent with the requirement of severe DNA damage for inducing Ser-46 phosphorylation (42).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Therefore, heat shock may activate ATM through inducing low level of DNA damage, which in turn activates p53 by phosphorylation of p53 or MDM2 (8).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	201	 DNA damage-mediated dephosphorylation of MDM2-acidic domain may also play a role in stabilization of p53 (43).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	202	 During the course or our study, Miyakoda et al.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	203	 (17) also reported that phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 occurs after heat shock in an ATM-dependent fashion, which is consistent with our finding.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	5	Received as resubmission 28 April, 2003; Accepted 20 May, 2003.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	6	Although as mentioned above p53 protein embodies the classical features of a sequence-specific transcriptional activator, it has one property that is rather unique, which is that it possesses a second essentially autonomous DNA binding region at its extreme C-terminus (9).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This region of the protein has been shown to facilitate and be required for the interaction of p53 with various forms of damaged or altered DNA including deletion/insertion mismatches, DNA ends, as well as double- and single-strand breaks (for a review, see 10).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The function of this region is not fully clarified and it has also been shown to be able to regulate the mode by which the central region recognizes DNA (for a review, see 11).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	9	Although p53 is clearly involved in regulating the transcription of numerous targets, there are several lines of evidence suggesting that p53 may play transcription- independent roles in cells as well.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Some mutant p53 proteins that have lost transcriptional transactivation capacity retain their ability to arrest cell growth to varying extents (12 to 16).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Conversely, loss of growth suppressor function has been reported in some p53 mutants, which retain transcriptional activity (17 to 19).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	12	 (20) showed that when cells are treated with the DNA-damaging drug camptothecin, p53 accumulation rather than the transactivation of p21 is required for the G1 arrest, strongly suggesting that p53 may play transcription-independent role(s) in cells.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In fact it is possible that under some conditions p53 may play a direct role in regulating DNA synthesis.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Various experimental results suggest that p53 protein may inhibit DNA replication in a transcription-independent manner.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The C-terminally truncated form of p53 protein, p53C30, which is also the DNA binding active form of p53 protein, was reported to inhibit Xenopus nuclear DNA replication in a transcription-independent manner (21).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	16	 p53 may inhibit the initiation of DNA replication directly by binding to RP-A (22 to 24), which is a single-stranded DNA binding protein required for DNA replication.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	17	 p53 protein also blocks the replication of SV40 DNA in vitro by binding to and inactivating the SV40 large T antigen (25 to 27).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Additionally, although p53 protein does not bind to or inhibit polyoma large T antigen, it is also able to inhibit the replication of polyomavirus origin-containing DNA (Py ori-DNA) in vitro although in this case it is necessary for p53-specific binding sites to be present in the template origin-containing plasmid (28).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	19	There have also been reports supporting the possibility of role(s) for p53 in regulating and responding to altered DNA replication in vivo.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	20	 When DNA synthesis is blocked, p53 inhibits entry into mitosis (29), and in several cell lines p53 is transcriptionally dysfunctional when DNA synthesis is blocked (30).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	21	 p53 protein prevents mammalian DNA reduplication, following the release from the mitotic spindle checkpoint, in a transcription-independent manner (13).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In addition, p53 inhibits the replication of Py and papillomavirus origin-containing DNAs in a cell-specific way: p53 represses replication of both viral origins in human and Chinese hamster cells, but fails to do so in mouse cells (31 to 33).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Further evidence supporting the possibility for a direct interaction between p53 and the DNA replication machinery is provided by the observations that p53 is localized to foci of replication in the nuclei of herpes virus-infected cells (34) and that p53 is imported into the nucleus of Xenopus oocyte upon fertilization, although the first 12 rapid cell cycles occur without transcription of the genome (35).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	24	To continue to explore possible alternative roles and functions of p53, in this study we tested the possibility that p53 affects the replication of damaged DNA templates.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	25	 We found that p53 can block the initial stage of replication of a -irradiated plasmid containing the Py replication origin.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Such inhibition requires both specific binding by the p53 core domain and non-specific binding by its C-terminus.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	27	 We discuss the implications of our findings including the likelihood that the effects seen require DNA looping by p53.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	28	Proteins Baculovirus-expressed HA-tagged p53 protein was purified as described (38).

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	53	  It was shown previously by Jayaraman et al.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	54	 (39) that N-terminally HA-tagged p53 protein that had been immunopurified using an affinity column containing the C-terminal-specific monoclonal antibody PAb421, HA to p53 [PAb421], is more active in sequence-specific DNA binding than a similarly purified p53 protein preparation (HA to p53 [flu]) in which the affinity column contained the HA antibody (mAb12.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The basis for this difference is not fully understood but may be related to the observations that interactions of PAb421 with the p53 C-terminus can in some cases stimulate its ability to bind to DNA (41).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	56	 It has also been shown that p53 purified in the absence of reducing agents (HA to p53 [flu,  to DTT]) is inert in DNA binding (39,42,43).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	57	 In contrast, as is well-documented, p53 lacking the C-terminus (HA to p53C30 [flu]) can bind extremely well to DNA (41,44).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	58	 These four different forms of HA-tagged p53 were prepared and tested for their ability to affect replication of Vw16PyCAT Py ori-DNA.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	59	 As expected, equivalent quantities of these p53 protein preparations, HA to p53C30 [flu], HA to p53 [PAb421], HA to p53 [flu] and HA to p53 [flu,  to DTT], have descending affinities for an oligonucleotide probe, which contains three copies of the RGC site (Fig.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The abilities of the different forms of p53 protein to inhibit the replication of Vw16PyCAT in vitro as measured both by incorporation of labeled deoxynucleotide into progeny DNA (Fig.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	61	 1C) and DpnI-resistant DNA detected on a 1% vertical agarose gel (Fig.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	62	 1D) reflected their relative abilities to bind to DNA.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Note that the presence of DpnI-resistant DNA suggested that all the dAMP incorporation measured was produced by replication synthesis.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	64	 We then tested a core domain  hot-spot  p53 mutant, HA to p53His to 175 [flu], as well as an N-terminally mutated form of p53, HA to p53Gln to 22/Ser to 23 [flu], which has been shown to be defective in transactivation of p53 target genes but active in sequence-specific DNA binding (45).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	65	 As shown in Figure 2, both wild-type HA to p53 [flu] and HA to p53Gln to 22/Ser to 23 [flu] bound to the oligonucleotide probe containing three copies of RGC sites to similar extents, while, as expected, HA to p53His to 175 [flu] failed to interact with the RGC sites.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Correspondingly, wild-type HA to p53 [flu] and HA to p53Gln to 22/Ser to 23 [flu] inhibited replication of Vw16PyCAT in a dose-dependent fashion while HA to p53His to 175 [flu] failed to do so.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Our results thus strongly support the conclusion that the essential feature required for p53 to block DNA replication is specific binding to the Py ori-DNA template.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Furthermore, the fact that HA to p53Gln to 22/Ser to 23 [flu] functions like wild-type HA to p53 [flu] in inhibiting the replication of Vw16PyCAT suggests that this inhibition does not require interaction of the N-terminus with cellular proteins that bind to its activation domain.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	91	 We did not, however, determine whether the interaction of p53 with this site was required for p53 to block replication of constructs containing binding sites on the late side of the origin.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Interestingly, while in the absence of p53, Vw16PyCATBSM2 had a replication efficiency close to that of Vw16PyCAT, Vw16PyCATBSM1 replicated 3 to 4-fold more efficiently than the other two plasmids (data not shown).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Since the endogenous p53 binding site is located between two T antigen binding consensus pentanucleotides spanning nucleotides 62 to 66 and 95 to 99, it may be that the weaker T-A base pairs constructed in PyORI-BSM1 make it easier for T antigen to unwind the origin DNA.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	109	 In the presence of HA to p53 [flu] protein the replication of Vw16PyCATBSM2 was inhibited even more efficiently than the replication of Vw16PyCAT, while the replication of Vw16PyCATBSM1 was not affected at all by HA to p53 [flu] (Fig.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Our results thus show that the ability of p53 to inhibit the replication of Vw16PyCAT closely correlates to the affinity of p53 for the endogenous p53 binding site, and they further support the conclusion that p53 inhibits the replication of Vw16PyCAT in a DNA binding-dependent manner.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	125	  Although in the presence of T antigen, the majority of dAMP incorporation in vitro using -irradiated pBE102 as a template is likely due to replication synthesis, the possibility cannot be excluded that repair synthesis as detected by labeled deoxynucleotide incorporation could also be inhibited by p53.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Therefore, DpnI resistance of the replication products was examined in order to distinguish replication synthesis from repair synthesis.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	131	 As shown in Figure 5A, among the four different forms of p53 protein used in Figure 1, only HA to p53 [PAb421] and HA to p53 [flu] inhibited the replication of -irradiated pBE102.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	132	 In fact HA to p53 [flu] was relatively more effective in blocking the synthesis of damaged ori-DNA than of intact ori-DNA containing RGC binding sites.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Neither HA to p53C30 [flu], nor the oxidized HA to p53 [flu,  to DTT], inhibited the replication of -irradiated pBE102.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Thus, while the C-terminus of p53 is not required to block the replication of plasmids bearing p53 binding sites, it is indispensable for p53 inhibition of replication of damaged plasmids.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The fact that HA to p53 [flu,  to DTT] was inert, however, suggested that sequence-specific DNA binding by p53 is also a component of its repressive effect on replication of damaged ori-DNA.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	144	 To test this, plasmids pBE102BSM1 and pBE102BSM2 were constructed, which have the endogenous p53 binding site mutated to BSM1 and BSM2, respectively (as shown in Fig.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Indeed, in contrast to wild-type or pBE102BSM2, the replication of -irradiated pBE102BSM1 was not inhibited by HA to p53 [flu] (Fig.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	147	It remained possible that the ability of p53 to bind to irradiated DNA might facilitate its ability to inhibit replication of pBE102 by a mechanism that does not require irradiation of the pBE102 plasmid itself.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Thus, p53 might bind simultaneously to an irradiated plasmid with its C-terminus and to another unirradiated plasmid through interaction of its central domain with the endogenous binding site and this would somehow prevent replication of the unirradiated plasmid.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	159	 It is thus possible to determine whether p53 inhibition of DNA replication occurs at the elongation or initiation stage by adding it to replication mixtures either before or after addition of deoxynucleotides.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	170	Do our results reflect the possibility that virtually any DNA binding protein when present in sufficiently high quantities may inhibit replication of radiation damaged ori-DNA? Arguing against this are our results showing that (28) p53 needs to be able to interact specifically with the endogenous p53 binding site on the early side of the ori as well as with DNA lesions caused by irradiation, (i) p53 needs both its specific and non-specific DNA binding domains to cause this inhibition, and (ii) p53 blocks specifically the initiation and not the elongation stage of ori-DNA synthesis.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Thus, it is unlikely that p53 is blocking replication by random non-specific binding to the damaged DNA.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	172	 It is also noteworthy that Ito et al.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	173	 (48) showed that the transcription factor AP1 stimulates the initial stage of in vitro replication of a Py ori-DNA plasmid containing the AP1 binding site.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Their result argues against the possibility that a sequence-specific interactor with DNA in the vicinity of the Py ori will obligatorily inhibit its replication.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	175	To explain the mechanism underlying the inhibition of Py DNA by p53, several possibilities can be suggested: (i) by binding to flanking consensus sites or lesion site(s), p53 may sequester away proteins which are essential for the replication machinery such as RP-A and T antigen; (ii) p53 binding to a site close to the replication origin, such as the endogenous p53 site of Py DNA, may block access of the replication initiation complex to the origin; (iii) p53 may also function as an anti-helicase (49) and counteract the helicase activity of T antigen by re-annealing denatured DNA around the origin; (iv) by binding to separate sites p53 may loop DNA around the origin and therefore produce steric hindrance to replication initiation.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Our results presented in this paper strongly support the DNA looping model (Fig.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	177	 8), because both the endogenous p53 binding site on the early side and an in cis p53 binding site on the late side adjacent to the Py origin are required for the DNA replication to be inhibited by p53.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	178	 It has been shown previously that p53 binding to separate single consensus sequences can indeed bend and loop DNA, and DNA looping by p53 may play an important role in transactivation of certain promoters (50,51).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	179	 So far, it remains to be tested whether p53 can also loop DNA by binding to separate DNA lesions, or as suggested by our result, by separately binding to a consensus sequence and a lesion site(s).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	180	It was interesting to discover that when the endogenous p53 binding site adjacent to the Py origin was mutated to BSM1 (that cannot bind p53), the replication efficiency of the mutant plasmid was increased 3 to 4-fold (data not shown).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	181	 The fact that the wild-type polyomavirus genome contains an endogenous p53 binding consensus site provides the intriguing possibility that polyomavirus may indeed use the host p53 protein to regulate amplicational replications.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Amplicational replication of small DNA tumor viruses is normally initiated after entry of the viral genome into the cell nucleus, which leads to a rapid increase in copy number of the virus genome (32).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Amplicational replication of the viral genome is essential for the establishment of viral infection but has to be controlled in order to avoid over-replication and unscheduled death of host cells prior to the synthesis of late genes and the production of infectious particles.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	184	 It is tempting to speculate that polyomavirus uses p53 as a cellular factor to control amplicational replication.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Further experiments will be required to test this possibility.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Small DNA tumor viruses generally encode proteins that interact with and modulate the activity of p53 and thereby regulate p53-dependent apoptosis of the host cells.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	188	 So far no protein encoded by the Py genome has been identified that interacts with or regulates the activity of p53 protein.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	189	 It supports the likelihood that polyomavirus uses p53 as a cellular factor to keep amplicational replication in check.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	190	In the original conception of p53 as a checkpoint factor, it was proposed that DNA damage would induce a transient G1 arrest in cells with wild-type but not mutant p53 to allow time for damaged DNA to be repaired before continuation of the cell cycle (56).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	191	 It is tempting to speculate that p53 may participate directly in a pathway that stops or slows down DNA replication more rapidly than the transcription- dependent p21/E2F pathway.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Although p53 is believed to interact with various forms of DNA damage through its C-terminus the biological function of this interaction has not been elucidated.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In our study using ionizing radiation damaged Py ori-DNA plasmids we were able to demonstrate by in vitro experiments a potential new function for p53, namely that of direct inhibition of initiation of DNA replication in a DNA binding-dependent manner.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	194	 It should be noted here that a p53-dependent DNA replication checkpoint has not been demonstrated (57), and in fact p53 has been shown to be transcriptionally impaired when it accumulates in blocked S-phase (30).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	195	 What is not known, however, is whether at the very onset of S-phase radiation-damaged templates might be prevented from initiating replication as a result of direct interactions with p53.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	196	 It is acknowledged that the replication of Py ori-DNA embodies several features that are distinct from the as yet poorly understood process of mammalian genomic DNA replication.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that p53 could only exert its effect on the initial stages of Py-ori DNA synthesis and, once initiated, p53 was ineffective in inhibiting ongoing replication.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Thus, based both on our biochemical observations and the existing body of knowledge of p53 in cells, it is possible that p53 might serve to prevent the onset of S-phase both through its function as a transcription factor and its ability to bind to damaged DNA and prevent initiation of DNA synthesis.

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	5	 This obstacle has to be removed in order to allow tumor development.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Indeed, approximately 50% of human cancers bear p53 gene mutations; in the majority of the remaining cancer cases, p53 activity is compromised by alternative mechanisms (Vogelstein et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	7	 These involve elevation in the expression levels of p53 inhibitors, such as Mdm2 or the E6 protein of HPV, or silencing of key p53 co-activators, such as ARF (Vogelstein et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	8	Only under reducing conditions is the affinity of p53 for the Gadd45 promoter increased, which suggests that the reduction of Cys277 is necessary to enable binding of p53 to C-rich binding sequences, such as that of Gadd45.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	9	 found that reduction of residues Cys275 and Cys277 by selenomethionine (the major dietary source of selenium) caused p53 to recruit the p53-binding redox factor Ref1 and activate DNA-repair machinery through the induction of Gadd45, without affecting cell growth (Seo et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Thus, the redox state of p53 Cys277 appears to serve as a switch for activating the DNA repair machinery.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	11	 This selective activation of p53-dependent DNA repair activity has been proposed as a novel approach to cancer prevention (Gudkov, 2002).

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	17	The Myc protein has been implicated as an important determinant of the choice between p53-induced growth arrest or apoptosis.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Myc inhibits growth arrest in response to UV light, -irradiation and DNA damage inflicted by reactive oxygen species (Sheen and Dickson, 2002; Vafa et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In the absence of Myc, cells that are exposed to UV light arrest in a p53- and Miz-1 (DNA-binding Myc-interacting zinc-finger 1)-dependent manner through activation of p21.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, when Myc is present, exposure to UV triggers its recruitment by Miz-1 to the proximal promoter region of p21.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This interaction effectively represses p21 induction by p53 and other activators (Herold et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Intriguingly, this repression appears to be specific for p21, because other p53-target genes, such as p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and PIG3, are induced.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This block in p21 induction shifts the balance away from growth arrest towards apoptosis (Seoane et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	24	 It should be noted, however, that arrested cells are not necessarily protected from apoptosis.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	25	 For example, normal thymocytes and mature lymphocytes undergo p53-mediated apoptosis under certain stress conditions (Strasser et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Interaction of p53 with several other proteins specifically enhances the induction of apoptotic target genes.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The apoptosis stimulating proteins of p53 (ASPP), for example, increases the DNA binding and transactivation activity of p53 on the promoters of apoptotic genes (e.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Bax and PIG3), while failing to promote binding to the p21 promoter by a mechanism that remains to be defined (Samuels-Lev et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	29	A novel insight into the interplay between p53 and its family members, p63 and p73, in the induction of apoptosis has been recently revealed by Flores et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Their study of the effect of p63 and p73 on p53 transcriptional activity, using a selection of knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), defined two distinct classes of target gene.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Whereas p53 alone is sufficient for the induction of p21 and Mdm2, the induction of the apoptotic genes PERP, Bax and Noxa requires p53 together with p63 and p73.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	32	 This finding demonstrates an essential role for both p63 and p73 in the efficient induction of apoptotic target genes by p53.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The mechanism of this cooperation is currently unknown, but it may involve an enhanced binding to and/or stabilization of the transcription complex on the promoters of p53 apoptotic target genes by the cooperative action of all three members (Urist and Prives, 2002).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In addition to the contribution of p63 and p73 to the apoptotic function of p53, they play an important role in the precise control of cell death during normal mouse development.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	35	 p73 also plays a role in the induction of cell death in response to DNA damage, a process involving cooperation between the Abl tyrosine kinase and p73 (reviewed by Shaul, 2000).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	36	How p53 mediates apoptosis has been a matter of intensive study since this was first demonstrated (Yonish-Rouach et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Numerous publications have recently described the importance of p53 transcriptional regulation of components of both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, few target gene products have been unequivocally established to be essential to p53-dependent apoptosis induction; we discuss the supporting evidence below.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	39	 p53 is also able to promote apoptosis through transcription-independent apoptotic mechanisms.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Under certain conditions, p53 induces apoptosis in the absence of transcription or protein synthesis (e.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Moreover, transcriptionally inactive mutants of p53 can induce apoptosis in certain cell types (Haupt et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	42	, 1995), and PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT), which blocks binding of p53 to DNA, does not inhibit p53-mediated apoptosis (Nelson et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In general, the transcription-independent apoptotic activities of p53 have been demonstrated in transformed cells rather than in normal cells (e.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Presumably, these activities of p53 require cooperation with other apoptotic factors - for instance E2F-1 (a transcription factor in the retinoblastoma protein pathway) (reviewed by Vogt Sionov and Haupt, 1999).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Experimental cell transformation may mimic various stages of tumor development, where the apoptotic function of p53 is being activated and becomes critical for the suppression of tumor progression.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	46	 These apoptotic activities of p53 may not be sufficient to induce apoptosis in non-transformed cells, such as normal thymocytes.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Whereas the transcription-dependent and -independent apoptotic functions of p53 are often described separately, they appear to complement each other.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	48	 We therefore discuss their contributions together in the context of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	49	In addition to stimulating Fas transcription, overexpressed p53 may enhance levels of Fas at the cell surface by promoting trafficking of the Fas receptor from the Golgi (Bennett et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	50	 This may allow p53 to rapidly sensitize cells to Fas-induced apoptosis before the transcription-dependent effect operates.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	51	 How p53 promotes Fas trafficking is not understood.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	52	The second member of this receptor family that is induced by p53 is DR5/KILLER, the death-domain-containing receptor for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	53	 DR5 is induced by p53 in response to DNA damage (Wu et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	54	, 1997) and in turn promotes cell death through caspase-8 (reviewed by Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	55	 DR5 induction is cell type specific.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Whole body -irradiation induces DR5 expression in the spleen, small intestine and thymus (Burns et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	57	, 2001), which is consistent with DR5 participating in the p53-mediated response to DNA damage in these tissues.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Strikingly, in MEFs exposed to DNA damage (by doxorubicin), similar levels of DR5 were identified in cells undergoing G1 arrest and apoptosis (Attardi et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Thus, the contribution of DR5 to these different p53-determined cell fates remains to be clarified.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	60	Another apoptotic gene, PERP, is induced in MEFs in response to DNA-damage in cells transduced with either E2F-1 or with the adenoviral E1A protein, which targets pRb, thereby releasing active E2F-1.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	61	 In this context, PERP probably cooperates with E2F-1 to induce apoptosis.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	62	 PERP is a putative tetraspan transmembrane protein that represents a new member of the PMP-22/gas family of proteins implicated in cell growth regulation.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The kinetics of PERP induction in response to DNA damage and the presence of a p53-responsive element in the PERP promoter support the notion that it is a direct p53 target.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	64	 A role for PERP in apoptosis is suggested by the significantly higher levels of PERP mRNA in cells undergoing apoptosis than in arresting cells.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	65	 However, the mechanism by which PERP contributes to p53-mediated apoptosis is yet to be defined (Attardi et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	66	Bax was the first member of this group shown to be induced by p53, but p53-responsive elements have only recently been unequivocally identified in the Bax gene (Thornborrow et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	67	 In response to stress activation, Bax forms a homodimer and releases cytochrome c from the mitochondria (Skulachev, 1998), which results in caspase-9 activation (reviewed by Adams and Cory, 1998).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The requirement for Bax in p53-mediated apoptosis appears to be cell-type dependent.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Bax is required for the apoptotic response of the developing nervous system to -irradiation (Chong et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	70	, 2000) and contributes to chemotherapy-induced killing of E1A-expressing fibroblasts (McCurrach et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	71	In contrast, equivalent levels of Bax induced in MEFs undergoing either arrest or apoptosis had been understood to indicate that Bax does not dictate cellular fate in these cells (Attardi et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	72	 In addition, in colonic epithelia undergoing apoptosis in response to -irradiation, Bax did not appear to be essential (Pritchard et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	73	A fascinating explanation for the apparent enigmatic role of Bax in apoptosis induction has recently been offered in the context of PUMA.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The PUMA gene is also directly induced by p53 in response to DNA damage, through p53-responsive elements within the first intron of PUMA.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	75	 In humans, PUMA encodes two BH3-domain-containing proteins, PUMA- and PUMA-ss (Nakano and Vousden, 2001; Yu et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	76	 A vital balance between PUMA and p21 has been identified to determine the onset of arrest, or death, in response to exogenous p53 expression and also hypoxia in human colorectal cancer cells.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Growth arrest through activation of p21 is the normal response to p53 expression in these cells.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	78	 If p21 is disrupted the cells die through apoptosis; if, however, PUMA is disrupted, apoptosis is prevented.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Bax is absolutely required for PUMA-mediated apoptosis.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	80	 PUMA expression promotes mitochondrial translocation and mulitmerization of Bax, culminating in apoptosis induction (Yu et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Thus, although p53 can bind to the Bax promoter, the affinity is weak in contrast to p21 and PUMA binding (Kaeser and Iggo, 2002).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Bax thus participates in the death response as an indirect target of p53 through PUMA (Yu et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	83	Another p53 target gene, Noxa, contains a single p53-responsive element in its promoter and is induced in response to X-ray irradiation (Oda et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Noxa encodes a BH3-only protein and hence is likely to contribute to p53-mediated apoptosis in a similar manner to PUMA and Bax, although this is yet to be demonstrated.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Thus, it appears that, in response to DNA damage, p53 activates the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by inducing the expression of at least three Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic family members, shifting the balance towards pro-apoptotic effects.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	86	Caspase activation Caspase-9 and caspase-2 respond to changes in mitochondrial potential, whereas caspase-8 and caspase-10 sense activation of death receptors.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	87	 These initiator caspases cleave the pro-enzyme forms of the effector caspases, caspase-3, caspase-6 and caspase-7, allowing digestion of essential targets that affect cell viability (Fig.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	88	 1) (MacLachlan and El-Deiry, 2002).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Intriguingly, p53 boosts the activation of the caspase cascade by both transcription-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In response to -irradiation of nucleus-depleted S100 cell-free extracts, p53 can activate caspase-8 (Ding et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Depletion or inactivation of caspase-8 in cell-free extracts completely prevents this effect and significantly attenuates overall apoptosis induced by wild-type p53.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	92	 However, etoposide- and UV-mediated death of fibroblasts derived from caspase-8-deficient mice is not impaired (Varfolomeev et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Thus, caspase-8 can contribute to, although is not always essential for, DNA-damaged induced death.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	94	p53 stimulates caspase-6 through a more conventional mechanism.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	95	 In response to DNA damage, p53 directly induces caspase-6 expression through a response element within the third intron of the gene (MacLachlan and El-Deiry, 2002).

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, September 16, 2004 , and in revised form, February 3, 2005.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	3	It is well established that p53 is a transcriptional regulator and that p53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage is predominantly attributable both to the transcriptional activation of genes that encode apoptotic effectors, such as the BH3-only proteins Noxa and PUMA, Bax, p53AIP1, and PERP (4-9), as well as to the transcriptional repression of genes for antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 (10) and survivin (11).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In addition to such transcriptional regulation, however, recent evidence has suggested the existence of a transcription-independent pathway of p53-mediated apoptosis (12, 13).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	5	 A fraction of the p53 molecules that accumulate in damaged cells translocates to mitochondria, and this translocation is sufficient for p53 to induce permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane through formation of complexes with the protective proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, resulting in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol (14, 15).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The mechanism by which the relative activities of the transcription-dependent and transcription-independent pathways of p53-mediated apoptosis are regulated, however, has remained unclear.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	7	Lesions in the transcribed strand of DNA induced by high concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin or by high doses of UV radiation trigger the ubiquitination and consequent degradation of the large subunit (LS)1 of RNA polymerase II (pol II), resulting in transcriptional collapse and the recruitment of DNA repair proteins (16, 17).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	8	 A prolonged blockage of pol II-dependent transcription caused by failure to repair such DNA lesions results in cell death by apoptosis (18).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Furthermore, -amanitin, a specific inhibitor of pol II-dependent transcription, also induces apoptosis (19).

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	88	To verify that the p53 accumulation elicited by -amanitin was not attributable to the induction of DNA damage, we checked for the presence of the -H2AX complex, which can be a marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (31, 32), in -amanitin-treated HCT116 cells by immunofluorescence analysis.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	89	 To avoid the detection of DSBs attributable to apoptotic DNA fragmentation, we examined cells for the presence of -H2AX foci 18 h after exposure to drugs (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Whereas adriamycin induced the formation of -H2AX foci, -amanitin did not, even though substantial p53 accumulation was apparent at this time point.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	91	 These results suggest that the accumulation of p53 induced by -amanitin is not caused by the induction of DSBs.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	92	The accumulation and activation of p53 are regulated by post-translational modifications, including protein phosphorylation and acetylation (33).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Given that phosphorylation of p53 contributes to both the stabilization and activation of the protein, we examined the time course of p53 phosphorylation on Ser15 and Ser46 in p53+/+ HCT116 cells treated with adriamycin or -amanitin (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Adriamycin-induced Ser15 phosphorylation was apparent at 3 h, as was p53 accumulation; an increase in the extent of phosphorylation of Ser46 was not apparent until 6 h, consistent with the delay in the phosphorylation of this residue compared with that of Ser15 observed previously in adriamycin-treated cells (6).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	95	 In contrast, an increase in the extent of Ser46 phosphorylation was apparent at 12 h, coincident with the onset of p53 accumulation, and Ser15 phosphorylation was not detected until 24 h in cells treated with -amanitin.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	96	 These results thus suggest that -amanitin triggers a slower p53 response in comparison to adriamycin and may activate a signaling pathway that differs from that responsible for the p53 stabilization in response to DNA damage.

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Although p53 protein was detectable at a low level in the nuclei of untreated cells, it was present in increased amounts in -amanitin-treated cells and was localized to mitochondria in a substantial proportion of these cells (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Cell fractionation experiments also demonstrate that p53 accumulated by -amanitin treatment is primarily detected in mitochondrial fractions, and those mitochondrial p53 molecules are phosphorylated on Ser15 and/or Ser46 (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	135	 These findings thus suggest that p53 molecules that accumulate in response to transcriptional blockade translocate to the mitochondria, which may activate the apoptotic program.

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Therefore, to investigate further the effect of -amanitin on cell cycle progression, HCT116 cells were first incubated with -amanitin or other reagents alone and then in the absence or presence of nocodazole, which induces cell cycle arrest in prometaphase through activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Consistent with previous observations (36), treatment of the cells with actinomycin D, which is an RNA polymerase I inhibitor, or adriamycin resulted in G1 or G2 arrest, respectively (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	140	 In contrast, cells treated with -amanitin incorporated BrdUrd and accumulated predominantly in the S phase (61%); they neither arrested in G1 nor entered M phase regardless of whether or not they were exposed to nocodazole (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Whereas the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) was dephosphorylated in cells treated with adriamycin, it was highly phosphorylated in -amanitin-treated cells (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	142	 5C) as it was in cells exposed to a DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin, which induced S phase arrest.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Furthermore, the abundance of ICBP90, a nuclear protein whose expression is down-regulated during DNA damage-induced G1 arrest (20), was not affected by treatment of HCT116 cells with -amanitin, whereas it was decreased by treatment with adriamycin or actinomycin D (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Together, these findings suggest that cells exposed to -amanitin progress through the G1-S transition and arrest in S phase.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	145	We next investigated the mechanism by which -amanitintreated cells are able to enter S phase even though they manifest accumulation of p53.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	146	 DNA damage is known to induce expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21Cip1 via p53-dependent transactivation (25).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	147	 p21Cip1 binds to and inhibits the activity of both PCNA and the complexes of CDK2 with cyclin A or cyclin E, thereby blocking progression of cells from G1 to S (37).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Given that the levels of p21Cip1 protein and mRNA were down-regulated in both the -amanitin-treated cells and the siRNA-mediated pol II-depleted cells (Figs.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	149	 S1), cells might be able to enter S phase despite p53 accumulation.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	150	 To address this issue further, we monitored changes in the levels of p21Cip1 during cell cycle progression of the -amanitin-treated cells (Fig.

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The size of the G1 population was markedly reduced and that of the sub-G1 (apoptotic) population was increased for cells treated with -amanitin compared with the corresponding populations of cells treated with actinomycin D or those left untreated.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Immunoblot analysis revealed that the amount of p21Cip1 protein was reduced in cells exposed to -amanitin, although it was markedly increased in response to actinomycin D (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	154	The abundance of p21Cip1 is regulated not only by transcriptional induction but also by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (38).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	155	 To examine whether the -amanitin-induced down-regulation of p21Cip1 expression was attributable to protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, we treated HCT116 cells with -amanitin in the presence of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The decrease in the amount of p21Cip1 induced by -amanitin was prevented by MG132 (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	157	 5F), indicating that p21Cip1 undergoes ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in response to -amanitin.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Thus, both transcriptional suppression and protein degradation appear to prevent the accumulation of p21Cip1 in -amanitin-treated cells and thereby lead to S phase entry.

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Immunoblot analysis revealed that cyclin B was not detectable in cells treated with -amanitin, suggesting that the cells are prevented from entering mitosis as a result of down-regulation of this cyclin.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	187	-Amanitin-treated Cells Undergo Apoptosis on Entry into S Phase Nocodazole synchronization revealed that -amanitin induced apoptosis 14 h after the release of cells from metaphase arrest (Fig.

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	189	 We therefore investigated whether cells treated with -amanitin undergo apoptosis as they enter S phase.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	190	 HCT116 cells were synchronized at G0-G1 by serum deprivation and then re-exposed to serum in the absence or presence of -amanitin (Fig.

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	192	 In addition, treatment with -amanitin resulted in a large increase in the number of cells positive for M30 CytoDeath antibody, which recognizes a specific caspase cleavage product of cytokeratin 18 and can be a marker of early apoptosis, at the time (24 h after release) when the cells began to accumulate in S phase (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Furthermore, this apoptotic marker was detected in the -amanitin-treated cells during early S phase but not at G2-M phase, suggesting that -amanitin induces p53-dependent apoptosis as cells enter S phase.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	194	 This notion is further supported by the immunocyto-chemical finding that -amanitin-treated cells in which p53 was localized to mitochondria preferentially incorporate BrdUrd, indicating that they had entered S phase (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	195	We next tested the possibility that induction of G1 arrest is able to block -amanitin-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	196	 The plant amino acid mimosine blocks the cell cycle in late G1 phase by inducing the up-regulation of the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (40).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Mimosine markedly inhibited the -amanitin-induced increase in the size of the sub-G1 (apoptotic) cell population (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the CDK inhibitors p21Cip1 or p27Kip1 also induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and prevented -amanitin-induced apoptosis (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Specifically, these results suggest that S phase entry is required for the apoptosis induced by transcriptional blockade.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	200	Accumulation of p53 and Down-regulation of p21Cip1 Lead to Apoptosis We then examined whether down-regulation of p21Cip1 is also required for the induction of apoptosis by -amanitin.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Treatment of p21-/- HCT116 cells with -amanitin resulted in p53 accumulation and massive apoptosis (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	202	 This finding raised the hypothesis that p53 accumulation without p21Cip1 induction triggers the apoptosis.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	203	 We thus constructed this condition by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of p53 in the p21-/- cells, and we found that this combination induces massive apoptosis without -amanitin treatment (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Furthermore, pifithrin-, a specific inhibitor of p53-mediated transcriptional activation (41), did not inhibit the induction of apoptosis in p21-/- HCT116 cells by overexpression of p53 (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	205	 7B), suggesting that the transactivation activity of p53 does not contribute to this effect.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	206	 These findings suggest the possibility that the p53-mediated transactivation-independent apoptosis is triggered by the accumulation of p53 without p21Cip1 induction.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	207	To verify further that transcriptional blockade induces p53-mediated transcription-independent apoptosis, we used cells expressing a transactivation-deficient p53.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	208	 We established p53-/- HCT116 cells stably expressing wild-type p53 or a truncated form of p53-(1-39) (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	209	 p53-(1-39) lacks an N-terminal transactivation domain (residues 1-39), which is thus unable to transactivate p21Cip1 expression (42).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Treatment with -amanitin induced apoptosis in cells not only expressing wild-type p53 but also in cells expressing p53-(1-39), although the p53-/- HCT116 cells were insensitive to -amanitin treatment (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	211	 These results thus support our hypothesis that apoptosis induced by transcriptional blockade is p53-dependent but transactivation-independent.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	212	High Dose UV Irradiation Induces Transcription-independent p53-mediated Apoptosis Here we showed that inhibition of pol II by -amanitin treatment or siRNA approach resulted in the p53 accumulation without p21Cip1 induction, leading to apoptosis.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	213	 We wanted to find out whether there is any biological condition inducing this type of cell death.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	214	 As reported previously (16), exposure of HCT116 cells to a high dose of UV radiation (30 J/m2) induced the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of pol II LS, resulting in transcriptional blockade and apoptosis 24 h after the treatment (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	215	 This treatment actually induced p53 accumulation and p21Cip1 down-regulation (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	216	 7D, left panel), biochemical effects identical to those of -amanitin and pol II LS siRNA.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	217	 In addition, the high dose UV-induced p53 was predominantly detected in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Together, these findings thus suggest that accumulation of p53 in mitochondria with down-regulation of p21Cip1, which resulted from transcriptional blockade, leads to apoptosis in high dose UV-irradiated cells.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	219	Inhibition of pol II by -Amanitin Induces p53 Accumulation and p53-dependent Apoptosis Apoptosis induced by -amanitin was markedly greater in extent in p53+/+ HCT116 cells than in the corresponding p53-/- cells and was blocked in the presence of a caspase inhibitor, indicating that transcriptional blockade induces p53-dependent, caspase-mediated apoptosis.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Furthermore, this notion was supported by the finding that the -amanitin-resistant p53-/- cells underwent apoptosis by expression of exogenous p53.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The accumulation of p53 appeared to be attributable to inhibition of p53 degradation, given that the amount of p53 mRNA was actually reduced by -amanitin treatment.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	222	 These findings are consistent with previous results (43), showing that the accumulation of p53 induced by inhibition of pol II-dependent transcription results from down-regulation of MDM2 gene transcription.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Therefore, in addition to the MDM2 down-regulation-mediated pathway, signaling triggered by modification of p53 protein may contribute to p53 accumulation.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	224	 In fact, we also found that -amanitin induces p53 phosphorylation.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The phosphorylation of p53, which is mediated by various stress-activated kinases (44), contributes to the stabilization and activation of the protein.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	226	 The DNA-damaging agent adriamycin induced the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15, which is reportedly mediated by the kinase ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (45) and results in p53 accumulation, before that on Ser46.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	227	 In contrast, -amanitin induced p53 phosphorylation on Ser46 before the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15, and the former reaction coincided with the accumulation of p53.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Transcriptional blockade by -amanitin might thus result in the activation of stress-activated kinases that are distinct from those activated by DNA-damaging agents and that phosphorylate and thereby stabilize p53.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Indeed, caffeine, an inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase and ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, did not inhibit -amanitin-induced p53 phosphorylation and accumulation,2 suggesting that these kinases do not contribute to the effects of -amanitin.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	230	 We also found that transcriptional blockade did not activate the Chk1 (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Furthermore, -amanitin did not induce p53 accumulation in M059J cells (46), which are deficient in the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	232	 S8), suggesting a possible role for DNA-dependent protein kinases in the phosphorylation of p53 in response to transcriptional blockade in the absence of DNA damage.

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	256	 p53-/- HCT116 cells and those stably expressing wild-type p53 or a truncated form of p53 (p53-(1-39)) were incubated with -amanitin (10  microg/ml) for 24 h, after which the extent of apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	257	 D, accumulation of p53, down-regulation of p21Cip1, and apoptosis induced by high dose UV irradiation in HCT116 cells.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Parental cells (p53+/+ and p21+/+) were exposed to UV radiation (0, 2, or 30 J/m2) in the absence or presence of 10  microM MG132.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Cells harvested 6 h after irradiation were subjected to immunoblot analysis of pol II LS, p53, and p21Cip1 (left panels), and those harvested 6 or 24 h after irradiation were subjected to flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis (right panel).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	260	 E, accumulation of p53 in the mitochondrial fraction of cells exposed to UV radiation.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Mitochondrial (Mito) and cytosolic (Cyto) fractions of MRC-5 cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to p53 (DO-1) 24 h after they were exposed to UV radiation (40 J/m2) in the presence of pifithrin-.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	262	  Cells Treated with -Amanitin Undergo Apoptosis on Entry into S Phase The accumulation of p53 in response to DNA damage results in the transcriptional activation of p53 target genes whose products either induce cell cycle arrest (such as p21Cip1) or trigger apoptosis.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	263	 However, we found that the expression of p21Cip1 was down-regulated by -amanitin as a result of both suppression of gene transcription and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	264	 The -amanitin-treated cells were thus prevented from arresting at G1 phase.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	265	 In addition, we found that the abundance of p27Kip1, another CDK2 inhibitor, was also down-regulated by -amanitin treatment in HCT116 and MRC-5 cells (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Thus, despite the fact that they accumulate p53, cells treated with -amanitin proceed to S phase, as confirmed by the status of pRb phosphorylation, flow cytometric analysis of DNA content, and BrdUrd incorporation.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The down-regulation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 might possibly be due to cleavage by the CPP32-like caspase during apoptosis (47).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	268	 However, the abundance of p21Cip1 in -amanitin-treated HCT116 cells was reduced prior to the appearance of the apoptotic phenotype (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Moreover, Skp2, which is a subunit of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein ubiquitin ligase that controls the proteolysis of p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 (48-50), was up-regulated in -amanitin-treated HCT116 cells (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	270	 S10), suggesting that signaling activated by transcriptional blockade results in the activation of Skp2, which then mediates the down-regulation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	271	Overexpression of exogenous p53 markedly enhanced cell death in p21-/- HCT116 cells (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	272	 7B), suggesting that the entry of cells with phosphorylated and accumulated p53 and down-regulated p21Cip1 into S phase is an important trigger for apoptosis induced by transcriptional blockade.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Several lines of evidence suggest that transcriptional blockade elicits cell death as cells enter S phase.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	274	 1) Synchronized cells released from nocodazole block in the presence of -amanitin underwent pronounced apoptosis during S phase (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	275	 2) Induction of G1 arrest by treatment of cells with mimosine or by overexpression of p21Cip1 or p27Kip1 resulted in marked suppression of -amanitin-induced apoptosis (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	276	 3) Withdrawal of mimosine from -amanitin-treated cells led to massive apoptosis (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Inhibition of CDK activity and induction of cell cycle arrest by p21Cip1 has been shown previously to play an important role in protecting cells from apoptosis (51, 52).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Together, these various observations suggest that transcriptional block by inhibition of pol II activity results in cell cycle arrest during DNA replication and induces apoptosis in S phase.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	279	Transcriptional Blockade Induces Translocation of p53 to Mitochondria and Consequent Apoptosis in S Phase Many genes whose products mediate p53-dependent cell death have been identified.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Several p53 target genes encode proteins that localize to mitochondria and affect the mitochondrial membrane potential, an important determinant of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	281	 These proteins include Bax, Noxa, PUMA, and p53AIP1.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	282	 We found that the accumulation of p53 induced by -amanitin did not result in the transcriptional activation of any of the p53 target genes examined.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Furthermore, the abundance of Bax and Apaf-1, which are also p53-inducible gene products (53), was not affected by -amanitin treatment in HCT116 cells (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	284	 These observations thus suggest that apoptosis induced by transcriptional blockade is mediated by p53 in a transcription-independent manner.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	285	Evidence suggests that p53 is able to directly engage the major apoptotic pathways in the cell, promoting both death receptor signaling and mitochrondrial perturbations, without requiring gene induction.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	286	 A fraction of accumulated p53 molecules also translocates to the mitochondria and thereby promotes apoptosis in cells with DNA damage (15).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	287	 The p53 protein directly induces permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane by forming complexes with the protective proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, resulting in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	288	 It has also been shown to activate and to induce the translocation of Bax to mitochondria, again resulting in cytochrome c release (54).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	289	 However, specific cellular contexts that trigger the transcription-independent translocation of p53 to mitochondria remain obscure.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	290	 We found that -amanitin-mediated transcriptional blockade induces p53 localization to mitochondria and that a substantial proportion of Bax molecules also translocates to mitochondria in -amanitin-treated MRC-5 cells (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Moreover, the p53 molecules that translocated to mitochondria in -amanitin-treated cells included those phosphorylated on Ser15 and Ser46, and such translocation was detected in cells at S phase.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Based on this evidence, we speculate that the p53 molecules that accumulate in response to transcriptional blockade trigger apoptosis directly by acting at mitochondria.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	293	Biological Significance of p53-mediated Apoptosis Induced by Transcriptional Blockade The induction of DNA lesions by high doses of UV radiation results in the ubiquitination and degradation of pol II LS, transcriptional collapse, and recruitment of DNA repair proteins (16, 17).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Prolonged inhibition of transcription as a result of a failure to repair such DNA lesions results in cell death by apoptosis (18).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Indeed, we found that high dose UV radiation induced pol II degradation, p53 accumulation, down-regulation of p21Cip1 expression, and p53-dependent apoptosis, similar to the effects of -amanitin treatment.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	296	 UV irradiation was shown previously to induce transcription of the c-jun gene and to modulate the association of p53 with the promoter of the p21Cip1 gene, resulting in repression of p21Cip1 gene activation and cell death (55).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Therefore, in addition to the c-Jun-mediated pathway, signaling triggered by transcriptional blockade at the sites of unrepaired DNA lesions may contribute to UV-induced apoptosis by a p53-dependent pathway.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	298	It is interesting to know how much the transactivation-independent apoptosis contributes to the p53-mediated cell death.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	299	 When HCT116 (p53+/+) cells were treated with adriamycin in the presence of -amanitin, the cell death was significantly enhanced in comparison to adriamycin treatment alone even though the p53-mediated gene expression is blocked (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	300	 This observation implies that p53 accumulated by DNA damage can elicit apoptosis via both transactivation-dependent and -independent pathways.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	301	It has been reported recently that many of the common DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin and the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin are known to interfere with transcription (56).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Therefore, translocation of p53 to mitochondria may serve as a fail-safe mechanism to elicit apoptosis for eliminating cells whose transcription is blocked by severe and irreparable DNA damages (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Loss-of-function mutations in the p53 gene might thus abrogate both the transcription-dependent and mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic activities of p53 and thereby lead to the survival of transformed cells.

0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	2	In the 25 years since its first description the p53 protein has been shown to play a key role in both tumour suppression and aging.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	3	 New discoveries about the function and control of p53 continue to emerge every month and attempts to exploit the system to develop better therapeutics and diagnostics are beginning to be successful in the clinic (1,2).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	4	The genetics of the p53 pathway.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	5	The current model for p53 function as a tumour suppressor is that the protein acts as a highly regulated transcription factor.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Normally p53 is a very unstable protein and is present only in minute concentrations in the cell.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Even these small amounts of p53 are not fully active as a transcription factor, because the negative regulator protein, Mdm2, binds them.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	8	 When cells are exposed to a wide variety of aberrant growth signals, the p53 protein is activated and stabilized and triggers the expression of downstream genes such as p21 that trigger cell cycle arrest, or Puma that triggers apoptosis.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	9	 This response is potentially lethal since mice that have p53 but lack Mdm2 die very early in development at the pre-implantation stage (3,4).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The response is vital to control tumour growth as mice that lack p53 develop spontaneous early onset malignancies (5).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	11	 More recently however another aspect of p53 regulation has emerged.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In two mouse models where p53 activity is modulated and increased by the expression of an N-terminally truncated form of the protein, accelerated aging phenotypes are seen (6 to 8).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Thus, the p53 response needs to be very finely controlled in order to provide adequate tumour suppression without promoting accelerated aging.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	14	Haploinsufficiency Genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated a rich variety of genes and pathways that act to control p53 function and thresholds.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These must act in concert to precisely control the activity of p53.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These pathways are nearly always disrupted in cancer cells that need to avoid the full p53 response if they are to grow and survive.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Genetic studies have helped to clarify the importance of key players in this pathway and also suggested suitable points for therapeutic intervention.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The huge number of biochemical and cell biological studies on the p53 protein can be hard to evaluate but the genetic models provide an increasingly firm basis on which to build a core understanding of the p53 pathway.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Studies of the responses of heterozygote wild-type over null mice (p53+/ to ) have demonstrated unequivocally that the p53 locus does not obey Knudsen's two hit hypothesis.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Instead there is clear evidence of haploinsufficiency at the locus.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Thus, cells that contain a single copy of the p53 gene as opposed to two copies show an impaired response to radiation-induced apoptosis and tumours that arise in these mice quite frequently retain the wild-type allele (9).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This also seems to occur in the tumours of individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome where not all tumours show loss of the single wild-type parental allele.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This implies that the regulation of the p53 system is exceptionally tightly controlled and that gene dosage and transcription is a critical method by which the p53 threshold is set.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	24	Implications of a hypomorphic Mdm2 allele Further support for the tight control of the p53 system emerges from elegant studies on a mouse model that carries a hypomorphic allele of the Mdm2 gene (10 to 12).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The Mdm2 protein binds to p53 and targets it for degradation by acting as a ubiquitin E3 ligase that results in the specific ubiquitination of p53.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In mice that are +/ to  at the mdm2 locus no phenotype is evident but in mice that express a slightly lower level of Mdm2 from a single hypomorphic allele thymic ablation, poor weight gain and bone marrow and intestinal cell loss are evident.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	27	 All of these phenotypes are dependant on wild-type p53 and do not require any exogenous signal.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The data strongly suggest that p53 is always active in these target tissues and that Mdm2 is a rate limiting negative regulator normally expressed at roughly three times the level needed to repress p53 function.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The fact that the inactivation of the Mdm2 related gene Mdmx (or Mdm4) (13) also gives a p53 dependant early embryonic lethal phenotype has implied that this less well studied gene also must be critical in controlling p53 and that it cannot be compensated for by Mdm2.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	30	The p19Arf locus and other regulators of p53 Other genes that control p53 function have also been verified by genetic analysis and the upstream genes ATM and CHK2 clearly act to regulate p53 response, as does the negative regulator of Mdm2 p19Arf.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Fascinatingly while p19Arf acts as a critical activator of p53 that suppresses tumour genesis it does not alter the phenotype of the Mdm2 hypomorphic mice (11).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	32	 This implies that the normal regulation of p53 is not modulated by p19Arf but that the p19Arf control pathway is activated by early events in the tumorigenic process.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Other genes that modulate wild-type p53 function are fragments of p53 and mutant p53 s.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Most point mutations in p53 that inactivate its function can also act as dominant negative mutants and are thus seen to act as oncogenes in transgenic mouse models.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The affect of the two N-terminal truncations that promote aging is subtler however as they seem to activate wild-type function but perhaps act selectively to promote p53 function at some but not all p53 responsive promoters.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Finally, the two p53 related genes p63 and p73 could also modulate p53 responses in vivo (14).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Recently, further study of the ubiquitin pathway has identified two new E3 s for p53 the Cop1 (15) and Pirh2 (16) proteins.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Thus, negative regulation of p53 seems to occur through at least four E3 or E3-like proteins (COP1, Pirh2, Mdm2, Mdm4) and three of these, Cop1, Pirh2 and Mdm2, are p53-induced genes.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	39	 This creates a very complex and responsive control circuit able to fine-tune the p53 response.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Another new gene that also looks as though it may be a powerful modulator of the response is the deubiquitinating enzyme HAUSP (17 to 19).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Again genetic studies using knock in mice have established that p53 must have an intact N-terminal transactivation domain to function as a tumour suppressor as the knock in mouse that expresses a p53 mutant at amino acids 25 and 26 (20) is no longer able to suppress tumorigenesis and in fact, despite expressing high levels of the mutant p53 protein, has an identical phenotype to a p53 null mouse.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	42	 While a very large number of genes have been identified as potential down stream targets of p53 activation or suppression only three have been established as being of critical importance in vivo these are the pro-apoptotic genes Noxa and Puma (21,22) and the cell cycle regulatory CDK inhibitor p21.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	43	 While knock out of these downstream response genes has a clear affect on the phenotype of the p53 dependant DNA damage response none of the knock out mice have the dramatic tumour prone phenotype of the p53 null mice.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	44	The increased understanding of the control of the p53 pathway that derives from these genetic studies has raised many points at which the pathway may be modulated or inactivated and the pharmaceutical manipulation of the p53 pathway is within our grasp.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	45	 A more sobering reflection however derives from consideration of the probable affects of functional polymorphisms at these loci in the human population.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Thus, we can expect both coding and non-coding polymorphisms at these multiple control loci to be segregating in the population.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	47	 This means that one can readily imagine gene combinations that will give reduced tumour protection or accelerated aging phenotypes.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	48	Inactivation of p53 in human tumours.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	49	Mutation in p53 The most common route by which the p53 pathway is inactivated in human cancers is by mutation in the coding region of the p53 gene.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	50	 These mutations have been extensively catalogued and have provided a powerful database in examining mutational spectra compared with predicted environmental causes of cancer in man.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The mutations occur at many sites within the gene but the most common class of mutation is a point mis-sense mutation in the central DNA binding domain of the protein.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	52	 These mutant proteins can accumulate to high levels in tumour cells where they are readily detected by antibody staining.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The mutations act as dominant negative mutations as the full-length mutant protein will form mixed inactive oligomers with the wild-type protein.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	54	 All of the mutants seem to be defective as transcription factors, which has formed the basis for yeast based functional assay for mutant p53 detection.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Structural and physical biochemical studies of the mutant proteins has helped to promote some understanding as to why mutations at so many different locations in the protein can all inactivate its function.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The current model would suggest that the core DNA binding domain of p53 is only just stable at body temperature, thus very small structural alterations are sufficient to destabilize the protein completely.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	57	 This is consistent with the finding that many of the mutant p53 proteins are temperature sensitive and if expressed at lower temperature can regain p53 wild-type activity.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	58	 It also helps to explain how antibodies to epitopes within the folded core of the protein are exposed by many different p53 mutations (23 to 28).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	59	 As will be discussed later this property of instability may allow the development of novel mutant p53 reactivating compounds.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Why should p53 be so unstable? It is reasonable to suppose that this property may allow its rapid breakdown and close regulation as it would be more difficult to switch off a very stable protein.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Our knowledge of the affects of p53 mutations is still incomplete however.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	62	 In some systems the mutant proteins appeared to have gained new functions beyond that of simply acting as dominant negative p53 mutants and other models make it clear that while p53 is often described as having a domain structure these domains do have a strong interconnection with each other.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Thus, a small mutation in the N-terminal domain of p53 can cause the second site reversion of a temperature sensitive mutation in the DNA binding core of the protein (29).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The accumulation of mutant p53 proteins in cancer cells is not yet understood.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	65	 An attractive model is that the loss of p53 transcription reduces the level of the E3 ligases so that p53 accumulates.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	66	 However, other mechanisms may be at play, because in a knock in mouse model that expresses a mutant p53 protein in all tissues, p53 protein accumulation seems only to occur in cancer cells (T.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	67	Other routes to p53 inactivation Half of all human tumours retain wild-type p53 so how is the tumour suppressor function of p53 bypassed in these systems? One route is by inactivation of upstream signalling pathways; thus, CHK2 mutations have been reported in breast cancers, tumours arise in patients with ATM, loss of p19Arf expression is common in many cancers and amplification and over-expression of Mdm2 may occur in up to 9% of cancers.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In cervical cancers the expression of the HPV E6 protein inactivates p53 and it is probable that as more components of the p53 response pathway are uncovered that it will be possible to see many new ways that the pathway is abrogated.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The role of COP1 Pirh2 and HAUSP for example has yet to be determined.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Overexpression of survival signals and of anti-apototic proteins can also help tumour cells to evade p53 activity.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	71	Therapy and the p53 pathway The implications of the p53 pathway in the treatment of cancer have been appreciated for the last decade.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Many current treatments trigger the p53 response in normal and tumour tissue and a critical question has been whether or not the p53 status of a tumour affects the chance of a response to treatment.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	73	 While in animal models dramatic affects can be seen with p53 wild-type tumours responding much better to chemotherapeutic drugs, the data obtained with human material is less clear cut.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	74	 This reflects the genetic complexity of human cancer, the technical difficulties of working with patient samples and the possibility that many  wild-type  p53 tumours may have other defects in the pathway.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	75	 More encouraging perhaps has been the discovery and development of therapies based on the understanding of the p53 pathway.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	76	p53 gene therapy The delivery of Wt p53 using an adenoviral expression vector has been approved in China as part of a radiotherapy/gene therapy combination for head and neck cancer and a similar  p53 virus  is in a late-stage clinical trial in the USA (30).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	77	 While delivery of the virus to all tumour cells is not possible, bystander affects and possibly immune phenomena may be acting to make these therapies effective.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	78	 It is possible to design more active variants of p53 by introducing mutations that block the binding of the negative regulator Mdm2 or that stabilize the core structure of the protein.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	79	 While these clearly offer a superior performance in model systems more work will be needed to see if they maintain the excellent safety features of the wild-type p53 virus in human trials.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	80	Onyx 0-15 This E1B region deletion mutant of wild-type Adenovirus was first reported to replicate preferentially in cells that lacked wild-type p53 (31).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	81	 This exciting concept proved more complex on closer analysis and the viruses selective replication in tumour cells seems now to depend on tumour cells over-expressing host proteins that compensate for the E1B mutant viruses deficiencies in nuclear export (32).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Nevertheless some encouraging clinical responses were seen and it is to be hoped that development of this therapy, which had the potential to attack systemic disseminated disease, will continue.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	83	Rescuing mutant p53 A number of approaches to the rescue of mutant p53 have been proposed.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Screening programmes have yielded some promising early leads, some of which have shown activity in animal models but the exact mechanism of action of these compounds is disputed.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Early work suggested that peptides derived from the C-terminus of p53 could activate the DNA binding function of some mutant p53 proteins (33 to 37).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Again while the mechanism of this affect has been widely discussed no complete consensus has been achieved.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Strikingly however in the last year Dowdy (38) and his colleagues have shown that such a C-terminal peptide when fused to a cell transport sequence and derived from D amino acids for stability can completely cure an aggressive intraperitoneal tumour in mice.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	88	The non-genotoxic activation of p53 for therapy by inhibiting the p53 to Mdm2 interaction Intense study of the activation of the p53 response has revealed a number of ways to turn on the p53 response without causing DNA damage.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In those tumours that retain wild-type p53 such approaches may yield exciting new treatment options.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Extensive analysis of the p53 to Mdm2 interaction using synthetic peptide libraries, phage display and peptide scaffolds (39 to 42) demonstrated that blocking this interaction was able to activate p53 to induce growth arrest and apoptosis.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The solved crystal structure of the interaction and the peptide database has now allowed two groups to develop small molecule inhibitors of the interaction that can trigger the p53 response (43).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In a very elegant work, a group of compounds called the Nutlins have been shown to activate p53 by blocking p53 binding to Mdm2.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	93	 In xenograft models these lead molecules demonstrated excellent tumour growth control without toxicity.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	94	 These results have greatly encouraged the Pharmaceutical Industry by validating Mdm2 inhibition as a therapeutic target and establishing that protein to protein interactions can be appropriate targets for small molecule drugs.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	95	Other small molecule activators of the p53 response Screening assays based on p53 reporter cells have identified many small molecules that can activate the p53 response without causing DNA damage.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	96	 A particularly potent activator is the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (44 to 46).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	97	 This streptomycete antibiotic binds to and inhibits the nuclear exportin protein CRM1.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The inhibition of export activates p53 dependent transcription dramatically and while it must affect many other proteins as well, cell based studies have shown that much of the cell cycle and apoptotic response to leptomycin B is p53 dependent.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	99	 While normal cells can recover from a leptomycin-induced p53 dependent growth arrest the compound induces apoptotic death in p53 wild-type human tumour cells.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Other molecules that are non-genotoxic activators of the p53 response include the cdk inhibitor Roscovitine (47,48).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The R isomer (CYC202) of this compound is currently in clinical trial.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	102	 CYC202 appears to induce p53 by partially inhibiting transcription.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The link between transcription and signalling to p53 is currently the focus of intense study as it may represent a unifying principal in how the p53 pathway senses cellular stress that should invoke the p53 system.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	104	The p53 protein is controlled by multiple negative regulators and activators to ensure that it achieves a high therapeutic index, protecting the organism from cancer whilst not damaging too many stem cells.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	105	 In order to escape the p53 pathway nearly all human cancers have either mutated the p53 gene itself or altered the sensitivity or effectiveness of the pathway.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Cancer cells are exceptionally sensitive to reactivation of p53 function and therefore treatments that achieve this promise to be exceptionally effective.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The use of p53 in gene therapy has already been approved and several small molecules that can activate the p53 pathway without non-specific toxicity are under development.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	108	 One of these, a small molecule cdk inhibitor is in phase 11 clinical trial.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Expanding knowledge of the p53 pathway means that further strategies to manipulate the p53 pathway are emerging rapidly and one can predict that the next 25 years should see our knowledge of this fascinating protein being put to extensive clinical use for the benefit of patients worldwide.

0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	112	 When p53 is active it induces three classes of genes that have been established genetically to be essential for its function.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	113	 One class exemplified by the CDK inhibitor protein p21 can cause cell cycle arrest.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Another class exemplified by the BH3 domain proteins Puma and Noxa promote apoptosis, while a third class of genes exemplified by Mdm2, Pirh2 and Cop1 act to negative regulate p53 activity.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The activity of this group of negative regulators, is in turn, moderated by the HAUSP and Arf proteins.

0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The activity of Mdm2 as an E3 ligase is inhibited by Mdm2 itself, acting to ubiquitinate itself promoting auto-ubiquitination and degradation.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	118	 This activity is counteracted by the HAUSP isopeptidase that can stabilize and activate Mdm2.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Removal of HAUSP can therefore activate p53 by reducing the activity of Mdm2 as an inhibitor of p53 function.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This diagram outlines a range of cellular stresses that can  activate  p53 and lists the modifiers and partners that were discussed at the meeting.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	8	 It is not a comprehensive list of all stresses, modifiers and outputs involved in the p53 pathway.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	9	  It was in this light, that on the 25th anniversary of the discovery of p53, the 12th International p53 Workshop was held in Dunedin, New Zealand, in November 2004.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The take home message from this latest biennial gathering of p53 researchers could be summarized in one word,  complexity .
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We learnt that p53 is complex on many levels genomic structure, regulation and function.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In fact, it is far more complex than any one of us could have possibly imagined.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This  theme of complexity  was established in the opening address by David Lane and it continued throughout the meeting.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In this report, we have endeavoured to cover as many of the oral presentations as possible but inevitably a few have been omitted.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In addition, we have paid particular attention to describing some highlights, areas of new investigation and on-going research that appear to be integral to the p53 field.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	16	p63/p73 Although not a major feature of this conference, several talks discussed p63 and p73, relatives of p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Given the similarity between the different protein isoforms encoded by these genes, and using the domain structure of p53 as a model, X.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	18	Chen (Birmingham, AL, USA) has been mapping domains in the isoforms of p63 and p73 that are critical for transcriptional activation, growth arrest and apoptosis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	19	 He showed, in particular, that the two activation domains of p53 (amino acid residues 1 to 42 and 43 to 63) are represented in the full-length and N-terminally deleted (N) versions of both p63 and p73, and are critical for all three functions.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	20	Stiewe (Wurzburg, Germany) showed that reduction of p73 expression was sufficient to induce telomerase activity in telomerase negative cells, suggesting that p73 could be an endogenous repressor of telomerase activity.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Stiewe also showed that hTERT is downregulated by p73 but upregulated by the ectopic expression of the dominant negative Np73.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These data agree with the observations that p73 upregulation accompanies differentiation, which in turn is coupled to a loss of telomerase activity.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	23	In the absence of functional p53, p73 is phosphorylated and acetylated after DNA damage to activate pro-apoptotic genes.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	24	 As described below, Pin-1 a propyl isomerase is an important regulator of p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	25	Del Sal (Trieste, Italy) has been examining the role of this prolyl-isomerase in the activation of p73.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	26	 His studies elegantly demonstrate a clear requirement for Pin-1 in regulating the stability and conformation of p73 after DNA damage, and the ability of p73 to activate gene expression and to induce apoptosis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Furthermore, he showed that c-abl regulates the Pin-1 modulation of p73 by phosphorylating amino acid residue tyr99, thus linking p73 into one of the same signalling pathways that regulates p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	28	Modifications to p53 are thought to be a part of the signalling process that  directs  p53 to carry out a particular task, whether it be cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair or some other process in which p53 plays a role.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	29	 However, the importance of any particular modification for regulating p53 function is unclear as there are many conflicting reports.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	30	 These conflicts, which were evident at this meeting also, may well reflect the use of different assay systems, the analysis of only limited p53 target genes and in vitro versus in vivo approaches.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	31	Post-translational modifications phosphorylation S.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	32	Shieh (Taipei, Taiwan) addressed the role of the checkpoint kinases, Chk1 and Chk2, in p53 regulation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	33	 She showed that in addition to phosphorylation of known N-terminal residues, phosphorylation on ser313, ser314, thr377 and ser378 were also found.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Furthermore, downregulation of Chk1 and Chk2 not only reduced the phosphorylation of ser20 as expected but also reduced the acetylation of lys382, leading to poor induction of the CDKN1A gene encoding the cyclin inhibitory protein p21WAF1/CIP1.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The data suggest that Chk1 and Chk2 may regulate p53 function in several ways and not just by N-terminal phosphorylation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Such data serve to emphasize the importance of the C-terminus in regulating p53 function, a theme that was repeated throughout the meeting.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In addition, it is interesting to note that germline mutations of Chk2 have been found in some Li Fraumeni families that have wt TP53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Further evidence for the apparent complexity in Chk2 regulation of p53 function was provided by Y.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Specific mutation of pro82 prevented binding of Chk2 and Chk2-dependent phosphorylation of ser20 after DNA damage.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In his attempts to identify the functional relevance of this aspect, Haupt looked at the role of Pin-1 in facilitating the Chk2 modulation of p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Previous studies had shown that activation and stabilization of p53 by Pin-1 requires specific phosphorylation of p53 on ser33, tyr81 and tyr150.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Experiments in Pin1 to / to  mouse fibroblasts were used to show that Pin-1 is also essential for phosphorylation at ser23 in mouse p53 (equivalent of ser20 in human p53) and stabilization of p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Haupt also showed that Pin-1 enhances formation of Chk2/p53 complexes early after DNA damage and requires pro82.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	44	 He therefore proposed a model in which p53 phosphorylation at specific residues permits binding of Pin-1, which then alters the conformation of p53 to allow binding of Chk2.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Chk2 then phosphorylates ser20, thus releasing p53 from Mdm-2 and stabilizing/activating p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	46	 A similar conclusion with respect to phosphorylation and the role of Pin-1 in regulating the interaction between p53 and Mdm-2, was reached by G.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	47	Prives (New York, USA) was unable to demonstrate any N-terminal phosphorylation of mouse p53 by Chk2 after DNA damage, and downregulation of Chk1 and Chk2 by siRNA failed to affect p53 function before or after DNA damage.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Further, questioning the importance of phosphorylation in regulating p53 function, L.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	49	Manfredi's group, New York, USA), using an artificial system involving tetracycline-regulated p53 expression and therefore not involving DNA damage, reported that p53 is not phosphorylated on ser6 and only poorly phosphorylated on ser15 and ser37 and yet binds DNA very efficiently, at least to the p53 response element in the CDKN1A promoter.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Furthermore, using proteosome inhibitors to elevate p53 levels, she showed that DNA binding, either in vitro or in vivo was not affected by the absence of phosphorylation on ser15 and ser392, and no acetylation at lys382.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	51	 So, if post-translational modifications are not required for p53 activity, what are they required for? A probable answer is that p53 may carry out many functions once it has reached a threshold concentration.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	52	 It may need to be  told  to activate a specific promoter by processes, such as phosphorylation or acetylation or by interacting proteins.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	53	Braithwaite (Dunedin, NZ) also failed to observe phosphorylation on N-terminal residues using hormone inducible p53, but still obtained activation of the CDKN1A and MDM-2 promoters.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	54	 However, no induction of the NOXA or BAX promoters was observed.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	55	Some support for the idea that phosphorylation on specific residues controls p53 specificity, at least in part, came from the presentation by S.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Phosphorylation on ser46 is known to be important for p53 to induce apoptosis, at least in some instances, yet the kinase responsible for ser46 phosphorylation is unknown.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The data from Soddu's work suggested that the enzyme could be HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting kinase 2), a member of a novel ser/thr kinase family.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Her studies were initiated by an observation that thyroid papillary tumours (TPA) have wt p53 and yet high levels of the anti-apoptotic protein galectin-3, expression of which is normally repressed by wt p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Soddu showed that these tumours have allelic loss on chr7q32 to 34, which encompasses the HIPK2 gene locus and that wt p53 can only repress galectin-3, when HIPK2 is present.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	60	 So, HIPK2 activates an apoptotic pathway that involves phosphorylation of p53 on ser46 and inhibition of the p53-mediated repression of galectin-3.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	61	Ubiquitination, Mdm-2 and the control of p53 stability It seems clear from the above discussion that much of the activity of p53 is dependent on its concentration (also discussed later).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Thus, it is not only post-translational modifications, but also the level of p53 that must be regulated precisely.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	63	 In a comprehensive analysis of enzymes required for ubiquitination of p53, D.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	64	Lane (Dundee, Scotland) identified UbcH5B/C as an E2-like protein involved in controlling the levels of p53 and Mdm-2.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Knockdown of UbcH5B/C increased levels of p53, but this p53 was transcriptionally inactive being still bound to Mdm-2, which is also modified by UbcH5B/C.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Activation of the stabilized p53 thus requires the removal of bound Mdm-2.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	67	 These results in conjunction with the recent discovery that both p53 and Mdm-2 can be modified by the ubiquitin-like NEDD8, a well-characterized regulator of p27kip1 and IB levels, demonstrate that there are now at least two pathways resulting in ubiquitination and inactivation of p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Both pathways involve Mdm-2 in a two-step stabilization and subsequent inactivation of p53: the NEDD pathway and UbcH5B/C that ubiquitinate both p53 and Mdm-2.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Understanding of this new complexity for p53 regulation has important implications for the design and use of therapeutic modulators of the p53/Mdm-2 interaction.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	70	 In addition, work presented by M.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	71	Melino's group, Leicester, UK) showed that both p63 and p73 are also subject to tight control by ubiquitin-like degradation processes.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	72	 He reported on the discovery of a new NEDD-like E3 ligase called Aip4/Itch that downregulates p73 upon DNA damage.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	73	Consistent with these and other data presented at the meeting, G.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	74	Wahl (La Jolla, USA) showed that in normal fibroblasts, DNA damage induces phosphorylation of ser15 on p53, but this occurred 2 h prior to induction of CDKN1A or MDM-2.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	75	 This means that phosphorylation of ser15 does not always equate to  active  p53 protein.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	76	 During this time however, p53 becomes much more stable, as Mdm-2 becomes unstable.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Proteosome inhibitors (to block Mdm-2 degradation) inhibited the transactivation function of p53 in this system, suggesting that the decrease in Mdm-2 stability contributed to p53 activation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Thus, if there is sufficient DNA damage, Mdm-2 stability is reduced and p53 becomes activated without a requirement for phosphorylation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	79	 These data provide a possible explanation for how p53 can be functional in the absence of N-terminal phosphorylation and also in p53 mutants lacking conserved serine and threonine residues (see above).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Thus, once again p53 level may be the critical determiner of function.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	81	To add to the complexity of Mdm-2 regulation, M.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	82	Oren (Rehovot, Israel) described studies reporting that Mdm-2 can directly bind the core histones and Mdm-2 mono-ubiquitinates H2A and H2B in vitro.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	83	 In a GAL4 DNA-binding reporter system, Mdm-2 repressed transcription from a GAL4-response promoter, suggesting that Mdm-2 might repress transcription via changes to chromatin.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Using ChiP analysis, Oren also showed that Mdm-2 can complex with p53 on the CDKN1A promoter in vivo and ubiquitinate residues on H2B.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	85	 The data imply that Mdm-2 may drive gene silencing in its own right via chromatin modification.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	86	New p53-binding proteins In common with agents that induce post-translational modifications of p53, p53-binding proteins appear important in  instructing  a specific response from p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The list of these proteins continues to expand, and several new members were discussed at the meeting.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	88	Taya (Tokyo, Japan) reported that the cytoplasmic protein, clathrin, which normally plays a role in the formation of  coated pits  in vesicle transport, binds p53 and influences its function.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	89	 He reported that clathrin binds the N-terminus and to the S46F mutant in particular.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Interestingly, phosphorylation of this residue is reported to be important for the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis (see data reported by Soddu).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	91	 He went on to show by transfection and reporter assays, that clathrin enhanced p53-dependent activation of apoptosis inducing protein 1 (AIP1) and other p53-dependent promoters, which was particularly marked for the S46F mutant.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In addition, RNAi studies showed that downregulation of clathrin partially ablated the ability of p53 to transactivate several target genes after UV exposure.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	93	Binding of p53 by the Y-box factor, YB1, was reported by A.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	94	 YB1 binds the C-terminus of p53 and like clathrin, is generally located in the cytoplasm.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	95	 YB1 translocates to the nucleus in response to various stresses and regulates transcription of several tumour-associated genes.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	96	 In tumours, nuclear localization and over-expression of YB1 are associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Braithwaite showed that YB1 requires a transcriptionally active p53 for translocation and does not appear to require direct binding.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Once in the nucleus, he showed that YB1 partially inhibits p53 activity.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Genes such as BAX and NOXA involved in apoptosis were inhibited by YB1, but CDKN1A and MDM-2 were not inhibited.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	100	 However, knockdown of YB1 with antisense oligonucleotides increased NOXA expression in a p53-dependent manner.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Braithwaite proposed that YB1 reduces the ability of p53 to bind target promoters of low affinity, such as those in the apoptotic pathway, and that this partial inhibition of p53 function may contribute to cancer formation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	102	A very interesting p53 binding partner discovered 2 years ago by G.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	103	Del Sal (Trieste, Italy), is Pin-1, a propyl-isomerase.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Pin-1 induces a conformational change on phosphorylated p53 facilitating further post-translational modifications, particularly acetylation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	105	 In this sense it is an important regulator of p53 function and is often over-expressed in common human cancers, such as prostate and breast.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Pin-1 also influences p53 regulation by Mdm-2 (see Haupt) and appears to have analogous effects on p73.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	107	Lu (London, UK) expanded her work on the pro-apoptotic ASPP (so-called because they comprise Ankrin repeats, SH3 domains and a Poly Proline domain) proteins and their effect on p53 function.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The ankyrin repeats bind p53 within the N-terminus.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	109	 It is of interest to note that, the polymorphism arg72 binds ASPP to a lesser extent than pro72.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	110	 When ASPP proteins bind p53, they augment the ability of p53 to transactivate pro-apoptotic genes, but have no effect on the ability of p53 to transactivate cell-cycle genes.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Although data were presented showing a similar selective influence by ASPP proteins for p73 and p63, much of the talk was focused on the regulation of ASPP function.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Biochemical studies showed that ASPP1 is a substrate for MAP-kinase (MAPK), and that both ASPP1 and ASPP2 are stabilized by MAPK.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Interestingly, RNAi downregulation of ras, inhibited ASPP1 and ASPP2 mediated p53-dependent apoptosis, demonstrating that ASPP proteins link p53-dependent apoptosis to a ras-signalling pathway.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	114	 In studies looking at transcriptional regulation of ASPP1 and ASPP2, they found binding motifs for E2F-3 (ASPP1, 4; ASPP2, 2 common to ASPP1) in both promoters.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	115	 That E2F-1 could bind these motifs was confirmed by in vivo (chromatin immunoprecipitation, ChIP) and in vitro (reporter) assays.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	116	 E2F-3 was also shown to activate both promoters.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	117	 However, only E2F-1 and E2F-2 can strongly activate the ASPP2 promoter.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Transfection of E2F-1 was able to induce ASPP1 and ASPP2 mRNA, leading to a proposal that induction of ASPP1 and ASPP2 by E2F-1 might sensitize cells to apoptosis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	119	Finally, the importance of TGFss as a regulator of p53 function was discussed by M.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Using cells derived from TGFss1 knockout mice, she found that radiation induced p53-dependent growth arrest and apoptosis were defective.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	121	 The defect was associated with an absence of ser15 phosphorylation but no overall change in p53 levels was observed and there was also no direct interaction between TGFss and p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	122	 In addition, studies with small molecule inhibitors of TGFss signalling led to a similar conclusion that TGFss is a regulator of the p53 DNA damage response.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Additional evidence of a link between the TGFss and p53 pathways, was provided by M.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	124	Agarwal (Cleveland, USA) who showed that TGFss mediates a p53-dependent protective cell-cycle arrest in response to dNTP imbalance.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	125	For many years it was thought that, like induction of cell-cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis by p53 was due solely to the transactivation of pro-apoptotic genes.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	126	 However, transactivation-independent apoptosis does occur in some cells.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	127	 This area has been pioneered by U.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	128	Moll (New York, USA) who believes that p53 induces mitochondrial apoptosis directly.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	129	 In support of this, she showed convincing evidence of p53 associating with mitochondria.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	130	 This association occurred only during p53-dependent apoptosis and in radiosensitive tissues, such as spleen and thymus, and was earlier to transactivation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	131	 She also showed that p53 binds the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl to 2 and Bcl-xL.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Using modelling techniques she predicted that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL would bind p53 within the central, specific DNA-binding domain.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Using the classic cytochrome C (cyt C) release assay, she showed that tumour-derived mutants of p53 are defective for binding Bcl-xL and prevent cyt C release from mitochondria.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	134	Murphy (Philadelphia, USA) provided independent evidence that certain p53 mutants (those that cannot oligomerize) fail to bind Bak and as a consequence are defective for p53-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	135	 These data suggest that tumour-derived mutants have a double-hit, i.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	136	 they cannot induce mitochondrial death and are transcriptionally inactive too!.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	137	Further support for a direct role of p53 at the mitochondrion was provided by D.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	138	Green (San Diego, USA) who has developed a sophisticated model system using isolated outer and inner mitochondrial membrane vesicles, as well as synthetic lipid vesicles containing dextran, to examine how individual Bcl-2 family proteins function.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	139	 During apoptosis, pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family act to permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membranes, without a requirement for the inner membranes or mitochondrial proteins.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	140	 As a result, cyt C is released in a manner that is sudden, rapid and complete.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Using this system, he looked at induction of apoptosis by p53 in intact cells and cytoplasts and concluded that the nucleus is dispensable for apoptosis! To further look at the function of endogenous p53 in apoptosis, he purified native p53 from various cell lines after UV treatment, as well as several p53 mutants including Pro (deleted the polyproline domain between residues 62 and 92) and examined their interaction with Bcl-2 family proteins and their ability to induce cyt C release.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Based on these studies, he proposed a model whereby after stabilization, p53 accumulates in the cytoplasm but is held  inactive  by Bcl-xL.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Nuclear p53 then activates BAX and PUMA transcription.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Puma accumulates in the cytoplasm and p53 is liberated from Bcl-xL by Puma.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Bax can then be activated by p53, cyt C is released and cell death occurs.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	146	Strasser (Melbourne, Australia) investigated the roles of PUMA and NOXA in p53-dependent apoptosis by generating specific knockout mice.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Thymocytes from NOXA  to / to  mice died after radiation or exposure to various DNA damaging agents but similar cells from PUMA to / to  mice were resistant.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Fibroblasts from PUMA to / to  mice were also much more resistant to apoptosis compared with NOXA to / to  fibroblasts.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	149	 He concluded that neither NOXA nor PUMA were required for normal development, but that PUMA and to a lesser extent, NOXA, were involved in mediating p53-dependent apoptosis, although tissue differences were noted.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Interestingly, he also showed that loss of PUMA protected cells from diverse p53-independent cytotoxics, such as staurosporine, glucocortocids, phorbol ester and cytokine withdrawal, suggesting that PUMA is not specific to p53 pathways.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	151	 By crossing PUMA to / to  and +/ to  mice with E micro-myc mice, they found that loss of PUMA accelerated tumour growth, consistent with its role as a tumour suppressor.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	152	Shibue (Tokyo, Japan) also generated NOXA and PUMA knockout mice with similar results to Strasser for isolated thymocytes and embryo fibroblasts.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	153	An interesting presentation was given by R.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	154	Wiman's group, Stockholm, Sweden).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	155	 It has long been known that p53 represses hTERT, but in this talk, the tables have been turned and now hTERT antagonizes the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis, which may be of clinical relevance (see Royds).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	156	Attardi (Palo Alto, USA) used a similar approach, but rather than using tumour mutants she examined the importance of p53 transactivation function in vivo, by generating knock-in mice with a p53 gene mutated at residues 25 and 26 to abolish transactivation and Mdm-2 binding.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	157	 By looking at various p53 parameters in fibroblasts derived from these mice, she confirmed that the mutant is markedly defective for gene activation under most conditions used, and also defective for cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	158	 However, there were some treatment-specific differences.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	159	 For example, the mutation could induce BAX expression after DNA damage, but was completely defective for induction of CDKN1A or NOXA.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Interestingly, she was unable to obtain homozygous mutant mice owing to embryonic lethality.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	161	 These data suggest that transcriptionally competent p53 is required for normal embryogenesis, yet paradoxically, mice that are deleted for TP53 generally develop in a normal fashion, although a significant proportion of female TP53 null mice show ex-encephaly.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Attardi's mutant mice therefore may have some gain-of-function that has yet to be described.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	163	Wahl (La Jolla, USA) also engineered a knock-in mouse in which the 7 C-terminal lysine residues were changed to arginine (7KR).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	164	 As indicated elsewhere in this review, modifications to these residues are thought to be important in dictating the nature of the p53 response to DNA damage.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Wahl showed however that these mice and cells derived from them, behaved essentially as cells with wt p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Thus, once again we have this conflict as to how critical post-translational modifications are for p53 function.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	167	An interesting variation on the use of transgenic and knockout mice was reported by A.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	168	Blackburn (Canberra, Australia) who is looking for modifiers of mammary gland tumourigenesis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	169	 One characteristic of Li-Fraumeni families is the early onset of breast cancer (50% risk by 50 years of age).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	170	 She has developed a mouse model for Li-Fraumeni (p53+/ to ) on a Balb/c background in which the incidence of mammary tumours is very high, whereas in a C57BL/6 background, the mice are very resistant to the formation of these tumours.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	171	 By crossing these two strains of mice and carrying out linkage analysis on second generation offsprings she identified a region of chromosome 7 (SuprMam1) and Chromosome 2 (SuprMam2) which were linked to increased frequency and reduced latency of tumour onset.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	172	Bulavin (Singapore) used an approach of replacing the mouse p53 gene with a human p53 (SWAP mice).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	173	 These mice do not develop spontaneous tumours and live twice as long as their p53-null counterparts.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Furthermore, induction of SWAP p53 after ionizing radiation did not induce apoptosis in the thymus and spleen and even more surprisingly, in crosses with E micro-myc mice, SWAP p53 did not prevent rapid onset of tumourigenesis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Thus, although the approach is novel, as SWAP p53 behaves very differently from expectations, its merits are unclear.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	176	In the study by Tlsty, molecular pathways underlying tumourigenesis in breast epithelial cells were investigated.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) were grown until a rare variant (vHMEC) was produced which propagated beyond the Hayflick barrier.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Tlsty showed that these cells have uncoupled the tight controls linking cell division and DNA replication and that this is associated with a loss of p16INK4A expression by hypermethylation of the p16INK4A gene promoter.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	179	 When HMEC (normal p16INK4A) and vHMEC (silenced p16INK4A) were further examined, it was noted that the levels of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 were high in vHMEC, but very low in HMEC.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Biochemical studies indicated that p16INK4A might be regulating p53 stability.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	181	 This reciprocal relationship between p16INK4A and p53 expressions, however, was not true of fibroblasts.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	182	 As silencing of p16INK4A expression occurs in islands of cells in normal breast, the suggestion is that this represents an early stage in tumorigenesis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	183	An elegant two-step mouse model of multistage skin carcinogenesis has been developed by Chris Kemp (Seattle, USA), in which initial treatment with DMBA results in Ha-ras gene mutation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Continuous exposure to TPA then leads to mutation of p53, loss of the remaining p53 allele and finally to amplification of the mutated H-ras gene.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	185	 His group has demonstrated a clear progression from normal cells to papillomas, then to tumours and metastases in this model.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Knowing that p53 is activated either by DNA damage (via ATM and ATR) or via oncogene activation (via p19ARF), he asked which activation pathway regulates p53 tumour suppressor activity.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	187	 To this end, tumours were generated in ATM to / to , p19ARF to / to  and p53 to / to  mice.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	188	 All tumours, irrespective of stage, had Ha-ras mutations, confirming that this was the initiating event.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Consistent with this pathway, p53 levels were elevated in papillomas from normal and ATM to / to  mice, but not in tumours from p19ARF to / to  mice.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The absence of p53 function accelerated malignant conversion from papilloma to carcinoma in p19ARF to / to  mice and p53 to / to  mice and was associated with metastasis, supporting the idea that induction of p53 suppressed metastasis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The importance of p19ARF to p53 induction was further shown by the fact that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of ARF in carcinomas overcame the need for subsequent LOH of TP53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Their data support the idea that, in this system, selection for p53 mutations is not due to external stress or DNA damage (i.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	193	 signalling via ATM), but rather, it results directly from signalling from the initiating oncogenic lesion via p19ARF.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Importantly, such data provide an explanation as to why mutational alteration of p53 is often a late event in the development of human malignancies.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	195	Further to the importance of natural genetic variants, A.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	196	Levine (New Jersey, USA) in an outstanding talk, identified 1335 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 82 genes directly involved in the p53 pathway the vast majority being in non-coding regions.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Analysis of the MDM-2 promoter has identified an SNP within the first intron, at nucleotide 309.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Within the general population 12% are G/G, 40% G/T and 48% are T/T (wt).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Functional analysis predicts that having G makes a better Sp1 binding motif (which was confirmed using gel shift assays) and increases transcriptional activity by Sp1 in reporter assays.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The importance of this is that in cells with Sp1, endogenous levels of Mdm-2 are higher in cells with G/G than T/T; as a consequence, these cells are more resistant to apoptotic cell death than T/T cells, because less  active  p53 is available so only high affinity promoters will be activated.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	201	At a clinical level, analysis of 115 independent lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) derived from Caucasion and African American patients, showed a normal distribution of SNPs in the proportion of cells undergoing apoptotic cell death in response to DNA damage, but the 11 cell lines with highest resistance to death were from patients with G/G.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	202	 More evidence of clinical relevance came from a study of Li-Fraumeni patients and a cohort of patients in Germany with adult soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and breast cancer.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	203	 There was an earlier age of onset (10 to 15 years) for STS and breast cancer (5 years earlier) in patients with G/G versus TT at 309.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	204	 There was also a significantly increased association of SNP309 with the occurrence of secondary cancers in Li-Fraumeni patients.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	205	p53 and gliomas Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal form of brain tumour and is characterized by frequent recurrence.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	206	 GBM is highly invasive, resistant to apoptosis and almost completely refractory to treatment.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	207	Kim (Luebeck, Germany) presented an interesting talk on an interaction between p53 and ets-1 in progression of glioblastoma.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Over-expression and activation of the transcription factor ets-1, which increases expression of pro-invasive genes, such as MMPs, pre-senilin and integrins in invasive GBM, has been well documented, but the underlying molecular basis is unknown.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	209	 She showed that wt p53 binds ets-1 and inhibits its ability to activate pro-invasive genes.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Ets-1 induction of thromboxane mRNA is inhibited by p53 (and binding of p53 to ets-1) in transient transfections.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Ets-1 also complexes with several p53 mutants that enhance the ability of ets-1 to activate transcription.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Her data suggest that in GBM, there is a selection against wt p53 function, the result of which is to aid in the upregulation of pro-invasive genes by ets-1.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	213	Royds (Dunedin, NZ) examined the relationship between TP53 mutations and telomere maintenance (TM) in gliomas.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Two mechanisms for TM have been described in gliomas, one requiring the enzyme telomerase and the other a recombinational method designated as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	215	 This latter mechanism was described in more detail by R.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	216	Reddel (Sydney, Australia) who demonstrated that ALT is manifested by a rapid increase in telomere length and the appearance in the nuclei of ALT-associated PML bodies.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Moreover, he showed that ALT is repressed by sequestration of the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 recombination complex by Sp100.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Royds found a high correlation between TP53 mutations and ALT, but not with telomerase.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Since ALT is based on telomere-specific recombination events, and p53 is a strong repressor of recombination, these data suggest that loss of p53 early in tumourigenesis might facilitate the acquisition of ALT.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Interestingly, ALT was found to be associated with a significantly better outcome than telomerase for patients with high grade gliomas.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	221	 However, there was a correlation between wt TP53 and telomerase in gliomas.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Wt TP53 gliomas showed high expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 but not apoptosis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	223	 The data by Rahman showing that hTERT inhibits p53 directed apoptosis, may provide some explanation for these findings.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	224	p53 and colorectal cancer The results of a large international study on the prognostic significance of TP53 mutations in colorectal cancer involving 3583 cases and 25 different research groups was outlined by B.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Mutation in TP53 was found to be associated with markers of poor prognosis, such as vascular and lymphatic invasion and advanced Dukes' stage.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Interestingly for tumours of the distal colon, mutations of p53 that give rise to truncated protein were associated with worse survival.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Response to adjuvant chemotherapy was favourable for patients with Dukes' C stage rectal tumours if they harboured a wt TP53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	228	The C-terminus of p53 Using a gel shift assay based system to estimate the affinity of different p53 proteins to bind linear double-stranded oligonucleotides, C.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	229	Prives (New York, USA) provided some intriguing data to suggest that p53 might find its specific motifs by sliding along linear DNA; and that this function requires the C-terminus.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Support for this idea was provided further by M.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	231	Kulesz-Martin (Oregon, USA) using a combination of ChiP and western blotting analysis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	232	 She showed wt mouse p53 was much more efficient at binding and activating the CDKN1A promoter in vivo, than the mouse alternative splice variant (p53AS) that contains a very different C-terminus.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	233	 She suggested that non-specific DNA binding facilitates localization of p53 to specific response elements via a sliding mechanism.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	234	 This was tested by looking at the binding of p53 to genomic DNA.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The p53AS form binds genomic DNA much more slowly than wtp53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	236	 So perhaps, p53 having located DNA damage, then slides along the DNA to locate its binding motifs in promoters as a rapid response to stress?.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	237	Further data on the importance of the C-terminus was provided by K.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	238	Chen's group, Birmingham, AL, USA).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	239	 She showed that p53 activation domain 2 (amino acid residues 43 to 63) is required for transcription of the pro-apoptotic insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) but the C-terminal basic domain (amino acid residues 364 to 393) is inhibitory.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Activation domain 1 (amino acid residues 1 to 42) controls the inhibitory action of the C-terminus.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Inhibition of apoptosis is thus alleviated by deletion of both of these domains.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	242	 The C-termini of p63 and p73 also inhibit induction of IGFBP3.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	243	Transcriptional regulation by p53 As has been discussed elsewhere in this report, several lines of evidence point to multiple mechanisms by which p53 regulates transcriptional activation: there is functional variation between p53 mutants, cofactor diversity, differences in binding motifs and differences in stress-specific responses.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	244	 In addition, there are differences in promoter architecture between different p53 response genes, e.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	245	 the CDKN1A promoter possesses two p53 binding sequences upstream of TATA/Inr element; the FAS/APO1 promoter has one p53 binding motif downstream of an Inr and PTEN has a p53 binding motif adjacent to a GC-rich sequence.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	246	 It is generally believed that p53 links upstream enhancer factors to mediators and the basal transcription machinery.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The advent of ChIP has allowed detailed in vivo analyses of p53-dependent activation of transcription.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Using a time-course ChIP approach, B.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	249	Emerson (La Jolla, USA) presented the results of elegant studies into the relationship between core transcription factors, p53, and the responses of p53 target promoters to different types of DNA damage.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Focusing on the CDKN1A promoter, prior to UV DNA damage, p53 is bound to its motifs but unphosphorylated at ser15.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Histone acetyl transferase (HAT; bound to p53) and TBP (bound to the TATA-box) are also present, but there is no transcription.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	252	 TAF250 is only recruited to the TBP pre-initiation complex after UV damage and when the promoter is active.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	253	 In contrast, TFIIB and RNA polymerase II are bound before damage, but not present after damage.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	254	 This RNA polymerase II is the unphosphorylated and active but non-elongating form of the enzyme; elongation activity is activated shortly after UV damage.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Histone acetylation and TAF250 recruitment occur prior to phosphorylation of ser15 on p53 and the stabilization of p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Therefore, the CDKN1A promoter is poised for action in response to DNA damage.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	257	 However, induction is transient because TFIIB is quickly lost, so RNA polymerase II cannot rebind and transcription is not sustained.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	258	 In contrast, the CDKN1A response to doxorubicin is biphasic.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	259	 After exposure, there is no recruitment of TAF250 to the CDKN1A promoter but there is an increase in TFIIB.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	260	 So after the initial burst of  ready-to-go  transcription and loss of RNA polymerase II, the increase in TFIIB means that TFIIB tends to stay on the promoter, recruit more RNA polymerase II and therefore, another wave of transcription.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	261	Interestingly, the affinity of RNA polymerase II for the CDKN1A promoter is the highest amongst the p53 target genes (along with other genes associated with growth arrest and DNA repair).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	262	 These promoters have plenty of paused RNA polymerase II compared with the apoptotic response genes.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Analysis of the FAS/APO1 promoter, which has very low levels of paused bound RNA polymerase II, showed that there is recruitment of TAF250 in response to UV but not doxorubicin, and low levels of bound TFIIB and paused RNA polymerase II remain constant after damage by UV and doxorubicin.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	264	 In this case, there is little pre-initiation complex present before DNA damage but it persists afterwards, and therefore, initiation of transcription by p53 is delayed compared with CDKN1A.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	265	 These results provide the basis for an explanation of how p53 generates rapid cell-cycle arrest responses but more delayed apoptotic responses.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	266	Several studies have attempted large-scale screening of small molecules that might reactivate mutant p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	267	Fersht's group, Cambridge, UK) provided preliminary data of an NMR approach that could be used to evaluate the effects of small molecule effects on p53 structure, thus allowing the rationale design of molecules.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	268	 They are now using NMR as a sensitive tool for screening novel molecules that bind weakly to p53 and might then be refined.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	269	 The advantage of this system is that only compounds that bind and alter p53 structure are detected and the approach can be automated for high throughput screening.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	270	Wiman (Stockholm, Sweden) reported on efforts to identify small molecules that might be used to reactivate normal p53 function in mutants.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Using a high-throughput screen of small molecules able to induce growth arrest or apoptosis in cells stably expressing mutant R273H, they originally identified PRIMA-1.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	272	 PRIMA-1 inhibits tumourigenesis of human xenografts and may prove useful in sensitizing cells to killing by current anticancer drugs.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Biochemical studies suggest that this sensitization may result from increased levels of mutant p53 induced by low levels of drug (e.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	274	 cisplatin), which increases the available pool of p53 for reactivation by PRIMA-1.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	275	 With this in mind, he proposed that any agent capable of elevating mutant p53 levels might synergize with PRIMA-1 to kill cells.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Using a similar approach, this group has also identified another small compound, MIRA-1, that can also reactivate mutant p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	277	Drummond (Auckland, NZ) described a compound called SN28049 that upregulates the death receptors Fas and DR5, and is preferentially cytotoxic in tumour cells with wt p53 activity.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	278	However, beyond its role in tumour suppression, and having regard for the many complex signalling pathways with which p53 appears to be involved in (Figure 1), Levine proposed that p53 may be a  ubiquitous sensor  of stress and as such is involved in the prevention of other, possibly aging-related disorders.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	279	 These, he suggested, may include diabetes, arthritis, atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases, for which there is indeed some evidence already (2 to 4), and even psychological stresses.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Thus, rather than just acting to prevent genetic lesions accumulating in somatic tissues which can lead to cancer, p53 may act to dampen many physiological stresses that may, if unchecked, lead to disorders.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Such responses may often be beneficial in the short-term, but long-term dysregulation can cause damage to body organs, resulting in premature ageing.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	282	 This cumulative wear and tear is known as allostatic load (5).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	283	 The idea that p53 may be important in the control of allostatic load is very exciting as it may well account for the large diversity of signals that appear to  activate  p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	284	 A handle on this might be obtained by analysing patients for polymorphisms in TP53 and in other members of the p53 pathway, such as the SNP309 discussed above, and correlating them with various ageing-related phenotypes.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	285	 It will be interesting to see if anyone picks up this gauntlet and has data by the time of the next meeting, potentially opening up even more areas of investigation, for the next generation of p53 researchers.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	286	In the final analysis, perhaps the timeless words of T.
