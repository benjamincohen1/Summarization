0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The study of the interactions between HPV and DC or LC has been complicated by the fact that native infectious HPV virions cannot be isolated in large enough quantities either in vitro or in vivo.

0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	147	, 2003), we examined the role of clathrin-coated-pit-mediated endocytosis in the entry of HPV 16 VLPs in LC and DC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	148	 These cells were preincubated with chlorpromazine, which inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	149	 A 70 % inhibition in HPV 16 VLPs endocytosis was observed in both DC and LC populations after chlorpromazine treatment (Fig.

0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	153	 To visually analyse the uptake of HPV VLPs into DC and LC, transmission electron microscopy analysis was also performed.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	154	 In the presence of HPV 16 VLPs, DC and LC plasma membranes were rich in coated pits where VLPs accumulated (Fig.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	155	 These coated pits budded off to yield coated vesicles with clathrin morphology confirming that HPV enter by endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits in both DC (Fig.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	156	 VLPs were contained in cytoplasmic coated vesicles (Fig.

0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	163	The purpose of the present report was to investigate further the interactions between HPV 16 VLPs and DC or LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	164	 We showed that these antigen-presenting cells differentially interact with HPV 16 VLPs.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Although DC and LC are able to bind and internalize HPV 16 VLPs, difference in entry kinetics was observed between both cell types with a faster entry of HPV 16 VLPs into LC compared with DC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	166	 As a correlation between entry kinetics and cell receptors has been previously shown with other viruses (Narayan et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	167	, 2003), we looked for potential different types of HPV 16 VLPs binding to DC and LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The most described epithelial receptors for HPV are heparan sulfates and integrin (Evander et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Our inhibition experiments with heparin or sodium chlorate confirm that DC use heparan sulfates to bind HPV 16 VLPs in contrast to LC in agreement with the data of Yan et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	170	 (2004) showing that HPV 6b L1 VLPs uptake by DC is inhibited in the presence of heparin.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Other pathogens such as Chlamydia trachomatis also use heparan sulfates to enter DC (Matyszak et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	172	 (2002) suggested that heparan sulfates moiety detected on DC may also play an immunoregulatory role.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	173	 In fact, heparan sulfates and their degradation products have been reported to deliver costimulatory signals to T cells and maturation signals to DC (Wrenshall et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	174	, 1991; Kodaira  and  Platt, 2000; Johnson et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	175	 This may explain why HPV VLPs initiate DC (but not LC) maturation and activation.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	176	HPV 6b genotype has been shown to interact with epithelial cells by 6 integrin (Evander et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	177	 However, this receptor is poorly expressed in DC and LC and probably not implicated in the differences of HPV 16 VLPs uptake between both cell types.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	178	 (2004) also reported that 6 integrin is not responsible for the initiation of binding of HPV 6b L1 VLPs by LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	179	LC express several receptors that facilitate antigen recognition and uptake, including Fc receptors, DEC205 multilectin and langerin.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Langerin is exclusively expressed by LC (Valladeau et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	181	, 1999) and is localized not only on the cell surface, but also intracellularly in close association with Birbeck granules.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	182	 This molecule functions as an endocytic receptor (Valladeau et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Upon binding to the cell surface, anti-langerin antibodies are rapidly internalized and delivered to Birbeck granules (Valladeau et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Electron microscopy analysis showed that HPV 16 VLPs colocalize with anti-langerin antibodies.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Indeed they were detected together in coated pits and in large cytoplasmic vesicles.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	186	 These data are in agreement with recent studies showing that the processing pathway of HPV 6b L1 VLPs in LC is associated with langerin+ compartments (Yan et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	187	, 2004) and that other viruses, such as HIV, also use langerin and lectin or mannose to enter into LC and DC, respectively (Turville et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Our electron microscopy analysis showed a colocalization of HPV 16 VLPs and langerin in large cytoplasmic vesicles resembling to endosome, which may be related to the observation that langerin is associated with the CD1a recycling compartment (McDermott et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	189	 HPV 6 VLPs were also shown to be colocalized with CD1a+ endosome (Yan et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	190	, 2004), but the loading mechanism was not determined.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	191	 When mannan, which was shown to be able to inhibit HIV entry in LC, was used a 40 % inhibition of VLP entry was observed suggesting that other proteins are also involved in the VLP binding to LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	192	 It will be interesting to determine the direct effects of langerin in VLP binding by further experiments and if other lectins are also involved in the uptake of VLPs by LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	193	As the cell surface binding of HPV 16 VLPs differed in DC and LC, we wondered if their internalization was also different as suggested by Fausch et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	194	 (2003) showed that DC use a clathrin-mediated endocytosis whereas LC use a different pathway, which is not associated with clathrin or caveolae.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	195	 (2004) show that HPV 6 VLP enter in LC by a caveolae-dependent pathway.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Entry pathways can be inhibited at different stages by specific inhibitors, such as chlorpromazine, cytochalasin D, nystatin and filipin.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	197	 When using these drugs, HPV 16 VLP entry was only inhibited in the presence of chlorpromazine and cytochalasin D whereas no inhibition was observed with the caveolae inhibitors, nystatin and filipin.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	198	 These results suggest that VLP enter in DC and LC by a clathrin-mediated pathway and are in agreement with the direct demonstration of HPV 16 VLPs in coated pits and cytoplasmic vesicles with a clathrin morphology in LC and DC preparations processed for electron microscopy.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	199	 The differences between these studies might be related to the different methods used to analyse HPV VLPs internalization although we cannot exclude different endocytosis pathways according to the origin of cells used to generate LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	200	 In agreement with this hypothesis, the LC used in this study poorly expressed syndecan-1 in contrast to the LC generated by Yan et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	201	The fact that HPV 16 VLPs use different types of cell binding to DC and LC might have important functional consequences.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	202	 It has been shown that the maturation of DC and LC depends not only on receptors involved in the uptake of pathogens but also on receptors directly acting on DC activation (Niedergang et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Moreover, a cooperation between these two types of receptors has been shown to be important for the diversity of DC or LC responses and to determine the outcome of the immune response (Gantner et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	204	 As receptors implicated in DC maturation activate nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (Janeway  and  Medzhitov, 2002), it will be interesting to characterize the cytoplasmic factors implicated in DC or LC maturation in the presence of VLPs and to determine if heparan sulfates are able to interact with these factors.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	205	Future research addressing the recognition of HPV VLP by DC and LC will provide insight on how these cell surface receptors regulate antigen-presenting functions and may contribute to the development of novel strategies that specifically prevent or treat HPV infections and associated (pre)neoplasic lesions.

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	4	During the replication process, cleavage and packaging of viral DNA are tightly linked functions at least requiring the following seven genes in HSV-1: UL6, UL15, UL17, UL25, UL28, UL32 and UL33 (Poon  and  Roizman, 1993; Taus et al.

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Viruses mutated in one of these genes synthesize near-wild-type levels of viral DNA but fail to cleave and package concatemeric DNA into capsids, resulting in an accumulation of B (intermediate) capsids in infected cells, with the exception of the UL25 mutant, which was shown to cleave newly synthesized viral DNA (McNab et al.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Moreover, in contrast to the latter study where no packaging of matur DNA was observed, Stow (2001) reported that a significant amount of DNA synthesized by the UL25 mutant was packaged stably into capsids.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	8	To propagate a BHV-1 deletion mutant with a potentially lethal mutation in the UL25 gene to study the function of this gene, it was necessary to develop a complementing cell line expressing the UL25 protein in trans.

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	25	 To genetically engineer a BHV-1 UL25 deletion mutant, we constructed the plasmid pKS/58-63kUL25/-gal+ from pKS/BHV58-63kApa-Bam, by replacing the SalI fragment encoding aa 86 to 393 of the UL25 protein by a -Gal reporter gene cassette (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In this way, the deletion introduced into UL25 should not alter the expression of neighbouring genes.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The plasmid pKS/58-63kUL25/-gal+ was linearized and used with BHV-1 viral DNA to co-transfect RK13/UL25+ cells grown in the absence of doxycycline (on-state) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, as described previously (Desloges  and  Simard, 2003).
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Regenerated progeny viruses were then plated on RK13/UL25+ cells and tested for their ability to form blue plaques in the presence of the chromogenic compound X-Gal.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	29	 A -Gal-positive mutant virus, designated BHV-1UL25, was plaque-purified five times on RK13/UL25+ cells before virus production.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	30	The known, complete sequence of the wild-type BHV-1 genome allowed us to determine the restriction profiles that were expected for the mutated genome.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We compared the HindIII restriction profiles of mutant versus BHV-1 DNA-purified, infected cell lysates.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	32	 No divergence between the patterns observed and that expected for the mutant genome was noted (results not shown).
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	33	 These findings demonstrate that the -Gal reporter gene cassette interrupts, as intended, the UL25-encoding sequence of the virus mutant.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	34	To verify that the engineered mutant was indeed incapable of expressing the UL25 gene product, we performed Western blotting analyses of protein extracts from RK13 cells infected for different periods of time with either BHV-1 or BHV-1UL25.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	35	 2(A), extracts infected with BHV-1 revealed the presence of an abundant 63 kDa protein, which was detected specifically with the UL25 antiserum, accumulating in cells from 12 to 18 h post-infection (p.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In contrast, the UL25 antiserum detected no protein in extracts from BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells, thus demonstrating that the virus mutant was incapable of expressing the UL25 protein in RK13 cells (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	37	 This protein was absent in lysates prepared in the presence of phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), a DNA synthesis inhibitor, confirming further our previous findings that BHV-1 UL25 belongs to viral genes of the 2 class, since its expression is dependent strictly on viral DNA synthesis (Desloges et al.

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	48	  To investigate the consequence of the UL25 defect on the replicative cycle of BHV-1, virus production was examined by establishing one-step growth curves of both BHV-1UL25 and BHV-1 in non-complementing RK13 as well as in complementing RK13/UL25+ cells.

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	51	, after which the total number of virus particles present either extracellularly or intracellularly in each sample was determined by titration assays, as described previously (Desloges  and  Simard, 2003).
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	52	 BHV-1 was capable of replicating efficiently in both RK13 and RK13/UL25+ cells, reaching similar maximal virus yields at 21 h p.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	53	 In contrast, BHV-1UL25 could only replicate in RK13/UL25+ cells, as no progeny was produced in RK13 cells (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	54	 These results demonstrate that the UL25 gene product is necessary for virus replication in non-complementing cells, as was observed also with an HSV-1 UL25 deletion mutant (Ali et al.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	55	 In addition, the virus yield obtained with BHV-1UL25 on RK13/UL25+ cells was similar to that of BHV-1 virus yield recovered from either cell line, indicating that the RK13/UL25+ cell line was capable of fully complementing the UL25 defect of the mutant virus.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	56	 These results demonstrate that the amount of the UL25 protein within the complementary cell line is sufficient to allow replication of BHV-1UL25 to BHV-1 levels, indicating that no mutations in other essential genes had been introduced during the recombination event giving rise to the mutant.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	57	To identify the step at which the UL25 deletion mutant replication aborts in RK13 cells, we examined whether the mutation compromised the expression of late viral genes products.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	58	 For this purpose, the expression of the BHV-1 gene trans-inducing factor protein encoded by the UL48 gene, a late gene (Misra et al.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	59	, protein lysates were prepared from BHV-1UL25- and BHV-1-infected RK13 cells and analysed by immunoblot for the presence of the UL48 gene product using a BHV-1-specific UL48 antiserum directed against an Escherichia coli-expressed T7 tag to UL48 fusion protein.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The antiserum detected a 50 kDa protein in lysates collected at 18 h p.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	61	 from both BHV-1UL25- and BHV-1-infected RK13 cells (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Moreover, the production of the UL48 gene product was abrogated by PAA treatment (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	63	 2C, +PAA), confirming further that UL48 is a 2 gene.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Thus, these results demonstrate that the UL25 defect does not impair the expression of viral genes of the 2 class or, consequently, the expression of genes of the earlier classes (, 1, 2 and 1).
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	65	 These results also demonstrate indirectly that the mutation does not compromise viral DNA synthesis, since genes whose expression is dependent strictly on viral DNA synthesis (such as UL48) are expressed efficiently.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	66	To obtain direct evidence that the UL25 defect does not compromise viral DNA synthesis in RK13 cells, Southern blotting analysis of HindIII digests of total cell DNA isolated from BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 and RK13/UL25+ cells was performed.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The HindIII fragment N, representing the leftward terminal region of the BHV-1 linear viral genome, was used as probe (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Probe N hybridized to a major 2 4 kbp and two minor non-well-resolved 14 and 15 kbp fragments present in DNA from BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells obtained at 12 and 24 h p.

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	70	 3A, lane 1), demonstrating that the bands observed represented newly synthesized viral DNA.

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	72	 3A, lane 3) was very similar to that observed in BHV-1UL25-infected RK13/UL25+ cells (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The 2 4 kbp bands common to the two profiles co-migrated with the KpnI to HindIII insert of the recombinant plasmid pKS/Nhd, which harbours the complete HindIII fragment N (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	74	 3A, lane 5), demonstrating that these bands represented the leftward terminal 2 4 kbp HindIII fragment N of the BHV-1 linear genome.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The sizes of the other two bands correlated to those expected for head-to-tail HindIII genomic fragments (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	76	 1, N to F and N to H head-to-tail fragments are in the range of 14 and 15 kbp, respectively), indicating the presence within infected cell lysates of viral DNA, which was in the form of either immature DNA concatemers or of circular unit-length genomes, or both.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Interestingly, the levels of the 2 4 kbp fragment observed were similar in the two cell lines.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	78	 These findings indicate that DNA replication of BHV-1UL25 is as effective in RK13 cells as in complementing RK13/UL25+ cells.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Moreover, the much higher abundance of terminal versus head-to-tail HindIII fragments indicate that mutant viral DNA synthesized in infected cells is processed efficiently into linear unit-length genomes.

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Significant numbers of all three capsid types were found on sections from both BHV-1-infected RK13 cells (A capsids, 35 7 %; B capsids, 16 7 %; C capsids, 47 6 %) and BHV-1UL25-infected RK13/UL25+ cells (A capsids, 29 6 %; B capsids, 51 7 %; C capsids, 18 7 %).
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Each of these infected cell samples (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	97	 3B, upper left and right panels, respectively) presented several C capsids surrounded by a bilayer envelope.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In contrast, most of the capsids in BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells were of types A and B (40 0 and 57 2 %, respectively), as illustrated in Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	99	 3(B, lower left panel), showing an accumulation of both capsid types in infected cells.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The generation of empty A capsids devoid of both DNA and internal structure is believed to result from an abortive packaging event.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Abortive packaging has been observed also in mutants of the dsDNA bacteriophage P22, which presents similarities to alphaherpesviruses concerning the DNA packaging and capsid assembly process.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In Salmonella cells infected with mutants of phage P22 defective in genes 4, 10 and 26, it was shown that the procapsids are assembled and that viral concatemeric DNA is packaged but that the newly filled capsids are unstable and lose their DNA (Strauss  and  King, 1984).
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The phenotype observed in bacterial cells infected with these mutants is an accumulation of empty A capsids, similar to those observed in BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	104	However, careful examination of these infected cells revealed the presence of few electron-dense cored C capsids (2 8 %).
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	105	 3(B, lower right panel), in which a complete enveloped C capsid is shown in the extracellular compartment of BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	106	 It was reported previously that the HSV-1 UL25 mutant (KUL25NS) does not package matur DNA (McNab et al.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Recently, Stow (2001) detected successfully low levels of KUL25NS DNA being packaged and retained into capsids.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The latter findings are corroborated in the present study by the observation of few full C capsids in electron micrographs of thin sections of BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells.

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Also, it could be that UL25 mutant genomes are packaged efficiently into capsids but are released subsequently and then degraded rapidly, as suggested by Stow (2001).

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	0	A Multistep, ATP-dependent Pathway for Assembly of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Capsids in a Cell-free System.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	1	 Hill,* Mei Lie Wong,  and Ramanujan S.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	2	To understand the mechanism by which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) capsids are formed, we have reconstituted the assembly of immature HIV capsids de novo in a cell-free system.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Capsid authenticity is established by multiple biochemical and morphologic criteria.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Known features of the assembly process are closely reproduced, indicating the fidelity of the cell-free reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Assembly is separated into co- and posttranslational phases, and three independent posttranslational requirements are demonstrated: (a) ATP, (b) a detergent-sensitive host factor, and (c) a detergent-insensitive host subcellular fraction that can be depleted and reconstituted.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Assembly appears to proceed by way of multiple intermediates whose conversion to completed capsids can be blocked by either ATP depletion or treatment with nondenaturing detergent.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Specific subsets of these intermediates accumulate upon expression of various assembly-defective Gag mutants in the cell-free system, suggesting that each mutant is blocked at a particular step in assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Furthermore, the accumulation of complexes of similar sizes in cells expressing the corresponding mutants suggests that comparable intermediates may exist in vivo.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	9	 From these data, we propose a multi-step pathway for the biogenesis of HIV capsids, in which the assembly process can be disrupted at a number of discrete points.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	10	The protein shell of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV)1 virion, termed the HIV capsid or core, is composed of ~1,500 copies of the Pr55 Gag structural protein precursor (for review see Gelderblom, 1991).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	11	 For proper assembly of the capsid to occur, Pr55 chains must undergo myristoylation (Gheysen et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	12	, 1989), an NH2-terminal modification thought to occur co-translationally (Towler et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The myristoylated chains are targeted to the host plasma membrane where assembly takes place concomitant with RNA encapsidation.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	14	 As capsids are formed, they bud into the plasma membrane, which results in envelopment and subsequent release of viral particles from the cell.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Coincident with these events, the immature viral particles undergo a maturation process, involving proteolytic processing of the precursor structural proteins and condensation of the capsids into collapsed, electron-dense cores (for review see Gelderblom, 1991; Wills and Craven, 1991).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	16	Much of our knowledge of HIV capsid assembly comes from studies of viral particle formation in cultured cells transfected with viral genes.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	17	 EM studies of these cells have indicated that the plasma membrane is the site of capsid assembly (Gelderblom, 1991; Wills and Craven, 1991).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Analysis of various mutants of Pr55 have revealed key domains required for efficient capsid assembly and targeting to the plasma membrane (Gheysen et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	19	, 1993; Wang and Barklis, 1993; Hockley et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, the actual mechanisms involved in coordinating the formation of an HIV capsid from 1,500 Gag monomers have not been elucidated.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Many important questions about HIV capsid assembly remain unanswered, including whether assembly is an energy-dependent process, whether host proteins are required for assembly to take place, and whether assembly proceeds by way of discrete intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	22	A major obstacle to addressing these questions experimentally has been the inherent difficulty of studying capsid assembly in cellular systems.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In cells, many of the events in question proceed extremely rapidly and are not readily amenable to manipulation, making it difficult to identify trans-acting factors and energy substrates that may be required for assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Development of a cell-free system that recreates capsid biogenesis would greatly facilitate a biochemical dissection and mechanistic understanding of capsid formation.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	25	In this study, we report the development of a cell-free system for the assembly of immature HIV capsids that appears to reproduce known features of capsid structure and biogenesis, including the phenotypes of a variety of assembly-competent and assembly-defective Gag mutants.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We use this system to demonstrate that capsid formation can be dissociated into co- and posttranslational phases, each of which has distinct requirements.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The reactions that occur during the posttranslational phase are dependent on ATP and at least two independent host factors, distinguished by their sensitivity to detergent.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In addition, the posttranslational phase appears to proceed by way of previously unrecognized assembly intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Expression of Gag mutants that are defective for assembly results in accumulation of these assembly intermediates in the cell-free system.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Similar findings are obtained in cellular systems.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Together, these data indicate that HIV capsid formation is a regulated, energy-dependent, multi-step process involving trans-acting host factors.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The gag ORF from HIV genomic DNA (a kind gift of Jay Levy, University of California, San Francisco, CA) was introduced downstream from the SP6 promoter and the globin untranslated region.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The GA mutation was made by changing glycine at position 2 of Gag to alanine using PCR.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The Pr46 mutant was made by introducing a stop codon after gly 435 which removes p6; Pr41 has a stop codon after arg 363 (in the COOH-terminal region of p24).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	38	 These truncation mutants are comparable to those described by Jowett et al.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	229	 First, after completion of the assembly reaction, membrane vesicles were solubilized using the nonionic detergent NP-40.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	230	 This treatment, which removes membranes enveloping capsids but does not affect the integrity of fully assembled capsids (Yu et al.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Secondly, the detergent-treated, completed reaction was size fractionated on a sucrose step gradient into a soluble fraction (containing material of  < 500-S) and a particulate fraction (containing material between 500- and 1,000-S) that would be expected to contain completed immature capsids (Royer et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Thus, while our standard translation and assembly reaction was carried out in the absence of detergent to allow association with membrane vesicles, analysis of the reaction product was performed in the presence of detergent, allowing the assembly status of the naked proteinacious capsid to be assessed.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	234	We found that the particulate fraction from a typical translation and assembly reaction contained between 15 and 40% of the total Pr55 synthesized (see Fig.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Thus, on average, 25% of the radiolabeled Pr55 protein synthesized in the cell-free system assembles into particles that closely resemble authentic immature HIV capsids generated in transfected cells, as judged by EM appearance as well as the biochemical criteria of size, sedimentation coefficient, and buoyant density.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	245	To determine whether the process of capsid assembly in the cell-free system is the same as that which occurs in cells, we examined whether known characteristics of capsid assembly were also reconstituted.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Studies in cellular systems have demonstrated that myristoylation of Gag is required for proper capsid assembly (Gheysen, 1989; Gottlinger, 1989).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	247	 This NH2-terminal modification is thought to occur co-translationally (Wilcox et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	248	 To assess the role of myristoylation in the cell-free system we omitted MCoA from the assembly reaction, or added it posttranslationally at 90 min into the reaction (when  > 90% of Pr55 chains have finished synthesis; data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In both cases, a dramatic decrease in capsid assembly was observed (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Consistent with these data, we found that a Gag mutant that fails to become myristoylated (GA) also does not assemble in the cell-free system (see Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	251	In cells, assembly of HIV capsids takes place at the inner surface of the host cell plasma membrane (Gelderblom, 1991; Wills and Craven, 1991).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Membrane targeting of Pr55 chains is directed by the NH2-terminal myristate moiety and by internal domains of the Pr55 polypeptide (Jacobs et al.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Studies using Pr55 mutations have shown that abolishing membrane targeting results in inefficient capsid assembly and failure of capsid release (Jacobs et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	255	, 1989; Bryant and Ratner 1990).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	256	 For this reason, targeting to plasma membranes is thought to facilitate the nucleation of Gag chains at a site within the cell where assembly, envelopment, and budding of the newly formed capsids can occur.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	257	 If immature HIV capsid assembly in the cell-free system requires membrane fragments (which are present in the wheat germ extracts used), it should be sensitive to addition of detergent at concentrations that solubilize membranes.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Thus, as a final criterion of authenticity of the cell-free capsid assembly reaction, we investigated the sensitivity of cell-free capsid assembly to the presence of detergent during the translation and assembly reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	259	 We treated the assembly reaction with a gentle, nonionic detergent that does not inhibit any of the enzymatic reactions involved in protein synthesis (Walter and Blobel, 1980) and thus would not be likely to affect protein interactions involved in assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	260	 As expected, the detergent Nikkol added to a concentration of 0.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	261	1% at the beginning of the translation reaction had no effect on Gag polypeptide synthesis (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	262	 2 B, Nikkol at this concentration largely abolished capsid assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	263	 This effect was not observed when Nikkol was used at a concentration of 0.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	264	002%, which is below that required to disrupt lipid bilayers (Walter and Blobel, 1980).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Furthermore, we found that Nikkol added after the completion of the 150 min assembly reaction did not diminish the amount of assembly, even when added to a concentration of 1.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Thus, it appears that whereas the completed capsid particle itself is not sensitive to Nikkol (even at high concentrations), assembly of this structure is inhibited by concentrations of Nikkol that are sufficient to solubilize membranes.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	267	 These data are consistent with the idea that membranes are required for newly synthesized Pr55 to be efficiently assembled into capsids in the cell-free system.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Thus, the dependence of assembly on cotranslational myristoylation and the apparent requirement for membranes indicate that capsid assembly in the cell-free system faithfully reproduces characteristics of capsid assembly that have been described in cellular systems.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	269	Studies of capsid assembly in cell culture model systems have revealed that certain mutations within the Gag coding region disrupt immature HIV capsid assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	270	 As a third criterion for fidelity, we examined the assembly phenotypes in the cell-free system of four previously described mutations in Gag (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	271	 3 A): (a) the Pr46 mutant, in which the COOH-terminal p6 domain of Gag is deleted (Royer et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	272	, 1994); (b) the Pr41 mutant, in which the deleted domains include p6, p7, and the distal end of p24 containing the p24-p7 protease cleavage site (Gheysen et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	273	, 1994); (c) the D2 mutation, in which 10 amino acids of the p24 domain of Gag (upstream of the p24-p7 protease cleavage site) are deleted (Hockley et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	274	, 1994); and (d) the GA mutation, an NH2-terminal single amino acid substitution that abolishes myristoylation of Gag (Gottlinger et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	275	, 1989; Bryant and Ratner, 1990).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Upon expression in cells, only the Pr46 mutant was capable of producing viral particles indistinguishable from those produced by expression of wild-type Gag (Royer et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Each of the other three mutants fails to result in proper viral particle production and release (Gheysen et al.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	279	Assembly reactions were programmed with transcript encoding each of these mutations and the amount of immature capsid produced was quantitated as described in the legend of Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	280	 3 B, the Pr41 and GA mutants failed to assemble into completed capsids, while ~40% of the total translation product of the assembly-competent Pr46 mutant and wild-type Gag assembled into completed capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	281	 The D2 mutant appeared to have generated a small amount of material in the region of completed capsids, but further analysis of this material revealed it to be the trail of a large Gag complex (of ~400- 500 S) that does not comigrate with completed capsid (see Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Thus, like Pr41 and GA, D2 did not assemble into the 750-S completed capsid.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Together, these data indicate that the cell-free system appears to faithfully reproduce phenotypes of a variety of assembly-defective and -competent mutations in Gag.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	285	For optimum assembly to occur, the cell-free reaction must be incubated at 25 degrees C for at least 150 min (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	286	 We observed that whereas the majority of Pr55 synthesis occurs during the first hour of this incubation, significant capsid formation does not take place until the final 90 min of the reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Thus, an aliquot of the reaction incubated for only 50 min contains ~60% of the full length Pr55 chains that are present in an aliquot incubated for the standard 150 min (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	288	 However, essentially none of the chains present at the 50 min time point has assembled into capsids (data not shown), while at 150 min 25% have completed the assembly process (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	289	 This indicated to us that it might be possible to completely separate the translation and assembly phases of the reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	290	 To confirm this, a reaction was split into two aliquots at 50 min into the incubation.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	291	 To one aliquot we added emetine, which blocks translation by inhibiting chain elongation, and then both aliquots were incubated to 150 min.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	292	 While total Pr55 synthesis in the emetine-treated reaction was 60% of the control (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	293	 4 A, compare gel lanes 1 and 2), the proportion of capsid assembly in this treated reaction was comparable to that of the untreated control (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	294	 4 A, bar graph), indicating that assembly takes place even when translation is halted.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Based on these data, one would expect that manipulations performed after emetine treatment would have effects on only the posttranslational phase of assembly and should not affect Pr55 synthesis, which is already completed.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	296	Having established a means of analyzing events specific to assembly, we then examined whether the previously described detergent sensitivity of HIV capsid assembly (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	297	 2 B) was due to an effect on co- or posttranslational events.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	298	 We treated Pr55 reactions with emetine and 0.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	299	1% Nikkol at 50 min into the reaction, continued the incubation to 150 min, and then determined the amount of assembly as previously described.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Under these conditions, assembly was dramatically reduced (data not shown), just as it had been when Nikkol was added at the start of translation (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Therefore, we conclude that the detergent sensitive step(s) in HIV capsid assembly occurs posttranslationally.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	302	Next we examined whether posttranslational events in capsid assembly are dependent on the presence of ATP.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Translation of Gag was allowed to proceed for 50 min, at which point further protein synthesis was inhibited with emetine.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	304	 The sample was divided, and one aliquot was depleted of ATP by the addition of apyrase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes free ATP.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	305	 After completion of the assembly reaction, samples were analyzed as previously described for the amount of assembly that had occurred.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	306	 We found that depletion of free ATP from the assembly reaction resulted in a dramatic reduction in capsid assembly (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	307	 The effect of ATP depletion was not reversed by addition of the nonhydrolyzable analogues, AMP-PNP or GTP-S (data not shown), suggesting that ATP hydrolysis, and not just ATP binding, is required.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	308	 As expected, addition of apyrase did not change the total amount of Pr55 synthesis (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	309	 4 A, compare gel lanes 2 and 3).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Furthermore, adding apyrase to the reaction after capsid assembly was completed had no effect on the amount of assembly (data not shown), ruling out the possibility of an effect of apyrase or ATP depletion on capsid stability.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	311	 These data indicate that there is a requirement for ATP in the capsid assembly process, and that this ATP dependence is distinct from the energy requirements of protein synthesis.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	312	A Subcellular Fraction Is Required for Capsid Assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	313	Given that the Gag protein itself is not known to bind or hydrolyze ATP, the requirement for this energy substrate suggests that a host protein or proteins are involved in the assembly reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Demonstrating that such a host factor is required would involve showing that assembly fails to occur when this factor is depleted from the cellular extracts used in the assembly reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Furthermore, adding back the depleted fraction to the reaction should restore assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Thus, we sought to fractionate the translation extract in a manner that would leave intact all of the components needed for translation but remove at least one component required for assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	317	 The cellular extract used for translation and assembly was subfractionated by ultracentrifugation into two portions: HSS and HSP.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	318	 The HSS, depleted of components that were 90-S or greater, supported Pr55 translation but not its assembly (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	319	 This indicates that the HSP likely contains an assembly specific host factor(s).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	320	 This was demonstrated directly by showing that addition of the HSP posttranslationally (after emetine treatment) to unassembled Gag chains synthesized in the HSS resulted in a considerable restoration of particle assembly (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	321	 As expected, total synthesis of Pr55 was unaltered by addition of the HSP (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Together, these data indicate that a subcellular fraction of the eukaryotic cell lysate is required for posttranslational events in capsid assembly to take place.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	323	We had previously observed that detergent also disrupts the posttranslational phase of capsid assembly (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	324	 We examined, therefore, whether the HSP contained the detergent-sensitive component that is required for capsid formation.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	325	 HSP was prepared from a cell extract treated with detergent (0.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	326	 The resulting HSP was washed with detergent-free buffer and added posttranslationally to an assembly reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	327	 We found that the HSP from the detergent-treated extract was as active in promoting posttranslational capsid formation as the control HSP (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Thus, separate detergent-sensitive and -insensitive host factors appear to be involved in the posttranslational phase of HIV capsid assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Furthermore, the detergent-insensitive host factor can be depleted by ultracentrifugation and then reconstituted by posttranslational addition.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	331	The existence of multiple specific requirements for HIV capsid biogenesis, including host factors and ATP, suggests that discrete biochemical intermediates may exist during the assembly process.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	332	 To date, such intermediates in capsid assembly have not been described, most likely due to the difficulty of detection in cellular systems where they would be present only transiently and in minute quantities.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Since the cell-free system is less efficient at forming completed capsids than are cellular systems, it might constitute a better system for detecting such assembly intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Consistent with this possibility, we found that under conditions where only a small amount of 750-S capsid assembly occurs in the cell-free reaction, analysis of the reaction products on 13 ml velocity sedimentation gradients revealed the presence of a series of Gag-containing complexes, in addition to 750-S completed capsids (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	335	 These complexes, which have calculated sedimentation coefficients of ~10-S, 80-S, and 150-S, will henceforth be referred to as complexes A, B, and C, respectively.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	336	If these complexes represent assembly intermediates, they would be expected to be present in large quantities at early time points, and to be diminished at later times in the reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	337	 To assess whether these complexes displayed this behavior, we used a pulse-chase analysis to follow a small cohort of radiolabeled Pr55 chains over time.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	338	 The cell-free reaction was performed with radiolabeled cysteine.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	339	 After the first 4 min of translation, an excess of unlabeled cysteine was added to abolish further labeling of subsequently synthesized Pr55 chains.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	340	 We observed that the total amount of radiolabeled Pr55 was the same at 25 and 150 min into the pulse-chase reaction (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	341	 5 B), indicating that neither further radiolabeling nor degradation of Pr55 had occurred after 25 min and confirming that the same population of Pr55 chains was being analyzed at both times.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	342	 Aliquots of the cell-free reactions were removed at the times indicated, treated with detergent, and then analyzed on 13 ml velocity sedimentation gradients.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	343	At 25 min into the reaction, all of the radiolabeled Pr55 was found in complexes A, B, and C (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	344	 5 C), with no radiolabeled Pr55 present in the region of completed 750-S capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	345	 While complexes A and B appear as peaks at ~ the 10-S and 80-S positions of the gradient, complex C appears as a less distinct shoulder in approximately the 150-S position.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	346	 In marked contrast, examination of the assembly reaction at 150 min showed that a significant amount of radiolabeled Pr55 was assembled into completed capsids that migrated in the 750-S position (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	347	 Correspondingly, the amount of Pr55 in complexes A, B, and C was diminished by precisely the amount that was now found to be assembled, demonstrating that at least some of the material in complexes A, B, and C constitutes intermediates in the biogenesis of completed 750-S capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	348	At extremely short chase times (i.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	349	, 13 min), when only some of the radiolabeled chains have completed synthesis, full length Pr55 chains were found exclusively in complex A on 13 ml sucrose gradients, while nascent chains that are not yet completed were in the form of polysomes of greater than 100-S (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	350	 Thus, polysome-associated nascent chains of Gag constitute the starting material in this pathway, and the 10-S complex A, which contains completed Gag chains, is likely to be the first intermediate in the formation of immature capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	351	 It is possible, therefore, that complexes B and C represent later assembly intermediates in the pathway of capsid formation.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	352	If complexes A, B, and C do in fact constitute intermediates in assembly, one would predict that blockade of assembly would result in accumulation of Gag chains in the form of complexes with those S values.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	353	 Furthermore, one would expect that blockade at different points along this pathway would result in accumulation of complexes A, B, and C in various combinations, as determined by the order of their appearance along the assembly pathway.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	354	 For example, if an ordered pathway of intermediates exists, then blockade at early points in the pathway should result in accumulation of one or two Gag-containing complexes corresponding to early putative assembly intermediates, while blockade at a very late point in the pathway would result in accumulation of all the putative assembly intermediates but not the final completed capsid product.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	355	 To test these predictions, we blocked assembly in a variety of ways, both pharmacologically and through the use of mutations, and examined the Gag-containing complexes that were formed.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	360	 Material in fractions corresponding to the assembly intermediates and completed capsid were quantified and are presented in Table I.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	361	 The untreated reaction contained Pr55 in complexes A, B, and C, as well as a peak in the final 750-S capsid position, while the treated reactions, as expected, contained no peak at the position of the final capsid product (Table I).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	362	 Treatment with either apyrase or detergent resulted in accumulation of additional material in complexes B and C, but did not result in accumulation of additional material in complex A.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	363	 This is consistent with the idea that complexes B and C are the more immediate precursors of the 750-S completed capsids, and that these interventions block the conversion of complexes B and C into the fully assembled capsid end product.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	370	 6 B) were found to have nearly identical profiles, in which  > 30% of the radiolabeled Gag chains synthesized formed completed immature capsids (that migrate at 750-S), and the remainder was in the form of residual putative assembly intermediates A and B.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	371	 Thus, these two assembly-competent forms of Gag appear to be indistinguishable in the cell-free system just as they are when expressed in cells (Royer et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	372	 6 C shows the same analysis for the assembly defective Pr41 mutant.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	373	 We found that all of the radiolabeled chains at the end of the Pr41 cell-free reaction were contained in a single complex that peaks at ~10-S and corresponds to complex A.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	374	 Since the 10-S peak was very large and led to an irregular trail that could be masking 80- or 150-S peaks, we reanalyzed the products of a Pr41 reaction on a gradient that allowed high resolution in the 1-200-S size range (data not shown) and confirmed that all of the Pr41 translation product was present in complex A, which was ~10-S in size.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	375	 Thus, in the cell-free system, it appears that Pr41 fails to progress beyond complex A, which is likely to represent the first intermediate in the assembly pathway.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	376	Like Pr41, the myristoylation-incompetent GA mutant failed to assemble into 750-S capsids (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	377	 6 D), but unlike Pr41, GA had distinct peaks in both the 10- and 80-S regions of the gradient (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	378	 These data indicate that the GA mutant, which contains the entire Gag coding region except for the myristoylation signal, is capable of forming complex A, which appeared to be the first assembly intermediate in the pulse-chase experiment, as well as complex B, but does not progress further towards forming completed capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	379	 These data suggest that complex B is likely to be the second assembly intermediate formed in the biogenesis of immature HIV capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	380	Previously, we had shown that in the absence of exogenously added MCoA, wild-type Gag failed to assemble in the cell-free system (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	381	 2 A), consistent with previous observations that myristoylation is required for proper capsid assembly to occur.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	382	 Thus, a cell-free reaction programmed with wild-type Gag but performed in the absence of MCoA would be expected to be blocked at the same point in the assembly pathway as the GA mutant.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	383	 Consistent with this, we found that assembly performed in the absence of MCoA resulted in formation of only complexes A and B (data not shown), and therefore closely resembled the GA mutant shown in Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	384	Analysis of a cell-free reaction programmed with the D2 mutant is shown in Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	385	 Unlike the previously described assembly-defective mutants, D2 was found to form a spectrum of Gag-containing complexes, including peaks corresponding to complexes A and B (at ~10- and 80-S), a shoulder corresponding to complex C (in the 150-S region), and an additional peak of ~400-500-S, that will henceforth be referred to as complex D.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Note that complex D trails into the 750-S region, accounting for the appearance of a small amount of assembly in the simpler analysis presented in Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	387	 However, the detailed analysis presented here makes it clear that in fact there is no discrete peak in the region of completed capsid (750-S).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	388	 Thus, the D2 mutant appears to form a series of complexes corresponding in size to the assembly intermediates seen in the pulse-chase experiment (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	389	 5), as well as an additional complex of larger size, but fails to produce the completed 750-S product.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	391	Having demonstrated by pulse-chase analysis, pharmacologic blockade, and analysis of mutants that assembly intermediates appear to exist in the cell-free system, we then examined whether complexes of the same sizes are present in mammalian cells that are expressing wild-type Gag or Gag mutants.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	392	 The finding of such complexes would be consistent with the existence of similar transient intermediates in vivo.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	393	Cos cells transfected with wild-type Gag were lysed in detergent, and the lysate was analyzed on 13 ml velocity sedimentation gradients, as in Figs.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	394	 Gradient fractions were immunoblotted with Gag antibody, and the relative amount of Gag polypeptide present in each fraction was quantitated as described in Materials and Methods (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	395	 The cell lysate contained Pr55 in a spectrum of complexes ranging from 10- to ~200-S.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	396	 Since cells efficiently release completed HIV capsids, most of the completed capsid would be expected to be in the medium at steady state.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	397	 This was confirmed by the finding that a substantial amount of fully assembled 750-S capsid was present in the medium (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	398	 7 A, open circles), while the cell lysate contained no 750-S capsids (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	399	 We conclude, therefore, that within cells, Pr55 is present in a heterogeneous mixture of complexes that have S values similar to complexes A, B, and C, the assembly intermediates found in the cell-free system.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	400	If these complexes correspond to the assembly intermediates seen in the cell-free system, one would expect that different assembly-defective mutants would result in the accumulation of the same sized complexes in cellular systems as they do in the cell-free system.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	401	 Thus, we examined whether the Pr41 mutant, which appears to be blocked after the first assembly intermediate in the cell-free system, and the D2 mutant, which appears to be blocked at the end of the assembly pathway in the cell-free system, resulted in corresponding patterns of Gag-containing complexes within cells.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	402	 Cos cells were transfected with each of these mutants, and the medium as well as the lysate were examined by immunoblotting.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	403	 As expected, medium from cells transfected with the assembly-defective Pr41 or D2 did not contain 750-S completed capsids (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	404	 The cell lysate of Cos cells transfected with the Pr41 mutant contained only material that peaked in the 10-S region of the velocity gradient (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	405	 7 B), resembling what had been found when the Pr41 mutant was expressed in the cell-free system (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	406	 The observation that the Pr41 reaction product migrated as a single complex that peaked in the 10-S region was confirmed by analysis on a variety of different velocity sedimentation gradients that allowed higher resolution in the 1-200-S size range (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	407	 In contrast, the cell lysate of Cos cells transfected with the D2 mutant contained a spectrum of immunoreactive complexes that ranged in size from 10-500-S (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	408	 7 C), resembling what had been found when D2 was expressed in the cell-free system (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	409	 Thus, the data from transfected cells suggests that the behavior of Gag mutants in the cell-free system reflects events in capsid assembly that occur in living cells.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	410	In this paper, we first demonstrate that immature HIV capsids can be assembled in a cell-free system.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	411	 We establish that the capsids produced closely resemble immature HIV capsids produced in cellular systems (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	412	 1) and that key known features of capsid assembly are faithfully reproduced in this cell-free system (Figs.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	413	 We then use it to dissect assembly into a number of steps.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	414	 First, through the use of an inhibitor of protein synthesis, we demonstrate that assembly can be resolved into a co-translational phase, during which Pr55 polypeptides are synthesized, followed by a posttranslational phase, during which additional events necessary for assembly take place.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	415	 Being able to separate these two phases allows us to analyze reactions specific to the assembly process, independent of other events such as protein synthesis.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	416	By manipulating the posttranslational phase of assembly, we then demonstrate that it has at least three specific requirements (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	417	 First, ATP is necessary, since the enzyme apyrase is able to effectively block the posttranslational progression of completed Pr55 chains into fully assembled capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	418	 Second, this phase is sensitive to nonionic detergent, implying that membrane fragments are likely to be involved.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	419	 Third, using a depletion and reconstitution approach, we demonstrate that a subcellular fraction of eukaryotic cell lysate is required for the posttranslational assembly events to take place.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	420	In addition, multiple criteria are used to demonstrate that the posttranslational phase of assembly proceeds by way of a series of Gag-containing complexes that appear to constitute intermediates in the cell-free capsid assembly reaction (Figs.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	421	 Finally, we show that complexes resembling assembly intermediates may also be present in cellular systems that are producing immature HIV particles, and that mutants in Gag have a similar behavior in both cellular and cell-free systems (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	422	Novel Requirements for HIV Capsid Assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	423	To date, studies have not revealed whether HIV capsid assembly occurs by way of a passive process of Gag polypeptide multimerization, or whether assembly is an active, regulated process requiring Gag associations with other proteins, as well as Gag-Gag interactions.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	424	 By demonstrating that the posttranslational phase of assembly requires ATP and a detergent-insensitive host cell component, our data indicate that in fact HIV capsid assembly is an energydependent, coordinated process in which host proteins play a crucial role.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	425	 Thus, the model of HIV capsid assembly supported by our data is conceptually very different from the view that many viral capsids are formed from capsid monomers by way of a passive process of "self assembly," requiring no components besides the individual capsid protein subunits (Klug, 1980).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	426	 Indeed, while host factors have not previously been documented to play a role in the assembly of HIV capsids, the possibility of their existence has been raised by data demonstrating that yeast expressing Gag do not support HIV capsid assembly (Jacobs et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	427	, 1989), while baculovirus and mammalian systems of expression do (for review see Boulanger and Jones, 1996).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	428	 Such studies imply that yeast either contain a factor that inhibits HIV capsid assembly (that is absent in higher eukaryotes) or lack a factor necessary for assembly (that is present in higher eukaryotes).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	429	 Our data support the latter possibility.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	430	 Consistent with the notion that previously unrecognized host factors may be important at various points in the HIV life cycle is the recent demonstration that cyclophilins are associated with the HIV virus particle and are required for infectivity (Luban et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	431	The finding that HIV capsid assembly requires ATP as well as host cell components suggests that the posttranslational phase of assembly may occur via a step-wise pathway of previously unrecognized assembly intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	432	 We present three lines of evidence to support this view.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	433	 First, using a pulse-chase analysis we demonstrate that a population of lower molecular weight Gag-containing complexes, referred to as complexes A, B, and C, is present at early time points in capsid assembly, and that Gag polypeptides from this population are converted into the final capsid product over time.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	434	 Note that the possibility that these complexes represent polyribosomes has been ruled out by the demonstration that they are not sensitive to RNase A used at concentrations that result in complete digestion of messenger RNA (Lingappa, J.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	435	 At very short chase times, all of the radiolabeled Pr55 in the pulse-chase reaction is present in complex A, suggesting that this may be the first intermediate in the assembly reaction, appearing after completed Gag chains are released from ribosomes.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	436	 It remains to be determined whether complex A constitutes either a monomer or dimer of Gag, or whether it is composed of a Gag chain associated with a host protein.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	437	Secondly, we show that by blocking assembly pharmacologically, using either apyrase or detergent, material in two of these complexes (complexes B and C) accumulates, indicating that they are likely to be precursors to the completed 750-S capsid end product.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	438	 Note that these data do not exclude the existence of other intermediates that might occur later in the pathway.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	439	 Such intermediates would not be seen with apyrase or detergent blockade, since these agents appear to block assembly by preventing progression beyond the 150-S complex.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	440	 The demonstration that both detergent and ATP depletion appear to result in the accumulation of the same assembly intermediates raises the possibility that this point in the assembly pathway may be a critical one, in which a variety of events necessary for assembly must take place in a coordinated fashion.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	441	 Further work will be required to determine whether this represents an important point of regulation in the assembly pathway.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	442	Finally, the analysis of three different Gag mutants that are known to be assembly defective lends further support to the presence of assembly intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	443	 We find that each mutant results in the accumulation of different subsets of these assembly intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	444	 Thus, a mutant that appears to be blocked after the first step in the assembly pathway results in the accumulation of complex A alone (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	445	 6 C), while one that appears to be blocked after the second step of the pathway results in accumulation of complex A and complex B (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	446	 A spectrum of complexes, including complexes A, B, and C, as well as the larger complex D, is seen upon expression of a mutant that appears to be blocked at a very late step in the assembly pathway (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	447	 Thus, analysis of these mutants supports the existence of intermediates in the assembly of HIV capsids, and also suggests an order to the appearance of such intermediates during the process of capsid assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	448	There are a number of caveats to our demonstration of assembly intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	449	 First, one or more of these putative intermediates could in fact constitute a side reaction or dead end byproduct off the main pathway of capsid assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	450	 The most likely candidate for such a dead-end byproduct is complex D, which is only clearly apparent in the analysis of the assembly-defective D2 mutant (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	451	 Arguing against the possibility that complexes A, B, or C are simply nonproductive side reactions is the finding that the amount of each of these complexes varies inversely with the amount of completed, immature capsid formed.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	452	 Such behavior would be expected for assembly intermediates but not for dead-end byproducts or side reactions.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	453	 For example, the quantity of each of these complexes decreases over time in the pulse-chase experiment, during a period when completed capsids are appearing and the total number of radiolabeled Gag chains present is constant (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	454	 Likewise, complexes B and C increase in quantity when formation of capsids is blocked (Table I).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	455	 Additionally, in an analysis of a mutant that is more efficient in capsid production than wild-type cells, we find that the amount of complex A drops to very low levels when very large amounts of capsid are being made (Hill, R.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	456	 Lingappa, unpublished observation).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	457	 Thus, the simplest interpretation of our data is that the Gag complexes A, B, and C constitute true assembly intermediates, although definitive proof of this must await a functional examination of each of these intermediates in isolation.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	458	A second caveat is that our analysis could be complicated by instability of Gag-containing complexes.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	459	 Thus, lower molecular weight complexes could actually result from disassembly of a higher order complex.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	460	 This seems unlikely to be a significant problem in our system, given that we have not observed any of the Gag-containing complexes to be labile in our studies.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	461	 For example, in the pulse- chase experiments (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	462	 5), there is a clear-cut progression over time from complexes A, B, and C to completed immature capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	463	 Residual amounts of complexes A and B present at the end of the incubation are likely due to incomplete conversion resulting from depletion and inactivation of necessary factors over time.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	464	A third caveat that should be noted is that there may exist additional intermediates in HIV capsid assembly that are not obvious from our current analysis.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	465	 Finally, we wish to point out that the S-values assigned to each of the complexes described here are only approximate S-values, calculated from the migration of these complexes in velocity sedimentation gradients (see Materials and Methods).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	466	 While one or more complexes may not appear to be distinct in a particular experiment or a particular gradient (i.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	467	 5 C), the specific complexes described here have been seen repeatedly in many different experiments and under a variety of gradient conditions and therefore are likely to represent discrete complexes that are difficult to resolve perfectly in every experiment given their transient and dynamic nature.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	481	While intermediates along such a pathway have not been demonstrated previously within cells, this could be a consequence of their transient nature and the difficulties involved in manipulating cellular systems.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	482	 Further work will be required to determine to what extent the mechanism of cell-free HIV capsid assembly reflects biochemical events that occur in vivo.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	483	 Here we show that, under steady state conditions, cells releasing immature HIV capsids contain Pr55 complexes that correspond in approximate size to complexes A, B, and C, the assembly intermediates observed in the cell-free system.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	485	 While these data do not constitute proof that assembly intermediates exist in cells, they lend support to the idea that the process of HIV capsid assembly in the cell-free system is closely correlated to the capsid assembly process in cells.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	490	 For example, our data suggest that the reason that certain Gag mutants fail to assemble is because they lack domains of the Gag polypeptide that may be required, either directly or indirectly, for progression from one assembly intermediate to the next along the proposed pathway for HIV capsid assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	491	 Similarly, our results indicate that in the absence of the myristate moiety or in the absence of intact membranes, capsid assembly fails to progress beyond specific stages in the assembly process.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	492	Altogether, we demonstrate that capsid assembly can be disrupted at different points in the proposed assembly pathway by five different means: (a) omitting MCoA during the co-translational phase of the reaction, (b) depleting ATP during the posttranslational phase, (c) treating with detergent either at the start of translation or posttranslationally, (d) removing the detergent-insensitive subcellular component(s) from the eukaryotic cell lysate used for the assembly reaction, and (e) programming the reaction with assembly-defective Gag mutants.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	493	 While details of the mechanisms underlying these forms of blockade remain to be determined by further analysis, these data reveal the power of this approach for elucidating the biochemical events that underlie capsid assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	494	Cell-free Assembly of Other Viral Capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	495	Cell-free systems have been used in the past to assemble simple viral particles whose formation is dependent only on cytosolic components of host cells (Molla et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	496	 In the current study we demonstrate that such systems can also be used to reconstitute the assembly of much more complex viral capsids, such as HIV capsids, that require co-translational modifications as well as membrane targeting for their biogenesis.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	497	 These data suggest that the cell-free system can be used to examine capsid assembly mechanisms of many different types of viruses.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	498	Previously, we used a cell-free system to study the mechanism of assembly of a Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), a completely unrelated virus (Lingappa et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	499	 Unlike HIV capsids, HBV capsids are formed free in the cytoplasm of the host cell (for review see Ganem, 1991).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	500	 We found that these capsids assemble by way of an intermediate that is associated with at least one host protein.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	501	 When this intermediate was isolated, manipulation of energy substrates resulted in release of the completed capsid end product.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	502	 Thus, while cell-free HIV and HBV capsid assembly differ greatly in many details and in their complexity, they share some general mechanistic themes.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	503	 Capsid formation in both systems involves assembly intermediates, the use of energy substrates, and association with host proteins.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	504	 Thus, we propose that viruses of very different types may assemble their capsids via a step-wise pathway using host cell machinery.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	505	 Whether the same or different host machinery is recruited by various viruses remains to be determined.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	506	Implications of the Cell-free System for Viral Assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	507	To allow an analysis of the earliest events in capsid biogenesis, we designed this cell-free system to assemble the simplest version of an HIV capsid, one that does not undergo maturation and lacks HIV genomic RNA and HIVspecific proteins (except for Gag).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	508	 Now that the method has been established, it should be possible to supplement this system with such additional components in a manner that will extend the reconstitution and allow the roles of other components in capsid assembly to be determined.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	509	 For example, using a modified version of this system, it should be possible to determine the requirements for encapsidation of viral RNA and viral specific enzymes.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	510	 Note that although no HIV-specific RNA besides the gag transcript is included in the cell-free reactions described in this study, it is entirely possible that nonspecific RNA from the cellular extract becomes incorporated into the capsids that are made.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	511	Recent studies demonstrating the highly dynamic nature of HIV (Ho et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	512	, 1995) indicate that the only successful approach to combating this infection will be simultaneous, multi-drug therapy.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	513	 Antiretroviral agents currently in use target only two aspects of the HIV life- cycle, namely reverse transcription and protease-dependent virion maturation.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	514	 In order to develop novel targets for future antiretroviral therapy, a mechanistic analysis of other aspects of the HIV life cycle, such as capsid assembly, must be aggressively pursued.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	515	 The work presented here establishes a means of carrying out such a biochemical analysis for assembly of the HIV capsid.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	516	 Furthermore, these data indicate the existence of novel steps in viral assembly that appear to be amenable to blockade.

0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Departments of Pediatrics and  Microbiology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, March 31, 2005 , and in revised form, June 29, 2005.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	3	We reported previously that both serotypes of HSV trigger inositol triphosphate-mediated release of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores and that Ca2+ signaling plays a critical role in viral entry (7).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Pharmacological inhibition of ER Ca2+ release or chelation of intracellular Ca2+ reduces nuclear transport of the viral tegument protein VP16, a surrogate marker for capsid transport, and the downstream events in the viral life cycle, including expression of viral immediate-early genes and viral plaque formation.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Activation of Ca2+ signaling is associated with triggering of phosphorylation signaling pathways.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Specifically, we observed previously that HSV-1 and HSV-2 trigger the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) within 5-10 min following exposure of Vero (monkey kidney) or CaSki (human cervical epithelial) cells to virus.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	7	 FAK phosphorylation appears to occur downstream of release of ER Ca2+ stores, as treatment of cells with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, an inositol triphosphate receptor antagonist that prevents release of ER Ca2+, or chelation of intracellular Ca2+ blocks the virus-induced phosphorylation of FAK.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Activation of both pathways (Ca2+ and FAK phosphorylation) requires exposure to entry-competent virus, as HSV-1 deleted in the glycoproteins essential for penetration (glycoproteins B, D, and H-L) fails to induce Ca2+ release or to trigger FAK phosphorylation, whereas Ca2+ release and phosphorylation are preserved following exposure to the repaired viruses and to inactivated virus, which retain the ability to penetrate cells.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These findings led to the proposal of a new paradigm for HSV entry in which HSV triggers inositol triphosphate-mediated release of ER Ca2+ stores, which may facilitate fusion of the viral envelope and cell membrane, allowing delivery of capsids to the cytoplasm (7).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In response to activation of the Ca2+ pathways, we hypothesize that FAK and related signaling pathways are activated, which may promote transport of the viral capsids to the nuclear pores.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	11	 This study was designed to test this hypothesis and to evaluate whether HSV exploits FAK signaling pathways to promote its nuclear transport.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We used complementary molecular techniques, including dominant-negative variants, small interfering RNA (siRNA), and knockout cells, to explore the role played by FAK in HSV invasion.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	13	 We tested the hypothesis with both serotypes using human and murine cells.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Our findings indicate that FAK phosphorylation plays a central role in promoting transport of viral capsids.

0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Optical densitometry scanning of the gels demonstrated an 40% reduction in nuclear VP16 following Pyk2-specific siRNA transfection, consistent with the modest inhibition of viral plaque formation (Fig.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Similarly, transfection with Pyk2-specific siRNA also had a moderate effect on delivery of GFP to the nuclear pore as detected by confocal microscopy (Fig.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Together, these results suggest that HSV induces phosphorylation of Pyk2 independent of phosphorylation of FAK and that, although FAK plays the predominant role, activation of both kinases contributes to viral infection.

0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The results are representative of three independent experiments.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	236	  Several studies suggest that HSV uses microtubule-based transport to delivery viral capsids to the nuclear pore, where viral DNA is released into the nucleus (1, 17-19).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that HSV-1 capsids co-localize with dynein and dynactin.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Microtubule-depolymerizing agents, such as nocodazole, block HSV infection in culture and in animal models (1).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Moreover, nuclear transport of capsids is reduced by dynein inhibitors (19).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Precisely how HSV (or other viruses) engages and regulates the microtubule complexes is not known.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	241	 It has been suggested that cellular kinases triggered by viral infection or perhaps encoded by viruses themselves may play this regulatory role.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	242	 The results obtained in this study support this notion and suggest that cellular FAK and the related tyrosine kinase Pyk2 are activated by HSV to promote transport along microtubules.

0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	255	  FAK was originally identified as a tyrosine kinase localized to focal adhesions, which are multiprotein structures that link the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton through integrin receptors.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	256	 More recent studies indicate that FAK also participates in the regulation of microtubule function.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	257	 For example, integrin-mediated activation of FAK is required for microtubule stabilization in mouse fibroblasts (20).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Additionally, FAK phosphorylation at Ser732 is important for microtubule organization, nuclear movement, and neuronal migration (21).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	259	 The latter study suggests that FAK phosphorylation regulates microtubule-based nuclear translocation and neuronal migration.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Pyk2 (also called FAK2) belongs to the same family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases as does FAK.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	261	 In contrast to FAK, which is expressed ubiquitously, Pyk2 expression is more restricted, but is found in hematopoietic, neuronal, and epithelial cells.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Pyk2 shares substantial homology with FAK and interacts with intracellular signaling molecules to activate a variety of cellular pathways, including regulation of microtubules (15).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Notably, increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels are associated with Pyk2 phosphorylation.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	264	 We found that HSV also induces Pyk2 phosphorylation independent of FAK.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Pyk2 phosphorylation was most evident in FAK-/- fibroblasts, which are known to overexpress Pyk2 (15), and also contributed to viral infection post-binding.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Thus, the observation that HSV capsid nuclear transport occurs via microtubules and the association of FAK and Pyk2 with microtubule regulation suggest that HSV triggers these cellular kinases to harness the microtubule machinery for its nuclear transport.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	267	Several viruses activate FAK or related signaling pathways, but the precise role played by these pathways in viral invasion or pathogenicity has not been delineated previously.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	268	 FAK is activated by integrin binding and aggregation.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Thus, viruses that bind integrin receptors, such as adenovirus and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), trigger FAK phosphorylation.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Adenovirus induces tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK within 15 min following infection of human corneal fibroblasts, but its role in viral pathogenicity is not known (22).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	271	 HHV-8 glycoprotein B, which possesses an RGD motif, binds to integrin receptors on target cells and triggers rapid phosphorylation of FAK and related signaling pathways.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	272	 The finding that HHV-8 infection of FAK-null cells is substantially reduced suggests that FAK may also be required for HHV-8 entry, but this has not yet been experimentally demonstrated (23-25).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Additionally, binding of HIV gp120 to T cells also triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (26), which may promote apoptosis (27), but has not yet been demonstrated to play any role in HIV entry or nuclear transport.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	274	It is not clear yet how HSV activates the FAK cell signaling pathway.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Although glycoprotein B is highly conserved among herpesviruses, only HHV-8 glycoprotein B possesses the RGD motif and interacts with integrin molecules as a receptor (28).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Recent studies demonstrate that HSV-1 glycoprotein H binds to v3 integrins; however; the functional significance of this interaction is unclear (29).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	277	 A recombinant virus with the RGD motif in glycoprotein H mutated to RGE shows no impairment in entry or infectivity in vitro (30) and also induces FAK phosphorylation.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	278	The results from our study suggest that FAK phosphorylation occurs downstream of Ca2+ signaling and is triggered either directly by the increase in [Ca2+]i or in response to Ca2+-dependent viral penetration.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	279	 This notion is supported by the findings that HSV induces an increase in [Ca2+]i in FAK-/- cells (Fig.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	280	 9) and that treatment of cells with pharmacological agents that block release of ER Ca2+ stores or chelation of intracellular Ca2+ prevents the virus-induced phosphorylation of FAK (7).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	281	 In contrast to what has been observed for HHV-8 glycoprotein B or HIV gp120, no single HSV glycoprotein-cell interaction appears to be sufficient to activate the requisite cell signaling pathways.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Our studies with deletion viruses indicate that penetration-competent virus is required to induce signaling.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	283	 This follows from the observations that HSV-1 deleted in glycoprotein L or glycoprotein D, both of which bind but do not penetrate, fails to induce the signaling responses, whereas heat-inactivated virus induces phosphorylated FAK (7).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Possibly, one of the HSV envelope glycoproteins interacts with a cell-surface receptor to trigger the signaling cascade, but the interaction is dependent on the other glycoproteins being present in the viral envelope.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	285	 This could occur if, for example, the other glycoproteins induce a conformational change in and/or recruit the requisite glycoprotein(s) to a specific site at the membrane.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	286	Defining precisely how HSV triggers the signaling pathways is critical, as the viral proteins involved are excellent candidate targets for antiviral therapies.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Although targeting critical cellular pathways such as FAK phosphorylation will undoubtedly have pleiotropic and potentially deleterious effects as suggested by the reduction in magnitude of virus-induced Ca2+ transients in FAK-/- cells and the observed changes in morphology of FAK knockout cells (15), targeting the viral proteins that activate the requisite signaling pathways should lead to the development of novel specific antiviral therapies.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The results from this study provide an important piece to the puzzle and suggest that blockade of HSV-triggered phosphorylation of FAK and, to a lesser extent, Pyk2 will prevent nuclear transport, a critical step in the establishment of HSV infection.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	6	Although plants lack homologs of the well-known metazoan peptide ligands, such as EGF, TGFss or Hedgehog, plant cells can also communicate via secreted molecules (Fletcher et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	7	, 2001; McCarty and Chory, 2000).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, in contrast to animals, cytoplasmic continuity between plant cells is the rule, not the exception.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Most plant cells are connected by plasmodesmata, plasma membrane-lined channels that provide cytoplasmic continuity between adjacent cells.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Plasmodesmata, which are used in the transport of nutrients and signaling molecules including RNAs and proteins, can be divided into two major groups (Crawford and Zambryski, 1999; Haywood et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The primary plasmodesmata form during cytokinesis, whereas the secondary plasmodesmata develop between cells that are not necessarily clonally related.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The size exclusion limit (SEL) of the different types of plasmodesmata can be measured using fluorescent tracer molecules.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In most cases, plasmodesmata in younger tissues have larger SEL and are morphologically simpler than those in older tissue (Crawford and Zambryski, 2001).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	14	Two modes of movement through plasmodesmata have been proposed.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Targeted movement involves specific interactions between the transported macromolecules and plasmodesmata components.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This leads to an increase in the SEL and is therefore not limited by the endogenous SEL of a given cell.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	17	 By contrast, non-targeted movement resembles passive diffusion and is governed by the endogenous SEL of the plasmodesmata involved (Crawford and Zambryski, 2000; Imlau et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The best understood case of targeted movement is probably the trafficking of plant viral movement proteins (MPs), which can move over long distances in plants and are key to the spreading of plant viral infections.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A good example of non-targeted movement is provided by green fluorescent protein (GFP).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Using transient transfection by bombardment, it has been shown that native GFP can move several cells away from its source.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In addition to the SEL, multimerization and the addition of nuclear or ER localization signals can hinder, or even prevent, GFP from leaving the source cell (Crawford and Zambryski, 2000; Crawford and Zambryski, 2001).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	22	Apart from viral proteins, studies of macromolecule movement in plants have focused traditionally on long-distance transport of photosynthates and larger molecules or complexes through the phloem (Lucas, 1995; Zambryski and Crawford, 2000).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	23	 A good example is the sucrose transporter SUT1, whose mRNA is transported into the phloem before it is translated (Kuhn et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Moreover, grafting experiments have demonstrated the existence of long-distance mRNA movement in plants (Kim et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	25	 More recently, studies conducted in several plant species have demonstrated that non-cell-autonomous effects of transcription factors involved in plant development can be mediated by protein movement (reviewed by Haywood et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	26	The first example of transcription factor movement was discovered through studies of the homeodomain protein KNOTTED1 (KN1) in maize.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Most plant organs originate post-embryonically from meristems, which include stem cells set aside during embryogenesis.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In the aerial part of the plant, new organs emerge from the shoot apical meristem (SAM), which consists of three tissue layers, L1-L3.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	29	 KN1 protein is found throughout the maize SAM but kn1 mRNA is absent from the L1 layer (Jackson et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In leaf injection experiments, not only was KN1 transported to the surrounding tissue through plasmodesmata, but KN1 also increased the SEL of plasmodesmata, enabling the transport of kn1 sense RNA and protein complexes (Kragler et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	31	 KN1 can also move away from its source of expression when expressed from heterologous promoters in Arabidopsis (Kim et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	32	 There is similar evidence that the Antirrhinum MADS-box transcription factor DEFICIENS (DEF) moves from inner to outer tissue layers in developing flowers, although the extent of movement is stage- and organ-dependent (Perbal et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	33	In Arabidopsis, two endogenous transcription factors move into neighboring cells: SHORTROOT (SHR) (Nakajima et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	34	, 2001) and LEAFY (LFY) (Sessions et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	35	 RNA of the GRAS-family transcription factor SHR is expressed in the stele of the root (Helariutta et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	36	, 2000), but SHR protein is found in both the stele and the surrounding endodermis, which is missing in shr mutants.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Further studies using transgenic misexpression confirmed that movement of SHR from the root stele to endodermis is required for endodermis development (Nakajima et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	38	 RNA of the plant-specific transcription factor LFY is expressed in all three layers of young floral primordia, which are mis-specified as shoots in strong lfy mutants (Weigel et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Surprisingly, LFY RNA expression in the L1 of developing flowers is sufficient to fully rescue the lfy-mutant phenotype.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In such transgenic plants, LFY protein, but not LFY RNA, is detected in all layers of the rescued flowers, indicating that LFY protein moves from the L1 into inner layers (Sessions et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	41	 By contrast, the transcription factor APETALA1 (AP1), which has similar in vivo functions as LFY but is structurally unrelated, behaves largely cell-autonomously (Sessions et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	42	Although movement of transcription factors in Arabidopsis and other plants is by now well-established, there are still major gaps in understanding the underlying mechanisms.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Here, we characterize the mode of LFY movement in Arabidopsis SAMs and floral primordia.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Using functional LFY-GFP fusion proteins, we show that LFY moves more readily from the L1 into deeper cell layers than laterally into adjacent, clonally related cells.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	169	 We used these fusions, which increase the size of LFY by about half, from 47 to 74 kDa, to further characterize the movement of LFY, which has been previously detected using anti-LFY antibodies (Sessions et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The fusions were introduced into lfy-12/+ plants under the control of the ML1 promoter.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	171	 To test independently for functionality, the N- and C-terminally tagged versions were also expressed under the control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	172	 All five transgenes were able to rescue the lfy-12 mutant phenotype, and to cause the typical gain-of-function phenotypes associated with overexpression of LFY (Weigel and Nilsson, 1995), which indicates that the three GFP fusions were fully functional.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	173	Using the ML1 promoter lines, we examined the subcellular localization of the LFY-GFP fusions, as well as their movement from the L1 layer (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	174	 All three fusions were detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, which was best seen in leaf epidermal cells (GLFY shown in Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	175	 3C), and all produced more cytoplasmic signal than NLS:2xGFP (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	176	 In leaf epidermal cells, a punctate signal that appeared along the cell wall was observed with all three fusions (GLFY shown in Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	177	 3C), which suggests a possible association with plasmodesmata pit fields.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	178	 GLFY and GFP:LFY moved three to four cell layers into the L2 and L3 in both the vegetative and inflorescence apices, forming a gradient with the highest concentration in the L1 (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Both GLFY and GFP:LFY were restricted to the epidermal layer in maturing leaves (data not shown).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	180	 LFY:GFP moved further, approximately 10 cell layers in apices (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	181	 In leaves, its distribution in the epidermis was similar to that of GLFY and GFP:LFY, but it could also be detected in the underlying mesophyll cells (data not shown).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Overall, LFY:GFP appeared more cytoplasmic than GLFY and GFP:LFY.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	183	 This observation was confirmed by quantifying the total signal intensity in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the epidermal cells of emerging leaves from all three fusions (see Materials and Methods).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	184	 For GLFY and GFP:LFY, the nuclear to cytoplasmic signal ratios were very similar, 1:2.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	185	 By contrast, the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of LFY:GFP was 1:5.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	186	4, a twofold increase compared with GLFY and GFP:LFY.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Western blots probed with an anti-GFP antibody demonstrated that there was little degradation of the fusion proteins, indicating that the in vivo fluorescence signal came from the intact fusion proteins (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Taken together, the behavior of LFY-GFP fusions is intermediate between that of 2xGFP and NLS:2xGPF, both with respect to their cytoplasmic localization and their ability to move from the L1 layer.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	193	 The signal from LFY:GFP, which has the longest moving range, appears `fuzzy' because of its higher cytoplasmic localization (D).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	194	 All three fusions are localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm in leaf epidermal cells, and bright spots are sometimes found along the cell wall with GLFY (shown in C).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	195	  Lateral movement of GLFY within tissue layers Movement of LFY-GFP fusions from the L1 to deeper layers indicated that they can pass through the secondary plasmodesmata, which connect cells that are not clonally related.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	196	 To study the lateral movement of LFY within each tissue layer, we took advantage of a mutated enhancer from the AGAMOUS (AG) gene, which drives reporter gene expression in the inflorescence meristem in addition to the normal AG domain in the center of floral meristems (Hong et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	197	We expressed 2xGFP, NLS:2xGFP and GLFY under the control of the CaMV 35S minimal promoter fused to the mutated AG enhancer (AG intron*).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Except for the subcellular localization, the expression patterns of NLS:2xGFP (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	199	 5B) were indistinguishable, with fluorescent signal in the inflorescence meristem and central domain of young floral primordia.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The signal in both the shoot and floral meristems had discrete boundaries, indicating that GFP neither moved from the inflorescence meristem into emerging floral primordia, nor moved from the center of stage 3 flowers to the periphery (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	201	 However, a gradient of 2xGFP could be seen extending into deeper cell layers in L3 in stage 3 flowers (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	202	 5E), which is consistent with our earlier observation.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Thus, compared with movement from the L1 to internal layers, lateral movement of 2xGFP and NLS:2xGFP within tissue layers is much more limited, or possibly even absent.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The much reduced movement of 2xGFP and NLS:2xGFP within L1 and L2, compared with movement between layers, suggests that the plasmodesmata SEL within these two layers is lower than that between layers.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	213	  Similarly, GLFY could not move laterally within the same tissue layer (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	214	 We have previously found that periclinal, as well as anticlinal, sectors of LFY can rescue mutant parts of flowers, indicating that LFY moves in both directions (Sessions et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	215	 One possibility for the apparently different behavior of LFY and GLFY is that the greater size of GLFY, compared with endogenous LFY, reduces its ability to move laterally within tissue layers.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	216	We used a functional assay to test this assumption.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	217	 For this, we took advantage of the fact that the mutated AG enhancer is active in lfy mutants.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	218	 When we expressed LFY and GLFY under the control of this enhancer in lfy-12 plants, the same fraction of transgenic lines showed rescue in flowers (4 out of 12 lines for LFY and 4 out of 11 lines for GLFY; no significant difference using Fisher's exact test), suggesting that GLFY has similar activity to LFY.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	219	 However, the rescued flowers differed in phenotype.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Both GLFY and LFY rescued the development of the two inner whorls, which contain stamens and carpels, and in which the AG enhancer is active (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	221	 6), but only LFY was able to rescue petal development.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	222	 All four of the lfy-12; AG intron*::LFY lines that showed phenotypic rescue produced at least some flowers with petals, and many flowers had the normal complement of four petals.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	223	 By contrast, none of the four lfy-12; AG intron*::GLFY lines produced flowers with petals.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	224	 As GLFY appears to be as active as LFY in the inner two whorls where it is produced, the difference in their activity in the outer two whorls is consistent with the conclusion that LFY can move more extensively than GLFY.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	229	  Requirement of LFY movement for normal flower development Although it has been established that LFY can move within flowers (Sessions et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	230	, 2000) (this work), it is unclear whether LFY movement is required for normal flower development, because LFY protein and RNA are expressed throughout young flowers (Parcy et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	231	 The difference between LFY and GLFY in their apparent ability to move within layers allowed us to address this question by expressing LFY and GLFY under the control of the LFY promoter and comparing their ability to rescue lfy-12 mutants.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Of ten LFY::LFY transgenic lines in the lfy-12 background, three showed complete rescue, and the remaining seven showed nearly complete rescue, with only a few flowers having reduced petal or stamen number.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	233	 By contrast, only six out of fourteen LFY::GLFY lines in the lfy-12 background showed a similar degree of rescue; the remaining eight lines resembled weak or intermediate lfy mutants and were sterile.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	234	 This difference between their ability to rescue is statistically significant based on Fisher's exact test.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Although only the opposite result  to  full ability of movement-compromised LFY to rescue lfy mutants  to  would have been entirely conclusive, our finding is consistent with the notion that LFY movement may be required for normal flower development.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	236	 However, we cannot exclude the possibility that GLFY is somewhat less active as a transcription factor than native LFY, although no difference in activity could be observed when tested from the 35S and AtML1 promoters.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	237	Movement of mutant LFY proteins To further test whether LFY movement is regulated, we investigated whether deleting parts of the LFY protein abolishes intercellular movement.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Three large, non-overlapping deletions were made in the LFY coding sequence, each removing approximately one third of the protein (Fig.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Although they differed in the extent with which they moved from L1 to inner layers, all three deletion variants were still able to move from L1 into the inner layers in both vegetative and inflorescence apices.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	241	 GFP:LFY1, with an N-terminal deletion, behaved very similar to GFP:LFY.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	243	 GFP:LFY2, with a central deletion, was expressed at lower levels and was largely cytoplasmic, presumably because of the deletion of the NLS.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	244	 GFP signal could be clearly detected for at least three cell layers into the L2 and L3 (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	245	 7C), but its low expression levels may have been limiting our ability to determine its actual range of movement.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	246	 GFP:LFY3, with a C-terminal deletion, showed the least degree of movement, moving only one to two cell layers from the L1 (Fig.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	269	Mode of LFY movement Several lines of evidence are compatible with the view that LFY movement is non-targeted.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	270	 First, GFP-LFY fusions produced in the L1 formed limited gradients extending into deeper layers.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Their movement range was between that of 2xGFP and NLS:2xGFP, which move in a non-targeted fashion (Crawford and Zambryski, 1999; Crawford and Zambryski, 2000; Kim et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	272	 This is in contrast to the nearly uniform distribution in the shoot apex (reflecting an active mechanism of cell-to-cell transport) that is observed when a viral movement protein fusion is expressed in the L1.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Second, size affects LFY movement, as native LFY was more effective in rescuing lfy defects in adjacent cells in the same tissue layer than the larger GLFY fusion.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	274	 The effect of size is one of the prominent characteristics of non-targeted movement (Zambryski and Crawford, 2000).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Third, although differing in stability and sub-cellular localization, all three GFP-LFY truncations and fusions of four mutant lfy alleles were able to move from the L1 into interior cell layers.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Although one cannot exclude the possibility that LFY has several redundant movement signals, the simpler explanation is that the LFY protein sequence does not contain a specific movement or export signal.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	277	It has been suggested that non-targeted movement, like targeted movement, occurs through plasmodesmata.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	278	 The potential localization of foci of GFP-LFY fusion proteins along the cell wall in the leaf epidermis supports this hypothesis.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	279	 This also suggests that the size exclusion limit of the secondary plasmodesmata connecting tissue layers in the Arabidopsis apex is greater than 74 kDa (the size of the LFY-GFP fusions), which is consistent with previous estimates for nascent leaves (Zambryski and Crawford, 2000).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	280	Movement within and between tissue layers An important new finding is that GFP variants, as well as GLFY, move more easily in the apical-basal direction than laterally.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Using in vivo function as a criterion, we found that the GLFY fusion was less efficient than the native LFY in moving from the center of floral primordia to the periphery.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	282	 This functional difference is most likely a result of their size difference, because both proteins are fully functional in the cells where they are produced.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Similar to previous studies that have demonstrated that the inner central zone (L3) does not allow fluorescent tracer uploading from the vascular tissue (Gisel et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	284	, 2002), we observed much more limited lateral movement within the L3.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Thus, intercellular movement needs to be considered in the context of the specific location and developmental stage within the plant.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	286	That lateral movement is less easily achieved than apical-basal movement may also explain the fact that LFY does not move out of floral primordia into the inflorescence meristem in wild type (Parcy et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	287	, 2000), as lateral movement would be required for efficient protein exchange between the two tissues.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The inflorescence meristem may even form a symplasmic domain that is insulated from emerging floral primordia (Rinne and van der Schoot, 1998), thus restricting movement of all macromolecules.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Alternatively, there may be selective gating, such that movement of only certain macromolecules from floral primordia into the inflorescence meristem (and vice versa) is permitted.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	290	 A similar mechanism may also be responsible for maintaining discrete whorl boundaries within the flower.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	291	 In this context, it is noteworthy that floral homeotic proteins that are expressed in distinct whorls of the developing Arabidopsis flower, such as AP1 and AP3, do not move, whereas LFY, which is expressed throughout the flower, does (Jenik and Irish, 2001; Sessions et al.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	294	 This cannot be simply due to size, because an N-terminal fusion, GFP:AP1, could move well.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Furthermore, GFP:AP1 (55 kDa) is smaller than either NLS:2xGFP (57 kDa) or LFY-GFP fusions (74 kDa).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Therefore, if LFY is moving by diffusion, AP1 and AP1:GFP must be actively retained in the cells where they are expressed.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	297	 One way to achieve the retention may be by subcellular localization, such as nuclear or ER localization.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	298	 From this study, we have found that there is a good correlation between nuclear localization and movement: 2xGFP, which is highly cytoplasmic, can move a considerable distance from the L1, and the same is true for the predominantly cytoplasmic GFP:AP1 fusion.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	299	 AP1:GFP, which appeared to be exclusively nuclear, did not move.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Between these two extremes, NLS:2xGFP showed little cytoplasmic localization and moved only one cell layer.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	301	 The GFP-LFY fusions all showed more cytoplasmic localization than NLS:2xGFP, and all moved farther than NLS:2xGFP but less than 2xGFP.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Among the three GFP-LFY fusions, LFY:GFP had the most cytoplasmic localization and moved the farthest.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	303	Another possible mechanism for retaining a protein could be through the formation of large protein complexes with more exclusive subcellular localization, or simply with sizes above the SEL of plasmodesmata.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	304	 This may contribute to the retention of MADS domain proteins such as AP1, as several of them, including AP1, are known to form heteromultimers in the absence of DNA (Egea-Cortines et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	305	 In addition, it has been shown that AP3, a MADS-domain transcription factor that does not move between tissue layers, needs to heterodimerize with another MADS-domain protein, PISTILLATA (PI), in order to localize to the nucleus (McGonigle et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	306	 It is possible that the GFP:AP1 fusion disrupts such interactions, thereby interfering with biological activity and nuclear localization, as well as with retention in the cells where it is produced.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	307	In this context, it is noteworthy that SHR is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of the stele, where it is produced.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	308	 From there, SHR moves exactly one cell diameter, into the adjacent endodermis, where it is located entirely in the nucleus (Nakajima et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	309	 This observation is consistent with a model in which SHR gets trapped in the nuclei of the endodermis through interaction with a partner that causes translocation to the nucleus, similar to the AP3/PI interaction (McGonigle et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	310	Mechanisms of movement Our results are compatible with the view that LFY movement is driven by diffusion.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	311	 However, it remains unclear whether the same conclusion can be drawn regarding the intercellular movement of other transcription factors.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Another well-studied example of a trafficking transcription factor is KN1 of maize (Kim et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	313	 As with LFY, KN1-GFP fusions are detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and in a punctate pattern associated with the cell wall (Kim et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	314	 In contrast to LFY, for which various deletions did not prevent movement, a simple mutation in the homeodomain and the potential NLS of KN1 abolished its movement.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Furthermore, experiments with tobacco have indicated the presence of a cellular component that is limiting for KN1 movement, and have suggested that the mode of KN1 trafficking may be related to the targeted movement of viral movement proteins (Kragler et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	316	 However, other results are consistent with KN1 moving in a non-targeted fashion.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	317	 In bombardment assays, KN1-GFP moved considerably less well than a fusion of GFP to the movement protein of TVCV (Kim et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Furthermore, movement of KN1 expressed from the SCR promoter in the shoot apex of transgenic Arabidopsis plants was rather limited (Kim et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	319	, 2002), similar to that of NLS:2xGFP or GFP:LFY expressed from the ML1 promoter (this work).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Further studies in a nonheterologous system will be required to clarify the mechanisms behind KN1 movement.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	321	 A complex relationship between targeted and non-targeted movement is also indicated by a recent study, in which a dominant-negative form of the tobacco NON-CELL-AUTONOMOUS PATHWAY PROTEIN 1 (NtNCAPP1) was overexpressed.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	322	 In such transgenic plants, trafficking of viral movement protein, but not of KN1, was affected (Lee et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Interestingly, tobacco LFY protein appears more uniform in such transgenic plants, which also have phenotypes reminiscent of LFY overexpressing plants.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	324	 The causal relationship between these observations needs further investigation, but it will be interesting to combine the dominant-negative NtCAPP1 overexpressing plants with the tools presented here.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	325	It is also worth noting that the determinants underlying transcription factor movement may be species-dependent.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Like LFY, its Antirrhinum ortholog FLORICAULA (FLO) has non-cell-autonomous effects in mosaic studies (Carpenter and Coen, 1995).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	327	 In contrast to LFY, the extent to which FLO can rescue mutant flowers varies depending on the layer in which FLO is expressed (Hantke et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	328	 As FLO protein has not been examined in these mosaics, it is unknown whether the differential rescue ability is caused by differences in FLO movement, or is only a result of downstream effects, such as the documented abnormalities in target gene expression in the mosaics (Hantke et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Another example of interspecific differences is provided by DEF of Antirrhinum, which was found to move from the L2 to the L1 in a stage- and organ-dependent manner (Perbal et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	330	 However, the DEF ortholog AP3 of Arabidopsis does not move between layers (Jenik and Irish, 2001), which indicates that subtle differences in sequence, or interspecific differences in the translocation machinery, affect transcription factor movement, the latter being consistent with the interspecific differences that have been reported for GFP movement (Crawford and Zambryski, 2001).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	331	 These observations highlight that care must be taken when extrapolating from one transcription factor assayed in a single species or single tissue.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	332	In conclusion, we have presented evidence that the transcription factor LFY moves in a non-targeted fashion.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	333	 We are proposing the testable hypothesis that movement is a default mechanism for many proteins in the Arabidopsis shoot apex, unless they are either efficiently targeted to specific subcellular locations or retained through formation of protein complexes.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	334	 More case studies are needed to determine whether our results can indeed be generalized to include other proteins, other tissues and other species.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Tissue-specific GFP expression studies also revealed dynamic regulation of PD SEL.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Estimates for PD SEL in mesophyll or trichome cells of mature leaves have been obtained from microinjection experiments, and range from one to a few kDa (Wolf et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	7	, 1989; Waigmann and Zambryski, 1995).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, in immature sink tissues the observation of GFP diffusion suggests that the PD SEL may be as high as 30-50 kDa in these tissues (Imlau et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Developmental changes in GFP diffusion are correlated with changes in PD structure during leaf development, from simple linear channels to complex branched forms (Oparka et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	10	 It is also evident that GFP can diffuse cell-to-cell in some mature tissues, depending on the tissue type and species (Crawford and Zambryski, 2000; Itaya et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Developmental modifications to PDs are also relevant to MP localization and trafficking.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	12	 For example, TMV or cucumber mosaic virus MP has been shown to be targeted to plasmodesmata and trafficked between cells only when the leaf reached a certain developmental stage (Ding et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These observations of GFP diffusion and MP trafficking reveal developmental regulation of PD function, suggesting that signaling through PDs is important in plant development.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The idea that MP trafficking is related to that of endogenous proteins is also supported by the fact that trafficking is extremely rapid (Ding, 1998), and that a plant MP-related protein, CmPP16, can traffic itself and mRNA through PDs (Xoconostle-Cazares et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	15	 However, the extent to which trafficking of endogenous proteins is developmentally regulated is unclear.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Endogenous trafficking proteins include phloem proteins (Balachandran et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	17	, 1997) as well as several developmental transcription factors such as LEAFY (LFY), SHORTROOT (SHR) and KNOTTED1 (KN1).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The LFY meristem identity protein acts non-autonomously and is able to traffic from the L1 layer to the L2 and L3 meristem cells and to complement a lfy mutant (Sessions et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In the root, the SHR protein traffics from the stele into the endodermal cell layer, and trafficking appears to be required for its function in cell fate specification (Nakajima et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The influence of tissue-specific or developmental signals in trafficking of these proteins is largely unknown.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	21	The first endogenous protein shown to traffic cell-to-cell was the maize homeodomain protein, KN1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Mosaic analysis of a dominant Kn1 allele showed that it acts non-autonomously during maize leaf development (Hake and Freeling, 1986).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Later, in situ hybridization and immunolocalization experiments showed that KN1 protein is detected outside the domain of mRNA expression, suggesting the possibility of KN1 trafficking (Jackson et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Microinjection studies of fluorescently labeled KN1 protein showed directly that KN1 has the ability to traffic between mesophyll cells, to increase PD SEL and to specifically transport its mRNA (Lucas et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	25	 These studies suggested that the KN1 protein itself could be the cell non-autonomous signal, and in support of this hypothesis we showed that a GFP-tagged KN1 fusion is able to traffic in the leaf and shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis (Kim et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Arabidopsis encodes four class I KN1-related homeobox (KNOX) genes (Bharathan et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The most closely related to KN1 are KNOTTED 1-like homeobox protein 1/BREVIPEDICELLUS (KNAT1/BP) and SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM); KNAT1 is thought to be the Arabidopsis ortholog of KN1 (Bharathan et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	28	, 2000), but STM has closer functional similarity to KN1 on the basis of similar null mutant phenotypes and expression patterns (Long et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	29	 STM and KN1 function in SAM initiation and/or maintenance, and KNAT1/BP is involved in the regulation of inflorescence architecture (Byrne et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The possible involvement of trafficking in the function of the Arabidopsis KNOX proteins has not been investigated.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	31	In this report we show a specific difference in inter-layer trafficking in the Arabidopsis leaf between GFPMP and GFPKN1.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Similar rescue phenotypes were observed in 50% of the independent transgenic lines (4 lines total).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The complemented plants showed relatively normal phyllotaxy, leaf and flower morphology (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	222	 5C, inset), but were shorter, had additional axillary shoots and were sterile.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	223	 In contrast, transgenic lines carrying pSTM-KN1 showed full complementation of stm-11 (not shown), including normal stature, flower morphology and fertile seeds.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Therefore KN1 could fully complement stm when expressed from the STM promoter, and the fusion of GFP to KN1 slightly impaired its function.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	225	To address whether KN1 expression in the L1 and its subsequent trafficking into L2 and L3 layers was sufficient to rescue stm, we next transformed stm-11 heterozygotes with the pAtML1-GFPKN1 construct.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	226	 In the T1 generation 21/32 (66%) of the stm-11 homozygotes showed partial complementation of the stm-11 phenotype (Fig.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Therefore, the L1 expression of GFPKN1 gave partial complementation of stm-11 that was less complete than the complementation we observed using with pSTM-GFPKN1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	230	 To identify whether the partial complementation by L1 expression of GFPKN1 was because of the GFP fusion to KN1, we also transformed stm-11 heterozygotes with a pAtML1-KN1 construct.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	231	 The T1 stm-11 seedlings ( > 20 independent lines) carrying the pAtML1-KN1 construct showed similar phenotypes to those with pAtML1-GFPKN1, i.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	234	 About 32% (74/229) of stm homozygous seedlings from 3 independent lines showed partial complementation, with phenotypes similar to those observed in the T1 (not shown).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	235	Since STM and KNAT1 could also traffic out of the L1, we determined whether L1 expression of these proteins could complement stm-11.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Plants expressing STM or GFPSTM from pAtML1 showed a very severe phenotype of stunted growth, small lobed leaves, no cauline leaves and flowers defective in sepal, petal and stamen development (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	237	 This phenotypes was presumably partly due to ectopic expression of STM in the leaves and floral organs.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	238	 A few plants showed milder, bushy phenotypes (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	239	 These bushy plants were homozygous stm-11 (not shown), suggesting therefore partial complementation by the L1-specific expression of STM.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	240	 L1 expression of KNAT1 also resulted in partial complementation, as about 30% (7 /24) of T1 plants expressing GFPKNAT1 in the L1 showed partial rescue of stm-11.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	241	 The stm-11/pAtML1-GFPKNAT1 seedlings developed rosette shoots (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	242	 5G) that later became bushy, similar to stm-2 plants (not shown).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	243	In summary, L1 expression of KN1, STM or KNAT1 was sufficient to give partial rescue of stm-11.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	244	 We assume that this rescue is in part due to KNOX protein that traffics into the L2 and L3 layers of the SAM.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The partial complementation of stm-11 by KNAT1 expression agrees with previous findings that KNAT1 has a partially redundant function with STM (Byrne et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	246	To test if KN1 trafficking was essential for complementation of stm-11 in this assay, we made a non-trafficking GUSKN1 fusion.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	247	 We fused GUS (68 kDa) at the N terminus of KN1, with an intervening alanine linker, as previous studies showed this to be the optimal configuration for KN1 fusions (Kim et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	248	 The GUSKN1 fusion protein behaved cell-autonomously in the leaf, as GUS activity was detected only in the perivascular cells in J2111/UAS-GUSKN1 lines (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	249	 5H,I) or in the epidermis in pAtML1-GUSKN1 lines (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	250	 The GUSKN1 fusion was also cell-autonomous in the SAM, as pAtML1-GUSKN1 plants showed GUS activity only in the L1 layer (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	251	We next asked if the L1 restricted expression of GUSKN1 could rescue stm-11.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	252	 We observed no rescue of the stm-11 phenotype in 16 independent T1 stm-11 seedlings and in more than 200 stm-11 seedlings from 4 independent T2 lines that expressed GUSKN1 strongly in the L1 (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	253	 This failure to complement could be because GUSKN1 was unable to traffic into L2 and L3 layers, or because the GUS fusion blocked KN1 function independently of its inhibition of KN1 trafficking.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	254	 To distinguish these possibilities, we asked if expression of GUSKN1 in all cell layers of the SAM was sufficient to rescue stm-11.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	255	 To this end, a 35S-GUSKN1 construct was transformed into stm-11 heterozygotes.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	256	 As expected, the transgenic plants showed constitutive GUS activity in all SAM layers (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	257	 We confirmed GUSKN1 over-expression by western blotting using the anti-KN1 antibody (Smith et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	258	 We observed shoot rescue in five out of 15 independent T2 lines (33%) that segregated for stm-11, indicating that the GUSKN1 fusion was indeed functional in this shoot rescue assay (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	259	 The rescue phenotypes were generally weaker than those of the GFPKN1 lines, though some of the 35S-GUSKN1-rescued seedlings developed inflorescence shoots, similar to the stm-11 plants rescued by L1-specific expression of KNOX proteins (not shown).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Therefore, GUSKN1 expression in all SAM layers could partially complement stm-11, whereas L1-specific expression gave no such complementation.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	261	We previously showed that 35S-GFPKN1 plants develop KNOX over-expression phenotypes (Kim et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	262	 To our surprise, the 35S-GUSKN1 transgenic plants ( > 40) that were wild type for stm did not show any KN1 over-expression phenotypes (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	263	 5P), despite having strong expression of GUSKN1 throughout the leaves (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	264	In summary, GUSKN1 was cell-autonomous and partially complemented stm-11 if expressed in all meristem layers, but not when expressed specifically in the L1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	265	 These data support the hypothesis that trafficking out of the L1 is required for shoot rescue in the pAtML1-KNOX expression lines.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Over-expression of the GUSKN1 fusion did not produce KNOX over-expression phenotypes, suggesting either that the over-expression phenotypes require the trafficking function of KN1, or that the GUS fusion interrupts some other function of KN1 involved specifically in generating over-expression phenotypes.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	267	Developmental and tissue-specific control of KN1 trafficking In plants with simple leaves, KNOX genes are usually expressed only in the SAM, though developmental consequences of ectopic leaf expression and the expression of KNOX genes in compound leaves indicate that they can function during leaf development (Bharathan et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	268	 We found that GFPKN1 trafficking was regulated tissue-specifically in the leaf.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Whereas it could traffic from mesophyll to epidermis, trafficking did not occur from epidermis to mesophyll, in either leaf primordia or in fully expanded leaves.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Consistent with these observations, distinctive phenotypes arose from layer-specific expression of KN1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	271	 As expected, the mesophyll-specific expression of GFPKN1 resulted in strong KNOX over-expression phenotypes, similar to constitutive (35S promoter driven) expression (Lincoln et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	272	 However, epidermal-specific expression of GFPKN1 produced a relatively mild, rumpled phenotype.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	273	 This mild phenotype is probably due to the restriction of KN1 in the epidermis, though the fact that epidermal expression is able to alter leaf shape does indicate a non autonomous effect of KN1 that is presumably not due to trafficking.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Similar unidirectional signaling was observed in periclinal chimeras of the floral organ identity genes GLOBOSA (GLO) and DEFICIENS (DEF) in Antirrhinum.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Some effects of DEF and GLO expression were non cell-autonomous, however these effects were only partially explained by movement, as DEF also moves from L2 to L1 but not in the opposite direction (Perbal et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	276	 In this study we showed that the lack of protein movement out of the epidermis was not, however, a general phenomenon.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Both GFP and GFPTVCV MP moved freely from epidermis to mesophyll, demonstrating that the PDs between epidermal and mesophyll cells are open to both diffusion-mediated and selective protein movement.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	278	Uni-directional trafficking of KN1 in the leaf suggests that KN1 normally traffics from inner to outer layers, and may reveal a directional signaling pathway.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Although class I KNOX genes are not normally expressed in the simple leaves of maize, rice and Arabidopsis, they are expressed in compound leaves (Bharathan et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	280	 For example, LeT6 is expressed in tomato leaf primordia as well as in the SAM (Chen et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	281	 showed that LeT6 mRNA expression was strong in the L2/L3 layers and reduced or absent from the L1 layer of the SAM, and we note that this expression pattern continues in the young leaf primordia (Chen et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	282	 It would be interesting therefore to test whether KNOX proteins traffic directionally in the tomato compound leaf; such a process could provide a mechanism for regulation of leaf morphology by signaling from inner to outer layers during development.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Classic studies involving inter-specific periclinal leaf chimeras indeed indicate the potential for direction signaling during leaf morphogenesis (reviewed by Tilney-Bassett, 1986).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	284	In support of the hypothesis that KN1 traffics through PDs, it showed a punctate pattern resembling that seen with GFPMP, which has been linked with plasmodesmata in studies using electron microscope level immunolocalization (Ding et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Our results imply, however, that the mechanism of KN1 trafficking differs from that of the viral MP.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	286	 This could be because tissue-specific receptors that recognize distinct trafficking motifs in the different proteins.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	287	 This idea is supported by the recent report that non-cell-autonomous pathway protein (NCAPP1), a putative PD receptor, interacts with CmPP16 and TMV MP but not with KN1 (Lee et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Alternatively, tissue-specific post-translational modification(s) of KN1 might affect its ability to traffic.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	289	 For example, phosphorylation regulates the trafficking of TMV MP (Citovsky et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	290	, 2000), and perhaps a similar mechanism controls KN1 trafficking.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	291	KN1 and related Arabidopsis KNOX proteins STM and KNAT1 traffic in the SAM Whereas KN1 was unable to traffic from epidermal to mesophyll cells in the leaf, it could traffic from epidermal (L1) cells to underlying cells in the inflorescence SAM.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Two Arabidopsis homologs of KN1, KNAT1 and STM, could also traffic in the SAM, suggesting that hypothetical signal(s) for trafficking in KN1 are conserved in other KNOX proteins.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	293	 These signal(s) could be made up of a simple, short sequence and/or complex structural motif(s).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	294	 So far, studies using viral MPs and rice phloem proteins suggest that recognition by the PD trafficking machinery involves structural motifs (Haywood et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	295	, 1998), though a short sequence motif appears to control the trafficking of the heat shock cognate 70 chaperone (Aoki et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	296	 In the case of KN1, a short peptide, homologous to a region near the N terminus of the protein, can interfere with its trafficking, though it is not known whether this sequence motif is sufficient for trafficking (Kragler et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	297	We observed a relatively short range of GFPKNOX protein trafficking in the Arabidopsis SAM, which generated a steep gradient of GFP fluorescence spanning approximately 23 cell layers.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	298	 In contrast, GFPKN1 can traffic over at least 3-5 cell layers in the leaf (Kim et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	299	 GFPTVCV MP or free GFP moved further than GFPKNOX in the SAM, through more than six cell layers.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	300	 This suggests that KNOX protein trafficking in the meristem is relatively restricted, and may be used for short range signaling.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	301	 The more pronounced nuclear localization of GFPKN1 in the meristem than in the leaf may be the cause of its shorter range of trafficking, as nuclear localization probably restricts its chance to interact with PD.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	302	 A similar mechanism was proposed for the restriction of SHR trafficking (Nakajima et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	303	, 2001) and of GFP diffusion (Crawford and Zambryski, 2000).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	304	 In the maize shoot apex, a KN1 protein gradient is also evident between the SAM and leaf primordia (Jackson, 2002).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Although the biological significance of these KNOX protein gradients is not yet clear, it is possible that they are used to activate target genes at different positions along the gradient (Jackson, 2002).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	306	Caution is required in interpreting the trafficking of GFP fusion proteins.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	307	 The GFP tag increases the size of the protein and may affect trafficking efficiency.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	308	 However, the GFPKN1 fusion used in this study produced normal KN1 overexpression phenotypes and also complemented the stm mutation, suggesting it retained normal biological function(s).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	309	 In addition, the low quantum yield for GFP, relative to other fluorophores, may well result in a significant underestimation of the range over which the tagged protein can traffic.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	310	Biological function of KNOX homeodomain protein trafficking The critical question is what, if any, is the function of KNOX protein trafficking in intercellular signaling? The conservation of trafficking ability in KNOX proteins of different species suggests that their function requires trafficking, and the nuclear localization of GFPKNOX proteins following trafficking in the SAM suggests that they can function in transcription in target cells.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Cell-to-cell trafficking of KNAT1 could explain the non cell-autonomous regulation of epidermal cell fate by KNAT1, reported by Venglat et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	312	GFPKNOX expression in the L1 rescued shoot formation in stm-11 mutants, and trafficking was probably required for this rescue, because the cell-autonomous GUSKN1 fusion did not result in rescue.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Whereas this failure to rescue could be because GUSKN1 was inactive, this was not the case since it could partially rescue stm-11 when expressed in all meristem cell layers using the 35S promoter.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	314	 However, the rescue of stm-11 by 35S-GUSKN1 was only partial, and we speculate that full KN1 function in the SAM might require its intercellular trafficking.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	315	 A functional requirement for KN1 trafficking in the wild-type situation remains to be tested by determining if expression of the non-trafficking version of KN1 under a faithful STM promoter can complement the stm mutant.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	316	Our results suggest that the correct spatial and temporal expression pattern and/or level of KN1/STM in the SAM is required for full complementation of stm-11.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	317	 In contrast to the AtML1 promoter, use of the STM promoter resulted in GFPKN1 expression at a relatively homogeneous level in the different SAM layers.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	318	 These expression differences are probably the reason why the two constructs resulted in different complementation phenotypes; pAtML1-GFPKN1 (or KN1) expression always resulted in partial complementation of stm and abnormal phyllotaxy, while complementation using pSTM-GFPKN1 (or KN1) was more complete and produced seedlings with normal phyllotaxy.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	319	 In this regard, intercellular protein trafficking might provide a way to regulate the distribution and concentration of key developmental regulators across a cellular domain like the SAM.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Intercellular KN1/STM trafficking may be a redundant `fail-safe' mechanism to ensure all cells adopt the SAM fate, analogous to the mechanism originally proposed by Mezitt and Lucas (Mezitt and Lucas, 1996) for non-autonomous action of FLORICAULA, and supported by the demonstration of LFY trafficking (Sessions et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	321	Plants expressing the non-trafficking 35S-GUSKN1 fusion did not have the usual KN1 over-expression phenotypes.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	322	 We therefore hypothesize that KN1 trafficking might be required to generate the over-expression phenotypes, or that movement per-se is important for function, rather than simply which cells contain KN1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	323	 One possible mechanism would be if KN1 was modified and gained a novel function during intercellular movement.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Partial unfolding of KN1 is required for passage through PDs (Kragler et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	325	, 1998), and could expose KN1 to post-translational modification(s).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Alternatively, the lack of a KNOX overexpression phenotype in the 35S-GUSKN1 plants could be because the fusion of GUS inhibits the ability KN1 to interact with partner proteins, such as Arabidopsis homologs of KN1 interacting protein (KIP), a BEL1-like TALE homeodomain protein (Smith et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Such interacting proteins may be differentially expressed or differentially required for the over-expression and SAM functions of KN1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Lastly, the nuclear localization of STM is required for its activity (Gallois et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	329	, 2002), and if the fusion of GUS interfered with KN1 nuclear localization specifically in the leaf this could also affect its ability to generate over-expression phenotypes.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	330	In conclusion, KN1 trafficking is under temporal and tissue-specific developmental control, and trafficking ability is conserved in STM and KNAT1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Our results suggest that trafficking of KNOX homeodomain proteins is functionally significant, and may coordinate the development of source and target cells, or provide a redundant `fail-safe' mechanism to control the fate of cells in the SAM.

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received October 24, 1997; Revised and Accepted January 8, 1998.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	4	Transcriptional interference between adjacent genes has been demonstrated in a variety of biological systems.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To study this process in RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcribed genes we have analysed the effect of transcription on tandem HIV-1 promoters integrated into the genome of HeLa cells.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We show that transcriptional activation at the upstream promoter reduces transcription from the downstream promoter, as compared with basal transcription conditions (in the absence of an activator).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Furthermore, insertion of a strong transcriptional termination element between the two promoters alleviates this transcriptional interference, resulting in elevated levels of transcription from the downstream promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Actual protein interactions with the downstream (occluded) promoter were analysed by in vivo footprinting.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Binding of Sp1 transcription factors to the occluded promoter was reduced, when compared with the footprint pattern of the promoter protected by the terminator.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This suggests that promoter occlusion is due to disruption of certain transcription factors and that it can be blocked by an intervening transcriptional terminator.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Chromatin mapping with DNase I indicates that a factor binds to the termination element under both basal and induced conditions.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	12	Termination of transcription may be defined as arrest of the elongating polymerase followed by release of the transcription complex and nascent RNA from the DNA template.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	13	 It is known that in eukaryotes functional poly(A) signals are required for efficient transcriptional termination by RNA polymerase II (pol II), since mutations which disrupt polyadenylation also result in the loss of termination (1-3).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Furthermore, the strength of the poly(A) signal correlates with termination efficiency, since a stronger processing signal is more effective in directing termination (4).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Actual termination sites remain ill defined and in most cases studied so far transcription continues well beyond the poly(A) site (5) until a downstream element is encountered which forces the elongating polymerase to pause or arrest (6,7).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Pause sites can take various forms, such as DNA-bound protein complexes or intrinsic DNA sequence elements, either of which are capable of causing poly(A) site-dependent termination of transcription (6,8-11).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	17	It has been reported that inefficient transcriptional termination can cause interference with DNA replication and with transcription of an adjacent, downstream gene, leading to impairment of these central cellular processes (12-16).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This emphasizes the need for an efficient termination process in some cases.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Transcriptional interference (promoter occlusion) has been observed in various eukaryotic systems, including genes transcribed by pol I and II, in prokaryotic operons and in certain viruses (12).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In vitro experiments in the pol I system have suggested a mechanism for promoter occlusion where transcription through the promoter may cause displacement of a bound transcription factor.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Interference is prevented by terminator elements which reside upstream of each pol I promoter (17,18).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In contrast to the less complex pol I promoter, transcription by pol II depends on multiple protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in the promoter and enhancer regions, which form stable initiation complexes (19).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	23	In the present work we have studied tandem pol II promoters, derived from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), stably integrated into the chromosome.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	24	 We investigated the importance of an intervening transcriptional terminator in this context and furthermore have also investigated DNA-protein interactions on the downstream promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Analysis of cytoplasmic RNA revealed that upon transactivation with the viral Tat protein transcription from the downstream promoter is reduced (as compared with already high basal transcriptional conditions).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	26	 A transcriptional terminator placed between the two LTR promoters allowed increased transcription from both promoters upon transactivation by Tat.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Actual DNA-protein interactions on the downstream promoter were analysed by DMS in vivo footprinting.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	28	 While we consistently observed footprints when the promoter was preceded by the terminator, these were reduced when the protective intervening terminator was absent, suggesting reduced binding of transcription factors to the occluded promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The footprint pattern changed mainly across the binding sites for transcription factor Sp1.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Furthermore, DNase I footprinting in vivo indicated binding of a protein to the 5[prime]-end of the pause site, corresponding to the position where the termination factor MAZ has been shown to bind in vitro (11).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This binding activity is stable under induced conditions.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Taken together, our results demonstrate that a pol II termination element located between strong pol II promoters plays a critical role in preventing transcriptional interference in a chromosomal context.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	33	 We suggest that transcriptional interference may result in destabilization of specific transcription factors on the occluded promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Schematic diagram of the two constructs (CI and CII) used in this study.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Both contain two minimal HIV-1 LTR promoters in tandem (L1 and L2).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	36	 CII contains a termination element placed between the LTR promoters [the SpA poly(A) site followed by the C2 pause site], allowing termination of L1 transcripts upstream of the L2 promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	37	 L1 transcripts derived from the CI construct have to read through the L2 promoter to use the HIV poly(A) site (HpA).

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	40	The interference constructs (L1[alpha]L2[alpha] and L1[alpha]-SPAC-L2[alpha]) have been previously described (20).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	41	 For stable transfection into HeLa cells a 2404 bp SfiI-BamHI fragment, containing the SV40 early promoter driving the neo gene, was inserted between SfiI and EagI sites of these constructs to generate CI and CII.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	42	The Tat gene (derived from a Tat expression plasmid; 21) was cloned into pBabe hygro, a plasmid containing the hygromycin resistance gene driven by the SV40 early promoter (22).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	43	HeLa cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique with 5  microg plasmid.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The medium was changed 12 h after transfection and selective medium [MEM (Gibco), containing 400  microg/ml G418 (Gibco), 300  microg/ml hygromycin (Boehringer Mannheim), 10% fetal bovine calf serum] added 48 h after transfection.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Single colonies were picked and expanded; cell pools consisted of ~100 individual colonies.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Cells were maintained in medium containing 200  microg/ml G418.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Tat-expressing HeLa cells were established by transfecting CI and CII clonally derived cell lines with a Tat-expressing plasmid and propagated in the same selective medium containing additionally 200  microg/ml hygromycin.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	48	RNA extraction and RNase protections were carried out as described previously (20).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Riboprobe L is complementary to the PvuII-SmaI region of L2 (Figs 2 and 3; 20).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Riboprobe S, for the internal standard, was constructed by inserting a restriction fragment (AvaI-HindIII from CI) spanning the neo gene into AvaI/HindIII-cut pGEM-3 (Promega).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The plasmid was linearized with NcoI for in vitro transcription.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Riboprobes were purified on 5% sequencing gels and 5  x  105 c.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	53	 probe were hybridized with 10  microg cytoplasmic RNA.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Gels were scanned in a phosphorimager and quantified using appropriate software (Molecular Dynamics).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	55	HeLa cells (106) grown in 10 cm dishes were incubated with DMS (1  microl/ml; Aldrich) for 5 min.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	56	 DNA extraction and linker-mediated PCR reactions were performed as described in Current Protocols (1996).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	57	 All primers were purified on 20% sequencing gels.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	58	HeLa cells (up to 2  x  106) were trypsinized, washed in PBS, then in physiological buffer (23), before being taken up in 200  microl physiological buffer (+1% NP-40) and treated with 175 U DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) for 5 min at 4 degrees C.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	59	 After DNase I treatment 5 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) were added and the DNA phenol extracted and analysed by linker-mediated PCR (24).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	60	It has previously been shown that a strong transcriptional termination signal can block interference between two HIV-1 LTR promoters on plasmids transiently transfected into HeLa cells (20).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	61	 To study promoter interference in a chromosomal context we stably integrated these tandem promoter constructs into HeLa cells.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Two constructs (CI and CII; Fig.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	63	 1) were transfected, one containing an intervening termination signal [SPAC, consisting of the strong poly(A) site SPA and the downstream C2 pause element] between the two LTRs (CII; 25) and the other without this intervening termination signal (CI).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Individual cell clones containing the CI and CII transgenes respectively were expanded and maintained in selective (G418-containing) medium.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Since the HIV-1 promoter is inducible by the viral transactivator Tat, we were able to detect transcriptional interference by enhancing transcription with Tat.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	66	 This was achieved by stably transfecting these clonally derived CI and CII cells lines with a Tat-expressing vector, allowing a direct comparison of basal and Tat trans-activated transcription of one particular clone.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Tat expression was monitored at the RNA level by S1 nuclease mapping of the Tat transcript (data not shown).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In the experiments described below we analysed individual clones derived from these stable transfections which were checked for their integrity and copy number by Southern blotting (data not shown).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Clones containing single copy integrants were employed.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Furthermore, to obtain position-independent values we also analysed complex cell pools consisiting of >100 positive clones.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Trans-activation by Tat leads to reduced transcription from the L2 promoter in CI cell lines.

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The gel was quantified in a phosphorimager.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Bars represent RNA levels from the L1 and L2 promoters under basal (-Tat) and trans-activated conditions (+Tat) and were normalized to the neo control.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Also shown are values for a complex CI cell pool (note the lower scale).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The diagram at the bottom shows the origin of the protected RNA species.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The tandem promoters L1 and L2 (white boxes) driving the [alpha]2-globin reporter fragments (grey bars) and the SV40 promoter (which is driving the neo gene) are shown, as are the HIV-1 poly(A) site at +80 (relative to the start site at +1; empty triangles), the [alpha]2-globin poly(A) site (grey triangle) and the LTR-specific antisense riboprobe (L) which protects transcripts initiated at both LTR promoters simultaneously.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The intervening terminator (SPAC) allows increased transcription from L2 promoters in the presence of Tat.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	80	 RNase protection assay of cytoplasmic RNA from HeLa cells stably transfected with CII.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Lanes 1 and 3, two different CII clones under trans-activated conditions (+Tat); lanes 2 and 4, the same clones under basal conditions (-Tat); lanes 5 and 6, undigested riboprobes L and S.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Trans-activation allows an increase in transcription from both promoters, L1 and L2, in the presence of the terminator.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Values were normalized to the internal neo standard.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Also shown are values for a complex CII cell pool.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Diagram as in Figure 2, except that the intervening terminator, SPAC, containing the synthetic poly(A) site is shown (filled triangle).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	86	It should be noted that the CI and CII constructs both contain an adjacent SV40 promoter-enhancer element which is used to drive expression of the neo gene.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Consequently, the HIV LTR promoters are significantly active in the absence of Tat, presumably due to the proximity of the SV40 enhancer (26,27).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Even so, the presence of Tat further activated the LTR promoters and allowed detection of transcriptional interference effects between the adjacent LTR promoters.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	89	Transcriptional activity from the two promoters (L1 and L2) was assessed by RNase protection assays (Figs 2 and 3).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Cytoplasmic RNA, extracted from various individual clones and pools, was analysed using a mixture of two riboprobes: probe L, an LTR-specific riboprobe which recognizes both LTR transcripts simultaneously and distinguishes between L1 read-through and L2 initiating transcripts (derived as a PvuII-SmaI fragment from L2); probe S hybridizes to transcripts initiated at the SV40 promoter (which drives transcription of the neo gene contained within the transfected plasmid).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Probe S was included as an internal control in each assay which allowed direct comparison of a single clone under basal and trans-activated conditions, when normalized to the internal standard.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	92	Transcriptional interference occurs between stably integrated tandem HIV-1 LTR promoters.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	93	As shown in Figure 2, RNase protection analysis of transcripts derived from three CI clones yields two major products of 134 and 230 nt, corresponding to transcripts initiating on the L1 and L2 promoters respectively.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Figure 2 also shows quantitative analysis of this data as well as comparable data for a CI pool.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	95	 These results demonstrate a relatively small change in L1 and L2 promoter activity following trans-activation by Tat, presumably due to their already high basal levels.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Using the SV40 RNA as an internal standard (which is not responsive to Tat), a direct assessment of the change in LTR promoter activity under induced conditions was determined.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Under basal conditions (-Tat) the L2/L1 ratio was calculated as ~3 (varying from 2.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	98	5 between the three clonal and pool RNAs, taking the number of labeled residues into account).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	99	 However, in the presence of Tat, while the activity of L1 increased, L2 activity actually decreased (relative to basal transcription conditions), indicating that the trans-activated upstream promoter may be reducing transcription from the downstream promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The LTR fragment comprising L2 contains an additional 20 bp from the LTR at its 3[prime]-end, which might explain the consistently higher L2 promoter activity.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	101	 As mentioned above, using these chromosomally integrated constructs transcription from the HIV-1 promoters is rather high, even in the absence of Tat.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In contrast, transcription from the same constructs (lacking the SV40 driven neo gene) could hardly be detected without Tat in transient expression assays (20).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The most likely explanation for this difference is the presence of the SV40 regulatory region containing the enhancer (380 bp from SfiI to PvuII), which has been shown to influence expression from the HIV-1 and human globin gene promoters (28).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The proximity of this potent enhancer could affect basal transcription rates, thereby leading to the relatively muted Tat enhancement (27,28).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	105	 However, since these tandem promoters are differently affected by Tat, we infer that the activated L1 promoter (+Tat) reduces transcription from the downstream L2 promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	106	Additional minor bands visible in Figure 2 derive from L1 transcripts reading into the L2 region of the construct.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	107	 In particular, the L1 transcript is polyadenylated at the downstream L2 HIV poly(A) site (HpA; Fig.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	108	 1), giving rise to a 116 nt 3[prime] doublet.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	109	 A small fraction of transcripts read through this poly(A) site, generating bands of ~150 and 248 nt.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The 248 nt species arises from read-through of Hp(A) in L2 to the 5[prime] splice site of the [alpha]-globin reporter gene.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	111	 The origin of the 150 nt species may derive from a cryptic splice site.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Both of these L1 species, as well as the major 134 nt fragment, increase upon trans-activation.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The constant band of ~200 nt does not change upon trans-activation and derives from incompletely digested riboprobe.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Overall the 3[prime]-end products of transcription initiated at the L1 promoter are clearly present at much lower levels than the 134 nt 5[prime] product using probe L.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Presumably a significant fraction of L1 transcripts is spliced out in the L2 region.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Identification of these various minor L1-derived bands was confirmed by S1 nuclease mapping (data not shown).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	117	An intervening transcriptional terminator alleviates interference and restores L2 promoter activity upon Tat transactivation.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	118	To examine the role of a strong transcriptional termination element placed between two pol II promoters in a chromosomal context, cytoplasmic RNA extracted from clones and pools stably transfected with the CII construct was analysed by RNase protection (Fig.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	119	 CII contains a strong synthetic poly(A) site (SPA) followed by the C2 transcriptional pause site (11,25,29) between the two LTR promoters.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	120	 As mentioned above, transcriptional termination signals have previously been shown to relieve interference in transient transfection assays (30).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Since promoters may be regulated differently when part of higher order chromatin we wished to examine the role of this termination element between the LTR promoters in stable integrants.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	122	 As shown in Figure 3, no read-in transcripts were detected from the L1 promoter, suggesting 100% SPA use.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Secondly, whereas trans-activaton led to a relative decrease of L2 in CI clones, we consistently observed an increase for both promoters, L1 and L2, in CII when transcription was enhanced by Tat.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	124	 These results suggest that transcription from the downstream promoter, upon trans-activation, can only increase when preceded by the termination element.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	125	The data presented in Figures 2 and 3 indicate that interference occurs between stably integrated tandem LTR promoter constructs which was detected upon transcriptional enhancement by Tat.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Inhibition of the downstream promoter can be overcome by the presence of the intervening termination signal.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	127	In vivo footprinting indicates reduced binding of transcription factors to the occluded L2 promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	128	Promoter occlusion by the incoming polymerase complex may be caused by impeding transcription factor access to the promoter or alternatively by actual displacement of factors already bound to the promoter (17).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	129	 We therefore analysed actual DNA-protein interactions on the downstream L2 promoter by in vivo footprinting (31).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	130	 It should be noted that neither restricted access nor displacement of factors is likely to be an `all-or-nothing effect' and its resolution in vivo is therefore limited.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Footprinting was carried out using dimethylsulfate (DMS) as the modifying agent.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	132	 DMS methylates freely accessible guanosine residues of DNA in living cells, unless they are protected by DNA-bound factors.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Cells derived from both lines (CI and CII) were incubated with DMS for 5 min (qualitatively similar results were obtained with 2 and 10 min incubations), genomic DNA was purified, cleaved with piperidine and analysed by linker-mediated PCR on 6% sequencing gels.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	134	 As a control phenol-extracted chromosomal DNA was treated with DMS in vitro and analysed in parallel.

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Footprinting was performed on the coding strand of various clones and pools.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	137	 The promoter region from -15 (relative to the start site at +1) to the distal NF-[kappa]B sites is shown.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The left half of the figure (CI) shows the reduced footprints across the upstream elements (indicated on the left side) of CI integrants.

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Three G residues are indicated at the right side (filled arrowheads, -47, -60 and -79 relative to the start site at +1).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	141	A typical analysis is shown in Figure 4, where panel CII represents samples from a CII clone and pool.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Binding sites for transcription factor Sp1 are clearly visible as compared with the control (co, lane 7).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	143	 As expected, these sites are engaged in protein interactions on an active HIV-1 promoter (32).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	144	 In detail, the CII profiles compared with the control DNA (lane 7) indicate a partial protection of G residues in Sp1 sites 1 and 2, in particular at positions -54 and -55 with respect to the transcriptional start site, a hypersensitive site between the proximal Sp1 sites 1 and 2, at position -60, strong protections in Sp1 site 3 and a hypersensitive site at -79.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The distal Sp1 site 3 is known to have the highest affinity for Sp1 in vitro (33).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Whereas these footprints are clearly apparent in CII clones (and pools), they are significantly reduced in CI clones (and pools) lacking the intervening terminator.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The clearest differences are seen over the distal, high affinity Sp1 site 3, where all G residues are less protected in CI integrants.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Also, the G residues at -54 and -55 are markedly less protected in the CI clones (G residues in SP1 site 1 are also slightly less protected).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	149	 A reduction in hypersensity over the NF-[kappa]B sites was also noted (mainly in CI clones), although with less consistency.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Overall these results indicate that protein interactions on the downstream promoter, especially over the Sp1 sites, in CI clones are reduced when compared with those on the corresponding promoter preceded by the terminator.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	151	 We also observed minor differences in the protein interactions in CI clones when trans-activated by Tat as compared with basal conditions.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	152	 In particular, the two NF-[kappa]B sites and position -79 evident in c1/1 and c1/2, which are less hypersensitive in the presence of Tat, indicate perturbed protein interactions under trans-activated conditions.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	153	Taken together, the genomic footprinting data presented in Figure 4 reveal reduced binding of Sp1 (and to a lesser extent NF-[kappa]B) to the downstream promoter in the absence of an upstream terminator, indicating an effect of interference on protein interactions at the promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Since Sp1 activates transcription synergistically (34) and both proteins, Sp1 and NF-[kappa]B, are known to contact components of the basal transcription factor TFIID (35), displacement of these factors would explain reduced transcription from an occluded promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	155	A factor binds to the C2 pause site in vivo.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	156	The C2 pause element originates from the 420 bp intergenic region of the human complement genes C2 and factor B, located in the MHC class III region.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	157	 A region of 156 bp downstream of the C2 poly(A) site, which contains a protein binding site towards its 5[prime]-end, has been implicated in pol II termination (Fig.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The zinc finger protein MAZ (Myc-associated zinc finger protein), which was originally identified as a factor that binds to the c-myc P2 promoter (36), correlated with the termination efficiency of the pause sites in various assays (29).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	159	 DNase I in vivo footprinting of the C2 pause site.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The 5[prime]-end of the C2 pause site, containing the MAZ binding site, is shown.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	161	 All samples (lanes 1-5) were probed with the same set of primers.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Lane 1, G ladder (CII DNA treated with DMS and piperidine as a marker); lanes 2 and 3, DNA from a CII clone (+Tat and -Tat); lane 4, DNA from a CII pool (+Tat); lane 5, naked DNA treated with DNase I.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	163	 The white box on the left hand side corresponds to the in vitro MAZ binding site.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Arrowheads show protected (empty) and hypersensitive sites (filled) with the degree being indicated by size of the arrowhead.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The diagram at the bottom shows the position of the pause site and the MAZ binding site.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	166	To see whether a protein binds to the MAZ site in our integrated construct in vivo we analysed the chromatin structure of this region by DNase I in vivo footprinting.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Footprinting was carried out in isolated nuclei, which were taken up in physiological buffer (23) and partially digested with DNase I (24).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The cleavage pattern of the non-coding strand was analysed by linker-mediated PCR and compared with naked DNA, partially digested in vitro (no specific primers could be designed to analyse the coding strand).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Figure 5 shows a hypersensitive site at the 5[prime]-border of the protein binding site, slight protection in the centre (compare lane 2 and 5), a strongly protected residue towards the 3[prime]-end and a hypersensitive site at the 3[prime]-border.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The in vivo footprinting pattern is in agreement with previous in vitro footprinting data, where a 27 bp region at the same position was protected from DNase I using HeLa cell extract (29).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The data also indicated that the pattern did not change upon Tat induction (Fig.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	172	 5, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting stable binding of the protein to this site under basal and induced conditions.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	173	 The same pattern was obtained when analysing DNA from a cell pool in the presence of Tat (lane 4).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	174	 These results indicate that a protein binds to the C2 pause site in vivo and that binding is not abolished by Tat-actived transcription from upstream.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	175	 It would therefore seem likely that the binding of this factor to the terminator sequence is not disrupted by transcriptional interference.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	176	Transcriptional interference between adjacent transcription units has been observed in various systems.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Initially experiments in Escherichia coli showed that transcription from the strong prophage [lambda] promoter Pl inhibits the adjacent gal promoter (12).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Interference between promoters has also been detected on plasmids transiently transfected into mammalian cells (30).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	179	 In vitro experiments in pol I systems led to the suggestion of a possible mechanism for this phenomenon.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Template competition experiments in the mouse pol I system indicated actual displacement of transcription factor D by the incoming polymerase, which allowed transcription of competitor templates by the displaced factor (17).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	181	 A similar observation was made on the pol I promoter in the lower eukaryote Acanthamoeba, where a single initiation factor (TIF, the Acanthamoeba analogue of mouse factor D) is required for pre-initiation complex assembly and polymerase recruitment to the promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In vitro footprinting analysis revealed displacement of TIF from a dimeric pol I promoter construct by pol I passage through the promoter (18).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	183	Earlier work has emphasized a role for transcriptional termination elements to relieve interference between transcription units on plasmids transiently transfected into mammalian cells.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	184	 To examine the importance of terminators between transcription units in the genome we used HIV-1 LTR driven reporter constructs stably integrated into HeLa cells.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Since the HIV promoter is trans-activated by Tat we could directly compare individual clones under basal and trans-activated conditions and the effect of a trans-activated promoter on the downstream transcription unit.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	186	 As mentioned above, the high basic transcription rates of the transgenes were ascribed to the proximity of the SV40 regulatory region with its strong enhancer.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Therefore, the relative increase in transcription in the presence of Tat in this system was not drastic (27).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Nevertheless, upon trans-activation, while transcription from the upstream promoter L1 increased up to 5-fold, transcription from the downstream L2 promoter increased only when preceded by the terminator.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Mapping the 3[prime]-end of the upstream L1 transcript revealed its extension into the L2 promoter in CI (-terminator) cell lines, whereas in CII lines it was processed at the intervening terminator.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The same terminator consisting of the strong synthetic poly(A) site SPA linked to the C2 pause site (SPAC) has been shown to prevent promoter interference between the MLV LTR promoter and the keratin 10 gene in a recent study (22).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Stable cell lines transfected with an MLV expression vector containing the whole keratin 10 gene downstream of the MLV promoter followed by a hygromycin B resistance gene were selected and tested for keratin expression by western blotting.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	192	 No keratin 10 was detected in these clones unless SPAC was positioned between the MLV and keratin promoters.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Eighteen of 22 hygromycin B-resistant clones synthesized keratin 10 when SPAC was present (22).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	194	Since interference might be caused by disruption of transcription factor binding to the promoter by an upstream elongation-competent polymerase complex, we mapped DNA-protein interactions on the L2 promoter in vivo.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Comparison of occluded versus protected L2 promoter by DMS in vivo footprinting revealed reduced footprints at the occluded promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Differences in the protein binding pattern in CI and CII were mainly evident across the three Sp1 binding sites and to a lesser degree at the tandem NF-[kappa]B binding sites.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Reduction in Sp1 binding was consistent in several experiments and ~3-fold, whereas changes at the NF-[kappa]B sites varied.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Since Sp1 activates transcription synergistically (34) and partly by interacting with TAF 110, a component of the basal transcription factor TFIID (37), loss of Sp1 would be expected to result in a reduction in transcriptional activity.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Interestingly, Sp1 sites were shown to have no effect on transcriptional termination (10), whereas a bound CAAT box binding protein was effective in termination.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	200	 It seems possible that, depending on the nature of the DNA-protein interaction, binding of some factors is disrupted by transcription, whereas others remain stably bound.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The ability of DNA-bound proteins to impede polymerase elongation has previously been demonstrated (38).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	202	DNase I in vivo footprinting across the C2 pause site of the terminator indicated binding of a factor to the 5[prime]-part of the of the pause element.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	203	 This binding pattern did not change after Tat trans-activation, suggesting a stable contact despite increased transcription from upstream.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	204	 This region of the pause site, in particular the sequence G5AG5 has been shown to bind the zinc finger protein MAZ in vitro, which has been implicated in termination in various assays.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Insertion of the C2 pause site between two poly(A) sites greatly increased use of the weak upstream site, probably by pausing the polymerase.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Binding of this factor to the pause site might be necessary to halt the polymerase (Fig.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The role of MAZ in the termination process is currently being investigated in vitro.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Model for interference between stably integrated HIV-1 promoters.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Shown are the L2 promoter regions of both the CI and CII constructs.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Sp1 transcription factors (filled grey circles) are displaced by the incoming polymerase (pol II) in CI.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	211	 In CII the polymerase is stalled at the terminator, possibly by MAZ (black oval) bound to the pause site of the terminator, allowing stable binding of Sp1 to the downstream promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	212	Our data suggest that transcriptional termination elements play an important role in regulation of gene expression, to allow individual expression of adjacent transcription units.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	213	 The absence of a terminator can lead to reduction or impairment of adjacent gene expression, probably resulting from a disruption of DNA-bound regulatory proteins by a processive polymerase complex.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	214	 We are currently testing our model for transcriptional interference (Fig.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	215	 6) in yeast, where transcription units are densely packed and therefore efficient transcriptional termination of more significance.

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, January 24, 2005 , and in revised form, February 22, 2005.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	3	The structure of a helical virus, tobacco mosaic virus, has revealed defined interactions between repeating sets of three nucleotides in its ssRNA genome and each capsid subunit (reviewed in Ref.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In the crystal structures of spherical viruses (reviewed in Refs.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	5	 2 to 6) a large part, or all, of the nucleic acid component is invisible, because it is randomly oriented within the viral particles that form the crystal.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Fortunately, in a few icosahedral viruses some segments of the nucleic acid molecule (10 to 60% of the total) are arranged with the same symmetry as the capsid, and could be visualized.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The structural analysis (reviewed in Refs.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	8	 4, 7 to 10) has revealed that the visible capsid-nucleic acid interfaces generally include a limited number of amino acids and some 7 to 30 nucleotides that in several, but not in all cases, form intramolecular double-helical segments.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The tertiary structure acquired by the nucleic acid within the virion may be at least partly independent of the nucleotide sequence (11).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Consistent with this observation, a capsid-binding nucleotide motif is not repeated exactly along the sequence, and thus the modeled nucleic acid stretch represents an average of the true individual sequences bound.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Accordingly, many of the interactions detected in viral nucleic acid-capsid interfaces are van der Waals and polar interactions with the nonspecific phosphate and pentose moieties, but more specific interactions with the bases are also observed.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Ionic interactions between some phosphates and basic side chains protruding from the internal surface of the capsid, or located in disordered N-terminal (Nt) arms of capsid proteins, occur in several ssRNA plant viruses (12 to 17) and nodaviruses (18 to 20), and in the ssDNA bacteriophage X174 (21 to 23).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Such interactions were not observed in the ssRNA bean pod mottle virus (24) or in ssDNA parvoviruses (25 to 30), but many nucleic acid-capsid van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds were detected in the latter (25 to 30).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	14	 A high resolution structural model of the ssRNA satellite tobacco mosaic virus showed that binding of the RNA occurs mainly through an intricate network of direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds (15).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Specific and nonspecific capsid protein-oligonucleotide interactions were also analyzed in detail in artificial complexes formed by a recombinant capsid of the bacteriophage MS2 and identical copies of a unique viral ssRNA fragment (OR) involved in translational repression and initiation of capsid assembly (31, 32).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This allowed a structural interpretation of mutational analyses on the formation of a biologically relevant complex between OR and an MS2 capsid protein dimer (32 to 37).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	17	Several studies have provided evidence for a functional role of the viral nucleic acid and its interactions with viral proteins in the assembly, conformation, stability, and/or disassembly of spherical virions (for some examples see Refs.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	18	 However, and partly due to the limited structural information available, mutational analyses to dissect the individual role(s) of specific capsid side chains that interact with the nucleic acid molecule are scarce (e.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Also, no single-residue scanning of capsid side chains involved in major interactions at the viral nucleic acid-capsid interface had, to our knowledge, been described.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	20	The parvoviruses canine parvovirus (CPV) and minute virus of mice (MVM) constitute good models for structure-function studies of residues involved in viral nucleic acid-capsid interactions, because of the structural simplicity of the virion and the relatively well defined viral DNA-capsid interfaces (25 to 30).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The icosahedral T = 1 capsid of MVM (29, 30) or CPV (25 to 28) is formed by 60 protein subunits that are contributed by three non-identical polypeptides, which are derived from a single gene and show identical fold and core sequence.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	22	 VP2 is the major capsid component, VP1 includes the VP2 sequence plus a Nt extension, and VP3 results from the cleavage of the Nt of some VP2 subunits (48, 49).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The DNA recognition site is essentially equivalent in CPV and MVM (strain i), and the major ordered ssDNA stretch (11 nucleotides) adopts a very similar conformation in both viruses (25, 26, 30).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This DNA segment interacts through multiple hydrophobic contacts and/or hydrogen bonds mainly with 7 to 9 side chains of the capsid of either CPV or MVM (25, 26, 30) (see Table I).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Most of these side chains are chemically and sterically identical or similar in both viruses (50) and participate in similar interactions with the DNA.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	26	 For MVMi, a few shorter DNA stretches, spatially close to the major ordered DNA segment, could also be modeled (29, 30).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	27	 We have individually truncated to alanine many of those residues of the MVM capsid that were previously (26, 30) found to be more involved in interactions with ordered nucleic acid in the structural model of the virion.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The individual effects of the mutations on virus infectivity, viral particle assembly, conformational stability, and DNA packaging have been analyzed.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	29	View this table:    TABLE I DNA-protein interactions observed in the structural models of MVMi and CPV.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	30	Contact analysis was carried out using the program Whatif (64) and the PDB files 1mvm [PDB] (29, 30) and 4dpv (26, 27), including symmetry-related subunits for completeness.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The MVM and CPV residues in each row occupy equivalent positions in the aligned sequence and in the three-dimensional structure.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Three DNA stretches of 11, 4 and 1 nucleotides (denoted here as A, B, and C, respectively) were included in the atomic coordinates of MVMi (29, 30), but only the equivalent to stretch A was included in both the unrefined (25) and the refined (26, 27) atomic coordinates of CPV.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Residues in parentheses are those not seen to participate in interactions with the visible DNA stretches in either MVM or CPV.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Conservation of sequence and conformation is consistent with the possibility that the CPV residues in parentheses could interact with the equivalent to DNA stretches B and C, even though these regions could not be modeled in the crystal structure of CPV.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	35	Electroporation of Mammalian Cells, Immunofluorescence, and Infectivity Assays For mutational analyses, mammalian NB324K cells at a concentration of 2 x 107 cells/ml were electroporated as described previously (53, 54) with equal, non-saturating amounts (10  microg) of the infectious recombinant plasmid carrying the appropriate mutations, using in each experiment the non-mutated infectious plasmid as a control.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Virions were recovered at 72 h from transfected monolayers and titrated in standard plaque-formation assays (55).

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	101	 This confirmed that mutant Y270A is defective in capsid assembly.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	102	Externalization of the VP2 Nt and Packaging of the Viral DNA The maturation within the nucleus of MVM virions with an encapsidating genome triggers the externalization of the Nt of VP2 (48), an event that is required for infectivity, as the externalized peptide segment allows the traffic of the particle outward of the nucleus (56).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Thus, DNA-containing virions can be specifically detected in cells by in situ immunofluorescence with an antibody specific for epitopes located at the VP2 Nt (56).

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	109	It could be argued that mutation D273A may prevent the externalization of the VP2 Nt but not DNA encapsidation.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	110	 We considered this possibility unlikely, because the two events have been correlated (48, 56), and the mutations are located far away from the pores at the capsid 5-fold axes where the Nt are externalized.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	111	 However, to analyze this issue further, mutants D273A, Y270A, W60A, and the non-mutated control were subjected to density gradient centrifugation analysis.

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The purified virions were exposed to a controlled thermal gradient, and the variation in their intrinsic fluorescence was determined.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The virions exhibited a small, but detectable and reproducible transition at a temperature of about 54  degrees C (Fig.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	157	 This transition did not correspond to the conformational transition observed for VLPs (59) or empty capsids at a substantially lower temperature (see above), which is consistent with the fact that in the virions the VP2 Nt is already externalized (48, 56).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Instead, the transition detected in the virion may be related to the externalization of the VP1 Nt, which has been shown to occur at a similar temperature (66).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The transition corresponding to dissociation of the virion (Fig.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	160	 5B) (66) yielded a Tm of 77  degrees C, which is very similar to that found for VLPs or empty capsids using the same approach (59).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Also, no significant difference in stability between DNA-full virions and empty capsids was found when the hemagglutination activity of heated purified particles was compared at neutral pH.

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	166	 For reasons of scale and clarity, the complete curve obtained in the same experiment has been split into two parts corresponding to low (A) and high (B) temperature ranges.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The experimental data were fitted to sigmoidal transitions (continuous lines).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	168	 C, relative infectivity of purified MVMp virions as a function of temperature at pH 7.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The titer at each temperature was obtained using several dilutions of the sample.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	170	 No infectious virions were detected at the three highest temperatures tested.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The experiment was repeated, and similar results were obtained.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	172	Even though the virion particle is disrupted only at high temperatures, its infectivity may be slightly reduced before capsid dissociation occurs (66, 67).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Thus, during the thermal gradient experiments using purified non-mutated virions, aliquots were taken at different temperatures, and the remaining infectivity was determined in plaque assays.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	174	 The results suggest that infectivity may be lost in two steps (Fig.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	175	 The first step involved a moderate (5-fold) reduction in infectivity at about 50 to 55  degrees C, a temperature that was approximately coincident with that of the first transition observed by fluorescence (see above).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The second step involved a drastic reduction of infectivity (several orders of magnitude) that started at about 70  degrees C and led to a nearly complete loss of infectivity at about 80  degrees C, temperatures that corresponded approximately to those of dissociation of the virion, empty capsids, and VLPs (see above and Refs.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	177	The small virion:empty capsid ratio obtained from infections of cell lines with MVM (49), and the reduced infectivity of most mutants analyzed, made it difficult to obtain the relatively large amounts of each of the purified mutant virions that are needed for the above analysis.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	178	 However, the conformational stability of mutant infectious virions could be compared by following the reduction of infectivity in thermal inactivation kinetic assays, which required only a small amount of partially purified virions (61).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The results of these assays are shown in Fig.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	180	 6 for some representative variants and summarized in Table II for all of the mutants analyzed.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	181	 The stability of mutants D273A, Y270A and, possibly, N491A was not substantially different to that of the non-mutated control.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In contrast, the stability of most mutants, namely D58A, W60A, N183A, T267A, K278A, K471A, and D474A was clearly reduced (Table II).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	183	 To summarize, no mutation tested affected the thermal stability of the empty capsid, but most of them affected the thermal sensitivity of the infectious virion.

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The standard deviation was in each case about 15% of the average, except for t = 99 min.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	190	 In the latter case the number of plaque-forming units was very low, leading to somewhat larger errors.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	191	Second, the use of empty capsids to analyze the contribution to virion stability of interactions between capsid amino acid residues assumes that these interactions are similar in both types of viral particles.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The structure of the CPV (68) or the MVM capsid (29, 58) is nearly identical in both the empty particle and in the DNA-full virion.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	193	 For CPV, a comparison of the refined structures of the virion and the empty capsid showed some local differences in the conformation of several residues in the DNA-binding region (68).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	194	 However, a detailed contact analysis using the same structural models indicated that the residues equivalent to those of MVM we subjected to mutational analysis are involved in similar interactions in both the virion and the empty capsid: The side chains of Tyr-270 and Trp-60 in MVM, and the equivalent Phe-266 and Trp-58 in CPV, participate in multiple hydrophobic contacts with neighboring amino acid residues in the virion; in the empty capsid of CPV, nearly all of these contacts are preserved (further contacts were observed).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Lys-278 and Asp-474 in MVM and the equivalent Arg-274 and Asp-475 in CPV are linked in the virion by an intersubunit salt bridge, and this salt bridge is also preserved in the empty capsid of CPV.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	196	The results obtained, together with the considerations just discussed, allow us to propose defined structural roles for most of the residues that were found to be involved in major interactions with the viral DNA, which can explain the observed functional involvement of these residues in the virus life cycle.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	197	Residues with Moderate Effects on Infectivity Truncation to Ala of Asp-58, Trp-60, Asn-183, Thr-267, Lys-278, Lys-471, or Asn-491 did not significantly affect capsid protein expression, assembly into capsids inside the nucleus, or externalization of the VP2 Nt.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This latter fact indicates that those mutants are also able to encapsidate the DNA, as confirmed by direct encapsidation analysis using mutant W60A.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	199	 The side chains of Trp-60 and Lys-278, but not the others, not only may interact with the DNA, but are also involved in multiple interactions with other capsid residues as well.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	200	 However, none of those seven mutations had any significant effect on the stability of the capsid itself.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	201	 In contrast, all of those mutations (with the possible exception of N491A, which had a lesser inhibitory effect on infectivity) caused a substantial reduction in the thermal sensitivity of the infectious virion.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	202	 These results indicate that the interactions of the mutated residues with the DNA, and not the interactions with other capsid residues, have a role in preserving the virion conformation needed for the infectivity of the virus particle.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	203	 The aromatic ring of Trp-60 is oriented perpendicularly to the ring of a neighboring purine base, which allows extensive van der Waals contacts and favorable dipole interactions.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Asp-58, and Asn-183 and Asn-491, may be hydrogen-bonded, respectively, to a purine base and to the sugar-phosphate backbone.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Thr-267 is involved in several van der Waals contacts.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Lys-278 and Lys-471 showed no contacts with the DNA, but they were relatively close to DNA phosphates, and could contribute to medium-range electrostatic interactions.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	207	The results also showed that, even though no neutralization of the charge of most DNA phosphates has been detected, the thermal stability of the MVM virion is not reduced relative to that of the empty capsid at neutral pH.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	208	 We propose that the manyfold repeated hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between the viral DNA and Asp-58, Trp-60, Asn-183, Thr-267, Lys-278, and Lys-471, and perhaps other residues involved in capsid protein-viral DNA interactions (Table I) that have not been analyzed in the present study, may help to counteract the potential destabilization caused by repulsion between non-neutralized DNA phosphates in the virion.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Truncation of the side chain of any of these residues except Lys-278 led to a reduction of infectivity by about one order of magnitude.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The individual contribution to virion stability and infectivity of each of those few residues involved in major interactions between the viral DNA and each capsid subunit is, thus, relatively moderate.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	211	 However, their combined effect, if additive as expected, could be dramatically important.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	212	Mutation K278A also reduced virion stability, but not infectivity.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	213	 One possibility to explain this anomalous result (under study) is that the reduction in stability could be compensated by another, favorable effect of the same mutation on another step of the viral cycle.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	214	Residues with Drastic Effects on Infectivity Truncation of Tyr-270, Asp-273, and Asp-474 did not affect capsid protein expression or nuclear transport.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	215	 However, contrary to the mutations discussed above, for these three mutants the reduction of infectivity was dramatic, and it does not appear to be caused by a reduction in the thermal stability of the infectious virion.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	216	Mutant Y270A is clearly defective in capsid assembly.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Tyr-270 is involved in multiple interactions not only with the DNA, but also with neighboring capsid residues.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Thus, the most likely explanation for the inefficient assembly of this mutant, and the dramatic reduction in viral yield, is the removal of some critical intracapsid interactions.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	219	The D474A mutation did not prevent capsid assembly, and capsid stability was not reduced either.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	220	 The D474A virion did show a reduced stability, but similar or higher reductions in stability were observed for many mutants whose infectivity (viral yield) was reduced by only 10-fold.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Thus, the drastic reduction in infectivity of D474A may be related mainly to another, as yet unidentified step in the viral cycle.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	222	Finally, the D273A mutation did not prevent capsid assembly, but it severely impaired the externalization of the Nt of VP2 and the encapsidation of the viral DNA, which explains its drastic effect on the infectivity.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Asp-273 is very close to a DNA phosphate, but not to any acidic or basic amino acid residue (the closest basic residue is Lys-494 at a distance of 4.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	224	7 A), and it makes no visible contacts with the DNA or with other amino acid residues.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	225	 One possibility is that the charge distribution at the capsid internal surface, which may be significantly altered if 60 negative charges are removed by the D273A mutation, may be critical for DNA packaging.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	226	 In addition, the D273A phenotype provides further support to the previous suggestion that encapsidation of the MVM genome occurs in empty capsids previously assembled inside the cell nucleus (56).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	227	To conclude, the results found with this spherical virus model indicate that several amino acid residues per capsid subunit, which are involved in interactions with the viral nucleic acid molecule, are important for virus infectivity because of their role in preserving the integrity of the infectious virus particle.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Because most of these residues are not involved in substantial intracapsid interactions, and none of them contributes to the stability of the capsid itself, their effect may be directly mediated by the multiple non-covalent interactions they establish with the viral DNA.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	229	 In addition, at least one acidic residue at each DNA-binding region is needed for DNA packaging.

0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	6	E2 has recently been proposed as a potential immune target for vaccines aimed at treating pre-malignant disease (Schiller  and  Hildesheim, 2000).
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This has been supported by data from the cotton tail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) model, where vaccination of rabbits with DNA encoding CRPV E2 was found to protect against the development of papillomas following subsequent tumour challenge (Han et al.

0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These assays variously can detect linear or conformational epitopes, respectively, so their lack of concordance may not be surprising.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	12	 A single study has investigated naturally occurring E2-specific T-cell responses in women with HPV-associated CIN where helper T-cell responses to the E2 C terminus, but not to the N terminus, occurred at the time of viral clearance (Bontkes et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Clearly there is a need for further baseline investigations of naturally occurring E2-specific immune responses in patients with HPV-associated disease.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	14	VIN is associated with high-risk HPV-16 infection in over 90 % of cases and has shown a significant increase in incidence over recent decades, particularly in younger women (van Beurden et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	15	 It is a chronic disease characterized by recurrence following standard treatment (Herod et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	16	 It therefore provides an excellent opportunity for the study of naturally occurring HPV-specific immune responses in women with persistent high-risk HPV infections.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This immunity is likely to have arisen as a consequence of chronic exposure to the virus but may be insufficient to effect disease regression and virus clearance.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The relapsing and recurring nature of VIN is likely to represent an ongoing battle between viral and immune factors in the natural control of this disease.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Thus, a comparison of HPV-specific immunity in women with chronic HPV infections and in those without may provide some insight into those immunological responses that play an important role in the natural history of HPV-associated disease.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	20	We have previously described an interferon- (IFN-) ELISPOT assay, which facilitates the detection of HPV-16 E2-specific memory T-cell responses to E2 C terminus protein following its processing and presentation by autologous dendritic cells (DCs) (Davidson et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The advantage of this system is that it is not limited by the use of HLA-restricted peptides but rather allows the study of the full range of T-cell responses that may have arisen as a consequence of natural antigen presentation in vivo.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In the present study, we have measured the 86 amino acid C-terminal E2- and virus-like particle (VLP) L1-specific T-cell responses in women with HPV-16-associated VIN and healthy female volunteers using this methodology and proliferation.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	23	 HPV-16 L1 VLP-specific T-cell responses were measured as a positive control, since previous studies have found high proportions of healthy volunteers and patients with HPV-16-associated high-grade CIN to respond to this antigen.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In addition we measured full-length GST to E2- and both GST to L1 and VLP L1-specific serological responses in the VIN and control subjects.

0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Other studies using overlapping peptides from the HPV-16 E2 protein have revealed a broad E2-specific T helper cell repertoire in healthy volunteers (de Jong et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	145	 DCs pulsed with HPV-16 VLP have also been shown to stimulate primarily type 1-dominated T helper cell responses (Lenz et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	146	, 2001) and MHC class I-restricted CTL responses (Rudolf et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The specific release of IFN- by CD4+ Th1 cells and CD8+ CTLs following stimulation with E2 and VLP protein antigens may therefore provide a useful measure of those cell-mediated immune responses that are likely to be important in the natural clearance of HPV infections.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	148	 In the present study, ELISPOT responses to C-terminal E2 and L1 required a 4 day stimulation of T cells with autologous protein-pulsed DCs; a 24 h stimulation of bulk PBMC cultures with antigen was not sufficient to reveal these responses.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	149	 This suggests that appropriate antigen processing and presentation is necessary to demonstrate these low-frequency memory responses.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	150	VLP L1-specific T-cell responses were more prevalent in the VIN group compared with the controls, both by IFN- ELISPOT (72 % vs 53 %, P=NS) and by proliferation assay (94 % vs 53 %, P < 0 02).
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	151	 All but one of the patients who were seropositive for L1-specific Ig also demonstrated L1-specific proliferative T-cell responses.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Twelve of these patients additionally showed L1-specific IFN- release by ELISPOT.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	153	 All but one of the healthy volunteers were seronegative for HPV-16 L1-specific Ig, but a significant proportion of the group were L1-specific proliferative and IFN--releasing T-cell responders.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	154	 In the absence of HPV-16 L1-specific antibodies, the T cells measured by these assays most likely reflect cross reactivity with, or shared, epitopes following exposure to other HPV types.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	155	 There is evidence for this in the studies of Williams et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	156	 (2002) for HPV-11 and Steele et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Overall, HPV-16-positive VIN patients have high levels of antibodies to the viral capsid proteins and these are likely to be capable of neutralizing the virus.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	158	 This antibody production is presumably also reflected in the high prevalence of T-helper responses measured by either proliferation or ELISPOT.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	159	E2 seropositivity is not prevalent in the disease and, as with T-helper responses (de Jong et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	160	, 2002), may reflect exposure to different HPV types with shared epitopes.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	161	 However, there does appear to be a subgroup of patients with specific T-cell responses to E2, as measured by proliferation and ELISPOT.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	162	 These two patients were clinical responders in a trial of an HPV vaccine (E.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	163	 The clinical outcome may be a result of a shift in immune factors that clear the lesion(s) (which may be heterogeneous) and concomitant reduction in local virus immune suppression (Tindle, 2002).
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	164	 None of the healthy volunteers showed evidence of E2-specific T-cell responses either by proliferation assay or by ELISPOT.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	165	 This is consistent with the results of Bontkes et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	166	 (1999), who found no E2-specific T-helper cell responses in healthy control subjects using an IL-2 release assay (Bontkes et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	167	, 1999), but contradictory to the findings of de Jong et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	168	 (2002), who found frequent strong T-helper cell responses to HPV-16 E2 peptides in four out of eight normal donors.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	169	There are several explanations for the discrepancies noted in these studies.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Firstly, there was only evidence of exposure to HPV-16 in one of the healthy volunteers recruited into this study.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	171	 (2002) tested anonymous donors for E2-specific T-helper cell responses and had no details regarding the age, sex, cervical smear history or HPV-16 VLP antibody status of their subjects.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Secondly, the methodology used was very different.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	173	 used 30-mer overlapping peptides from the full HPV-16 E2 sequence.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Significant cross-reactivity was seen between particular HPV-16 E2-specific T-cell responses and homologous peptides from other HPV types.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Thus, the measured responses may reflect priming with HPV types other than HPV-16 itself.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Furthermore, it is not clear whether all of the peptides investigated in this study are naturally processed by antigen-presenting cells in vivo.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	177	 In contrast, since the intact E2 C terminus protein was used to measure T-cell responses in this study, any measured E2-specific immunity must reflect stimulation with naturally processed peptides.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	178	 This is also true for the study by Bontkes et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	179	 (1999), where E2 C terminus or N terminus proteins were used to stimulate PBMCs for 7 days before testing the supernatant for IL-2 concentration.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	180	 However, the assays used in the present study should also test responses to the HPV-16 E2 N terminus, since it is possible that we are missing a significant response not evident in the IL-2 release assays (Bontkes et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	181	It appears that exposure to HPV-16-positive VIN stimulates both antibody and T-cell responses to L1 protein but these may not always be sufficient to clear the lesions.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In contrast, E2-specific T-cell responses are rare, although a repertoire exists, so it is possible that their absence may facilitate the persistence of VIN lesions.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Without clear proof of E2-specific T-cell responses associated with lesion resolution, it is unclear whether a lack of responsiveness indicates the inappropriateness of the assay or a true absence of E2-specific T cells.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Nevertheless, these studies of immunity to an early and late HPV-16 protein in VIN provide a baseline for comparison of responses to vaccines such as chimeric VLPs including L1 to E7 to E2 (Schiller  and  Hildesheim, 2000).
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The challenge is to demonstrate such immune responses in patients at the time of virus clearance (systemic and local analyses), and for this, long term follow-up studies of large numbers of young women are required.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	186	 This will resolve whether E2 is simply non-immunogenic or whether absence of immunogenicity is specifically associated with persistence of HPV-16 infection.

0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	5	We examined gene and surface expression and activity of the endothelin (ET)-1 receptors (ETA and ETB) in subendothelial (L1) and inner medial (L2) cells from the main pulmonary artery of sheep with continuous air embolization (CAE)-induced chronic pulmonary hypertension (CPH).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	6	 According to quantitative real-time RT-PCR, basal gene expression of both receptors was significantly higher in L2 than L1 cells, and hypertensive L2 cells showed significantly higher gene expression of ETB than controls.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Expression of both genes in hypertensive L1 cells was similar to controls.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis confirmed the increased distribution of ETB in hypertensive L2 cells.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Although only the ETA receptors in control L2 cells showed significant binding of [125I]-labeled ET-1 at 1 h, both receptors bound ET-1 to hypertensive cells.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Exposure to exogenous ET-1 for 18 h revealed that only the L2 cells internalized ET-1, and internalization by hypertensive L2 cells was significantly reduced when compared with controls.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Treatment with ETA (BQ-610) and ETB (BQ-788) receptor antagonists demonstrated that both receptors contributed to internalization of ET-1 in control L2 cells, whereas in hypertensive cells only when both receptor antagonists were used in combination was significant suppression of ET-1 internalization found.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We conclude that in sheep receiving CAE, alterations in ETB receptors in cells of the L2 layer may contribute to the maintenance of CPH via alterations in their expression, distribution, and activity.

0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The ET family of 21 amino acid peptides exists in three distinct isoforms: ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	16	 It is an extremely potent vasoconstrictor resulting in slowly developing and sustained contraction.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Although the endothelial cell was originally described as the source of ET-1, it is now known that several other cell types, including pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells, synthesize this peptide (33, 36).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	18	The biological effects of ET-1 are mediated by two distinct ET receptor subtypes, ETA and ETB (1, 35).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The affinity of the ETA receptor for ET-1 has been shown to be ~100 times that for ET-3 (ET-1  >  ET-2  >  ET-3), whereas the affinity of the ETB receptor is equipotent for all three isoforms of ET (34).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Early reports indicated that the ETA receptor on smooth muscle was responsible for the vasoconstrictor effect of ET-1, whereas the ETB receptor on endothelial cells modulated ET-1-induced vasodilation.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, recent pharmacological studies suggest that there are two classes of ETB with cell specific effects, ETB1 on endothelial cells mediating vasodilation and ETB2 on smooth muscle cells mediating vasoconstriction (9).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The ETB receptor also functions as a "clearance receptor" and is particularly important in the lung, where 50% of ET-1 is retained (22, 29).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	23	ET-1 has been linked to the development of chronic pulmonary hypertension (CPH).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Increased expression of the peptide has been demonstrated in endothelial cells of pulmonary arteries from patients with idiopathic and secondary forms of pulmonary hypertension (15), and arterial-to-venous ratios of ET-1 protein were found to be elevated above the normal range in patients with pulmonary hypertension (40).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Several studies have linked increased expression of ET-1 to the development of hypoxia-induced CPH in rats (5, 24), and use of ET-1 receptor antagonists has been shown both to inhibit progression of the disease and to promote recovery (4, 10, 43).

0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	239	In a previous study, our group identified differences in the ET-1 system in L1 and L2 cells from control sheep (41).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	240	 L1 cells, like endothelial cells, were found to synthesize and release ET-1, whereas L2 cells had less synthetic capacity for ET-1 but, rather, had the propensity to internalize exogenous ET-1.

0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	247	Function of ETA and ETB receptors.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	248	 In humans, ETA and ETB are encoded by distinct genes located on chromosomes 4 and 13, respectively (32).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells, the ETA receptor is linked to vasoconstriction as well as hypertrophy and smooth muscle proliferation, whereas the ETB receptor is linked to clearance of ET-1 from the circulation as well as both vasoconstriction and vasodilation (22, 36, 39).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Studies in the pulmonary vasculature suggest that the actions of ET-1 are mediated by at least three receptors: one ETA receptor and two ETB receptor subtypes.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Pharmacological studies in several species indicate that the endothelial ETB receptor (designated ETB1) mediates vasodilatation, whereas the ETB2 receptor expressed in smooth muscle acts as vasoconstrictor (5, 7, 9).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	252	ETA and ETB receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that undergo agonist-stimulated desensitization or inactivation (26).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Desensitization is thought to prevent both overstimulation and damage to activated cells as well as saturation by weak stimuli.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Phosphorylation has been identified as the major mechanism for rapid desensitization for many G protein-coupled receptors.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In humans, ETA receptors have been shown to have a prolonged period of desensitization occurring within 5 min of exposure to ET-1; sensitization is restored between 80 and 120 min (8).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	256	 This prolonged desensitization period seems to be unique to the ETA receptor and may explain, at least in part, the prolonged contraction of smooth muscle cells in response to ET-1 (6).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	257	 The ETB receptors, on the other hand, are rapidly deactivated (via phosphorylation and dehydration) and lose  > 80% of their initial activity within 5 min of agonist stimulation.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	258	 This rapid deactivation of ETB has been linked to the short-term vasodilatory effect of ET-1 (7).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	259	 The present study shows that both ETA and ETB receptors bind and are responsible for internalization of exogenous ET-1; however, our data in hypertensive cells suggest that both receptors types have become desensitized.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	260	ETA and ETB receptors in L1 and L2 cells from control sheep.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Both ETA and ETB receptors have been identified in pulmonary and systemic vascular smooth muscle cells, e.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	262	, rat aorta (30), human internal mammary artery and vein, porcine coronary arteries (37), and rat and human pulmonary artery (28).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	263	 In humans, ETA receptors were found in both resistance and conduit arteries, and in the main pulmonary artery, ETA receptors predominated (90%) (5).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Tracheal smooth muscle from rats and mice, however, exhibited approximately equal numbers of the two receptor subtypes (18), whereas ETB receptors were 50% more numerous than ETA in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (23).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Thus the distribution and density of ET-1 receptors on various smooth muscle types may vary between species and location (5, 31).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	266	The present study demonstrates that L1 and L2 cells from control sheep express both the ETA and ETB genes.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The significantly lower expression of both genes in L1 cells compared with L2 cells substantiates our previous suggestion that the L1 cell contributes little to the maintenance of vascular tone in the main pulmonary artery.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	268	 The paucity of ET-1 receptors in L1 cells also corroborates our finding that these cells fail to internalize exogenous ET-1.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	269	Our binding studies confirm the notion that activity of the ETA receptors predominates in L2 cells from the main pulmonary artery of control sheep.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	270	 With long-term exposure, however, it seems that both receptors participate equally in the internalization process.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	271	 This difference is likely to reflect the effects of long- and short-term exposure, the ETB receptor becoming more active when exposure to ET-1 is prolonged perhaps as a result of an increase in the requirement for internalization, and degradation of ET-1.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Previous studies in isolated, perfused rat lungs (29) have also shown that both receptors play a role in clearance of ET-1 (14).

0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Alterations in ET-1 receptors have been demonstrated in several models of CPH.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	275	 For example, increased ETA gene expression was demonstrated in rat lungs and increased ETB gene expression in the rat main pulmonary artery after exposure to hypoxia for 48 h (25).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	276	 After 14 days of hypoxia, increased expression of both ETA and ETB was found in the distal pulmonary arteries of rats, ETA expression occurring mainly in the media and ETB in the intima; no change in expression of either receptor was found in the large muscular pulmonary arteries (39).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	277	 In contrast to the hypoxic models, in monocrotaline-induced CPH, ETB receptor mRNA was shown to be decreased in the lung (46).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	278	The present study demonstrates a selective and significant increase in ETB gene and surface expression in and receptor binding by the hypertensive L2 cells compared with controls.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Further confirmation of the increase in ETB receptors on hypertensive L2 cells is shown by our finding of an increase in early internalization of ET-1 by ETB.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Similar increases in ETB gene expression have been reported in the pulmonary arteries of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (44).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	281	 The ETB signaling pathway has been linked to the regulation of ppET-1 gene expression in rat mesangial cells (19).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	282	 The present study confirms this notion since, in a previous study, we showed that ppET-1 gene expression in the main pulmonary artery was decreased in hypertensive sheep compared with controls.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	283	Although our studies demonstrate that, in the short term, internalization and clearance of ET-1 by ETB in the hypertensive cells may be increased, our studies with the ETA and ETB receptor antagonists suggest that, in the longer term, this scenario does not occur.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Rather, our data demonstrate that ET-1-stimulated internalization of exogenous ET-1 is decreased in hypertensive L2 cells compared with controls and that the sensitivity of the individual ET-1 receptors is lost.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	285	 It is only when the ETA and ETB antagonists are added simultaneously that suppression of ET-1 uptake occurs.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Similar findings have been demonstrated in isolated perfused lungs from rats with hypoxic CPH (23).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	287	 One possible explanation for the failure of each antagonist alone to inhibit ET-1 uptake is that the concentration of antagonists used in the study was not sufficient to inhibit ETA and ETB receptors in hypertensive L2 cells.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	288	 This would seem unlikely, because both antagonists failed to exert an inhibitory effect.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Another possibility is that phosphorylation of the receptor/ligand complex and/or receptor recycling are altered in the hypertensive cells.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	290	 This notion requires further study.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	291	Another possible explanation is that concurrent treatment with the ETA and ETB antagonists involves simultaneous activation and heterodimerization of the two receptors (26).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Recent studies suggest that ET-1 binds simultaneously to both an ETA and ETB receptor (2, 11).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	293	 This heterodimerization between two fully functional G protein-coupled receptors is suggested to result in a new receptor/ligand binding complex with functional properties different from those of either receptor alone (21).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Thus it is possible that when the individual ETA and ETB receptors of hypertensive L2 cells are desensitized to exogenous ET-1, their simultaneous stimulation results in heterodimerization of ETA and ETB receptors and internalization of ET-1 by a different pathway.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	295	 This new pathway would seem to be extremely effective, since intracellular levels of ET-1 in the hypertensive L2 cells returned almost to basal values.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Further studies are needed to elucidate this possible explanation.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	297	In summary, we have shown that gene and surface expression and activity of the ETB, but not the ETA, receptors in L1 and L2 cells from control and hypertensive sheep are different.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Control and hypertensive L2 cells exhibit significantly higher steady-state basal expression of both the ETA and ETB genes than L1 cells.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	299	 In agreement with this finding, we found that only the L2 cells internalize exogenous ET-1.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	300	 In the short term, the ETA receptors are mainly responsible for binding of ET-1, but with longer exposure, both receptors contribute to internalization.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	301	 In hypertensive L2 cells, we showed that ETB gene and surface expression and Bmax by this receptor were significantly elevated above baseline.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Uptake of exogenous ET-1 by these cells, however, was less pronounced than in control cells.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Furthermore, we found that only concurrent treatment with both ETA and ETB antagonists suppressed ET-1 uptake in the hypertensive cells, suggesting an alteration in their structure.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	304	 We conclude that changes in gene and surface expression and activity of the ETB receptors in L2 cells from hypertensive sheep may contribute to the development and maintenance of CPH through an altered sensitivity to locally produced ET-1.

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	4	Genital HPV infection frequently induces antibody-mediated immune responses, mostly directed against the viral capsid (Wang et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The HPV capsid is composed of two structural proteins, a largely internal minor capsid protein (L2) and a major protein (L1), which is 30 times more abundant than L2 (Kirnbauer et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	6	, 1993) and represents about 80 % of the total viral protein.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	7	 L1 is an important target of the immune system.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Immunological assays based on the use of HPV capsids are known to detect type-restricted antibodies, possibly due to the presentation of type-specific conformational epitopes.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Interestingly, the HPV-16 capsid exposes not only type-restricted but also type-common antigenic epitopes (Heino et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Thus, in addition to specific antibodies (Cason et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	11	, 1992), widely cross-reactive antibodies have been found to react against peptide sequences on the L1 protein of both high- and low-risk HPV types (LeCann et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	12	We have previously described a peptide (IHSMNSTIL) derived from the HPV-16 L1 protein (16L1 peptide) that binds to HLA class I allele B*3901 and elicits proliferative responses in lymphocytes from patients with cervical cancer associated with either HPV-16 or -18 (Monroy-Garcia et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Further analysis of this peptide using Lipman and Pearson's ALIGN program showed that the sequence presented a substantial amino acid identity with the corresponding sequence in HPV-18 (88 9 % identity), HPV-16-related types (77 8 to 66 7 % identity) and HPV-18-related types (88 9 to 66 7 % identity).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Interestingly, comparison with the corresponding sequences in HPV-6 and -11 demonstrated an identity level of 55 6 %.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This observation raised the question of whether antibodies generated against these sequences could cross-react with the 16L1 peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This study aimed to evaluate the anti-peptide reactivity of antibodies produced in patients with high-risk HPV-associated low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and cervical cancer and to compare it with the reaction of antibodies from women with low-risk HPV-associated LSIL to assess their potential cross-reactivity.

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Low- and high-risk types were determined by hybrid capture test.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	71	 HPV-16 was detected using the Pr3/Pr4 type-specific primers for PCR.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Clinical diagnosis was based on cytological analysis and was corroborated by histopathological analysis.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	73	  We first investigated the presence of IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide in serum samples.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	74	 A small proportion of patients with low-risk HPV-associated LSIL (6 5 %) tested positive for the presence of IgG antibodies.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	75	 This proportion was similar to the proportion of seropositive individuals in the normal population (P=0 1) (Fig.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	76	 In contrast, more than 90 % of patients infected with high-risk HPV were positive for the presence of IgG.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The difference between this group and the negative controls was highly significant (P < 0 0001).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Moreover, the mean signal strength of antibody response in high-risk HPV-associated LSIL patients was 3 7-fold higher than the mean signal strength in control samples.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	79	 PCR analysis of DNA from high-risk HPV-associated LSIL samples indicated that 60 8 % of patients were infected with HPV-16, while 17 4 % were infected with HPV-18 and 21 6 % with other high-risk types.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	80	 However, the proportion of seropositive subjects in each group was similar (P > 0 1) (Table 2).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	81	 This seemed to indicate that most LSIL patients infected by high-risk HPV types produced antibodies that reacted against the 16L1 peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Thus, we next addressed the question of whether these antibodies could also be found in patients who had developed a high-risk HPV-associated cervical tumour.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Results showed that only 57 7 % of cervical cancer patients had antibodies against the 16L1 peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The proportion of seropositive subjects in the cervical cancer group was significantly higher than that observed in the negative controls (P < 0 0001).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	85	 However, seropositivity in cervical cancer patients was significantly lower than that detected in high-risk HPV-associated LSIL patients (P < 0 0001).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	86	 This suggested that the presence of viral DNA in cervical cancer patients does not correlate with the presence of IgG antibodies against the peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Furthermore, statistical analysis revealed that the proportion of seropositive patients whose tumours were HPV-18 positive was significantly lower than the proportion in patients with HPV-16-associated tumours (P=0 03) (Table 2).

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Thus, we next addressed the significance of the 16L1 peptide-based ELISA for the detection of high-risk HPV infection in LSIL and cervical cancer patients.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	97	 As shown in Table 3, the 16L1 peptide-based ELISA was able to detect a high proportion (91 6 %) of LSIL patients who were actually infected with high-risk HPV types and produced low levels of false-positive and false-negative results.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The probability that an LSIL patient is infected with high-risk HPV types, given a positive ELISA value, was high (positive predictive value=97 7 %).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	99	 However, the probability of not being infected with high-risk genotypes, given a negative ELISA result, was lower (negative predictive value=87 7 %).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The efficiency of the ELISA to detect high-risk HPV infection in LSIL patients was higher than 90 %.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	101	 In comparison, the ELISA was not quite as sensitive for the detection of high-risk viruses in patients with cervical cancer, having a low negative predictive value (52 7 %) and, as a consequence, a reduced level of efficiency (70 4 %).

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	104	  Detection of IgA antibodies against the 16L1 peptide in cervical secretions Since the results showed that IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide were present in the sera of high-risk HPV-infected LSIL patients, we next determined whether reactive IgA antibodies could also be found in cervical secretions from these women.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Once more, ELISAs revealed that LSIL patients infected with low-risk HPV genotypes were largely negative for the presence of anti-16L1 peptide antibodies (Fig.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	106	 In addition, IgA reactivity in the high-risk HPV-associated LSIL population was significantly higher than that observed in the negative-control group and in the low-risk HPV group.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	107	 HPV-16 is by far the most frequent high-risk HPV type infecting women in Latin America (Bosch et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Thus, to determine whether mucosal IgA antibodies against the 16L1 peptide were more prevalent in women infected with HPV-16 than in women infected with any high-risk HPV type, we evaluated the presence of IgA in cervical secretions of HPV-16-associated LSIL patients.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	109	 2, the proportion of IgA-positive subjects in the HPV-16-infected group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0 0001).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	110	 However, statistical comparison of the IgA positivity in the high-risk HPV- and HPV-16-associated LSIL groups indicated that the responses were similar in both groups [OR=1 3; 95 % CI=0 8 to 2 1; P=0 09].

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	117	  To ascertain whether the presence of serum IgG correlated with the detection of cervical IgA, a statistical analysis of the proportion of positive subjects in each group was performed.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	118	 As shown in Table 4, there was no difference in the proportion of women positive for the presence of IgG and IgA in the non-infected group (P=0 4).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Interestingly, when all patients diagnosed with LSIL were analysed together, no difference was detected between the IgG and IgA responses (P=0 06).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	120	 However, separate analysis of LSIL patients infected by low- or high-risk HPV types showed that the proportion of cervical IgA responders was significantly higher than the proportion of IgG seropositives in the group of patients infected by low-risk HPV types.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	121	 In contrast, in the patients infected with high-risk HPV, the proportion of IgG seropositives was significantly higher than that of cervical IgA positives (P < 0 0001).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	122	 In this group, the likelihood of presenting circulating IgG antibodies to the 16L1 peptide was six times higher than that of presenting mucosal IgA antibodies against the peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	123	 This suggested that, during early infection by high-risk HPV genotypes, the antibody response is mediated predominantly by systemic IgG antibodies.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Statistical comparison of serum IgG and cervical IgA responses against the 16L1 peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	125	Serological studies, using virus-like particles (VLPs) as antigenic targets, have demonstrated that the majority of women infected with HPV-16 produce an IgG antibody response (Kirnbauer et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Here, we found that most women with high-risk HPV type-associated LSIL generated systemic IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	127	 However, antibodies detected in VLP-based assays are mainly type restricted and directed against conformational epitopes (Christensen et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Therefore, it might be possible that anti-16L1 and anti-VLP antibodies are generated in parallel as a response against infection.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	129	 To ascertain whether these antibodies co-exist in infected humans, the population studied herein is currently being tested in a VLP-based ELISA.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	130	It is generally accepted that IgG antibodies against HPV capsid antigens are long lasting (Af Geijersstam et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	131	, 2000) and may be a marker of past and current infection.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	132	 From the information presented in Table 3, it appears that systemic IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide are good indicators of current infection.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Nevertheless, we cannot conclude this, because we did not analyse women with a previous history of HPV infection and the number of seropositive patients who were negative for the presence of viral DNA was too small.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	134	 To ascertain whether antibodies against the 16L1 peptide are markers of prior infection, it will be necessary to test groups of currently non-infected women, who had a previous infection that was either treated successfully or cleared naturally.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	135	 On the other hand, we observed that a small proportion of patients with LSIL were seronegative, regardless of the presence of HPV DNA.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	136	 With reference to this, an earlier study of incident HPV infection demonstrated that some women with a persistent HPV infection never seroconverted (Carter et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Thus, it is possible that the seronegative patients detected in this work do not produce antibodies against the peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	138	Here we demonstrated that IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide were detected in sera from most LSIL patients infected with high-risk HPV types and were almost absent in low-risk HPV-associated LSIL and uninfected women.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	139	 In as much as HPV infection is associated with risk factors such as age and sexual activity (Giuliano et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	140	, 1999), it could be postulated that the apparent cross-reactivity between high-risk HPV types might reflect shared epidemiological risk factors.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	141	 This is unlikely, because the epidemiological data presented in Table 1 showed that mean values for age, number of sexual partners and pregnancies were similar between high- and low-risk HPV-associated LSIL and even non-infected women.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	142	 This suggests strongly that the antibodies detected are not associated with these risk factors.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Another possibility might be that patients included in the high-risk HPV-associated LSIL group were previously infected with HPV-16.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	144	 To determine whether previous HPV-16 infection occurred in these women, a study of the presence of HPV-16 DNA in archive tissue samples is warranted.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	145	A more likely explanation might be that the difference in antibody responses is associated with the level of sequence conservation of the peptide region.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	146	 This hypothesis is supported by previous work in which antibodies raised against a peptide sequence containing the 16L1 peptide reacted with HPV-16 VLPs but not with HPV-11 VLPs (Heino et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The 16L1 peptide is located within the structure of the h2 and h3 -helices of the C-terminal laterally projecting domain of L1 (Chen et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	148	 They form, together with the h4 helix, the surface of contact with other L1 monomers.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Consequently, this site is important for the assembly of viral capsids and is relatively conserved among different HPV types.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	150	 However, comparison of the corresponding sequences in the high- and low-risk types detected by the hybrid capture test used in this work showed interesting differences.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	151	 For instance, all five low-risk types differed at three or more amino acid positions from the 16L1 peptide sequence.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	152	 In contrast, only three of the 12 high-risk types differed at more than three amino acid positions from the 16L1 peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Moreover, changes at positions 1, 5 or 8 were found in four of five low-risk types, while only four of 12 high-risk types had these changes.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	154	We also observed that a high proportion of patients with cervical cancer were positive for the presence of systemic IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In an earlier study (Dillner et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	156	, 1990), IgG responses to peptides covering the complete amino acid sequence of the HPV-16 L1 protein were examined in sera from patients with cervical cancer.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Interestingly, a peptide region that included the 16L1 peptide sequence was demonstrated to be largely unreactive.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	158	 This divergence might be attributable to differences in the amino acid sequences.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	159	 (1990), the 16L1 peptide sequence was included as a part of a 20 amino acid peptide, which meant an extension of nine amino acids at the N terminus and one amino acid at the C terminus of the 16L1 peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	160	 In this respect, there is evidence to indicate that recognition and binding of antibodies to a particular epitope are highly influenced by the extension of a peptide sequence.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	161	 In fact, extension of a single amino acid can induce a reduction in monoclonal antibody recognition of two to three orders of magnitude (Uray et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	162	, 2003), while an extension of 13 amino acids can result in complete loss of antibody binding (Calderon-Aranda et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Therefore, extensions of the 16L1 peptide might account for the lack of response observed in the former report.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	164	Interestingly, patients with high-risk HPV-associated invasive cervical cancer showed a reduced antibody response against the 16L1 peptide compared with high-risk HPV-associated LSIL.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	165	 In agreement with our results, previous studies have shown that IgG responses against different L1-derived peptides are significantly prevalent in patients with premalignant lesions (Sharma et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	166	, 1996), but are not associated with cervical cancer (Dillner et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Reduction of anti-peptide IgG responses in cervical cancer may be due to a natural decline in antibody titres that occurs over time in infected individuals (Andersson-Ellstrom et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	168	, 2000), or may be associated with a lack of antigen expression.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	169	 It is known that transcription of the L1 gene is restricted to terminally differentiated keratinocytes and that the level of cellular differentiation decreases as the grade of neoplasia increases (Stoler et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Consequently, the expression of the L1 protein is significantly reduced in advanced lesions associated with high-risk HPV genotypes (Melsheimer et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Furthermore, integration of HPV DNA in cervical cancer may cause disruption of the L1 gene (Walboomers  and  Meijer, 1997), affecting the expression of the L1 protein.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Indeed, integration of viral DNA occurs more frequently in HPV-18- than in HPV-16-associated tumours.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	173	 This is consistent with our observation that the prevalence of antibodies was lower in patients with HPV-18- than in patients with HPV-16-associated cervical cancer.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	174	In conclusion, our study indicates that the 16L1 peptide might be a high-risk type-common epitope capable of inducing cross-reactive antibodies in high-risk HPV-associated LSIL patients.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Importantly, antibodies in LSIL patients infected with low-risk HPV types did not react against the peptide, suggesting that the reaction was restricted to high-risk virus types.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Although more extensive studies to investigate antibody responses against the 16L1 peptide are still required, our primary results suggest that the 16L1 peptide might be useful for the development of serological assays for the study of natural and vaccine-induced immune responses against high-risk HPV, as well as for the early detection of oncogenic HPV infections.

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	9	The L1 cytoplasmic domain (L1CD)* is not required for adhesion, but it is needed for regulation of adhesion by signal transduction and internalization.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Interestingly, mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of the human L1 gene impair the formation of major axon tracts in neural development (for review see Kamiguchi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	11	 One important function of the L1CD that has been analyzed in detail is the regulation of endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and cell surface distribution of L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Neuronal L1 differs from L1 found in nonneuronal cells such as Schwann cells and neuroblastoma cell lines in that it contains four amino acids (RSLE) in the cytoplasmic domain encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 28 (Miura et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The RSLE stretch immediately follows tyrosine 1176.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The composite sequence (YRSLE) forms a tyrosine-based sorting motif that is required for endocytosis of L1 via clathrin-coated pits (Kamiguchi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Like tyrosine-based sorting signals characterized in other proteins (Ohno et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	16	, 1996), the YRSLE sequence found in L1 serves as a binding site for the  micro2 chain of the clathrin-associated AP-2 complex in vitro, and a number of endocytic machinery components can be coimmunoprecipitated with L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Furthermore, mutating tyrosine 1176 (Y1176) or removing the RSLE exon also prevents L1 from interacting with AP-2, and consequently prevents clathrin-mediated endocytosis of L1 (Kamiguchi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons growing on an L1-Fc substrate, clathrin-mediated endocytosis of L1 occurs preferentially at the rear of growth cones, suggesting local regulation of L1 endocytosis and that its recycling may be important in growth cone motility (Kamiguchi and Lemmon, 2000).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Indeed, blocking AP-2 to mediated internalization of L1 inhibits L1-based neurite growth in part by disrupting a gradient of L1 adhesivity from the growth cone periphery to the central domain (Kamiguchi and Yoshihara, 2001).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Finally, the neuronal form of L1 (with YRSLE) is significantly less adhesive than the nonneuronal form due to its more rapid internalization and shorter dwell time on the cell surface (Long et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	21	Phosphorylation is likely to play a critical role in regulating L1-mediated processes such as neurite outgrowth (Atashi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	22	 L1 is phosphorylated on both serine and tyrosine residues in cultured neurons, and clustering of L1 on cultured cells with cross-linking antibodies can trigger changes in both kinase and phosphatase activity (Klinz et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	23	, 1999), as well as in the phosphorylation state of L1 (Zisch et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Several kinase activities coimmunoprecipitate with L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	25	 We have identified three L1-associated kinases, CKII, p90rsk, and ERK2, that can phosphorylate certain serine residues in the L1CD in vitro (Wong et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Inhibition of p90rsk phosphorylation of L1 impairs DRG neurite outgrowth on L1 but not on laminin substrates.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Furthermore, activation of the MAP kinase cascade, which includes p90rsk and ERK2, requires L1 endocytosis.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Tyrosine kinases, such as p60src and FGF receptor, have also been implicated in L1 signaling (Ignelzi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	29	, 1994; Doherty and Walsh, 1996), and the receptor tyrosine kinase, EphB2, is capable of phosphorylating L1 (Zisch et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Tyrosine phosphorylation may regulate associations between L1 and the cytoskeleton.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	31	 For example, both L1 and the L1 family members neurofascin and NrCAM associate with the membrane cytoskeleton protein ankyrin, and phosphorylation of a tyrosine within the ankyrin binding site of neurofascin, which is conserved in L1, disrupts this association (Tuvia et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	32	Here, we present evidence that outside-in signaling dynamically regulates the functional state of the L1CD via dephosphorylation.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	33	 We have characterized the mAb 74-5H7 that recognizes a subset of L1 at points of cell to cell contact and in vesicular structures.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The 74-5H7 epitope is regulated by phosphorylation of L1 and maps to the region immediately preceding the tyrosine-based sorting motif.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In vitro studies show that phosphorylation within the epitope prevents recognition by 74-5H7 and also binding of AP-2 to L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	36	 We have identified the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase p60src as an L1-phosphorylating kinase that preferentially phosphorylates Y1176 of the tyrosine-based sorting motif in vitro.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Cell to cell contact is able to induce changes in the phosphorylation state of L1 that is recognized by 74-5H7.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	38	 These data demonstrate that L1 to L1 binding induces a functional change in the L1CD mediated by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle.

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Our detailed analysis of the pattern of 74-5H7-IR, in conjunction with our earlier report showing that 74-5H7-IR can colocalize at the rear of growth cones with the endocytosis marker protein Eps15 (Kamiguchi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	56	, 1998b), indicates that 74-5H7 recognizes a subset of L1 that is in vesicle-like structures and on the cell surface at points of cell to cell contact.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Therefore, expression of the 74-5H7 epitope correlates with a functional state of L1 that occurs when L1 is engaged in adhesion at the cell surface and during trafficking.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	58	Characterization of the 74-5H7 epitope In principle, there are several possible explanations for the unique distribution of 74-5H7-IR, including a change in posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation, blocking of the epitope by protein to protein interactions, or conformational change.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Two lines of evidence suggest that phosphorylation is the most likely explanation.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	60	 First, 74-5H7 recognizes L1 by Western blot after fractionation by SDS-PAGE (Fig.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Under these conditions, posttranslational modifications to the L1CD would be preserved, whereas global conformational changes or protein associations would be lost.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Second, bacterially produced, purified recombinant L1CD is recognized by 74-5H7 on Western blots (Fig.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	63	 2 B), indicating that the 74-5H7 epitope is part of the primary structure of the L1CD, suggesting that the epitope is masked by posttranslational modifications of L1 in vivo.

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Western blot analysis of extracts from myeloma cells expressing different L1 truncations shows that 74-5H7 recognizes full-length L1 and L1 truncated after Y1176, which leaves the first 33 amino acids of the L1CD intact (Fig.

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	78	 In contrast, the 74-5H7 does not recognize L1 truncated after lysine 1147 that removes all but the first four amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain (Fig.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	79	 These results suggest that the 74-5H7 epitope resides in the first 33 amino acids of the L1 cytoplasmic domain.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	80	A series of peptides was made to map the precise epitope recognized by 74-5H7.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	81	 First, we synthesized two peptides spanning the first 33 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain and asked whether 74-5H7 recognized either on dot blots.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Our analysis indicates that 74-5H7 recognizes a 14 amino acid peptide, SEARPMKDETFGEY (residues 1163 to 1176; Fig.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	83	 2 B), but not the peptide, KRSKGGKYSVKDKEDTQVDS (residues 1144 to 1163), consisting of the first 20 amino acids of the L1CD.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	84	 We then used synthetic peptides with alanine scanning substitutions through the 14 amino acid peptide to determine which residues are essential for recognition by 74-5H7.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	85	 This analysis identified five amino acids, SEARPMKDETFGEY (underlined) that when individually changed to alanine, abolish 74-5H7 binding (Fig.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Although only these five amino acids were identified as critical for 74-5H7 binding, we were unable to detect binding to peptides shorter than the SEARPMKDETFGEY sequence, suggesting there may be structural contributions to the epitope from other residues (unpublished data).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The SEARPMKDETFGEY peptide also competed with purified L1 for 74-5H7 binding, confirming the importance of this sequence for mAb recognition of L1 (Fig.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Thus the 74-5H7 epitope, which is present in L1 at points of cell to cell contact and in small vesicle-like structures, is positioned immediately NH2-terminal to the tyrosine-based sorting motif.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	89	 This motif (YRSL) is present in the neuronal form of L1 and is critical for regulation of L1 endocytosis (Kamiguchi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	90	Phosphorylation of L1 peptides inhibits 74-5H7 binding The 14 amino acid peptide contains three potential phosphorylation sites, SEARPMKDETFGEY (underlined).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	91	 We synthesized peptides in which one of these residues was phosphorylated, and found that the peptide containing phosphorylated threonine 1172 was no longer recognized by 74-5H7.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In addition, 74-5H7 recognition of phosphorylated Y1176 peptide was reduced over 80%, although the peptide containing phosphoserine 1163 was strongly reactive (Fig.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	93	 These results suggest that phosphorylation of one or both of these sites, threonine 1172 and Y1176, in L1 could be responsible for its inability to react with 74-5H7, and that the epitope may be transiently unmasked by dephosphorylation.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	94	 However, phosphothreonine has never been reported in L1 (for review see Schaefer et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	95	p60src phosphorylates the L1CD Although phosphorylation of both threonine 1172 and Y1176 disrupt the 74-5H7 epitope, phosphorylation of threonine residues in L1 has not been reported either in vitro or in vivo (Salton et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	96	 In contrast, at least two reports indicate that L1 is tyrosine phosphorylated in vivo (Heiland et al.

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Phosphorylated peptide fragments containing the other three tyrosines present within the L1CD did not coelute with radioactivity, indicating that p60src preferentially phosphorylates Y1176, an amino acid residue that plays a critical role in regulating L1 trafficking and endocytosis.

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	113	 To demonstrate that Y1176 was, indeed, phosphorylated in vivo, we produced a new Ra-pYRSLE antibody.

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	123	 When the inhibitors were absent, a strong signal for the 74-5H7 epitope was seen, whereas the anti-pY antibody gave a relatively weak signal (Fig.

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Previous data implicate p60 src in L1 function, because src-/- neurons extend poorly on L1 substrates, suggesting their response to L1 is impaired (Ignelzi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Our finding that p60src can phosphorylate Y1176 provides potential mechanistic insight into this phenotype.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	206	 We suggest that L1 in src-/- neurons grown on L1 may be relatively hypophosphorylated at Y1176.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	207	 This could alter the regulation of L1 endocytosis; disruption of L1 trafficking could in turn impair neurite outgrowth on L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Suter and Forscher (2001) recently showed that p60src activity could be involved in a positive feedback loop strengthening CAM interactions with their cytoskeletal linkages.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Our data support a similar role for p60src in which it could phosphorylate L1 under certain conditions, thereby inhibiting internalization and increasing adhesion.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	210	The 74-5H7 epitope is adjacent to the tyrosine-based motif, Yxx ( is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid) in the L1CD that mediates L1 endocytosis (Kamiguchi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Studies of tyrosine-based sorting motifs in other proteins indicate that the tyrosine has to be in a nonphosphorylated state for the signals to be active in sorting and endocytosis; i.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	212	, phosphorylation of the tyrosine prevents binding of adaptin proteins to the motif (Boll et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Indeed, our in vitro peptide competition experiments using peptides derived from L1 show that a Y1176-phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the potential p60src phosphorylation site, FGEpYRSLESDNEE, is no longer able to bind the  micro2 chain of AP-2, whereas a serine 1181-phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the CKII phosphorylation site, FGEYRSLEpSDNEE, retains its capacity to associate with  micro2.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	214	 It is highly unlikely that T1172 influences L1 to AP-2 interactions because there is no evidence suggesting it is phosphorylated, and extensive studies show that the fourth residue in the amino-terminal direction does not influence  micro2 binding to tyrosine-based sorting motifs (Boll et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Our results show that the 74-5H7-IR is inhibited by phosphorylation of Y1176 and that src family kinases may mediate this.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Similarly, clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the T lymphocyte receptor, CTLA-4, has been shown to be negatively regulated by phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine in the endocytosis motif (Bradshaw et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	217	, 1997) and this is likely by src family kinases (Miyatake et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Overall, our results imply that only L1 that can bind 74-5H7 is capable of interacting with the clathrin-mediated endocytic machinery.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	219	 This is consistent with the finding that in growth cones growing on L1 substrates, 74-5H7-IR is at the rear of growth cones, where L1 is internalized and colocalizes with Eps15, a marker for clathrin-coated pits (Kamiguchi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	220	 We have shown previously that inhibition of L1 endocytosis dramatically increases L1-mediated adhesion (Long et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	221	 L1 at the rear of growth cones growing on L1 is less adhesive than L1 at the front of the growth cones, but this differential is not observed on growth cones growing on N-cadherin (Kamiguchi and Yoshihara, 2001).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Therefore, phosphorylation of Y1176 provides a rapid but reversible means of increasing L1-mediated adhesion.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	223	The hypothesis that the 74-5H7 epitope is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation implies the involvement of L1 phosphatases in its regulation and is consistent with early results that show that cross-linking L1 activates tyrosine and serine phosphatases (Klinz et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	224	 A number of potential candidate phosphatases exist.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	225	 These include phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) that prefer substrates containing acidic residues NH2-terminal to the phosphotyrosine such as PTP1B, and rat brain PTP1 (for review see Zhou and Cantley, 1995).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Another candidate is the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase ss because of its ability to bind heterophilically with L1 family CAMs.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	227	 The phosphatase may also be coexpressed in some of the same cell types as L1 (Peles et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	228	 It has been suggested that acidic residues NH2-terminal to the phosphotyrosine residue are a hallmark for targeted dephosphorylation (Pinna and Ruzzene, 1996) and that the number, nature, and position of the acidic residues may create consensus sequences that are recognized selectively by individual PTPases (Pinna and Donella-Deana, 1994).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	229	The simplest interpretation of our biochemical analysis of the 74-5H7 epitope is that unengaged L1 is phosphorylated on Y1176, and that Y1176 becomes dephosphorylated subsequent to L1 ligand binding.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Dephosphorylation allows interaction with AP-2 and clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	231	 In this paradigm, the time course of 74-5H7-IR observed in the cell pelleting experiments could reflect internalization and subsequent recycling (and rephosphorylation) of L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Our immunohistochemical observations of the distribution of 74-5H7-IR suggest the situation is more complex, however, and that L1 to L1 binding does not always induce L1 endocytosis.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	233	 First, L1 can mediate stable axon fasciculation, suggesting it is not invariably endocytosed at points of L1 to L1 binding.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Second, although growing DRG neurons on L1 increases L1 internalization and subsequent recycling (Kamiguchi and Lemmon, 2000; Kamiguchi and Yoshihara, 2001), endocytosis of L1 occurs preferentially at the rear of the growth cone.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	235	 74-5H7-IR is colocalized with vesicle-like structures in these neurons, rather than just at points of contact between the growth cone and the L1-Fc substrate (Kamiguchi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	236	 These observations suggest that dephosphorylation of Y1176 and L1 endocytosis in growth cones are not regulated solely by L1 to L1 binding, but also by restricted localization of the dephosphorylation machinery.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	237	 We cannot rule out the possibility that, in vivo, the 74-5H7 epitope in some L1 is masked by interactions with other proteins, such as cytoskeletal components (Brophy, 2001).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Thus, although 74-5H7 clearly identifies a subset of L1 in cells that are dephosphorylated at Y1176, there may be other populations of L1 that are dephosphorylated at Y1176, but not accessible to the antibody and thus not visualized in immunocytochemical experiments.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	239	In summary, we have used 74-5H7 to show that L1 is dephosphorylated at Y1176 where L1 is internalized and trafficking in growth cones.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	240	 We have also shown that the phosphorylation state of Y1176 determines whether L1 can interact with the clathrin internalization machinery.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	241	 A variety of experiments showed that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation state of L1 is regulated by cell contact and restricted to specific sites in neurons.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	242	 The phosphorylation of the L1CD on Y1176 by p60src that is important for L1-mediated neurite outgrowth raises the possibility that the regulation of L1 internalization by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation represents a critical regulatory point for L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	243	 The ability of L1 to L1 adhesion to influence its endocytosis is reminiscent of how other surfaces can influence integrin expression on neurites (Condic and Letourneau, 1997).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	244	 In Aplysia, the distribution of apCAM, an IgSF CAM member, is acutely regulated by endocytosis during learning-induced synaptic remodeling (Bailey et al.

0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	161	 However, similar to the formation of this inclusion body (Garcia-Mata et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	162	, 1999), Gag transport towards the MTOC involves the retrograde dynein-dynactin motor, because it is prevented by overproduction of CC1, the central coiled-coil domain of p150Glued, reported to disrupt the function of this retrograde motor.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Other viruses have been shown to use the MT network for their intracellular transport.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	164	 For instance, adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) and HSV, two nuclear replicative DNA viruses entering the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis and direct membrane fusion respectively, are transported as naked capsids towards the nucleus via the MT network (Sodeik et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	165	 For ASFV and rabies viruses, two other viruses that use the MT network to move within the infected cell, an interaction with LC8 forms a molecular basis of this trafficking (Alonso et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The interaction between LC8 and HFV Gag described here could play such a role in the case of FVs.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	167	LC8 was first identified as an integral component of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii outer dynein arm (Pfister et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	168	, 1982; Piperno and Luck, 1979).
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Since then, this evolutionarily conserved molecule has been shown to interact with many cellular complexes, such as the nitric oxide synthase (Jaffrey and Snyder, 1996) and myosin V (Goode et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	170	, 2000), an actin-based motor mainly located at the plasma membrane that shuttles between the cell periphery and the MTOC along the MT network (Espreafico et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	171	 LC8 is encoded by at least two genes in humans (Naisbitt et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	172	, 2000), leading to the synthesis of dynein light chain 2 (DLC2) and dynein light chain 1 (DLC1), the isoform used in our work.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Interestingly, myosin V has been shown to interact with DLC2 but not with DLC1 (Naisbitt et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Thus, migration of HFV capsids towards the centrosome on the microtubule network probably involves an interaction with dynein LC8 (DLC1) rather than myosin V LC8 (DLC2).
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In that sense, HFV efficiently targets the centrosomal region and replicates in myosin-V-deficient melanoma S91-6 cells (E.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	176	 However, we cannot exclude the possibility that HFV Gag also interacts with DLC2 as a component of myosin V, favoring its trafficking on actin beneath the plasma membrane devoid of microtubules.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Therefore, interaction between incoming FV capsids and the multifunctional LC8 could provide a bridge to shuttle between an actin-based motor beneath the plasma membrane and the MT network within the cytoplasm.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Remarkably, a similar MT- and dynein-dependent trafficking towards the centrosome was recently described for incoming HIV-1, although the viral and cellular protagonists involved in this retrograde transport were not determined (McDonald et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Nevertheless, these observations suggest that distinct classes of retroviruses might tether the dynein-dynactin complex motor on the MT network during the early stage of infection to reach the nucleus, opening new perspectives in the development of anti-retroviral drugs.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	180	Analysis of the subcellular distribution of Gag deletion mutants reveals that the GR boxes as well as the determinants involved in capsid assembly (the Gag-Gag interaction domain and the CTRS) are not required to target the centrosome, whereas amino acids 150-180 are necessary to reach this organelle.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	181	 This region does not harbor any obvious similarities with the two previously described LC8-interacting motifs, (K/R)XTQT and GIQVD (Lo et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	182	, 2001), but a coiled-coil motif conserved in all primate foamy viruses (Tobaly-Tapiero et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	183	, 2001) seems to be involved in centriolar targeting of Gag.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	184	 In that sense, a single point mutation (L171G) in the Gag ORF, leading to the disruption of the coiled-coil motif, abolishes MTOC targeting of the corresponding GFP-Gag fusion and renders a full-length viral clone non-infectious.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Indeed, whereas Gag assembly and virus release are not affected by this helix-breaking point mutation, productive infection of naive cells is dramatically reduced.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Because this mutation was shown to prevent Gag/LC8 interaction, tethering of the dynein retrograde motor following its entry into the cytoplasm might be impaired, a hypothesis that we are currently exploring.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The L171G point mutation does not totally abolish infectivity, suggesting that other trafficking pathways might be used by FVs to reach the center of the cell.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	188	 In that sense, intracellular trafficking involving the actin cytoskeleton might account for this observation, an alternative route already put forward for HIV-1 (McDonald et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	189	, 2002) and previously suggested for FVs because Gag was also shown to interact with actin (Giron et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	190	HFV Gag is not the unique partner of LC8 lacking the two characterized LC8-interacting motifs.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Interestingly, all these proteins harbor an -helical coiled-coil in the domain identified as the LC8-binding region.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	192	 For example, the LC8-interacting domain of myosin V is predicted to fold into an amphiphilic helix (Naisbitt et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	193	, 2000) and, similarly, the signal response domain of IB, which was shown to interact with LC8 (Crepieux et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	194	, 1997), folds into a coiled coil as revealed by the COILS program (data not shown).
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Such a hypothesis might also apply to the neuronal form of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) (Benashski et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Given that LC8 harbors a similar amphiphilic helix triggering its multimerization (Benashski et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	197	, 1997), interactions between LC8 and myosin V, IB, nNOS and HFV Gag might occur via such specific protein motif interface, constituting a new mode of contact with LC8.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	198	One remaining issue is how the viral genome, wrapped by Gag molecules, is imported into the nucleus.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Interestingly, the dynein-dynactin complex has recently been shown to associate with the nuclear envelope, facilitating the remodeling of this physical frontier (Busson et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Therefore, interaction of Gag with the dynein-dynactin complex could not only drive incoming viral capsids towards the centrosome but also be involved in their subsequent targeting to the nuclear envelope.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Yet, HFV capsids were never detected within the nucleus, nor close to nuclear pores, even later during the replication cycle [here and Fischer et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	202	, 1998)], whereas unassembled Gag proteins and the viral genome are detected in the nucleus early after infection (Saib et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	203	, 1997; Schliephake and Rethwilm, 1994).
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Therefore, in contrast to Ad2 or HSV, those capsids dock to the nuclear pore triggering nuclear translocation of the viral genome (Greber et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	205	, 2001), nuclear import of HFV Gag and genome must be accompanied by disassembly or significant deformation of the core particle at the MTOC.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	1	The genomes of double-stranded (ds)RNA viruses are never exposed to the cytoplasm but are confined to and replicated from a specialized protein-bound compartmentthe viral capsid.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	2	 We have used cryoelectron microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction to study this compartment in the case of L-A, a yeast virus whose capsid consists of 60 asymmetric dimers of Gag protein (76 kD).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	3	 At 16-A resolution, we distinguish multiple domains in the elongated Gag subunits, whose nonequivalent packing is reflected in subtly different morphologies of the two protomers.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Small holes, 10-15 A across, perforate the capsid wall, which functions as a molecular sieve, allowing the exit of transcripts and the influx of metabolites, while retaining dsRNA and excluding degradative enzymes.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Scanning transmission electron microscope measurements of mass-per-unit length suggest that L-A RNA is an A-form duplex, and that RNA filaments emanating from disrupted virions often consist of two or more closely associated duplexes.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Nuclease protection experiments confirm that the genome is entirely sequestered inside full capsids, but it is packed relatively loosely; in L-A, the center-to-center spacing between duplexes is 40-45 A, compared with 25-30 A in other double-stranded viruses.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The looser packing of L-A RNA allows for maneuverability in the crowded capsid interior, in which the genome (in both replication and transcription) must be translocated sequentially past the polymerase immobilized on the inner capsid wall.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	8	IN eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells alike, the medium in which genetic information is stored is double-stranded (ds)1 DNA.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Viruses, more limited but less constrained genetic entities than cells, exhibit greater diversity in their replication cycles.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	11	 All four alternative media, single-stranded (ss)RNA, ssDNA, dsDNA, and dsRNA, are used by different virus families to encode their genomes (for review see Roizman and Palese, 1996).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Whereas dsDNA and ssRNA molecules are abundant cellular components, dsRNA and ssDNA molecules are not.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In these circumstances, one might expect viruses of the latter kinds to have developed special strategies for interfacing with the metabolic resources of their host cells.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	14	One such strategy that is widespread if not universal among dsRNA viruses is their use of capsids as specialized cytoplasmic compartments that genomes are confined to, and are replicated and expressed from (Dryden et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Such capsids are selectively porous protein shells that the genome and replicase reside within, nucleotides infuse into, and nascent strands (positive sense) are extruded from.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The latter molecule is a fusion of Gag with Pol, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol; 868 residues, 100 kD) (Fujimura and Wickner, 1988a; Icho and Wickner, 1989) that is generated by ribosomal frameshifting (Dinman et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The L-A capsid is a spherical particle, ~430 A in diam, composed of 120 copies of Gag (Esteban and Wickner, 1986; Cheng et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	20	, 1994), of which approximately two carry the Pol moiety (Dinman and Wickner, 1992; Ribas, J.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Interestingly, 120-subunit capsids have been detected in several other dsRNA viruses, including bacteriophage 6 (Mindich and Bamford, 1988), reovirus (Dryden et al.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Of these, the most prominent are thin arms of density near the twofold axes on the full capsid (Fig.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	184	 There are five classes of holes: those at the fivefold axes (area = ~107 A2); those surrounding the fivefold axes (~165 A2); those on the threefold axes (~118 A2); relatively large Y-shaped holes surrounding the threefold axes (~244 A2); and oblong holes between the A- and B-subunits (~110 A2).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	185	In these maps, the capsids' interiors are icosahedrally symmetric; although there is no reason to suppose that the material in these regions actually conforms to this symmetry, which was imposed by the reconstruction procedure.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Rather, because the micrographs contain a strong signal at these spacings, arising from the distances between nearest-neighbor RNA filaments, the icosahedral density map calculated from them also contains strong features at the same spacings.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	231	 To test it, we conducted accessibility experiments with RNase III, a nuclease specific for dsRNA.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	310	 While their sizes may be revised somewhat when higher resolution data become available, current estimates suggest a strategically useful property.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	311	 None of these holes is large enough to pass an A-form duplex (~23-A diam), but the largest holes (triangular, average distance from apex to base ~15 A; Fig.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	312	 3 e) should readily allow passage of an ssRNA molecule.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Thus the capsid appears to be configured to function as a molecular sieve: duplex RNA is retained inside, but transcripts may exit.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	314	 It would be expedient for freshly synthesized transcript to be fed directly into an exit port (Fig.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	315	 8), as this would forestall formation of secondary structure that might impede export.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Since there are only one to two copies of Pol per capsid, presumably no more than two transcripts per capsid are being exported at any one time.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	317	 However, the other holes should facilitate the infusion of nucleotides, of which a steady supply is required to sustain synthesis during transcription or replication.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	318	 A further filtering property is that the holes are presumably small enough to exclude potentially degradative enzymes.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Hypothetical model of a transcriptionally active L-A virion.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	320	 The polymerase (Pol) is covalently attached to a Gag subunit, which we assume to be integrated into the icosahedral surface lattice, thus immobilizing Pol (Icho and Wickner, 1989).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Pol (and the COOH terminus of Gag) are assumed to reside on the inner surface of the shell, to facilitate access to the substrate dsRNA.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	322	 The shape assigned to Pol in this diagram is arbitrary.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	323	 In this scenario, it is necessary for the genome to be propelled sequentially past Pol as transcription proceeds.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Transcripts are hypothesized to be extruded directly through the largest holes in the capsid shell (Discussion).

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	327	In projection, encapsidated L-A genomes exhibit punctate and/or swirl motifs (Fig.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Presumably, these two classes of motifs represent distinct views, although it is not clear that the genome is packed in the same way in each particle.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	329	 We infer that the genomes are loosely coiled, with variable spacing between adjacent filaments.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	330	 5) have average Bragg spacings of 36-40 A, corresponding to a center-to-center spacing of 41-46 A between filaments.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	331	 The L-A motifs differ from those of dsDNA viruses such as phages T4 and  (Lepault et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	332	, 1992) and herpes simplex virus (Booy et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	333	, 1991), and other dsRNA viruses such as reovirus (Dryden et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	334	, 1993); these are relatively highly ordered and tightly packed, with center-to-center spacings of 25-30 A.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	335	 In part, the larger spacing in L-A reflects the fact that A-form duplexes are wider than B-form duplexes.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	336	 However, the average interduplex spacing may be calculated independently from the volume available (average internal capsid diam = 348 A) and genome length (1.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	337	 Assuming quasi-hexagonal close packing to a uniform density, a spacing of ~40 A is obtained.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	338	 There is some flexibility in this figure, arising from the center being less populated with RNA, the packing not being perfectly crystalline, and possibly also from some local compaction into multistranded filaments (see below).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	339	 Nevertheless, this figure is in good agreement with the spacings measured directly from the powder patterns (Fig.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	340	 Its consistency supports our inferences that (a) the dsRNA genome is fully internalized, and (b) its packing is much looser than in other double-stranded viruses.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	341	RNA extending from capsids often has a uniform mass-per-unit length that is significantly higher than for a single A-form duplex (Fig.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	342	 7), and appears to represent some sort of higher order filament formed by two or more duplexes.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	343	 We have not observed these thicker filaments in preparations of isolated dsRNA, and see no obvious way in which they might arise as an artifact of specimen preparation.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	344	 It may be that within the confines of the capsid, i.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	345	, under conditions of high packing density, some piecewise condensation of duplexes into higher order filaments takes place.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	346	, at much lower density, the RNA gradually relaxes to single duplexes.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	348	L-A is also a helper virus for other dsRNA segments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Wickner, 1996a).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	349	 These satellite viruses (M1, M2, etc.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	350	) and deletion mutants of L-A itself (such as X) contain more dsRNA segments than L-A, but approximately the same number of base pairs per particle.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	351	 This occurs by "headful replication," whereby one viral (+) strand is packaged, and replicates inside the particle until it is full.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Subsequently synthesized (+) strands are extruded from the particle (Esteban and Wickner, 1986; Fujimura et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	353	 As noted above, much more room remains available in the packaged L-A capsid than in other double-stranded viruses.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	354	 We can think of two explanations.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	355	 In one, the Gag gene has evolved recently to provide a more capacious capsid, but the genome as a whole has not yet evolved to fully exploit this opportunity for expansion.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	356	 The fact that the multisegmented satellites do not package RNA more densely than L-A appears to argue against this hypothesis.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	357	In the second explanation, we speculate that the maximum viable packing density may be dictated by a requirement for long range mobility of the dsRNA in this transcriptionally active particle.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	358	 The polymerase is thought to reside on the inner surface, anchored by integration of its Gag moiety into the surface lattice (Wickner, 1996a,b).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	359	 8), large tracts of dsRNA must be propelled sequentially past this fixed point.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	360	 In so doing, the organization of the entire packaged genome must undergo constant revision, or "churning" motion.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	361	 (In contrast, the tightly compressed genomes of dsDNA phages are thought to be in a static vegetative state.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	362	) RNA polymerases are known to be powerful translocases, capable of generating forces in the range of 14 piconewtons (Yin et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	363	 The ability of L-A Pol to function in replication and transcription depends on its being capable of overcoming the frictional drag imposed by the packaged genome.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	364	 We infer that this resistance increases with higher packing density, whence the observed packing density may represent the highest level of frictional resistance against which the enzyme can function effectively.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	365	 This idea is testable by generating insertions in the L-A genome.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	366	Is a similar mechanism operative in other dsRNA viruses? The consideration that dsRNA appears to be packed more densely in the cores of both reovirus (Dryden et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	367	, 1993) and rotavirus (Prasad et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	368	, 1996) than in L-A might suggest otherwise.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	369	 However, these systems, in which transcriptionally active particles have been visualized (Yeager, M.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	370	, 1997), are considerably more complex; more proteins and many more RNA segments are involved, and precisely calibrated spacings for their packaged genomes have yet to be reported.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	371	 Transcription of reovirions is thought to require "activation" by proteases, and concomitant conformational changes (Powell et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	372	, 1993), which, we conjecture, may rearrange the core structure, so as to facilitate motion of the dsRNA during transcription.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	373	 Nevertheless, the same overall requirements apply.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	374	 It will be fascinating to learn more about possible solutions to this problem, and the properties of protein shells that are not only closed containers but also active metabolic compartments.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, October 1, 2003 , and in revised form, November 14, 2003.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	4	In recent years, several transcription factors have been identified as substrates of DYRK1A (for a review, see Ref.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Particularly, overexpression of DYRK1A has been shown to modulate the transactivation potential of FKHR (forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma) (10, 11), cAMP-response element-binding protein (12), and GLI1 (13).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Cytoplasmic proteins like eukaryotic initiation factor 2B, tau (14), and dynamin (15) have also been reported to be phosphorylated by DYRK1A, but these proteins might equally well be targets of the cytoplasmic kinases DYRK2 or DYRK3.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, although DYRK1A contains a canonical nuclear localization signal and is indeed predominantly targeted to the nucleus (16, 17), a significant fraction of the kinase is also present in the cytoplasm (18).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Within the nucleus, DYRK1A is localized in "nuclear speckles," which represent the splicing factor compartment (17, 19).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The precise function of DYRK1A in the nucleus is still largely unknown, and it is an open question whether any of the known substrates of DYRK1A is a key mediator of its functions on cell differentiation and proliferation.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We have therefore performed a more extensive search for interacting proteins and substrates to address this problem.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	11	Several methods have been employed to identify novel substrates of protein kinases.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Routine interaction screens like the yeast two-hybrid system, phage display, and phage expression library screening, yield in many cases substrates of kinases (20 to 23).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Other approaches are based on the specificity of substrate recognition by kinases and aim to identify substrate proteins by searching data bases with experimentally determined or predicted consensus phosphorylation sequences (24, 25).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	14	 More direct strategies include the phosphorylation screening of phage expression libraries (26) or of cell lysates (27), and the identification of phosphoproteins by functional proteomics and mass spectrometry (28).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	15	Here we have employed a new method which allowed us to screen in parallel for interaction partners and substrates of the kinase DYRK1A.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In this approach, we used an arrayed protein expression library (29, 30) both for interaction screening by overlaying with the radiolabeled recombinant kinase (31), and for a substrate screen by solid phase phosphorylation (26).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The use of the filter array allowed us to directly identify positive clones without the need of further rounds of purification.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Several DYRK1A-interacting and/or phosphorylated proteins were identified by this approach, and one protein was found in both screens.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	19	 This protein turned out to be a novel member of the cyclin family and was designated cyclin L2.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	20	Here we characterize cyclin L2 as a novel substrate of DYRK1A.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Furthermore, we describe the alternative transcripts generated from the cyclin L2 gene and show that full-length cyclin L2, but not the truncated splicing variant cyclin L2S, is co-localized with the splicing factor SC35 in nuclear speckles.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Using photobleaching techniques, we demonstrate that cyclin L2 and the closely related isoform, cyclin L1, differ strikingly with regard to their intranuclear mobility.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	23	Probe Labeling for Overlay Assays The probe for the interaction screen, GST-DYRK1A-C-K188R, was expressed from the pGEX-2TK vector (GenBankTM accession number U13851 [GenBank] ), which allows labeling of the fusion protein on a vector-encoded phosphorylation site by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The C-terminally truncated mutant of DYRK1A was used as a probe in order to avoid potential nonspecific binding of the repeat structures in the C-terminal domain of DYRK1A (32).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The kinase-negative point mutant (K188R) of DYRK1A should exhibit enhanced enzyme-substrate interactions.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	189	 34 strongly reacting cDNA clones were further characterized, including three clones that were also identified in the interaction screen.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	190	 By solid phase phosphorylation of bacterially expressed fusion proteins, all of the selected proteins were confirmed to be in vitro substrates of DYRK1A (Fig.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	192	 A randomly chosen clone that gave no detectable signal on the array was not phosphorylated by DYRK1A, demonstrating the reproducibility of the array results (control in Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Sequencing the cDNA inserts resulted in six known (one of them represented by two clones) and two hypothetical proteins being identified (Table I).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The remaining 26 fusion proteins represented cloning artifacts (ribosomal RNA, untranslated regions of mRNA, out of frame fusions).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	195	 All of the identified proteins either contain nuclear localization signals or are known nuclear proteins.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	196	Phosphorylation of Splicing Factors by DYRK1A Three clones encoding proteins with RS domains were identified both as DYRK1A-interacting proteins and as substrates of the kinase (Table I); clone M24584 codes for the splicing factor SRp75, and N16596 and P23533 [GenBank] both contain partial cDNA coding for an RS domain-containing protein that we designated cyclin L2 (see below).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	197	 A total of four proteins with RS domains were identified (SFRS4, cyclin L2, SFRS5, and SWAP2) as in vitro substrates of DYRK1A, suggesting that DYRK1A may be involved in splicing catalysis.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	198	 We therefore performed in vitro kinase assays to compare the phosphorylation of RS domain-containing proteins by DYRK1A.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	199	 In addition to the proteins identified in the present screen, two additional RS domain-containing proteins (hTRA21 and SF2/ASF) and a well characterized in vitro substrate of DYRK1A (myelin basic protein) (34) were included in this experiment.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	200	 2, cyclin L2 and hTRA21 were phosphorylated with markedly higher intensities than the other RS proteins.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Thus, DYRK1A does not indiscriminately phosphorylate serine residues in the context of RS domains.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	202	 In the present study, we concentrated on the characterization of cyclin L2 and its interaction with DYRK1A, because this protein was independently identified in both screens and because cyclin L2 was an excellent substrate of DYRK1A (see below; Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	203	Structure of Cyclin L2 The amino acid sequence derived from the cDNA clones N16596 and P23533 [GenBank] definitely encodes an RS domain (21 RS dipeptide motifs within 141 amino acids; Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	204	 3A) but shows no extended sequence similarity with any other RS domain-containing protein.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	205	 By a data base search, we identified an uncharacterized full-length mRNA sequence corresponding to these partial cDNAs (GenBankTM accession number AY037150 [GenBank] ).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The deduced protein encoded by this cDNA exhibits high sequence similarity with cyclin L1 (HUGO gene symbol CCNL1), a recently characterized protein with an N-terminal cyclin domain and a C-terminal RS domain (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Therefore, we designated the protein encoded by AY037150 [GenBank] cyclin L2 (HUGO gene symbol CCNL2).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The mouse homologues of cyclin L1 and cyclin L2 have previously been named Ania-6a and Ania-6b, respectively (41).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The cyclin domain of cyclin L2 (amino acids 69 to 296, as indicated in Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	210	 3A) was defined by comparison with cyclin H, which has been modeled by Andersen et al.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	211	 The cyclin domains of cyclin L1 and L2 are most closely related with cyclin K (HUGO gene symbol CCNK; 33% identical amino acids) and cyclin T1/T2 (HUGO gene symbols CCNT1 and CCNT2; 30 and 32% identical amino acids).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The RS domains of cyclin L1 and L2 contain 45% identical amino acids, a range that was also found for RS domains of known splicing factors.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	213	Genomic Organization of CCNL2 The human CCNL2 gene is located on chromosome 1 (1p36.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The gene spans about 13 kb and comprises 11 exons (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The comparison of the genomic sequence with public expressed sequence tag sequences allowed us to deduce the existence of three different transcripts, T1 to T3 (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The different transcripts are generated by alternative splicing of exon 6a and by the use of alternative polyadenylation sites within exon 6a.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Inclusion of exon 6a introduces a stop codon, and therefore transcripts T1 and T3 encode a truncated version of cyclin L2 that lacks the RS domain (cyclin L2S, "s" represents "short," Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Because exon 6a is skipped in transcript T2, the resulting mRNA (AY037150 [GenBank] ) encodes the long version of the protein, which is named cyclin L2 and includes the RS domain.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	219	Alternatively Spliced Transcripts of CCNL2 and CCNL1  We performed Northern blot analyses with exon-specific hybridization probes (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	220	 3C) and PCR analysis in order to determine the expression pattern of CCNL2 in different tissues and to verify the existence of the hypothesized transcripts of the CCNL2 gene.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	221	 On Northern blots of RNA from different human tissues, two major bands of about 4.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	222	4 kb were detected by a probe corresponding to the 3'-untranslated region in exon 11 of CCNL2 (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	223	 These sizes correspond very well to the calculated lengths of the transcripts T1 and T2 (see Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Transcript T1, which encodes cyclin L2S, was ubiquitously found in all tissues tested, although signal intensities varied.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	225	 In ovary, testis, prostate, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and liver, T1 appeared to be more abundant than in blood, colon, lung, and brain.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	226	 In contrast, transcript T2 was weakly detected in a few tissues (skeletal muscle, and spleen), and only testis RNA contained comparable levels of both transcripts (T1 and T2).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	227	4-kb transcript (T2) appears as a double band on the autoradiogram, because there are two polyadenylation sites in exon 11 that are separated by 211 bp (see Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	228	 To confirm the identification of T1 and T2, we hybridized identical blots with a probe derived from the 5'-end of exon 6a (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	229	 As expected, this probe detected the same 4.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	231	 In addition, we identified a band with an approximate size of 1.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	232	 We hypothesize that this band corresponds to a transcript comprising exons 1 to 5 (a total of 677 bp) and about 500 bp of exon 6a (transcript T3 in Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Indeed, exon 6a harbors a potential polyadenylation signal (AAUACA) (43) at nucleotide 1165 of BC016333 [GenBank] (GenBankTM accession number).

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	254	  The structure of the CCNL1 gene resembles that of CCNL2, and there are alternative splicing variants of cyclin L1 that result in a long and a short form of the protein (41, 39), similar to cyclin L2 and cyclin L2S.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	255	 To directly compare the expression patterns of CCNL1 and CCNL2, we hybridized the same Northern blots with CCNL1-specific probes that corresponded to the probes used for detection of CCNL2 mRNA.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Similar to CCNL2, a probe specific for the last exon of CCNL1 detected two bands of 4.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	257	 This result suggests that alternative transcripts of CCNL1 are generated in the same way as T1 and T2 of CCNL2.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Consistent with this identification of the bands in the Northern blot, a probe equivalent to E6a-5' detected only the longer transcript of CCNL1 (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	259	 No transcript of CCNL1 was detected that corresponded to T3 of CCNL2.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	260	 As in CCNL2, a stop codon in the longer transcript results in a truncated version of the protein.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	261	 These data suggest that alternative splicing occurs in the same way in both isoforms of cyclin L; inclusion of exon 6a of CCNL2 or the corresponding region of CCNL1 leads to a larger transcript, which encodes a truncated protein lacking the RS-domain and part of the cyclin domain.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	262	To confirm the identification of the bands detected by Northern blot analysis, we characterized the ratio of the cyclin L2 transcripts in different tissues by PCR analysis.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Combination of the three primers in a single reaction (multiplex PCR) allowed us to compare the expression ratios of T1/T3 with T2 in different tissues (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	265	 It should be noted that the ratio of the PCR products is not necessarily equal to the ratio of the respective cDNA sequences, because the different products may have been amplified with different efficiencies.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Consistent with the Northern blot data, stronger signals were obtained in most tissues for transcripts T1/T3 than for T2, except for testis, which contained relatively higher levels of T2.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	270	 In mouse tissues, the ratio of T2 and T1/T3 was also higher in testis than in brain (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Moreover, an antibody specific for the C-terminal domain of cyclin L2 detected a band of about 65 kDa in Western blots of mouse testis, matching the size of full-length cyclin L2 as deduced from transcript T2 (data not shown).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	272	Localization of Cyclin L1 and Cyclin L2 to the Nuclear Speckle Compartment Many splicing factors with RS domains are localized in subnuclear structures called nuclear speckles (44).

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Notably, sequence similarity between DYRK2 and DYRK1A is limited to the catalytic domain and a short segment immediately N-terminal of the catalytic domain that we earlier designated the "DYRK homology box" (DH box) (48).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	324	 The DH box contains a large number of negative charges (35) and may thus bind the RS domain of cyclin L2 by ionic interactions.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Both DYRK1A-NC, which lacks the DH box, and the N-terminal domain alone bound cyclin L2 only very weakly.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Taken together, these results suggest that optimal binding of cyclin L2 to DYRK1A (or DYRK2) requires the presence of both the catalytic domain and the DH box.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	354	 Coexpression of DYRK1A or CLK3 did not detectably alter the level of phosphate incorporation, possibly because cyclin L2 was already strongly phosphorylated by endogenous protein kinases.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	355	 However, a more slowly migrating form of GFP-CycL2 was observed in the immunoprecipitates from DYRK1A-overexpressing cells.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	369	 This unusual domain structure is conserved in the homologous proteins from invertebrates and plants (Drosophila, Caenorhabditis, and Arabidopsis (41)), providing evidence for a conserved function of the RS domain in these proteins.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	370	 The RS domain is a hallmark of many proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing, including the serine/arginine-rich splicing factors (SR proteins), which contain at least one RNA-binding motif, and the SR protein-related polypeptides (50, 51, 47, 52).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	371	 SR protein-related polypeptides constitute an inhomogeneous family of proteins that contain the RS domain in combination with additional domains (e.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	373	 The modular domain architecture of cyclin L1 and L2 is thus a typical feature of SR protein-related proteins, although unusual for members of the cyclin family.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	374	RS domains mediate protein-protein interactions with other proteins that contain RS repeats, and they target proteins to the nuclear speckle compartment (50).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	375	 Here we show that cyclin L2 interacts with the alternative splicing factor SF2/ASF (Fig.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	377	 This subcellular distribution is very likely mediated by the RS domain, since a construct of cyclin L2 that lacked the major part of the cyclin domain (cyclin L21 to 222) exhibited a subnuclear distribution indistinguishable from that of the full-length construct (data not shown).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	378	 In contrast, cyclin L2S, which lacks the RS domain, was distributed both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Fig.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	381	Photobleaching experiments showed that a significant fraction of GFP-CycL2 in nuclear speckles was rapidly exchanged by unbleached molecules within the nucleus (FRAP analysis; Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	382	 Moreover, FLIP analysis showed that a considerable portion of nuclear GFP-CycL2 transits a given small region of the nucleus within a time period of 60 s (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	383	 6B), indicating that the protein diffuses freely in the nucleoplasm when not associated with speckles.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	384	 In contrast, GFP-CycL1 was found immobile in both FRAP and FLIP analysis.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	385	 To our knowledge, the observation that GFP-CycL1 is an immobile component of nuclear speckles is unprecedented in the analysis of proteins with RS domains (for a review, see Ref.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	386	 The different mobilities of cyclin L1 and cyclin L2 indicate that the proteins have different functions despite their highly similar structures.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	387	 Presently, we can only speculate on the reason for the different mobilities of cyclin L1 and cyclin L2.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	388	 The fact that cyclin L1 was co-immunoprecipitated with PITSLREp110 argues against the possibility that the GFP fusion protein is grossly misfolded in the cell.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	389	 Instead, the association of cyclin L1 with its cyclin dependent kinase, PITSLREp110, may constrain the mobility of cyclin L1, whereas the association of cyclin L2 and PITSLREp110 appears weaker (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	390	Altogether, the presence of the RS domain, the interaction with SF2/ASF, and the localization in the nuclear speckle compartment suggest a role of cyclin L2 in the regulation of RNA splicing.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	391	 Cyclin L1 has previously been reported to stimulate an in vitro splicing reaction (39).

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	393	 Thus, a function of cyclin L2 in the control of transcription or another step of pre-mRNA processing cannot be excluded.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	400	  These cyclins, in association with the corresponding cyclin-dependent kinases, are components of the basal transcription factor TFIIH (cyclin H-CDK7) or the transcriptional elongation factor P-TEFb that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (cyclin T-CDK9 and cyclin K-CDK9) (56).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	401	 The present data show that cyclin L2 binds in vivo to the cyclin-dependent kinase PITSLREp110, as previously also demonstrated for cyclin L1 (41, 39).

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	404	 Here we show that cyclin L2 is co-localized with SC35 in the splicing factor compartment, supporting the hypothesis that cyclin L2 and PITSLREp110 are associated in vivo.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	405	 Recent reports provide evidence that PITSLRE participates in a signaling pathway that coordinates transcription and RNA processing events (57, 60).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	406	 It should be noted that in our coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	418	 Furthermore, we found that the transcripts of CCNL1 and CCNL2 were differentially regulated by extracellular stimuli; phorbol ester and cycloheximide specifically induced the mRNA for full-length cyclin L1 in human RT112 keratinocytes, whereas levels of the cyclin L2 transcripts were only weakly affected by cycloheximide and not at all by phorbol ester.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	421	 Taken together, the present characterization of the cyclin L2 gene suggests that CCNL1 and CCNL2 originated by gene duplication and have acquired different patterns of expression by divergent evolution of their promoters.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	422	The fact that both splicing variants are conserved in the paralogous genes CCNL1 and CCNL2, together with their differential patterns of expression, argues against the possibility that cyclin L1S and L2S are products of irregular splicing.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	428	 CLK1 is regulated through alternative splicing of the CLK1 pre-mRNA, yielding mRNAs encoding the catalytically active kinase and truncated polypeptides lacking the kinase domain.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	429	 CLK1 regulates splicing by phosphorylation of SR proteins and controls its own expression, since the presence of the active kinase favors the production of the truncated, inactive polypeptide (61).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	430	 There are other known cases of splicing factors that are subject to autoregulation by alternative splicing (62, 63), and we hypothesize that the existence of the short splicing variants of cyclins L1 and L2 provides a means to control the levels of the full-length proteins at the level of splicing.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	431	We have characterized cyclin L2 both as a substrate and an interaction partner of the protein kinase DYRK1A.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	432	 It appears plausible that these proteins also interact in vivo, since DYRK1A has previously been found to be localized in nuclear speckles (17, 19).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	433	 The original cyclin L2 clone isolated from the expression library lacked the cyclin domain, thus allowing the conclusion that DYRK1A interacts with the RS domain of cyclin L2.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	434	 The results of the pull-down assays indicate that the catalytic domain of DYRK1A alone is able to bind cyclin L2 but that this interaction is greatly enhanced by the presence of a small conserved region preceding the catalytic domain, called the DH box.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	435	 This region contains a large number of acidic residues (35) and is conserved in all kinases of the DYRK family and in several related kinases that are involved in the regulation of splicing (CLK family, PRP4 (48)).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	436	 It appears reasonable to assume that the negatively charged DH box is engaged in ionic interactions with the positively charged RS domain.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	437	DYRK1A phosphorylated cyclin L2 in vitro within the C-terminal domain, but the three in vitro phosphorylation sites identified in the present study were not located within RS repeat motifs (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	438	 This finding confirms our previous classification of DYRK1A as a proline-directed kinase (35).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	439	 Notably, none of the target sites in cyclin L2 contains an arginine residue in position P-2 or P-3 that we and others have previously found to be critical for substrate recognition (14, 34, 64).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	440	 We could further show that cyclin L2 is indeed a phosphoprotein when expressed in COS-7 cells.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	441	 The phosphate content of cyclin L2 was not significantly altered by co-expressed DYRK1A (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	442	 10A), probably because RS domains are generally highly phosphorylated by endogenous kinases (47).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	443	 However, overexpression in COS-7 cells of catalytically active DYRK1A, but not of a kinase-inactive mutant, induced a mobility of shift of cyclin L2, resembling the result of the in vitro phosphorylation of His6-CycL2 by DYRK1A (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	444	 This result strongly suggests that DYRK1A directly phosphorylates cyclin L2 in living cells.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	445	 The phosphorylation of SR proteins is necessary for their recruitment from nuclear speckles to sites of transcription/pre-mRNA processing (44, 65).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	446	 (19) have recently reported that kinase-active DYRK1A, but not an inactive point mutant, induced speckle disassembly.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	447	 However, it remains to be determined whether phosphorylation of cyclin L2 is involved in this action of DYRK1A.

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	0	Tripartite Hemolysin BL from Bacillus cereus HEMOLYTIC ANALYSIS OF COMPONENT INTERACTIONS AND A MODEL FOR ITS CHARACTERISTIC PARADOXICAL ZONE PHENOMENON*.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	1	(Received for publication, June 25, 1996, and in revised form, October 11, 1996).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	2	Hemolysin BL (HBL) is a unique membrane-lytic toxin from Bacillus cereus composed of three distinct proteins, designated B, L1, and L2.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	3	 HBL produces a paradoxical zone phenomenon in gel diffusion assays in sheep blood agar.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Lysis does not begin immediately adjacent to the source of diffusion; rather, it begins several millimeters away.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Cells near the source and at intersections of lysis zones remain intact longer.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Here, we developed a spectrophotometric hemolysis assay system that measures the activities of the individual HBL components and used it to analyze the mechanisms of hemolysis and the paradoxical zone phenomenon.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The B component was rate-limiting, and erythrocytes were slowly primed by B at an optimal concentration of about 1.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	8	3 nM to rapid lytic action by the combination of the L components (L1+2).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	9	 All of the individual components bound to cells independently, and membrane-associated HBL components were neutralized by specific antibodies, suggesting that lysis was caused by formation of a membrane attack complex on the cell surface.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Osmotic protection experiments indicate a colloid osmotic lysis mechanism.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Concentrations of the B component above 1.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	12	3 nM caused inhibition of L1-mediated lysis, and L1 inhibited the priming reaction of B over a similar concentration range.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	13	 From analyses of spectrophotometric and diffusion assays we constructed a basic model for the interactions between HBL components and for the paradoxical zone phenomenon in blood agar.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In the latter, areas of slow lysis near diffusion sources are caused primarily by the accumulation of inhibitory levels of L1 reached before cells are primed by B.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	15	Bacillus cereus secretes hemolysin BL (HBL),1 a membrane-lytic system composed of three antigenically distinct proteins thought to contribute to diarrheal food poisoning (1) and necrotizing infections such as endophthalmitis (2).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Separately, the HBL components are nontoxic, but when combined they exhibit a variety of toxic activities including hemolysis, cytotoxicity, vascular permeability, dermonecrosis, enterotoxicity, and ocular toxicity (1, 2, 3, 4).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	17	 When HBL diffuses from a bacterial colony or a well in blood agar, it produces an unusual discontinuous hemolysis pattern (5), called a paradoxical zone phenomenon (6).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Lysis begins away from the well or colony, followed by slow lysis nearer the source (5).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A similar zone phenomenon is seen in spectrophotometric assays in which there is decreased hemolysis at HBL concentrations above a maximally effective dose (4).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	20	HBL is the first known three-component bacterial toxin.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The components are designated B, L1, and L2.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	22	2 kDa, and their pI values are 5.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	23	33 (4), as determined electrophoretically.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The genes for all three components have been cloned, and the sequences have been determined (7, 8).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The amino acid sequences predicted from the nucleotide sequences are in complete agreement with published N-terminal amino acid sequences determined chemically (4).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	26	 All of the proteins appear unique and exhibit no significant similarity with other known proteins.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The three genes are immediately adjacent to one another, apparently in an operon (8).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Methods for purification of relatively large quantities of pure HBL components were developed only recently (4); therefore, little is known about the mode of action of HBL at the molecular level.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	29	Here we present a novel hemolysis assay system that has provided significant insight into the mechanism and interactions of HBL components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	30	 These assays are based on a fundamental difference between the activities of the B and L components and allow analysis of the activities of the individual HBL components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	31	 When sheep erythrocytes were treated with B they did not lyse, but they slowly became primed to lysis by the combination of the two L components (L1+2).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The discrete proportion of cells primed at a given time could be used as a measure of the activity of B.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The priming reaction, which took less than 1 h at 42  degrees C could be nearly stopped by reducing the temperature to 22  degrees C or below, creating a quasistable population of B-primed red blood cells (RBC-B).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The addition of L1+2 to RBC-B at 22  degrees C caused rapid lysis of cells that was over 3000 times faster than the priming rate at that temperature.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Consequently, numerous samples of the L components could be analyzed against an RBC-B preparation with little change in the primed cells.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	36	All three HBL components bound to erythrocytes independently of the others.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Complete neutralization of membrane-bound L components by specific antibodies suggest that HBL causes hemolysis via the interaction of at least the L components in a "membrane attack complex" and not by enzymatic degradation of the membrane.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Osmotic protection experiments indicated that lysis was by a colloid osmotic mechanism through transmembrane pores.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	39	Analysis also indicated that concentrations of B above 1.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	40	3 nM caused inhibition of the lysis of RBC-B by L1 in the presence of L2.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Conversely, excess L1 inhibited the priming reaction of B.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The data suggest that B and L1 each inhibit the other above a threshold concentration relative to the concentration of a membrane component.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The L2 component was required for lysis, but it exhibited little or no interference with the other components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	44	From these observations we propose a model for the paradoxical zone phenomenon seen in gel diffusion assays.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Hemolysis is slow near the HBL source because excess (and therefore inhibitory) concentrations of B and L1 accumulate before cells can be primed by B.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The initial location of lysis occurs at a point at which the diffusion rate has decreased enough so that the rate of priming by B exceeds the rate at which excess components accumulate.

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	48	Except for the osmotic protection experiments described below, all protein and red blood cell (RBC) preparations were in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Pure HBL components were purified as described previously (4).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The concentrations of the components in stock solutions were determined by absorbance at 280 nm through a 1-cm light path using extinction coefficients of 1.

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The IgG fractions were purified with a fast protein liquid chromatography system, using a Protein G-Superose column as per the instructions of the manufacturer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	56	 When tested in double immunodiffusion and dot blot assays, the titers of the antibodies to components B and L2 were roughly equal and were 2-4 times higher than those of the antibodies to L1.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The antibodies were highly specific for their respective antigens and exhibited no cross-reactivity to the other HBL components in double immunodiffusion assays or on Western blots.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	58	Osmotic protection experiments were performed essentially as described by Moayeri and Welch (9).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	59	 All samples had final compositions of 2.

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	66	 The samples were held at 37  degrees C for 75 min and then centrifuged.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Hemolysis was determined by the absorbance of the supernatants at 540 nm.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Percentage of hemolysis was calculated by comparing the absorbances of the samples with positive (100% lysis by saponin) and negative controls containing NaCl and no HBL (6).

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Also the protective antigen of anthrax toxin, which acts as a docking protein, must be cleaved by a cellular protease before the complementary proteins will bind.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	250	 The observations presented here allowed us to address related questions about the mechanism of HBL and helped answer three basic questions.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Does HBL cause lysis enzymatically or by formation of a membrane attack complex? Do the HBL components act randomly or in a compulsory order? What is the basis for the paradoxical zone phenomenon exhibited by HBL?.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	252	Hemolysins are thought to lyse cells by two general mechanisms (17).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	253	 First, the cell surface may be enzymatically altered to an extent that causes membrane degeneration.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	254	 This usually involves phospholipases, and there are numerous examples of hemolysis that require two enzymes acting in a compulsory order (18).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In some systems a phospholipase acts on the cell, which is subsequently lysed by a nonphospholipase enzyme or nonenzymatic protein.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	256	 In the second hemolysis mechanism, lysin molecules insert into the membrane and form functional transmembrane pores (19), or "leaky patches" (20).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Such lesions are generally composed of oligomers of one protein or multiple proteins.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Complement is an example of a lytic system that produces lesions composed of more than one different protein.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Complement lesions are called membrane attack complexes (MACs) to account for their multicomponent composition (21).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Hemolysins may also exhibit detergent-like activity and "solubilize" membranes, but this mechanism may not occur for hemolytic proteins (17).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	261	 3 demonstrates that both L components bound to erythrocyte membranes independently of any other HBL component.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	262	 After priming of L1- or L2-treated and washed cells by B, the addition of antibodies specific to either membrane-bound L component completely neutralized hemolysis by the complementary L component.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	263	 This indicates that the L components remained associated with the membranes after washing and that each needed to be present for a competent lytic lesion to be formed.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	264	 It also strongly suggests that a competent lesion is only formed when L1 and L2 physically interact on the cell surface, which, by definition, describes a MAC.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	265	 If the L components were simple enzymes that caused lysis by independently damaging membranes, then antibodies to an L component would not reverse the membrane damage and protect cells from lysis by the other HBL components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	266	 It appears, therefore, that HBL ultimately causes lysis by forming a lesion analogous to a complement MAC that has a minimum structure consisting of an L1-L2 heterodimer.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Osmotic protection of erythrocytes treated with HBL (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	268	 2) suggests that the putative MAC results in formation of transmembrane pores but does not indicate whether the pores are protein-lined or simply perturbations of the phospholipid bilayer surrounding the HBL components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	269	Antibodies specific for the B component also interfered with the ability of the L components to lyse B-primed cells (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	270	 4), suggesting that L components interact with B to form an integral three-component heteromeric membrane lesion.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	271	 However, although the anti-B antibodies completely neutralized the autonomous priming reaction of B, they could only partially inhibit lysis once cells were primed.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	272	 If HBL lysis does involve a three-component MAC, there are several possibilities as to what might occur during the priming reaction that decreases the ability of the anti-B antibodies to neutralize lysis.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	273	 During priming, the B component may insert into the membrane, possibly forming oligomers.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	274	 This would allow antibodies to bind only to exposed portions of B and not to portions sequestered within the membrane.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Any conformational changes experienced by B might also decrease the avidity of antibodies prepared to its native conformation.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	276	 It is also possible that B is altered by a membrane component, such as occurs in the proteolytic processing of the protective antigen component of anthrax toxin (14).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Antibodies prepared to native B may bind poorly to the processed version.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	278	The inability of anti-B antibodies to completely neutralize lysis of RBC-B by L1+2 might also be diagnostic of an enzymatic mechanism for B.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	279	 A situation can be envisioned in which B binds to a membrane and converts a substrate to a product that is subsequently recognized by the L components, leading to lysis.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	280	 If the product was to accumulate in a pool in the immediate vicinity of the membrane-bound B, partial inhibition might occur if B-associated antibody sterically prevented access of L components to the product.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Such a mechanism seems rather unlikely, but it cannot be ruled out with present observations.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	282	The next question addressed by our data is whether the HBL components act in an ordered or random manner.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	283	 1 and 3 that all three HBL components bind to erythrocytes independently (i.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	284	 However, as pointed out by Ponder in 1948 (6), hemolysis is a relatively complex multistep process.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Pore assembly models for staphylococcal -toxin and for streptolysin O provide examples of such a multistep process (22).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	286	 -Toxin monomers bind to membranes, diffuse laterally into a prepore complex on the membrane surface, and subsequently insert and form pores.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	287	 SLO also binds as monomers and then undergoes a rate-limiting nucleation process involving formation of dimers on the membrane surface, followed by dimer insertion, and then rapid accumulation of monomers around the dimer nucleus to form the functional lesion.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The complexity of these processes demonstrates that simple association of toxin components with erythrocytes does not provide a picture of the overall hemolysis mechanism.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	289	Our evidence suggests that HBL components form pores after they form a complex.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	290	 The L1 and L2 components rapidly contribute to the complex in a manner that does not appear to depend on the sequence of their addition.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	291	 However, the B component clearly must undergo an autonomous, rate-limiting reaction before a functional lesion can be formed with the L components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Therefore, although all of the components bind independently to the cell, final lesion formation appears to follow a specific order with respect to the B and L components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	293	 It is possible that the appearance of an ordered reaction is an artifact of the kinetics of the individual components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	294	 All of the components might undergo analogous independent priming reactions, with the reaction of B being extremely slow relative to the reactions of the L components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	295	 However, our data suggest that the priming process followed by B is fundamentally different from those followed by the L components, because antibodies could completely protect cells when reacted with either membrane-associated L component, but not when reacted with B-primed cells.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	296	The cause of the paradoxical zone phenomenon of HBL is the third major mechanistic question addressed by these data.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	297	 5 and 6 indicate that B and L1 are mutually inhibitory above a threshold concentration and that this antagonism is responsible for the paradoxical hemolysis behavior seen in gel diffusion and suspension assays.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	298	In a dose-response curve for the priming reaction of B (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	299	 5A), the lysis velocity (reaction 2 in Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	300	 1A) of L1+2 decreased with increasing concentrations of B even when most cells were primed.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	301	 5B shows that lysis velocity could be inhibited even if Bi was added after cells were completely primed (100% RBC-B).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	302	 The inhibition of lysis did not increase if RBC-B were pretreated with Bi (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	303	 5B, inset), indicating that inhibition was not due to an enzymatic action of Bi on the cells.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Inhibition decreased, however, if Bi was added after L1 (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	305	 5, B and C), indicating that Bi interferes with the incorporation of L1 into the lesion and not with the function of a preformed lesion.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	306	The kinetics of the inhibition of L1 by B in Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Inhibition decreased linearly with time (r = 0.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	308	 This suggests a first order process for the incorporation of L1 into lesions, which is in distinct contrast to the complex shape of hemolysis curves.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	309	 This type of measurement was possible only because of the special situation in which B does not appear to interfere with lysis once L1 has been incorporated into a lesion.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	310	 6 shows that, above a threshold concentration, L1 also inhibited the priming reaction of B.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	311	 The dose-response of L1-mediated inhibition of the priming reaction was nearly identical to that for inhibition of L1 by excess B (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	312	 In addition, excess L1 inhibited hemolysis caused by HBL placed in adjacent wells in blood agar (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	313	The hemolysis data presented here provide an explanation for the paradoxical zone phenomenon of HBL and the lysis patterns seen in Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	314	 HBL hemolysis in blood agar is discontinuous and begins away from a well containing the components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	315	 However, diffusing molecules create a continuous concentration gradient, and the components must therefore reach a concentration that promotes hemolysis at every point between the well edge and the zone in which lysis begins; this is the paradox, and we propose the following model to explain it.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	316	 A cell will not lyse unless it has been primed by B, and maximal priming occurs only at permissive concentrations of B and L1.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	317	 When membrane-bound B or L1 exceeds a critical ratio versus a membrane constituent, the other component is inhibited from forming a functional lesion (or perhaps produces an inefficient lesion).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Priming by B is slow and, since L1 can inhibit B at any time during the reaction (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	319	 6A, insert), priming is inhibited near a well when L1 diffuses rapidly enough to accumulate to inhibitory levels before cells are primed.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Hemolysis only begins in a zone in which the B concentration is high enough to prime cells, but the diffusion rate of L1 is too low for it to reach an inhibitory concentration before the cells are primed.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Inhibition at the intersections of zones is due to accumulation of excess L1 before cells are primed.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	322	 It is unlikely that inhibition is caused by an excess ratio of B to L1 or vice versa, because a paradoxical zone phenomenon occurs in suspension assays simply by increasing the concentration of all three components at a constant ratio of each to the others (4).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	323	The influence on hemolysis patterns of the inhibitory effect of L1 is seen in Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Just as lysis is inhibited at the intersections of HBL hemolysis zones, lysis was also inhibited at the intersection of an HBL hemolysis zone and an L1 diffusion zone.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	325	 6A, L2 had no appreciable effect on an adjacent hemolysis pattern.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	326	 The enhanced lysis between wells containing either HBL or B only seems contradictory in light of the observation that excess B inhibits lysis by L1, but it is consistent with the mechanism of HBL.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	327	 The B component primes cells independently of the other components (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	328	 1, B and C), and once primed, cells are rapidly lysed by any concentration of L1+2.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	329	 The lysis within the B diffusion zone occurred simply because cells were primed by B in the absence of inhibitory concentrations of L1.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	330	 The priming reaction of B is over 1000 times slower than the lytic action of L1 at room temperature.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Therefore, even in the presence of excess B, the lysis rate of RBC-B will not be noticeably slower than the rate at which cells are primed by B.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	332	 On the other hand, any inhibition by L1 of the priming reaction of B should be profoundly evident.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	333	 This seems to be born out in the lysis patterns in Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	334	Our hemolysis data provide some insights into the mechanism of HBL, which appears to involve novel modes of interactions between proteins and membranes.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	335	 The three proteins that comprise HBL are collectively called a toxin because of an early simplifying assumption that they represent a single functional unit to the bacterium that produces them.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	336	 This work supports that assumption.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	337	 New findings show that the genes for all three components are arranged immediately adjacent to one another, probably in an operon (8), lending additional weight to the idea that the three proteins comprise a functional unit.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	338	 HBL is unlike any previously described cytolytic toxin, from its complex composition to the unique hemolytic phenomena that it causes.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	339	 Further study of this toxin promises to add a new perspective to perceptions about the mechanisms and utility of cytolytic toxins.

0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Furthermore, binding of in vitro generated HBV capsids to the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized hepatoma cells was previously found to depend on the phosphorylation status of the core protein (15).

0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Due to the low amounts of enveloped virions obtained with mutant S245A, this study was restricted to mutants S245D and S245N.

0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Possible reasons accounting for this observation include differences in local protein structure preferred by alanine and aspartic acid compared with serine and asparagine and/or electrostatic repulsion of DNA by aspartic acid.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Furthermore, hydrogen bonding mediated by non-phosphorylated serine as well as asparagine may contribute to the stabilization of the quarterny structure of mature DHBV capsids.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	229	 The precise structural properties of mutant capsids that are associated with the nuclease-sensitivity of mature viral DNA remain to be further elucidated.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	230	 We obtained no evidence for a complete disintegration of mature S245A capsids in immunoprecipitation experiments and the density gradient sedimentation assay.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	231	 It should be noted, however that, partially dissociated S245A capsids may have reassembled after DNA release with rcDNA remaining attached to the outside of the capsid.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Alternatively, the sensitivity of rcDNA may simply be based on an increased "breathing" of the capsid.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	233	 This phenomenon involves the slow release of capsid subunits followed by a rapid reformation of the capsid integrity, as discussed previously for HBV capsids (25).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	234	The fact that only mature rcDNA but not ssDNA associated with mutant capsids S245D and S245A was accessible to nuclease action indicates that DNA maturation itself is an important trigger of capsid destabilization.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Possibly, interactions of viral DNA with the C terminus of the core protein are of importance in this context (26).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Our results shed new light on previous data, which had implicated that the C-terminal domain of DHBV core protein is required for DNA maturation.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Rather, this report and our previous study on deletion and insertion mutants of the DHBV core protein (17) suggest that the phenotype of several mutants is at least in part due to nuclease sensitivity of mature viral DNA.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	238	 The fact that nuclease treatment is commonly used to remove plasmid DNA prior to extraction of nucleocapsid associated hepadnaviral DNA explains why fully mature DNA forms have not been observed earlier.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Indeed, we found that nuclease sensitivity of rcDNA also accounts for the phenotype of a previously described P246G mutant of DHBV core (16).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	240	2 It will be interesting to determine the relevance of these observations for HBV core protein mutants.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	241	Our data suggest that negative charges at position 245 as contributed by phosphorylated serine or aspartic acid support nuclear targeting of DHBV core protein, cccDNA formation and infectivity.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	242	 The residual cccDNA formation by mutant S245N could be due to nuclear import of small amounts of core protein mediated by the remaining, unchanged phosphorylation sites.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	243	 This may be difficult to detect by immunofluorescence since the polyclonal anti-DHBV core antibody may not react well with core protein dimers in fixed cells.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Alternatively, capsids might become entrapped non-specifically within the nucleus of dividing cells and be degraded subsequently.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Nevertheless, our infection experiments in PDH demonstrate that the residual cccDNA formation by S245N does not suffice to initiate productive infection.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	246	Collectively, our observations suggest the following model: maturation of rcDNA within the nucleocapsid is an important trigger of capsid destabilization, which ultimately results in DNA release.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	247	 During viral assembly hydrogen bonds formed by non-phosphorylated serine 245 contribute to the stabilization of nucleocapsids thus preventing DNA liberation in the cytoplasm.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	248	 During infection, phosphorylation of serine 245 directs the capsid to the nucleus.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	249	 At the same time nucleocapsids are destabilized thus facilitating rcDNA release in the nucleus.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	250	 These mechanisms would also apply to progeny capsids that are redirected to the nucleus for cccDNA amplification.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	251	 How newly formed DHBV capsids are directed to the secretory pathway remains to be elucidated, however, since Mabit and Schaller (13) have shown that dephosphorylation alone is not sufficient to confer membrane affinity.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	252	 The suggested model is in line with the previous observation in the duck model that serum-derived nucleocapsids are non-phosphorylated whereas nucleocapsids from liver tissue are highly phosphorylated (14).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	253	 It is tempting to speculate that incoming and recycling capsids are phosphorylated by a capsid-associated kinase activity of cellular origin, which has been described in the WHV and HBV system (27 to 33).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	254	The present report demonstrates a central role of serine 245 in regulating DHBV capsid trafficking and stability.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Clearly, however, the remaining phosphorylation sites within DHBV core may play an important role as well, since earlier reports indicate that serine 259 also affects viral infectivity (10, 16).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	256	 It remains to be elucidated which and how many residues of individual nucleocapsids are phosphorylated at a given time point and how core protein phosphorylation is orchestrated during capsid assembly and disassembly.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Further studies in the HBV and WHV system will have to establish whether mammalian core protein phosphorylation is essential for infectivity as well.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	258	 The recently described infection of primary tupaia hepatocytes (34) might represent a suitable model to address this question.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Interestingly, phosphorylation of capsid protein by capsid-associated kinase activities has also been suggested to play a key role during the early steps of HIV infection (35).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Thus, phosphorylation might represent a general mechanism regulating the targeted genome release from viral capsids.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	126	 In addition, we observed that intestinal nuclei of lin-46(lf); lin-14(n179ts) animals fail to divide in the L1 as they normally do, which is a lin-14A defect, but did not display precocious vulva development, a lin-14B defect (data not shown) (Ambros and Horvitz, 1987; Euling and Ambros, 1996).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Thus, lin-46(lf) suppressed the defects that lin-14 hypomorphic alleles have in common with lin-28(lf), but not those unique to lin-14, although it suppressed none of the defects of a lin-14 null allele.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	128	Interestingly, the suppression of the lin-28(lf) phenotype was quite complete: whereas 100% of lin-28(lf) animals have precocious adult alae, the lin-28(lf); lin-46(lf) double mutant animals were devoid of adult alae at the L4 stage (Table 2, lines 3 and 4).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	129	 By contrast, the suppression of lin-14 hypomorphic alleles was substantial, albeit incomplete.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	130	 For example, for lin-14(n360), the percentage of animals with full-length precocious adult alae was reduced from 77% to 5%; however, 95% of double mutant animals had some amount of precocious alae (Table 2, lines 9 and 10).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	131	Because lin-14 and lin-28 act together to govern the cell fates of the L2 and later, our findings suggest that lin-46 has different relationships with these two genes.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The ability of lin-46(lf) to suppress lin-14 hypomorphic alleles but not a null allele may reflect that at least some lin-14 activity is required for suppression, and, furthermore, that lin-46(lf) suppresses the phenotype of lin-28(lf) by raising lin-14 activity to a compensatory level.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Importantly, a requirement for lin-14 in the suppression would suggest that lin-14 can act independently of lin-28 to control late stage fates.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Because of its implications for how the heterochronic pathway functions, we further investigated this possibility.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	135	Suppression of lin-28 does not require lin-14 To determine whether lin-14 is indeed required for the suppression of lin-28(lf) phenotype by lin-46(lf), we assessed hypodermal development in strains bearing a null allele of lin-14.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	136	 lin-14(0) animals skip L1-specific lineage patterns, and precociously execute the L2-specific division patterns that increase the seam cell number (Ambros and Horvitz, 1987).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	137	 It has been previously shown that a lin-28(lf); lin-14(0) strain executes the L/A switch one stage earlier than a lin-14(0) strain; however, the effect of this mutant combination on seam cell number was not assessed (Ambros, 1989).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	138	 We observed that the increase of 10 to 15 seam cells that occurs abnormally early during the L1 in lin-14(0) animals did not occur in the absence of lin-28, consistent with an L3 lineage pattern occurring two stages early (Table 3, lines 1 and 3).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	139	 This observation indicates the hypodermal lineage patterns executed in the L1 in lin-14(0) animals are controlled by lin-28, and is evidence that lin-28 acts independently of lin-14 to govern these cell fate choices.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Suppression of lin-28(0) by lin-46(0) does not require lin-14.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	141	  Importantly, although lin-46(lf) had no effect on the number of seam cells of lin-14(0) animals with wild-type lin-28, it increased the number of seam cells of a lin-28(lf); lin-14(0) strain to that of a lin-14(0) strain (Table 3).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Thus, lin-46(lf) suppressed the lin-28(lf) defect, despite the absence of lin-14.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	143	 In addition, the L/A switch, as indicated by seam cell fusion and adult alae formation, occurred one stage later in triple mutant animals relative to lin-28(lf); lin-14(0) animals (data not shown).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Therefore, the elevation of lin-14 activity is not the mechanism by which lin-46(lf) compensates for the loss of lin-28.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	145	Interactions of lin-46 with other heterochronic mutants To further establish the position of lin-46 in the developmental timing pathway, we examined its interactions with other precocious heterochronic mutants.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In addition to lin-14 and lin-28, several other genes have been identified that result in precocious expression of the L/A switch when mutated: lin-41, lin-42 and lin-57 (Z.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Liu, PhD thesis, Harvard University, 1990) (Abrahante et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	148	 For this analysis, we again examined the ability of a lin-46(lf) to suppress the precocious execution of the L/A switch that is characteristic of these mutants.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	149	lin-46(lf) partially suppressed the precocious synthesis of adult alae of a lin-42(lf), whereas it had little or no effect on the precocious alae caused by loss of the activities of lin-41(lf) and lin-57(lf) (Table 2, lines 11-16).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Thus, lin-46 appears to function upstream of lin-41 and lin-57 and downstream or in parallel with lin-42 in controlling the L/A switch.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	151	 These results are consistent with lin-46 acting early in the heterochronic pathway, because both lin-41 and lin-57 are thought to act late in development, downstream of lin-28 in controlling the L/A switch (see Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The earliest time of action of lin-42 has not been determined, but previous genetic analysis, as well as these data, are consistent with it acting early in the heterochronic pathway (Z.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	154	lin-46 mutations cause retarded development at two stages In examining the effects of lin-46(lf) in the absence of other heterochronic mutations, we observed an increase in the number of seam cells after the L2 stage when the animals were grown at 15 degrees C (Table 1, line 8).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	155	 This increase probably reflects a reiteration of the L2-specific lineage pattern at the L3 stage, in which the five seam cells that divide twice in the L2, do so again in the L3 (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	156	 This retarded lineage defect was not observed when animals were raised at 20 degrees C, indicating a strict cold-sensitivity for this defect (Table 1, line 7).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Because the mutant alleles of lin-46 are likely to result in the complete loss of function of the gene (see below), a reiteration of L2 lineages in lin-46(0) would indicate that the normal role of lin-46 is to promote the expression of L3-specific cell fates at the appropriate time.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	158	Moreover, we observed that two mutant alleles of lin-46 each caused a similar failure of the L/A switch at the end of larval development, resulting in gaps in adult alae (Table 4, lines 4 and 7; Figs 1, 2).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The penetrance and expressivity of this phenotype are significantly enhanced by growth at low temperature.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	160	 For example, the retarded L/A switch defect of lin-46(ma164) showed 6% penetrance at 25 degrees C, 32% at 20 degrees C, and 86% at 15 degrees C (Table 4, lines 4-6).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Because this cold sensitivity was true of mutant alleles of lin-46, which, as described below, are likely to be null by molecular criteria, it appears to be a property of a strain lacking lin-46 activity, rather than a property of the molecular lesions themselves.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	169	  Remarkably, the early and late retarded lineage defects of lin-46(lf) are not equivalently penetrant.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Specifically, 32% of lin-46(ma164) animals raised at 20 degrees C show L/A switch defects, whereas none grown at the same temperature showed reiteration of L2 lineage patterns (Table 1, line 7, and Table 4, line 5).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Thus, the late stage defect is not dependent on an earlier lineage defect (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	172	 As discussed below, this is consistent with lin-46 either acting twice, early and late, or acting at one time and separately affecting two downstream processes that are differently sensitive to its level of activity.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	173	Interestingly, the retarded phenotype of lin-46(lf) is nearly completely suppressed by lin-28(lf).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	174	 For example, the penetrance of the L/A switch defect in lin-28(lf); lin-46(ma164) was 8% at 15 degrees C, which is significantly reduced relative to 86% for lin-46(ma164) alone (Table 4, lines 4 and 13).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Likewise, we observed no early cell lineage defects in the double mutant grown at 15 degrees C (Table 1, line 4; Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	176	 This mutual suppression of lin-46(lf) and lin-28(lf) suggests that lin-46 is not in a simple linear pathway downstream of lin-28, but rather that their activities converge, possibly on common targets.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	177	By contrast, the retarded phenotype of lin-46(lf) was not suppressed by a lin-14 null mutation.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Rather, lin-46(lf) causes a severe retarded defect in a lin-14 null mutant background (67%), as it does in an otherwise wild-type background (86%; Table 4, lines 4 and 17).

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	223	 We observed that it was sufficient that animals be at the restrictive temperature only until the L2 lethargus for nearly 90% of the population to display gaps in adult alae (Table 5, 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Futhermore, we found it was necessary that the animals be at 15 degrees C at least until L2 lethargus for a high penetrance of the alae defect; if animals were shifted from the permissive to the restrictive temperature at the L2 lethargus then 7% or less showed the defect (Table 5, 25 degrees C to 15 degrees C).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	225	 These data indicate that the period that lin-46 mutant animals are cold sensitive for the adult alae defect is prior to the L3 stage.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	229	 We previously presented a model for the interactions governing the choice of L2 versus L3 cell fates (Seggerson et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	230	 In this model, lin-14 and lin-28 are repressed by the microRNA lin-4 at the same time they support each other's expression via a lin-4-independent feedback circuit.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	231	 This positive regulatory circuit is proposed to occur by the repression of two negative regulators, x and y, whose identities are not known.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	232	Here we extend this model by proposing that lin-46 acts specifically to promote the activity of y, and furthermore, that y acts both to regulate lin-14 expression and to control developmental timing at two larval stages (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Therefore, y represents both the point of convergence of the lin-28 and lin-46 activities, as well as a branch-point in the pathway that affects lin-14 expression and L3 cell fates.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	234	 We have no reason yet to believe that lin-14 expression and L3 cell fates are regulated by distinct factors.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Therefore, we continue to indicate this as a single activity, the hypothetical factor y, which may consist of multiple factors.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	236	In our model, we have placed lin-46 outside of the feedback circuit based on the relative penetrance of the lin-28(lf) and lin-46(lf) phenotypes and their mutual suppression (Tables 1 and 4).

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Thus, their mutual suppression implies that lin-28 and lin-46 affect a common process, but do not act in a simple linear pathway.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	239	 If it were a simple pathway, then the lin-28(lf); lin-46(lf) animals would display the same degree of retarded development as lin-46(lf) animals.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Furthermore, the difference in penetrance of the lin-28(lf) and lin-46(lf) phenotypes suggests they have different degrees of influence on cell fates.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Specifically, whereas a lin-28(lf) is always fully precocious, the lin-46(lf) retarded phenotype is incomplete and conditional.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	242	 For these reasons, we propose that lin-46 is not directly part of the lin-14/lin-28 positive feedback circuit, and therefore is not itself y, but rather acts to promote the activity of y (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	243	The difference in the penetrance between the suppression by lin-46(lf) of lin-28(lf) and the retarded L2 phenotype of lin-46(lf) also suggests that changes occur in how the L2/L3 fate decision is made at different times.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	244	 In other words, cell fates at the L2 stage in a lin-28(lf) are more sensitive to the loss of lin-46 than are fates at the L3 in wild type (Table 1; Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Perhaps the decision to execute L3 fates is more robust at the third larval stage in wild type because of additional activities that are not present at the second larval stage in a lin-28 mutant.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Furthermore, in no situation does the absence of lin-46 cause L2-specific cell fates to be reiterated indefinitely, further suggesting that additional factors come to influence the L2/L3 fate decision, ultimately in favor of L3 fates.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	247	The role of lin-14 in late stage cell fates Our observations help to further illuminate the relationship between lin-14 and lin-28 in controlling the execution of cell fates after the first larval stage.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Two models have been proposed to explain the activities of lin-14, lin-14A and lin-14B that independently affect L1 and later developmental events (Ambros and Horvitz, 1987).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	249	 One is that different isoforms of the LIN-14 protein possess these distinct activities (Wightman et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	250	, 1991; Reinhart and Ruvkun, 2001).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	251	 However, this model is not supported by the finding that a molecular clone of a single isoform of LIN-14 can fully rescue lin-14(lf) (Hong et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	252	 A second model is that the LIN-14 protein forms a temporal gradient through larval development, analogous to morphogen gradients in the Drosophila embryo (Ruvkun and Giusto, 1989; Reinhart and Ruvkun, 2001).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	253	 However, our findings indicate that lin-14 affects L2 developmental events only through lin-28, which requires a genetic circuit between these genes that engages late in the first larval stage (Table 3) (Seggerson et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	254	 In other words, the lin-14B activity essentially reflects the participation of lin-14 in a positive feedback circuit with lin-28.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	255	This model explains why lin-46(lf), which bypasses the requirement for lin-28, suppresses the L2 defects of lin-14(lf) but not its L1 defects.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Hypomorphic alleles of lin-14, such as lin-14(n360) and lin-14(n179ts) used in these studies, reduce the activity of lin-14, but do not eliminate it.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	257	 At the end of the first larval stage, when the positive feedback circuit between lin-14 and lin-28 is engaged, a mutation in lin-14 would lead to a reduction in lin-28 expression, and then a further reduction in lin-14.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	258	 We have previously proposed that y in our model mediates the reduction of lin-14 in this circuit (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	259	 However, if lin-46 is absent, the activity of y would be attenuated and the reduction of lin-14 would not be further amplified.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Therefore, lin-46(lf) suppresses a lin-14 hypomorph by essentially upregulating the existing lin-14 activity.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	261	 As a corollary, we propose that part of the reduction of lin-14 activity of hypomorphic alleles is due to further downregulation via the positive feedback circuit.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	262	Importantly, the reason a lin-46 mutation does not suppress a lin-14 null allele is twofold: first, lin-14 normally acts through the feedback circuit and lin-28 to control the L2/L3 fate choice, as we have shown (Table 3); and second, the lin-28-repressive component of the feedback circuit is not engaged early in the first larval stage of a lin-14 mutant, as has been shown previously (Seggerson et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Therefore, the effects of lin-28 and lin-46 on the L2/L3 fate decision are independent of the feedback circuit because they occur in the early L1 when lin-14 is absent.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Supporting this conclusion is our observation that lin-46(lf) causes a severe retarded phenotype in a lin-14(0) background at 15 degrees C (Table 4).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Thus, the different genetic interactions lin-46 has with lin-14 and lin-28 reflect the underlying change in the relationship between lin-14 and lin-28 that occurs at the end of the L1 stage with the engagement of the lin-4-independent feedback circuit (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	266	lin-46 affects L3 and adult fates independently Our data also indicate that the role of lin-46 in regulating the L/A switch appears to be independent of its role in the L2/L3 fate decision.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Specifically, lin-46(lf) animals grown at 20 degrees C display normal cell lineage patterns early, but at the same temperature there is significant failure of the L/A switch at the L4 stage (Tables 1 and 4; Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Thus, the failure of the L/A switch in lin-46(lf) animals can occur without a prior lineage defect.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Because lin-46:GFP reporters are expressed in the L4 stage (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	270	 4B), this independence of early and late retarded defects may reflect that lin-46 acts twice, once to promote L3 fates and again later to promote adult-specific fates.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	271	 However, we found that the cold-sensitive period of lin-46(lf) strain for the adult fates is prior to the L3 stage.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	272	 This finding suggests that lin-46 normally acts only once at a branch-point in the heterochronic pathway where some of its targets influence L3 fates immediately, and other targets, which are more sensitive to its absence, govern adult fates (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	273	 This latter possibility is consistent with lin-46 acting at a step immediately downstream of lin-28.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	274	 In our model, therefore, y may represent multiple factors, some of which affect the L2/L3 fate decision and the regulation of lin-14, and others which affect the L/A switch through the other known heterochronic genes (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	275	 One possibility is that lin-28 and lin-46 directly affect the microRNA let-7, which then regulates other genes that control the L/A switch (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	276	 This is consistent with the failure of lin-46(lf) to suppress the precocious phenotypes of the later-acting genes lin-41 and lin-57 (Table 2).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Further analysis will determine whether lin-46 and lin-28 indeed affect the expression or activity of let-7.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Because let-7 or let-7-like microRNAs have been hypothesized to regulate lin-14, it is an intriguing possibility that some of factors that constitute y are microRNAs.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	279	LIN-46 may form a scaffold for a multiprotein assembly The homology of the LIN-46 protein to MoeA and gephyrin further provides a basis for explaining its function.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	280	 The crystal structure of MoeA shows it to exist as a homodimer, and it is likely that proteins with sequence similarity to MoeA do so as well (Schrag et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	281	 We have observed that the LIN-46 protein strongly interacts with itself in a yeast two hybrid assay, further suggesting LIN-46 forms multimers (L.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Gephyrin is believed to dimerize with itself via its C-terminal MoeA-like region, and trimerize with its N-terminal MogA-like region (see Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	283	 The ability of gephyrin to multimerize and form a scaffold is the basis for its ability to cluster and aid the activity of interacting proteins (Schwarz et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Although gephyrin is known to act both in synaptic transmission and in molybdenum co-factor biosynthesis, LIN-46 does not appear to have a role in either of these processes in C.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	285	 elegans; possibly its paralog, MOC-1, has these roles.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	286	 We speculate that a general feature of proteins related to gephyrin, therefore, may be their ability to form scaffolds that avail them to participating in diverse biological roles, including development.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	287	Based on several lines of evidence, including the homology to gephyrin, we propose a molecular model for LIN-46 in which it acts as a scaffolding protein for a multiprotein complex that determines cell fates (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Supporting this model is the striking cold sensitivity of lin-46 null alleles (Table 2).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Cold sensitivity can be a feature of mutations affecting the dynamics of multiprotein structures, such as microtubules and bacteriophage capsids (Huffaker et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	290	 LIN-46 may potentiate the activity of a complex that includes cell fate regulators or other developmental timing factors.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	291	 LIN-46 is not essential for the activity of this complex, because development of a lin-46 null mutant is nearly normal at 20 degrees C, but the absence of LIN-46 protein may substantially reduce the activity of the complex at low temperature, possibly by causing the retention of a negative regulator of the complex.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Because the LIN-28 protein appears to be a specific mRNA-binding protein (Moss et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	293	, 1997), the expression of some of the components of the complex may be repressed when lin-28 is normally active (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	294	 The suppression of the loss of lin-28 activity would therefore result from balance between the overexpression of components of the complex, and reduced efficiency of their function.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	295	In summary, we believe lin-46 occupies a unique position in the heterochronic pathway and furthers our understanding of the complex genetic network that governs the temporal regulation of developmental events.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	296	 The fact that the LIN-46 protein resembles gephyrin expands the biological function of this protein family to development.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	297	 LIN-46 is likely to interact with other proteins in controlling cell fate choices, and the identities of these proteins, which may also be regulatory targets of LIN-28, will provide further insight into how the temporal components of cell fates are determined.

0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	6	The tRNA molecules and tRNA-like structures have been identified as crucial elements in the replication of a very diverse group of viruses including plant viruses (12,13) and mammalian retroviruses (14).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Recently, a human tRNASer(CGA) gene has been cloned and expressed in mammalian cells (15,16).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The cloned human tRNASer(CGA) gene containing 400 bp has previously been verified for its integrity and functionality (15,16), via its ability to act in reverse transcription of a retroviral vector harboring a complementary primer binding site sequence (16).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The human tRNASer(CGA) molecule was originally identified via a screening of the human BOSC23 retroviral packaging cell line (17) for tRNA molecules functionable as primers for murine leukemia virus (MLV) replication (16).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	10	 But it is not clear whether this tRNASer(CGA) molecule could be functional for protein translation of MLV and other viruses.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	11	 More recently, tRNA-like structure of turnip yellow mosaic virus has been reported to be a 3'-translational enhancer, which enhanced expression of a firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter gene up to 25-fold (18).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Therefore, we are interested to investigate whether and how the expression of the human tRNASer(CGA) gene would affect the expression of wild-type (wt) and codon-modified (HB) papillomavirus (PV) L1 genes in cultured mammalian cells.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	13	Both wt and HB PV L1 genes were chosen as the target genes throughout the experiments; we initially considered the choice for three reasons.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	14	 First, PVs are exclusively epitheliotropic viruses.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The PV life cycle is tightly linked to epithelial cell differentiation.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Production of viral capsid proteins (L1 and L2) expressed from the late gene (L1 and L2) is restricted to the most terminally differentiated keratinocytes in the upper layers of the epithelium.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Expression of L1 and L2 proteins from wt PV L1 and L2 genes has not been observed in proliferating transfected keratinocytes (19) and other replicating mammalian cells (20).

0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	247	 (A) Protein expression of hm gfp and six serine GFP variants in CHO cells transiently transfected solely with the seven GFP plasmid DNAs 42 h post-transfection.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Protein sample 4  microg was separated by SDS to PAGE and blotted on PVDF membrane.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Signals of both GFPs produced by the GFP expression constructs and ss-tubulin were detected by monoclonal antibodies against both GFP and ss-tubulin.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	250	 (B) Effects of the tRNASer(CGA) expression construct on expression of GFPs produced by the hm gfp gene and six serine GFP variants in CHO cells.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Two dilutions of protein samples from CHO cells either transfected solely with hm gfp and six Serine GFP variants, or co-transfected with GFP gene construct and the tRNASer(CGA) gene 42 h post-transfection were loaded onto SDS to PAGE gel for protein fractionation and blotted on PVDF membranes for immunoblotting assay.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Upper panels show the results of GFP immunoblotting assay; lower panels show the results of ss-tubulin immunoblotting assay indicating equal loading of the protein samples between two treatments.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	253	 The relative levels of GFPs and tubulin produced by the six serine GFP variants with or without co-transfection of the tRNASer(CGA) gene are shown by arbitrary units (means + SDx 103), which were measured from the four blots by densitometry from two independent experiments.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	254	Previous studies have indicated that changes of physiological factors resulted in alteration in the populations of specific or total tRNAs in the mammalian tissues or cells (40 to 44).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	255	 For example, ovariectomy resulted in alterations in the population of uterine serine tRNA (40).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Due to carcinogenesis, cellular tRNA distribution was shifted in the tRNA population with an increased level of initiator tRNAMet in the malignant tissues (44).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Selenium, an essential trace element that functions in proteins (selenocysteine, Sec) critical for a variety of cellular processes, influences the level of the Sec tRNA[ser]sec population and the distribution of the Sec tRNA[ser]sec isoacceptors in both mammalian cells grown in culture (45) and mammalian tissues (46) and the turnover of Sec tRNA[ser]sec in CHO cells (43).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	258	 The present data indicate further that the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene increased not only the relative levels of the tRNASer(CGA) and the initiator tRNAMet but also probably resulted in new tRNA species produced in the two cell lines.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Consequently, expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene altered the gel profiles of the total tRNAs in the two cell lines.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Our results are in agreement with previous studies (47 to 52) in that genes for expressing tRNA species introduced into cells change tRNA contents in the targeted cells.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Thus, all the observations suggest that mammalian cells may have a sensitive mechanism to sense and respond to both changes in physiological factors and introduction of foreign tRNA genes, by altering their tRNA populations.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	262	Here, expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene was identified to enhance the expression of L1 proteins encoded by the PV wt L1 genes and of GFPs encoded by two (UCG and AGU) serine variants in two cell lines examined.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Previously, there have been examples in which synthesis of a specialized protein is associated with expression of a single tRNA gene due to modification of the tRNA population in different expression systems (9,10).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene was then found to increases the synthesis of some cellular proteins in the present study.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	265	 As a result, expression of 5 to 10% of total cellular proteins was increased in the L1 cells following transfection of the tRNASer(CGA) gene when compared to the control L1 cells.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Our results support previous studies that tRNAs, even a single tRNA, affect protein expression encoded by heterologous genes in different expression systems (9,10,20,30,40,41).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	267	 For example, tRNAs from oviducts of estrogen-stimulated chicks or from oviducts of laying hens produced an enhanced stimulation of ovalbumin synthesis in vitro (40).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	268	 The use of tRNA (AGA/AGG) increased human interferon HUIFN-a2 and HCV core protein expression (9,10), but barely affected the human IFN-8 expression in an E.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	269	 However, expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene reduced expression of L1 proteins encoded by the PV HB L1 genes and of GFP encoded by UCA serine variant and of some cellular proteins.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	270	 The result was consistent with a few other studies.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	271	 A tRNASer(UCN) gene flanked with the deafness-associated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) T7445C mutation at the 3' end causes an average reduction of 70% in the levels of the tested proteins and a decrease of 45% in protein synthesis rate in the cell lines analyzed (53).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Recently, Akama and Beier (54) reported that co-transfection of Arabidopsis hypocotyls with amber suppressor tRNASer(CGA) gene and the GUS reporter gene resulted in 10% of the GUS activity found in the same tissue transformed solely with the GUS gene.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Therefore, we can speculate that contents and modifications of the endogenous tRNAs have effects on the expression of a large number of both foreign and host genes through tRNA function in translation in mammalian cells.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Our findings are consistent with the conclusion that the host cell tRNAs can affect the synthesis of gene products quantitatively and qualitatively in translating heterologous genes (55,56).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	275	The most interesting finding in the present study is that the tRNASer(CGA) gene had variable effects on expression of the PV wt and HB L1 genes and of hm gfp gene and serine GFP variants at protein translational levels in the two cell lines examined.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Previous studies have reported that the expression of the PV capsid genes (L1 and L2) is controlled by several means: the late viral promoters depend on the differentiation status of the cells, polyadenylation signals terminate transcription before reaching the late regions (57 to 60) and mRNAs encoding the capsid proteins contain inhibitory elements that prevent nuclear export or destabilize the message (19,61 to 66).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	277	 However, none of these studies produced the PV L1 and L2 proteins expressed from the wt L1 and L2 genes in replicating mammalian cells.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	278	 In contrast, previous findings in our laboratory have indicated that a strong bias in codon usage is apparent between the papillomavirus and its host, which blocks BPV1 capsid genes from expressing their proteins in non-differentiated mammalian cells (20,33).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	279	 On the basis of the hypothesis that the match between codon usage and tRNA contents regulates the gene expression at the protein levels (20), the limitation of PV capsid protein expression has been overcome by modifying the codon usage of these genes toward mammalian  consensus  without changing the protein sequence, demonstrating that codon usage is one of the determinants of the rate of HPV gene expression in non-differentiated mammalian cells (20,22 to 24,67).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	280	 In the present study, we take a different approach to test the hypothesis that the match between codon usage and tRNAs regulate PV L1 genes to express their proteins.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	281	 We expressed a tRNASer(CGA) gene in the two non-differentiated cell lines.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene resulted in alterations in tRNA patterns in the two cell lines examined, which enhanced translation of two PV wt L1 mRNAs that contain large numbers of the codons rarely used by mammalian genes (20,33).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Meanwhile, the enhanced expression of the serine UCG GFP variant was probably corresponding to the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene according to a previous statement that correct translation of the UCG codon depends on the tRNASer(CGA) molecule (68).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Although it has been reported that tRNA1Ser(G34) with the anticodon GGA can recognize not only UCC and UCU codons but also UCA and UCG codons (69), but the enhanced expression of the serine AGU GFP variant by the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene is presently not understood.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Moreover, we observed that expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene resulted in a dramatic reduction in the translation of PV HB L1 and UCA serine GFP variant mRNAs in the two cell lines.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Thus, the phenomena observed in the present study may be well explained by two previous statements by Del Tito et al.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	287	 These statements have described how the tRNAs in cells are related to the gene expression at translation levels: (i) if the level of certain tRNAs was low, then one would predict translational difficulties in decoding mRNA species containing large numbers of the rare codons (55) and (ii) the cellular content of tRNA species often correlates positively with the codon bias of mRNAs for the major homologous protein products (70).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Taken together with these statements (55) and our previous studies (20), current data strengthen support for the hypothesis that codon usage matches tRNAs to regulate expression of the target genes in both non-differentiated and differentiated epithelium.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	289	Recently, Walsh and Mohr (71) provided the first evidence that phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor elF4E by the elF4E kinase mnk-1 is crucial for viral protein synthesis and replication of the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) in quiescent cells.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Consistent with their report, phosphorylation of the two translation initiation factors elF4E and elF2 induced by the tRNASer(CGA) gene appears to be required for the translation of the PV wt L1 mRNAs in the two cell lines examined in the present study.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	291	 In contrast to this expectation, however, the phosphorylation of elF4E and elF2 may have selective effects, even reducing the translation of the PV HB L1 and serine UCA GFP mRNAs.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Thus, the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene was able to regulate the phosphorylation levels of both elF4E and elF2, suggesting that another possible mechanism is involved by which the PV L1 genes and serine GFP variants may differentially regulate cap-dependent and cap-independent translation initiation.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	293	Based on our observations, we can conclude that alterations in tRNAs and phosphorylation of elF4E and elF2 caused by the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene are important in modulating expression of the PV L1 genes with different codon usage and serine GFP variants at protein translational levels in the two cell lines.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	294	 However, tRNAs must associate with their cognate aaRSs that catalyze the attachment of a particular amino acid to the 3' end of an appropriate tRNAs containing the anticodon corresponding to that amino acid to generate aminoacyl-tRNAs necessary for protein synthesis.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	295	 But, it is not clear whether the expression and activities of any aaRSs is affected by the tRNASer(CGA) gene.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Detailed studies are therefore necessary to examine how expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene affects the other components of the protein-synthesizing machinery, including the aaRSs and the elongator factors in the two cell lines.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Heterodimers are formed by kissing interaction between the loop bases of two RNA stem to loops, each containing one part of a ribozyme (red and blue boxes).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Only structural rearrangement into a double-stranded extended dimer, but not the kissing complex, leads to the formation of a functional ribozyme.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	12	  Short synthetic RNAs containing the DIS hairpin are able to dimerise spontaneously in vitro, whereas RNAs resembling the retroviral 5' region but lacking this hairpin fail to do so.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In vitro experiments revealed that RNAs corresponding to the whole DIS stem to loop structure are able to form complexes of different stabilities depending on the incubation conditions.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	14	 At 37 degrees C, a less stable complex, formed via base pairing of the complementary loop sequences, is found and corresponds to the kissing complex.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Incubation of these RNAs at 55 degrees C generates a more stable complex (10).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	16	X-ray and NMR structural data is available for subtypes A and B HIV-1 DIS both in the kissing complex as well as in the extended conformation (11 to 13).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The crystal structures obtained from 23mer RNAs that contain the loop as well as the apical stem of the kissing complex of both viral subtypes (MAL and LAI) are virtually identical.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In both cases, the two hairpins are in perfect coaxial alignment, thereby strongly resembling the structure of the extended duplex.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In contrast, the solution structure obtained by NMR reveals a different picture, with the loop closing bases unpaired and the kissing loop helix not in A-form geometry, but distorted and kinked.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Compared with the X-ray structure, the NMR structure shows an entirely different orientation of the 5' unpaired loop purines, suggesting that these bases are involved in non-canonical base pairing with partial stacking (11).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	21	Recently, fluorescence techniques were used to demonstrate the refolding of small DIS-like RNAs in the presence of the HIV nucleocapsid protein NCp7 (14).

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Two different ribozyme systems were used in our study, the hammerhead ribozyme (15) and the synthetic leadzyme, which had been isolated via in vitro selection (16).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Using these two systems, we investigated structural requirements, the influence of temperature and magnesium concentration as well as the impact of the nucleocapsid protein NCp7 (17,18) on extended duplex formation in vitro.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	25	The oligonucleotides were annealed and filled in with T4 DNA polymerase.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	38	In vitro dimerisation assay Both RNAs (H1 and H2 or L1 and L2) were heated separately for 1 min at 90 degrees C and immediately chilled on ice water in order to prevent homodimerisation.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	39	 After 5 min on ice, the RNAs were added to the reaction mixture.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The reaction was then allowed to progress at the indicated temperature and samples were taken at different time points.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	44	 In the case of the leadzyme system, lead acetate (200  microM PbOAc) was added to these samples after the refolding reaction and cleavage was allowed to occur for 30 min at room temperature.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The reaction was stopped by adding RNA loading buffer (7 M urea) and the reaction products were separated by denaturing PAGE (20% polyacrylamide).

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	69	  Extended duplex formation results in specific ribozyme cleavage To determine whether heterodimerisation and subsequent refolding leads to specific ribozyme cleavage, we performed dimerisation assays at 37 and 55 degrees C as shown in Figure 3.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	70	 In vitro transcribed H1 and L1 RNAs, which should be cleaved upon formation of functional ribozymes, were radioactively labelled at their 5' ends.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The observed products correspond to the predicted 54 nt shortened H1 RNA or 6 nt L1 fragment as confirmed by RNAse T1 analysis.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The amount of cleavage product and therefore the efficiency of extended duplex formation are strongly increased when the reaction is carried out at 55 degrees C compared with 37 degrees C as shown for the hammerhead system in Figure 3a (right).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	75	 This is in agreement with previous data that show induction of extended duplex formation of DIS stem to loop RNAs at 55 degrees C (10).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Furthermore, specific ribozyme cleavage is dependent on the presence of both L1 and L2 (Fig.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	103	  Kissing loop interaction is essential for subsequent extended duplex formation If extended duplex formation is dependent on a preceding kissing complex, mutations that reduce or abolish loop complementarity should affect reaction efficiencies.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	104	 We used the previously described GC1 mutant which lacks four of the six palindromic loop nucleotides (H1GC1, H2GC1 and L1GC1, L2GC1 constructs, Fig.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Compared with wild-type loop sequences, GC1 constructs showed strongly reduced reaction efficiencies but were still capable of forming extended duplexes.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	106	 This is observed at 37 degrees C in the presence of 50 mM MgCl2 as shown with the hammerhead system (Fig.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	108	 We also tested combinations of H1 and H2GC1 or H2 and H1GC1 RNAs, which have only two complementary nucleotides in their loops, and the extended dimers of these two combinations contain two unpaired GC pairs.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	109	 These combinations show a strongly reduced capacity to form duplexes compared with the wild type.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	110	 These results indicate that a reduced complementarity is sufficient to induce extended duplex formation, although the stability of the kissing complex influences the efficiency.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	111	To determine whether the complete abolishment of loop to loop complementarity would also abrogate extended duplex formation, the wild-type DIS loop was substituted by six adenosines.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	112	 This construct, termed L1A, is unable to form loop base pairs with L2 RNA.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	124	 L1nsc and L2nsc RNAs contain the non-self complementary loop sequences 5'-AAGAGAGGA-3' and 5'-AACUCUCCA-3', respectively (Fig.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	125	 These non-self-complementary sequences are unable to form homodimers, which might interfere with the dimerisation reaction.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Additionally, these RNAs do not have a central GC pair within the complementary hexanucleotide sequence of the loop, which had previously been suggested to be essential for dimerisation (8,9,21).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	127	 As shown in Figure 5a, extended duplex formation of the nsc constructs is slightly more efficient than that of the MAL constructs.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Therefore, dimerisation can be promoted by kissing complexes formed by sequences other than the wild-type palindromes.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Neither self-complementarity nor the central GC nucleotides are required for the refolding reaction.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	130	Finally, L1MAL and L2nsc RNAs were tested for their ability to form extended duplexes.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	131	 These two constructs are only complementary for two loop bases with four mismatched bases.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	132	 As for the GC1 RNAs, this sequence combination still shows extended duplex formation to some extent although the reaction efficiency is strongly reduced (Fig.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	133	 This demonstrates that the strength of the loop to loop interaction is a key parameter for dimerisation.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	134	Influence of temperature, magnesium concentration and stem length on extended duplex formation As mentioned previously, incubation at 55 degrees C enhances extended duplex formation in various small DIS-like RNAs.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Some of these RNAs with short stems form the extended dimer even at lower temperatures (22).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	136	 This is not unexpected as extended duplex formation requires opening of all DIS stem base pairs (12 in the case of L1 RNA) so they can then undergo intermolecular base pairing.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	137	 This refolding process represents a kinetic barrier that has to be overcome to establish the thermodynamically more stable extended duplex conformation.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	138	 We wanted to test the effect of higher temperature and of a shortened stem on extended duplex formation as well as the influence of the Mg2+ concentration on duplex formation.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	140	 5b) were designed in which 2 bp from the upper DIS stem were deleted.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	141	 These shorter constructs, termed L1s and L2s, were tested at 37 and 55 degrees C for their ability to form the extended duplex.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	142	 At 37 degrees C, both L1/L2 and L1s/L2s show similar behaviour.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	143	 At 55 degrees C we observed a slight but reproducible increase in cleavage efficiency that lies within the error range of the experiments.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Therefore, weakening of the upper stem by only 2 bp is not sufficient to significantly increase the efficiency of extended duplex formation (Fig.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	145	Figure 6a shows that extended duplex formation of L1 and L2 RNAs is enhanced with increasing temperature up to 55 degrees C.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Since at any temperature the known rate constants for ribozyme cleavage far exceed the rates of cleavage observed in our systems, the limiting step appears to be refolding rather than catalysis.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Therefore, temperature-dependent differences in the observed rate constants likely reflect the rate of refolding.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The optimal Mg2+ concentration for hammerhead ribozyme activity is usually 10 mM MgCl2 (23).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	160	 We found that extended duplex formation is strongly enhanced by the presence of high Mg2+ concentrations up to 100 mM MgCl2 (Fig.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Mg2+ might stabilise the kissing complex, which would increase the likelihood of subsequent extended duplex formation.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	162	NCp7 strongly accelerates extended duplex formation It has been suggested that NCp7 plays a critical role in HIV genomic RNA maturation.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Indeed, it has been shown that NCp7 is able to convert low stability retroviral RNA dimers into more stable dimers in vitro (24 to 27).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	164	 NCp7 also catalyses conversion of small DIS-like RNAs ( < 25 nt) into the extended duplex form (14).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	165	 However, the specificity of this interaction is uncertain since NCp7 also acts as a general nucleic acid chaperone.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	166	 It has been shown to posses nucleic acid annealing and strand exchange activity in vitro (28,29), RNA chaperone activity in vivo (30) and it also accelerates cleavage of the hammerhead ribozyme (19).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	167	We set out to test whether the NCp7 protein would also enhance extended duplex formation in our system.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	168	 To discriminate between general RNA to RNA annealing activity and a more specific action we used L1 and L2 RNAs but also the combination L1A and L2, which completely lacks loop complementarity.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	169	 As shown in Figure 6c, NCp7 strongly increases extended duplex formation between L1 and L2 RNAs.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Sixty percent of the RNAs are refolded after only 5 min at 37 degrees C compared with 10% in the absence of NCp7 (Fig.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	171	 6c, compare triangles and squares).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The reaction levels off to reach 70% completion after 30 min.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	173	 L1A/L2 RNAs, which lack loop complementarity and do not show any extended duplex formation at 55 degrees C in the absence of NCp7, do react in the presence of NCp7.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	174	 We conclude that NCp7 strongly enhances specific extended duplex formation in our system, but to some extent also of RNAs without loop complementarity via its general nucleic acid structure destabilising activity.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	175	Formation of the active ribozyme after refolding of the hairpins into the extended duplex clearly demonstrated the double-stranded nature of the extended dimers.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Our results further confirm the current model of HIV-1 DIS dimerisation involving refolding of the kissing complex with melting of the stems into a partially double-stranded dimer and rule out a hypothetical mechanism for extended duplex formation involving symmetric cleavage of both chains and subsequent religation (13).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	177	 From crystal structure data, it was found that the 2' OH group of the second purine residue 5' to the complementary sequence is in favourable position for an in line attack on the neighbouring 3' phosphate.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	178	 A mechanism involving a nucleophilic attack leading to strand scission, followed by a dangling movement of this base and cross religation of both RNAs was proposed.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Such a mechanism would join both DIS stem to loop RNAs within their loop regions keeping the initial stems intact.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	180	 If this were true, both parts of the ribozyme would remain separated from each other and would be unable to form a functional ribozyme.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Our observation that extended duplex formation leads indeed to ribozyme cleavage therefore strongly supports the refolding model with the melting of the stems.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	182	We further show that formation of a kissing complex through interaction of complementary loop nucleotides is an essential prerequisite for extended duplex formation.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	183	 In contrast to previous reports investigating viral RNA dimerisation in vitro, we found that neither self-complementarity nor the central GC pairs within the palindrome are essential for refolding.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	184	 It has been suggested that the central GC pairs are essential for efficient dimerisation in vitro possibly through the involvement in non-canonical base pair interactions by forming a potential nucleation point of the dimer (8,9,21).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Our results are in accordance with in vitro selection data that show that this dinucleotide favours dimerisation but is not essential (31,32).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Self-complementarity of the loops is evidently required for viral RNA dimerisation of homologous strands, but apparently not for the refolding process per se.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	187	 These observations are particularly interesting given the fact that only two different loop sequences have been found in HIV-1 isolates, raising the question on the nature of the selective pressure for these two sequences since they can be substituted by other sequences for extended duplex formation in vitro.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	188	 It has been shown that the entire HIV 5' leader RNA can adopt two different conformations, suggesting that sequence conservation might reflect the need to preserve these two structures (33).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	189	Extended duplex formation was still possible when only partially complementary sequences or sequences with strongly reduced loop complementarity were used.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	190	 This suggests that loop to loop interaction through partial base pairing itself is sufficient for extended duplex formation at 55 degrees C, although full complementarity, as is the case for wild-type loop sequences, strongly enhances the efficiency of the refolding process.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Assuming that reduction of loop complementarity does not affect refolding itself but only reduces kissing complex stability, then the previous findings of Berkhout and van Wamel (5) might be explained.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	192	 These authors reported strongly reduced infectivity when two GC pairs were deleted from the palindrome of HIV-1 LAI subtype; however, purified virions still contained stable dimeric RNA.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Reduced stability of the kissing complex might lead to a strong impairment of the packaging efficiency, but any loose dimers that happened to be encapsidated were still able to refold, forming stable dimers.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	194	The study on the influence of external parameters on the refolding process revealed that its efficiency is temperature dependent, suggesting that refolding proceeds by the destabilisation of the stems.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Additionally, it could be shown that the presence of magnesium ions enhances extended duplex formation although it is not essential for this process.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	196	 High magnesium concentrations accelerated the reaction in a way that very efficient extended duplex formation could already be observed at 37 degrees C.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	197	 This could be explained by a more efficient stabilisation of the kissing complex than that of the stems.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Indeed, such a strong stabilisation of the kissing complex compared with the stem is observed in the presence of magnesium ions in UV melting experiments (A.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	200	Transition from a kissing complex to an extended duplex in vitro is clearly observed at physiological temperatures in the presence of the viral nucleocapsid protein NCp7.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	201	 This small basic 55 amino acid long highly conserved RNA binding protein was reported to have general RNA chaperone activity (19,28).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	202	 In vivo experiments demonstrated that a viral protease-dependent maturation resulting in the cleavage of the gag precursor to generate nucleocapsid protein is accompanied by conversion of the dimeric RNA particles into a more heat stable dimer (24,34).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Our data show that NCp7-induced extended duplex formation is extremely efficient compared with the temperature-induced refolding.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The amount of extended duplex formed by constructs lacking loop complementarity can be explained by the general RNA to RNA annealing activity of NCp7 (19).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	205	 This might propose a model for how extended duplex formation is promoted by NCp7.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	206	 It is conceivable that NCp7 induces kissing complex formation by its RNA to RNA annealing activity and/or by its helix destabilising activity (29).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The kissing interaction might provide a stable and specific interaction surface as a starting point for an efficient refolding.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	208	 In contrast, it might be the temporal availability and spatial location of NCp7 during the viral maturation cycle that allows it to use its general nucleic acid refolding activity in a specific manner.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	209	 However, it should be mentioned that it is currently unclear how the data on DIS-mediated dimerisation obtained in vitro translate to the in vivo situation, given that there is no direct evidence that the mature form of the dimer inside the viral particle is an extended duplex.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	210	RNA loop to loop interactions are involved in a variety of biological processes and some of these interactions are accompanied by structural rearrangements leading to more stable structures (reviewed in 20).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	211	 It is often difficult to distinguish between the two alternative conformations.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Since the sequence requirements of the leadzyme are relatively small, derivates from this system could be easily used to investigate whether refolding follows RNA loop to loop interactions in other biological contexts such as antisense regulation, or bicoid mRNA localisation.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	1	 Lipoyl Domain-based Mechanism for the Integrated Feedback Control of the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex by Enhancement of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase Activity (*).
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	2	(Received for publication, April 10, 1995; and in revised form, August 18, 1995).
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	3	To conserve carbohydrate reserves, the reaction of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) must be down-regulated when the citric acid cycle is provided sufficient acetyl-CoA.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	4	 PDC activity is reduced primarily through increased phosphorylation of its pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component due to E1 kinase activity being markedly enhanced by elevated intramitochondrial NADH:NAD and acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	5	 A mechanism is evaluated in which enhanced kinase activity is facilitated by the build-up of the reduced and acetylated forms of the lipoyl moieties of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component through using NADH and acetyl-CoA in the reverse of the downstream reactions of the complex.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Using a peptide substrate, kinase activity was stimulated by these products, ruling out the possibility kinase activity is increased due to changes in the reaction state of its substrate, E1 (thiamin pyrophosphate).
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Each E2 subunit contains two lipoyl domains, an NH-terminal (L1) and the inward lipoyl domain (L2), which were individually produced in fully lipoylated forms by recombinant techniques.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Although reduction and acetylation of the L1 domain or free lipoamide increased kinase activity, those modifications of the lipoate of the kinase-binding L2 domain gave much greater enhancements of kinase activity.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The large stimulation of the kinase generated by acetyl-CoA only occurred upon addition of the transacetylase-catalyzing (lipoyl domain-free) inner core portion of E2 plus a reduced lipoate source, affirming that acetylation of this prosthetic group is an essential mechanistic step for acetyl-CoA enhancing kinase activity.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Similarly, the lesser stimulation of kinase activity by just NADH required a lipoate source, supporting the need for lipoate reduction by E3 catalysis.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	11	Complete enzymatic delipoylation of PDC, the E2-kinase subcomplex, or recombinant L2 abolished the stimulatory effects of NADH and acetyl-CoA.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Retention of a small portion of PDC lipoates lowered kinase activity but allowed stimulation of this residual kinase activity by these products.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Reintroduction of lipoyl moieties, using lipoyl protein ligase, restored the capacity of the E2 core to support high kinase activity along with stimulation of that activity up to 3-fold by NADH and acetyl-CoA.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	14	 As suggested by those results, the enhancement of kinase activity is very responsive to reductive acetylation with a half-maximal stimulation achieved with 20% of free L2 acetylated and, from an analysis of previous results, with acetylation of only 3-6 of the 60 L2 domains in intact PDC.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Based on these findings, we suggest that kinase stimulation results from modification of the lipoate of an L2 domain that becomes specifically engaged in binding the kinase.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In conclusion, kinase activity is attenuated through a substantial range in response to modest changes in the proportion of oxidized, reduced, and acetylated lipoyl moieties of the L2 domain of E2 produced by fluctuations in the NADH:NAD and acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios as translated by the rapid and reversible E3 and E2 reactions.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	17	In mammalian cells, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) ()controls the oxidative utilization of glucose(1) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Flux through this reaction results in a net depletion of body carbohydrate reserves.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The activity of PDC must be reduced when fatty acids or ketone bodies are being preferentially used to provide 2-carbon units for oxidative energy production by citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation systems, a routine situation in many organs.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Furthermore, under conditions of starvation or diabetes, the activity of PDC is reduced to a minimal level to conserve carbohydrates essential for the brain and other specialized tissues/organs.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	21	 To achieve its critical role in cellular fuel conservation, the PDC reaction is controlled primarily by a highly regulated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle which is carried out by dedicated kinase and phosphatase components.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component inactivates the complex and dephosphorylation reactivates the complex.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	23	Shortly after PDC was shown to be regulated by this interconversion (2) , the capacity of fatty acids and ketone bodies to promote inactivation of PDC was demonstrated in intact tissues (3, 4) and in studies with intact mitochondria(5, 6) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Studies with purified complex (7, 8, 9) and isolated mitochondria (10, 11, 12) found that increases of the PDC reaction products promote an increase in the proportion of PDC in the phosphorylated (inactive) state.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	25	 With purified complex, the activity of the kinase is greatly enhanced upon elevation of the NADH:NAD ratio and the acetyl-CoA:CoA ratio along with a reciprocal reduction in phosphatase activity as the NADH:NAD ratio is elevated(7) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	26	Accordingly, the E1a kinase has a crucial role wherein it throttles down PDC activity in response to increases in the mitochondrial acetylation and reduction potentials.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Not only are NADH and acetyl-CoA produced during mitochondrial oxidation of all fuels, they are direct products of the PDC reaction.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This laboratory presented evidence that this control of kinase activity initially involves these product to substrate ratios being translated by competitive utilization in the downstream reactions of the complex which, in turn, adjusts the fraction of the complex's lipoyl prosthetic groups in the oxidized versus reduced versus acetylated forms(13, 14, 15, 16, 17) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Specifically, our mechanism proposes that kinase down-regulates PDC activity due to NADH reacting in the reverse of the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) reaction and acetyl-CoA reacting in the reverse of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) reaction.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Typically a 60-80% enhancement in kinase activity occurs upon lipoate reduction and up to a 3-fold enhancement following lipoate acetylation.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The potential for understanding the molecular basis of this control has greatly improved with new insights into the structure of E2 subunits and the unusual nature of the association of the kinase with E2.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	32	The E2 subunits of mammalian PDC have four domains connected by relatively large (2-3 kDa) and highly mobile linker regions Fig.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Sixty COOH-terminal inner domains (E2) associate to form a dodecahedral inner core which catalyzes the transacetylation reaction.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Each inner domain is connected to 3 globular domains by linker or hinge regions.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The globular domains consist of two 10-kDa lipoyl domains (E2 and E2, or L1 and L2) and an E1-binding domain (E2) located between the inner core and the lipoyl domain region.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	41	 PDC kinase binds to the lipoyl domain region of E2 through an association that requires the lipoyl prosthetic group(24, 25, 26) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Using lipoylated and delipoylated forms of recombinant L1 and L2 of human PDC-E2(27) , the kinase was shown to bind preferentially to the lipoylated L2 (Fig.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The E1a kinase was also shown to interchange rapidly between L2 structures(26) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	44	 To account for tight binding and rapid interchange, a dynamic ``hand over hand'' mechanism is proposed in which a dimeric kinase alternates between being bound to one and two L2 domains.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	45	 This interchange and catalytic function of the kinase exert their combined effects in the limited space at the surface of the complex where the a kinase molecule and many E1 components are tightly bound to the mobile outer domains of E2.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The capacity of continuously bound kinase to phosphorylate bound E1 components more rapidly than free kinase can phosphorylate free E1 is termed E2-activated kinase function.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	47	The aim of this work is to determine the compulsory components, domains, and catalytic processes involved in kinase stimulation by NADH and acetyl-CoA, and to evaluate the relative capacities of the recombinant L1 and L2 in mediating the stimulation of kinase in the presence or absence of E2-activated kinase function.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	48	 We have found that stimulation occurs with a peptide substrate of the kinase; that a lipoyl source must be available for catalytic reduction by E3 or acetylation by E2; that the L2 lipoyl domain is much more effective in mediating kinase stimulation than the L1 domain; and that the kinase is remarkably sensitive to the level of acetylation of L2.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Support for this stimulation occurring via reductive-acetylation of lipoyl moieties stems from the findings that adding low levels of pyruvate to TPP-containing PDC generates an increased kinase activity equivalent to that with NADH plus acetyl-CoA and that pyruvate is principally used in the reductive acetylation of oxidized lipoyl groups(13, 14, 15) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	150	 This mechanism for kinase stimulation predicts some TPP bound to E1 and a lipoyl domain source are required.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	277	 In their studies with purified porcine heart PDC, no stimulation by acetyl-CoA beyond that of NADH was detected, and they speculated that enhanced kinase activity might be due to the removal of an inhibition of kinase activity caused by the absence of an interaction between oxidized lipoate and the E1 substrate (8, 9) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Although not the correct mechanism and detection of an effect of acetyl-CoA required use of higher K concentration (see below), the suggestion of a role for changes in the intermediate status of lipoyl groups was insightful as was their linking of the stimulatory effect of pyruvate (41) to the effect of products(9) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	279	 This laboratory presented the initial and much subsequent evidence that reduction and acetylation of lipoyl prosthetic groups of PDC constituted essential steps in the operation of a sensitive signal translation process whereby increases in the NADH:NAD and acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios markedly enhance kinase activity(13, 14, 15, 16, 17) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	280	 However, elucidation of the minimal requirements for the operation of this control could be accomplished only following a greatly enhanced understanding of the organization of the complex, the preparation of individual lipoyl domains of PDC-E2, and the availability of lipoamidase and lipoyl protein ligase, combined with the selective use of peptide substrate and free forms of lipoamide.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	281	Using these tools, we have found that the marked enhancement of kinase activity by acetyl-CoA requires a lipoate source and its reduction, the catalytic domain of E2, and a peptide substrate.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	282	 These requirements conclusively support a change in the kinase mediated by catalytically forming acetyl-dihydrolipoate.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Accumulation of this intermediate explains the similarly strong stimulation of kinase activity by low pyruvate via E1(TPP) catalysis.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	284	 The direct stimulation by dihydrolipoamide, its capacity to replace NADH in potentiating acetyl-CoA stimulation, and the complete lack of an effect of NADH on kinase activity in the absence of a lipoate source strongly favor NADH boosting kinase activity through its use in the E3 reaction.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	285	 We have established that this intervention is abolished by complete removal of lipoates from intact E2 subunits or lipoyl domains.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Of particular importance for understanding the operation and regulation of the kinase is our finding that the kinase-binding L2 domain is much more effective than E2's L1 domain or lipoamide in mediating kinase stimulation.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	287	 The 3-fold increase in kinase activity generated by reductive acetylation of recombinant L2 is comparable to the change in kinase activity produced by acetylation of lipoyl moieties in the intact complex.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	289	 At higher levels L1 inhibits kinase activity(26) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Thus, the L2 domain must have structural features that facilitate its dedicated roles in binding the kinase, producing enhanced E1 phosphorylation within the confines of the complex, and further increasing kinase activity upon reduction and acetylation of its lipoyl group.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	291	 This raises the question of the linkage between these L2-supported actions of the kinase.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	292	Detaching lipoates of the E2 core removes the capacity of the E2 core to give a severalfold increase in E1 phosphorylation(24) .

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	294	 It is significant that a lipoamidase treatment of PDC, which left only a few lipoates and caused close to full loss of this E2-enhanced kinase function, still allowed marked stimulation of the residual kinase activity upon acetylation of those few domains retaining lipoyl groups (PDC series in Fig.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	295	 This result forcefully suggests that the kinase has moved to the limited number of lipoylated L2 domains and, furthermore, that their acetylation (during a short-lived dissociation and reassociation of the kinase) facilitated kinase stimulation.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Based on this continued stimulation when very few E2 subunits retain lipoate, we hypothesize that maximal effector stimulation is mediated by an allosteric effect induced by a reductively acetylated L2 domain that becomes engaged in binding of the kinase (i.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	300	 In the absence of a lipoyl domain source, kinase phosphorylation of E1 is not stimulated at low pyruvate ((17) , miniprint section); and here we show that TPP and a lipoyl domain source are needed to achieve pyruvate stimulation.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	301	 These findings raise the question as to whether the E1 reaction or the downstream (E2,E3) reactions determine the relative proportion of lipoates in the oxidized, reduced and acetylated forms in the complex.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Since E1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step(35, 36) , under most metabolic conditions, this distribution should be determined by the NADH:NAD and the acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios and kinase activity should primarily respond to their fluctuation.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	311	 While these probably contribute to a fine tuning role on a small portion of active PDC, enhanced phosphorylation should effectively throttle down PDC activity before onset of these extremes.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	312	A priori, the lesser enhancement of kinase activity by just the conversion of lipoates from the oxidized to the reduced form could involve either removal of an inhibitory interaction of oxidized lipoates, an enhancement of kinase activity by gain of a positive allosteric interaction of the reduced form, or a change in the thiol disulfide state of a kinase subunit.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Studies with E2-bound kinase found that the kinase is sensitive to thiol reagents(13, 52) , effects probably due to changes in the oxidation-reduction state of the lipoate of L2 domains.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Although there is a small increase in alkylation of cysteines of the K1 subunit following treatment of E2Xkinase-E3 with NADH, this was not rapidly reversed by excess NAD which opposes kinase stimulation.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	315	 ()Thus, a mediator role for changes in the thiol-disulfide status of the kinase is not indicated.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Our model proposes that a change from the kinase binding to one or two L2 containing only oxidized lipoate (nonstimulated K state) to interacting with an L2 containing a reduced or an acetylated lipoate results in the modified lipoates allosterically inducing conformational changes that generate the progressively more active K* or K** states, respectively.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	321	Consistent with stimulation occurring at low ratios of acetyl-CoA to CoA, half-maximal and near-maximal stimulation of kinase associated with the intact bovine kidney PDC are achieved with only 7-10 and 22-26 acetyl groups incorporated, respectively, per PDC(15, 16, 17) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	322	 With the recent knowledge that there are 3 lipoyl domains, two on E2 and one on the E3-binding protein giving a total of at least 126 lipoates per E2, ()it seems likely that no more than 12 and possibly as few as 7 acetyl groups are incorporated per PDC into the kinase-binding L2 domain for near-maximal stimulation, and as few as 3 and no more than 6 are incorporated for half-maximal stimulation.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	323	 ()This constitutes a highly responsive regulatory mechanism in which the kinase must preferentially interact with acetylated L2 and suggests that full stimulation may result from only one subunit of a kinase dimer interacting with a reductively acetylated L2 domain.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Consistent with this prospect, half-maximal stimulation occurred with free L2 when only 20% of the L2 are acetylated.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Although a much higher portion was found than estimated (above) for the intact complex, very different conditions are operative at the outer surface of the complex where lipoyl domains are concentrated at 1 mM, making the localized L2 level at least 50-fold higher than the highest level of free L2 used in the present work.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Interaction of the kinase with acetylated-L2 would be aided by steady state turnover in the overall PDC reaction rapidly changing the location of acetyl groups within the multienzyme cluster.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Kinase shuffling between L2 domains may also contribute, but this is needed, regardless, since acetylation by acetyl-CoA requires an unhindered lipoate(50, 51) , and the kinase must interact after L2 acetylation.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	328	 We conclude that increased reductive-acetylation is very effective in activating kinase due to this preferred interaction of acetylated L2 altering the structure of the kinase and thereby increasing kinase activity (Fig.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	329	In being stimulated, kinase kinetic properties must fundamentally change since stimulation occurs over a wide range of rates (e.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Another property of the kinase that changes with increasing K ion is that ADP inhibition markedly increases(55) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	334	 A potential mechanism is that interaction of the kinase with an L2 domain containing an acetyl-dihydrolipoate leads to a conformational change in the kinase that speeds up ADP dissociation, which is probably the rate-limiting step in the kinase reaction at elevated (physiological) K levels.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Consistent with that prospect are the observation that acetylation causes a greater stimulation of ADP-inhibited kinase (13) and the evidence that kinase-ADP is a prominent reaction intermediate, since pyruvate effectively inhibits by binding to the kinase-ADP in the absence of free ADP(56) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	336	 For this mechanism to be correct, it must operate in conjunction with the slow rate of phosphorylation of peptide substrate, a particularly useful system for testing this mechanism.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	337	 Further studies will be needed to define the structural changes that attenuate the kinase through changes in L2's lipoyl group and to determine how the K1 and K2 subunits of the kinase vary in their regulatory control.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	338	In conclusion, our results strongly support E3-catalyzed reduction and E2-catalyzed acetylation of lipoyl moiety of the kinase binding inner (L2) domain of E2 mediating a marked enhancement in kinase activity.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	339	 The effectiveness in intact PDC of acetylating a low proportion of L2 domains in enhancing the phosphorylation of many bound E1 by a single tightly bound kinase molecule is probably accomplished by inter-L2 domain movement of the kinase combined with a stronger interaction of the kinase with acetylated L2 domains.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	363	 As acetylation is increased from a level expected to give primarily monoacetylated lipoates (some reduced and some biacetylated) to a level expected to give a much higher proportion of biacetylated lipoates, there is a concomitant decrease in the number of sites that can be alkylated (by N-[C]ethylmaleimide) supporting formation of biacetyl-lipoates (S.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	366	(42) determined that there are only 6 E3BP in mammalian PDC but that should be reinvestigated.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	367	()Even at fairly low levels of acetylation, both E2 and E3BP are acetylated(42) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	368	 Furthermore, analysis by autoradiography of the acetylation of elastase-generated polypeptides of L1 and L2, that were identified on blots by L1- and L2-specific monoclonal antibodies(27) , demonstrated that both lipoyl domains of E2 are acetylated well with low levels of acetylation (S.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	369	 There appeared to be a somewhat higher acetylation of L2 but the complex distribution of L1- and L2-derived polypeptides made that judgment uncertain.

0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	204	 In this study, we have carried out a structure-based mutagenesis of six residues, namely Gln-37, Tyr-67, Arg-68, Asp-83, Ile-123, and Ser-145, which are predominantly involved in inter-subunit interactions.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Except for S145A, all of the other mutant rCPs failed to assemble into T = 3 capsids, although they were found to be soluble (Fig.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Furthermore, these mutant proteins are partially folded, as evidenced by the following: (i) gel filtration elution behavior (Fig.

0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Thus, the mutation of residues involved in extensive inter-subunit interactions affect both the subunit folding and particle assembly of PhMV.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	215	 A detailed analysis of the position of the residues mutated and the probable consequence of the mutation on the folding and assembly is presented below.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	216	Gln-37 is conserved in all of the tymoviruses and is present at hydrogen-bonding distance to the conserved glycines 113 and 114 and leucine 109, respectively, at the A-A5 interface (Fig.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Gln-37 also interacts with Gly-113 and Leu-109 at B5-C interface and with Asn-188 at C-C2 contacts (Fig.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	218	 This residue does not seem to interact with any of the residues within the subunit.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The mutation of Gln-37 to Glu should therefore have disrupted only the inter-subunit interactions.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Replacement of Gln with Glu in the structure using the molecular modeling software program "O" showed that there are no short contacts and also that all the interactions of Gln-37 can be retained by Glu.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	221	 However, it introduces a negative charge in the dense interface of subunits.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The results presented here demonstrate that the mutation of Gln-37, which is involved in multiple inter-subunit interactions, also affects the proper folding of the subunit.

0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	244	 This residue does not have any obvious intra-subunit interactions.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The replacement of Arg with Gln can be done without short contact within the same subunit.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	246	 However, its mutation to Gln led to the partially folded and assembly-incompetent protein.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	247	 These results further support the observation that the mutation of residues involved in multiple inter-subunit interactions disrupts subunit folding and particle assembly.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Even here, the uncompensated negative charge might interfere in the folding of the protein.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	249	Asp-83 and Ile-123, although not conserved among all tymoviruses, are involved in extensive interactions with residues from the other subunits (Fig.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	250	 The mutation of these two residues to alanine also led to the partially folded proteins that were assembly-incompetent.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	251	Tyr-67 is also conserved across the tymovirus group.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	252	 It is involved not only in inter-subunit interactions at C-C2 and B5-A, but also in intra-subunit hydrogen-bonding interactions.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Its mutation to alanine disrupts the hydrogen-bonding interaction at the quasi-2-fold axis.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	254	 This creates a cavity in the vicinity of residues Leu-34, Leu-63, Leu-180, and Ile-32.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	255	 This may have a destabilizing effect on the same subunit, which could hinder proper folding of the subunit.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Hence, its mutation to Ala led to the misfolding of the subunits and the consequent arrest of assembly.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	257	Interestingly, the tertiary structure of the partially folded mutant proteins is similar to that of the rCP capsids (Figs.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	258	 The single tryptophan residue, Trp-96, is located inside the -barrel, and its mutation led to soluble aggregates defective in folding and assembly (8).
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Furthermore, this Trp is not an interfacial residue.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Therefore, it is possible that the partially folded mutant rCPs and the wild type rCP have similar accessibility to this tryptophan.

0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	4	It is generally agreed that HSV capsids acquire their final tegument and envelope in the cytoplasm.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	5	 However, the molecular mechanism of HSV-1 envelopment in the cytoplasm is poorly characterized.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	6	 During infection, viral membrane glycoproteins are expressed and traffic via cytoplasmic organelles to the cell surface.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Several lines of evidence suggest that the cytosolic domains of these glycoproteins may provide a platform for tegument assembly and recruitment of capsids followed by envelopment (Mettenleiter, 2002).
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In a recent study, a double mutant of pseudorabies virus (PrV) lacking viral glycoproteins gM and gE (or gM and the cytoplasmic tail of gE) showed a failure in envelopment, instead accumulating cytoplasmic nucleocapsids immersed in a dense layer of tegument (Brack et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Following single deletion of either glycoprotein, the production of infectious virions was not affected, suggesting that the cytoplasmic tails of gE and gM act in a redundant fashion during assembly, most likely interacting with the tegument proteins and, indirectly, with the surface of nucleocapsids.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In HSV-1, simultaneous deletion of the same two glycoproteins did not dramatically affect production of infectious virions (Browne et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	11	, 2004), although simultaneous deletion of gD and gE resulted in a striking defect in particle assembly (Farnsworth et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This apparent redundancy makes analysis of specific glycoprotein to tegument interactions difficult to perform in vivo.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	13	 To overcome this obstacle, we developed a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein-binding assay to investigate the interaction between envelope glycoprotein tails and tegument partners in vitro.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This approach has previously been used to demonstrate the interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of glycoprotein H (gH) and the tegument component VP16 (Gross et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In the current study, we focused on analysing the tail of the glycoprotein D (gD) because it is a highly abundant component of the envelope (Spear  and  Roizman, 1972) with a short cytoplasmic tail of 30 amino acid residues that can easily be manipulated in mutagenesis studies.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Moreover, it has been shown to play a key, albeit redundant, role in assembly (Farnsworth et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Additionally, Pomeranz  and  Blaho (1999) reported that gD co-localizes with at least one tegument protein, VP22, during infection.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	18	We prepared GST fusion proteins that contained the cytoplasmic tail of gD or mutants thereof at their carboxy terminus.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Following binding of the GST fusion proteins to glutathione to Sepharose beads and incubation with HSV-infected cell extracts, these fusion proteins were tested for their ability to interact with tegument proteins.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Here we report that the cytoplasmic tail of gD bound to the tegument protein VP22 in a manner that was independent of other viral polypeptides.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Additionally, our results indicated that VP22 may be one of the tegument components that mediate the interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of gD and the HSV capsid.

0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The level of capsid binding seen for the mutant gDR5K6 was similar to the background binding seen for the negative control of GST.

0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Our results showed that the gD tail specifically bound the tegument protein VP22 but did not interact with the abundant cellular protein -tubulin nor with the capsid scaffold proteins ICP35 and Pra.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the interaction between gD and VP22 could be detected in infected cells.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Additionally, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the gD tail identified two amino acid residues, arginine and lysine (from the amino-terminal end of the tail) at positions 5 and 6, respectively, that were critical for VP22 binding.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	206	Since VP22 and VP16 form a complex (Elliott et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	207	, 1995) and we observed VP16 binding to the gD tail, we were interested to test whether VP22 bound the gD tail directly or via VP16 or other viral proteins.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Therefore, we synthesized 35S-labelled VP22 using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro transcription/translation system and tested its ability to bind the gD tail.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	209	 We found that in vitro-translated VP22 did bind specifically to the gD tail, showing that this binding was independent of other viral polypeptides.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	210	Under our conditions we also observed capsid binding to the gD tail.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	211	 This binding was saturable, unlike the low level of binding seen with GST alone.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	212	 We speculated that capsid binding to the gD tail was mediated by tegument components present in the crude capsid preparation.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Our results showed that the gD mutant tail gDR5K6 that failed to bind VP22 also failed to bind capsids.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	214	 This suggested that VP22 was mediating capsid to tail interactions.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	215	 However, it is also possible that other tegument proteins mediate binding of capsids to the gD tail, utilizing the same residues as VP22.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Although VP16 is present on these capsids (Fig.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	217	 5a) and can bind to the gH tail (Gross et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	218	, 2003), it appeared unable to tether capsids to the gH tail (Fig.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Additionally, we observed that VP16 was capable of binding to the gD mutant tail gDR5K6, which does not bind capsids (data not shown).
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	220	 This also suggested that VP16 was not involved in capsid to tail interactions under these conditions.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	221	The association between VP22 and gD may be one of many interactions between glycoprotein tails and tegument proteins that facilitate the budding of capsids into organelles and the incorporation of tegument/glycoproteins into nascent virions.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	222	 In HSV-1, deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of gD had relatively little effect on normal virus production (Feenstra et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	223	 However, simultaneous deletion of gD and gE showed elimination of cytoplasmic envelopment and accumulation of large numbers of unenveloped nucleocapsids within a dense layer of tegument in the cytoplasm (Farnsworth et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	224	, 2003), indicating that gD and gE may share overlapping roles in cytoplasmic envelopment.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Our data suggest that at least one of these roles may be in VP22 recruitment and predict that the cytoplasmic tail of gE may also bind VP22.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Interestingly, Farnsworth et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	227	 (2003) reported that the cytoplasmic tail of gE, when fused to GST, was indeed able to bind VP22.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Thus, gD and gE may act in a redundant manner to incorporate VP22 into the newly forming virions.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Alternatively, it could be argued that VP22 serves to gather gD and gE to the sites of capsid to envelope interaction.

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	3	The reason why Lhc proteins require a number of xanthophyll species while reaction center proteins only require -carotene is not completely understood; these carotenoid species have very similar physico-chemical properties, enabling, in each case, efficient light harvesting, triplet quenching, and singlet oxygen scavenging (11).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Nonetheless, the pigment composition is one of the most conserved traits in higher plants, suggesting a specific function for each carotenoid species.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The best known xanthophyll binding protein is the major light harvesting complex of Photosystem II (LHCII) for which four distinct binding sites have been reported to be bound into distinct domains of the protein.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Sites L1 and L2 intersect the helix A/helix B cross-domain in the center of the Lhc structure (12).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	7	 L1 is selective for lutein, whereas L2 can also bind violaxanthin (13).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Site N1 is highly selective for neoxanthin and is located within the C helix domain of LHCII (14).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Finally, a low affinity binding site has been named V1 after its major ligand (violaxanthin) in low light conditions (15, 16).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Each binding site was shown to play a distinct functional role; structure stabilization and Chl a triplet quenching are provided by lutein in site L1 only (10, 17).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Site V1 is not involved in singlet nor in triplet energy transfer and was suggested to accommodate a pool of readily available substrate molecules for the violaxanthin deepoxydase enzyme (16), whose product, zeaxanthin, can then be bound to the allosteric site L2 (18).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Site N1 is active in light harvesting and singlet oxygen scavenging (13) and stabilizes the long lifetime conformation of LHCII (19).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	13	Despite the high homology in the transmembrane regions, which suggests a similar folding, the number of xanthophyll binding sites, their selectivity, and their occupancy in the structure seem to be different in each Lhc gene product.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Considering the different roles of individual sites and the complexity of the Lhc multigene protein family, it is possible that the function of individual Lhc gene products is largely determined by the presence/absence of individual xanthophyll sites and by their selectivity and strength.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	15	Primary sequence analysis of structural determinants for xanthophyll binding sites has been less successful than in the case of Chl binding sites, possibly due to the contribution of neighbor Chls rather than of amino acid side chains, to the formation of binding pocket for xanthophylls (13, 14).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Nevertheless, four short sequences, located in the hydrophilic domains and consisting into four hydrophobic amino acids and a charged residue, could be involved in the binding by forming a hydrophobic pocket hosting xanthophylls end-rings, whereas the charged side chain was supposed to interact with oxygenated ring substituents (20).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Alternatively, binding might be performed by interactions between hydrophobic residues with the polyene chain located deeply in the membrane as observed in the bacterial LH2 complex (21).

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	174	 We approached the problem by using recombinant pigment-protein complexes in which either the carotenoid complement was biochemically modified or the apoprotein was engineered at the putative carotenoid binding sites.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	175	How Many Carotenoids Are Bound to CP29? The data presented clearly indicate that both native and recombinant CP29 tightly bind two carotenoids per polypeptide.

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	177	 This is also supported by the analysis of CP29 purified from different plant sources, showing variations in the ratio between the xanthophylls (5, 35, 36).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	178	Reconstitution experiments in the presence of either one xanthophyll species or a combination of two xanthophyll species indicate that lutein, violaxanthin, and zeaxanthin can enter both binding sites, although with different affinity and binding strength.

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	194	 This implies that when a complex contains one molecule of neoxanthin and one molecule of another xanthophyll, the latter has to be located on site L1.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	195	 This allows studying the role played by individual xanthophylls in the two sites.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	196	We applied this model to the stability measurements to determine the influence of different xanthophylls in the L1 and L2 sites.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	197	 We considered the denaturation temperature of CP29-L, CP29-V, CP29-NV, CP29-NL, and CP29-VL, and we resolved a system of five equations with five variables.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This calculation does not take into account the contribution of Chls to the stability since the Chl content of all the samples was identical.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	199	The calculation yields a value of 50.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	200	3  degrees C for the contribution of lutein in site L1 to the stability of the protein, whereas the same xanthophyll contributed only for 3.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	201	2  degrees C when located in site L2.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	202	 For violaxanthin the corresponding values were respectively 42.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	203	2  degrees C (for L2), whereas neoxanthin in site L2 contributes for 14.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	204	 As an example, we can calculate the stability of CP29-control (62.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	205	33  degrees C) and verify that it matches with the measured denaturation temperature (64  degrees C) of the CP29-control complex.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The good match indicates the independence of all variables (e.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	207	 lutein in L1 site stabilizes the complex in the same way independently from which xanthophyll is present in site L2).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The results confirm that site L1 is the most important in Lhc protein stabilization, as previously assessed in Lhcb1 (10), and lutein in this site seems to confer the highest stability to the complex.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Lutein in the L2 site has almost no effect on the stability, whereas the occupancy of this site by violaxanthin or, even better, by neoxanthin increases the temperature of denaturation.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	210	Energy Transfer The excitation energy transfer efficiency from individual binding sites has been determined by analyzing the absorption and excitation spectra in terms of the spectral contribution of individual pigments.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	211	 The possibility of comparing samples, which differ only for the carotenoid composition, allowed quantitative information to be obtained from this analysis.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	212	 It is worth mentioning that all samples were fully equilibrated with the only partial exception of CP29-Za and CP29-Zb, which showed a small emission contribution from Chl b fluorescence at 660 nm when the complex was excited at 475 nm.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	213	Again, we applied the model used for the stability analysis (see "Stability").
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	214	 It has been demonstrated that binding to either one or the other of the two sites yields into a different modulation of the S2 energy level of the xanthophylls (4).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	215	 This indicates that the same xanthophyll in the two sites is spectroscopically different.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	216	 In agreement, two distinct values for the red-most peak were found for both lutein and violaxanthin, corresponding to the absorption in the L1 and L2 sites.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	217	 In contrast, a single neoxanthin spectral form was needed for the best fit of both absorption and fluorescence excitation spectra consisting with its exclusive binding to the L2 site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Considering that in the samples containing neoxanthin, violaxanthin and lutein can only be located in the L1 site, it is possible to associate the two absorptions at site L1 or L2 based on the pigment composition of the samples.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Thus, lutein in the L1 site absorbs at 494 nm, whereas in the same site violaxanthin absorbs at 496 nm.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	220	 The same description found for the absorption spectra was applied to the analysis of excitation spectra, thus allowing discrimination between the transfer from Car in L1 and L2.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	221	 It is therefore possible to read the data of Table II with the understanding that notations "1" and "2" actually correspond to xanthophyll binding sites L1 and L2.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	222	 We can conclude that lutein transfers with high efficiency (up to 91%) when in site L1, while its efficiency in exciting Chl a fluorescence is very low (down to 28%) when it is located in the L2 site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Violaxanthin transfers efficiently from the L1 site, and the efficiency is around 60% for both violaxanthin and neoxanthin from the L2 site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Both violaxanthin and lutein show high (80 to 90%) efficiency from the L1 site, while the decrease in the transfer efficiency from the L2 site is different; lutein decreases its efficiency by a factor of 3.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	225	2, whereas viola decreases its efficiency by a factor of 1.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	226	 This suggests that the arrangement of the two xanthophylls in the L2 site is different.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	227	 The case of zeaxanthin is even more extreme: its energy transfer efficiency from the L1 site is around 60%, whereas from the L2 site it is very low, if at all.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	228	 These results suggest that the energy transfer from a single site is dependent from the site occupancy.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	229	In general the L2 site seems to be less active in the energy transfer as compared with the L1 site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Moreover, the efficiency of excitation energy transfer to Chl is modulated by the xanthophyll species bound there in the following gradient: V = N  >  L  >  Z.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	231	 The lower transfer efficiency from the L2 site, common to all xanthophyll species, indicates that in this site the distance/orientation between pigments is not optimal for excitation energy transfer.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	232	 It has been recently observed that most of the transfer from Car to Chl occurs via the S2 Car state in less than 100 fs.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Considering the short carotenoid S2 lifetime, a perfect geometry between donor and acceptor is required for highly efficient energy transfer (3, 4, 6), and small changes in this geometry can strongly influence the process.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Moreover, the finding that the xanthophylls behave differently when bound to the L2 site suggests that this protein domain may change its folding in the presence of different xanthophylls, supporting the proposal that the L2 site has allosteric nature (10).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	235	 It is thus possible to suggest that when, for example, lutein enters the site, which is usually occupied by neoxanthin and violaxanthin, a conformational change occurs, changing the relative chromophore orientation and, thus, decreasing the transfer efficiency.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	236	 The picture in CP29 is thus different as compared with the case of LHCII, where both L1 and L2 sites showed high efficiency of excitation energy transfer to Chl a (4).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	237	 This suggests the L2 site has a different function in the two proteins.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	238	 In the case of CP29, a Ca2+ and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binding site in the loop between helix B and C was suggested to work as a sensor for pH changes in the lumen (37, 38).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binding sites have been also found in CP26 (39).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	240	 At low lumenal pH the substitution of the Ca2+ with an H+ would "open" the structure, allowing violaxanthin to exit and zeaxanthin to enter the site (18).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	241	 The high flexibility, which is required for this process, can thus explain the low energy transfer efficiency from this site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	242	 In the case of LHCII, zeaxanthin never enters the central sites, and thus, the structure could be optimized for the function of excitation energy transfer.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	243	Photoprotection The photobleaching measurements show that samples with two or more xanthophyll species are more resistant to photooxidation.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Among the samples containing only one xanthophyll species, CP29-L and CP29-Z are the most sensitive to photo-oxidation.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	245	 It has been proposed above that lutein in site L2 is organized differently compared with the other xanthophylls and in effect does not transfer energy efficiently.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	246	 CP29-Z has only one xanthophyll molecule located in the L1 site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The results thus indicate that the L2 site in CP29 can play an important role in photoprotection and, again, that this role is modulated by the site occupancy.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	248	 In this respect, CP29 differs strongly from LHCII for which it has been clearly shown that L1 is the only site active in preventing photooxidation (10).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	249	Do Putative Carotenoid Binding Sequences Participate in Actual Xanthophyll Binding? In the last part of this work, the putative binding sequences for the carotenoids in the L1 and L2 sites have been studied by mutation analysis.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Comparison between the primary structures of Lhc multigenic family members has shown in the loops conserved sequences composed by one charged amino acid hydrophobic residues in between four.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Considering that Lhc proteins cannot bind -carotene, it was argued that these sequences are involved in the xanthophyll binding by establishing an H-bond between the polar residue in the polypeptide stretch and the ring -OH substituent (20).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	252	 However, our mutation of the four putative binding sequences not only did not decrease pigment-protein stability but also did not change the affinity of binding sites for the different xanthophyll species.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	253	 The changes in Chl composition observed for the P238R mutant are probably due to changes in the D helix domain and loss of the Chl in A3 site, as suggested by the similar effects of mutation P238R (this work) and Q230L (17) detected by pigment analysis, CD spectroscopy (data not shown), and the heat denaturation kinetics.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	254	 The two mutations, which affect the putative stromal binding sequences for xanthophylls in the L2 site (CP29-D50L and CP29-N-term), support the view that pigment-protein stabilization by xanthophyll binding is not provided by hydrophilic sequences.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	255	 A small but reproducible decrease of violaxanthin and neoxanthin balanced by an increase of lutein was, however, consistently found.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	256	 This result may indicate that the sequence encompassing the Asp-50 residue plays a minor role in determining the selectivity of the L2 site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	257	The pigment binding properties of chimeric LHCII-CP29 complex further support the conclusion that lumenal sequences have little effect on site selectivity: despite the presence of the CP29 sequence in the lumenal region between B and C helices, it still accommodates mostly lutein in the L2 site, as is the case in LHCII (13) rather than violaxanthin and neoxanthin, as in CP29.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Nevertheless, the absence of a clear phenotype for this chimeric complex can be useful in the search of the structural determinants for the affinity of the Car binding sites for individual xanthophyll.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	259	 In fact, no effect in xanthophyll composition was observed by either deleting the N-terminal domain down to residue 96 (CP29) or by substituting half of the B helix and the lumenal loop.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	260	 We conclude that the structural determinant for the selectivity of the L2 site has to be located in between these two regions, namely within a 28-amino acid sequence (e.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	261	 from residue 50 to residue 77 in the LHCII sequence).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	262	 It has been recently demonstrated that CP26 has the same L2 occupancy as in CP29 (25); this means that the determinant has to be conserved in CP29 and CP26 and not in LHCII.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	263	 The three sequences are reported in Fig.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	264	 The only candidate is the N-61 in LHCII.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	265	 An aromatic amino acid in both CP29 and CP26 occupies this position.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	266	 In the structure of LHCII this asparagine is within 5 A from the carotenoid in L2.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The presence in this position of a Phe or Tyr may change the steric interaction between pigments, possibly favoring the binding of violaxanthin and neoxanthin with respect to lutein.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	268	 This may be due to the difference in the ring orientation between lutein and violaxanthin and neoxanthin; lutein is in its low energy conformation when the -cycle is oriented parallel to the polyene chain, whereas the -cycles of violaxanthin and neoxanthin are oriented perpendicularly.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	269	 This difference can play a role in the selectivity of the binding site; an aromatic group in this site has higher steric hindrance and can select against lutein.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	270	 However, the stringency cannot be very high as lutein is able to enter the L2 site when the reconstitution is performed in the absence of violaxanthin and neoxanthin.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Consistent with this hypothesis is the finding that the CP29-L sample is less stable than the control CP29, and lutein in site L2 is differently oriented in the complex, as proposed above.

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Sequence comparison between CP29, CP26, and LHCII in the B helix.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	274	Although the putative carotenoid binding sequences on the stroma-exposed side of the protein can be somehow involved in the selectivity of the sites for the different xanthophylls, it is quite clear that the stabilization of the carotenoid binding cannot be attributed to these sequences.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Similar results have been obtained for the major light-harvesting complex, LHCII, where the deletion of the N-terminal domain, which contains the putative binding sequence for L1 site, does not influence the carotenoid composition of the complex.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	276	 The dragging force for the carotenoid binding is most probably to be found in hydrophobic interaction in the portion of the complex inside the membrane in a similar way to that observed in bacteria (40).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Aromatic residues present in A and B helices can be involved in this binding.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	278	 The position of these residues is not conserved in different members of the Lhc family but maintained in the same gene products from different species.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Mutation analysis on the Chl binding residues both in CP29 and LHCII have shown that the interactions between Chls and carotenoids can play a major role in the xanthophylls binding.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	280	 In particular, the binding of neoxanthin in the N1 site of LHCII is stabilized by interaction with Chls (14).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	281	 This is consistent with CP29 lacking the N1 site; if the number of Chls in the domain in between helices A and C is lower than in LHCII, then critical Chl-neoxanthin interactions might be lacking.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	282	 The loop in between helix A and helix C of CP29 is shorter with respect to the corresponding domain in LHCII; this may bring helix C closer to helix A and, thus, prevent Chl A6, A7, and B1 binding in both CP29 and the chimeric LHCII-CP29 complex.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	283	CP29 is a member of the Lhc family, which is conserved in higher plants and green algae and is involved in light harvesting and protection from abiotic stress.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Knowledge of the biochemical and functional properties of the isolated proteins will contribute to the understanding of the physiological roles of individual gene products in providing stress resistance.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Recent work showed that during light stress the xanthophyll ligand of site L2 (violaxanthin) is changed into zeaxanthin (18), thus inducing a conformational change leading to fluorescence quenching, whereas the binding of neoxanthin in site N1 stabilizes the unquenched conformation (9, 19).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	286	 The absence of site N1 in CP29 qualifies this antenna subunit for prompt response to light-induced photoprotective conformational change.

0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	6	Received for publication, October 24, 2003 , and in revised form, April 22, 2004.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	7	The double-stranded DNA virus HSV-1 has a 1250-A icosahedral protein capsid, surrounded by a less structured protein tegument layer, in turn surrounded by a lipid envelope containing several glycoproteins.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The major capsid proteins VP5, VP19C, VP23, and VP26 are self-assembling when expressed in vitro using recombinant baculoviruses (2, 3).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	9	During infection, HSV-1 binds to cell surface receptors (via glycoproteins), enters the cell by membrane fusion, then most but not all tegument proteins dissociate from the nucleocapsid after phosphorylation (4, 5).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The nucleocapsid-tegument complex is transported to the outer nuclear membrane where it docks and releases viral DNA into the nucleus, but the capsid itself does not enter the nucleus (6).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	11	 There is evidence that the rapid "retrograde" transport of this complex to the cell nucleus involves microtubules and is mediated by the minus-end-directed molecular motor cytoplasmic dynein (7 to 9).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Retrograde transport of the closely related alphaherpesvirus pseudorabies virus (PRV) has been observed in live cells to be saltatory, with brief, rapid transport events (10).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The herpes viral proteins that mediate retrograde transport are unknown but are likely to involve outer capsid or inner tegument proteins.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In support of this, HSV-1 capsids, stripped of envelope and much of the tegument protein by detergent lysis, move in a retrograde direction after injection into giant squid axons (11).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The site of attachment for the dynein complex on the capsid has not been confirmed.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	16	Cytoplasmic dynein is a large (1.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	17	2 MDa) complex, with heavy chains providing motive force, whereas intermediate and light chains contribute to cargo binding (12).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Regulation of dynein function is not well understood but is thought to involve the multisubunit complex dynactin, which is also involved in binding membranous cargo (13).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Light chain LC8 has been reported to interact with proteins from rabies virus (14, 15), African swine fever virus (16), human adenovirus, vaccinia virus, and human papillomavirus (17), whereas Tctex1 interacts with the poliovirus receptor CD155 (18).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Despite a recently reported interaction between dynein intermediate chain (DIC) and HSV-1 protein UL34 (19), its role in retrograde transport has yet to be confirmed.

0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	217	Cytoplasmic dynein is the major minus-end-directed, microtubule-associated molecular motor, and each dynein complex contains two copies of the same 14-kDa light chain, either RP3 or Tctex1.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	218	 The two chains, although 55% homologous at the amino acid level (30), are mutually exclusive in each complex, compete for binding sites on DIC, and have differing binding specificities (31).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	219	We initially demonstrated binding of VP26 to dynein light chains RP3 and Tctex1 in a yeast two-hybrid system, and we confirmed strong expression of the -galactosidase reporter by quantitative assay.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Subsequent work confirmed binding of recombinant, soluble VP26 to RP3 and Tctex1 in vitro, using bacterial expression and GST pull-down assays.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	221	 We also confirmed that immobilized His6-VP26 is able to bind to intact cytoplasmic dynein complexes in cell lysates.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Most important, we have confirmed binding of dynein (RP3) to VP26 in its biologically relevant form as part of a recombinant viral capsid bound to VP5.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	223	Thus we have confirmed specific binding of VP26 to dynein light chain RP3 in three separate assays, including as part of a viral capsid.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	224	 This suggests that the binding of VP26 to RP3 utilizes different VP26 epitopes from those involved in binding to VP5 in capsids (49) and is consistent with the interaction playing a significant role in vivo.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Furthermore, in microinjected cells we have shown co-localization of HSV-1 capsids containing VP26 with RP3, Tctex1, and microtubules, further supporting a functional role for VP26-dynein interactions.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	226	Despite strong interaction between VP26 and Tctex1 in the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro pull-down assays (using His6-VP26), and co-localization of HSV-1 capsids with Tctex1, we were unable to confirm binding of VP26+ capsids to Tctex1 in vitro.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	227	 We believe that this result most likely reflects a lower sensitivity for this particular assay, in light of the other in vitro binding results.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The ability to bind either RP3 or Tctex1 would be expected to offer HSV-1 an evolutionary advantage, by allowing retrograde transport of HSV-1 capsids on any cytoplasmic dynein complex in all cell types.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	229	 We cannot exclude that recombinant Tctex1 may only bind to soluble VP26 in vitro and not to VP26 incorporated into recombinant HSV-1 capsids.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	230	 However, the co-localization of VP26+ capsids with Tctex1 in live cells suggests that VP26 interacts with Tctex1, as well as RP3, in this more biologically relevant model.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	231	HSV-1 readily infects mucous membranes in both adults and children, before being transported in a retrograde direction along neuronal axons to establish latent infection.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	232	 RP3 in particular is an attractive candidate to mediate this retrograde transport, as it is expressed at high levels in cells infected by HSV-1, including adult brain and many other tissue types, whereas Tctex1 is expressed predominantly in fetal tissue and testis (30).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Furthermore, it has been proposed that RP3-containing dynein complexes play the predominant role during retrograde transport from post-synaptic nerve terminals (29), the site of HSV-1 entry.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	234	VP26, at the hexon tips, is ideally located to interact with molecular motors (48), because most of the tegument is lost soon after cell entry (6).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Tegument proteins VP11/12, VP13/14, VP16, and VP22 are known to dissociate from the virus at early stages of infection, whereas the major tegument protein VP1/2 and the minor capsid protein UL25 probably remain attached to incoming capsids (4, 5, 8, 50, 51).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	236	 VP1/2 appears to attach to capsids at the vertical pentons (52), whereas VP26 is found exclusively on hexons (39, 48, 53) and does not interfere with capsid-tegument interaction (54).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	237	 This specific binding is probably due to differing orientations of the upper domain of VP5, the structure of which has recently been solved (55).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	238	Binding of the tegument protein VP11/12 to RP3 and Tctex1 was detected in the yeast two-hybrid system but could not be confirmed with pull-down assays due to poor expression of soluble His6 tag fusion proteins in E.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	239	 The significance of these results is unclear, but any role is likely to be later in the viral replication cycle, rather than during retrograde transport.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	240	 It seems unlikely that VP11/12 is involved in retrograde transport of the capsid-tegument complex, because it dissociates from incoming capsids during cell infection (50), although retention of some residual VP11/12 during retrograde transport will be difficult to exclude.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	241	 An interaction of VP11/12 with dynein may play a role during tegument assembly, however, because newly synthesized VP11/12 has been observed in perinuclear particles undergoing rapid, microtubule-dependent movement (50).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	242	To confirm that the interaction between VP26 and dynein is important for cellular transport, recombinant viral capsids were microinjected into living cells.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	243	 On average there was significant movement of VP26+ capsids toward the cell nucleus after 2 or 4 h, which was absent for VP26-capsids.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	244	 VP26-capsids in fact redistributed slightly toward the cell periphery, but this may simply reflect diffusion to a truly "random" distribution.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	245	 These results therefore suggest an important role for VP26 during retrograde transport, through interactions with cytoplasmic dynein.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	246	The relative contribution of other tegument or capsid proteins to HSV-1 transport is unclear and requires further study.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	247	 We cannot exclude that VP1/2, or one of the minor capsid proteins such as UL25, may also contribute to dynein binding in vivo, as suggested by others (8, 10).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Any binding of these or other HSV-1 proteins to dynein would imply redundancy in viral proteins available for retrograde transport, and may explain why VP26 is not an essential protein for replication in vitro (56).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Redundancy for such an important process may be advantageous for the virus, and there are precedents for functional redundancy in other HSV-1 proteins (57).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	250	 In our yeast two-hybrid system there was no evidence of interaction between dynein and a large fragment of VP1/2 (N-terminal two-thirds), but it was not possible to clone the rest of the protein.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Neither was it possible to test UL25 in our system for possible interaction with RP3 or Tctex1, due to autoactivation.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	252	The role of VP26 during viral transport in vivo remains to be determined.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	253	 There has been one previous study, in a mouse eye model, dissecting the role of VP26 in retrograde transport of HSV-1 to, and replication in, trigeminal ganglia (56).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Deletion of VP26 decreased the amount of infectious virus in trigeminal ganglia by 100-fold, whereas titers in cell culture (where retrograde transport is less critical) were decreased only 2-fold.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Simultaneous deletion of thymidine kinase (and thus replication) ablated the effects of VP26 deletion at 72 h after ocular infection, suggesting the virus could still be transported in the absence of VP26.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	256	 However, earlier time points may be needed to detect a decrease in transport velocity or efficiency, because wild-type virus can arrive as early as 19 h postinfection (58).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	257	In our current study we set out to determine the viral and cellular proteins that mediate retrograde axonal transport of HSV-1.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Our use of protein-protein interaction assays and minimal recombinant capsids should be a more sensitive way to detect HSV-dynein interactions than traditional approaches, relying on single gene null mutants, which can miss important interactions where multifunctional or redundant proteins exist (10).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	259	We have demonstrated by two different assays that VP26 binds to dynein light chains RP3 and Tctex1 in vitro, and we confirmed binding of VP26 to intact dynein complexes.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	260	 We have demonstrated co-localization in cells of micro-injected HSV-1 capsids with RP3, Tctex1, and microtubules.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	261	 We have shown further that VP26 in its biologically relevant form is able to mediate binding of recombinant HSV-1 capsids to RP3 in vitro, in the absence of minor capsid or tegument proteins.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Finally, we have shown that VP26, incorporated into recombinant capsids, is both necessary and sufficient to mediate retrograde intracellular transport of capsids.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	263	 We therefore propose that VP26, although not essential for viral replication in vitro, is likely to be one of two or more HSV proteins mediating retrograde axonal transport in vivo, perhaps another example of redundancy for key viral functions.

0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Institute of Immunology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, People's Republic of China.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, July 9, 2003 , and in revised form, November 25, 2003.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	3	Transcription regulator cyclin/CDK pairs are associated with the initiation, elongation, and processing of RNA transcripts.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	4	 During this process cyclins interact with the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, phosphorylating the C-terminal domain (CTD) via their partner CDKs.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	5	 It is widely accepted that transcription and RNA processing are closely related.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Capping enzymes, polyadenylation factors, and splicing factors assemble at the CTD of RNA polymerase II.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNAPIIo) stimulates RNA splicing, and the CTD has been observed to target some splicing factors to RNA transcription sites in vivo (8).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Although there is no direct evidence to support a critical role for transcription regulator cyclins in regulation of cell cycle progression or cellular apoptosis, some results have implied that one transcription regulator cyclin, cyclin C, may be important for the regulation of cell proliferation in cooperation with c-Myc.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Cyclin C has been reported to regulate both cell cycling and cell adhesion, suggesting that this cyclin may play some part in regulating both the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (9).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	10	 It thus appears that some transcription regulator cyclins may also be involved in cell cycle progression or apoptosis, RNA transcription, and DNA repair, although the precise role of the phenomena remains to be elucidated.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	11	In addition to small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles and spliceosome-associated proteins, SR proteins compose another group of splicing factors.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	12	 SR proteins have a characteristic C-terminal Arg/Ser-rich repeat of variable length (RS domain) and RNA-binding domains in the N terminus and constitute a family of highly conserved nuclear phosphoproteins that can function as both essential and alternative pre-mRNA splicing factors (10, 11).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	13	 SR-related proteins, proteins that are structurally and functionally distinct from the SR family, have also been identified.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These proteins generally contain RS domains but not RNA-binding domains, are associated with the transcriptional machinery or mRNA 3'-end formation, and have been implicated in export.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Cyclin L1 (originally named cyclin L) is the first known example of a cyclin containing an RS domain in addition to a typical "cyclin box" (12).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	16	We report here a novel candidate cyclin, human cyclin L2 (CCNL2), first identified by large scale random sequencing of a cDNA library of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Human cyclin L2 is also a cyclin box and RS repeat region-containing protein and localizes within the nuclear speckles, co-localizing with splicing factors SC-35 and 9G8.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	18	 We demonstrate that human cyclin L2 associates with RNAPIIo, CDK p110 PITSLRE kinase (CDK11), SC-35, and 9G8.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In addition, recombinant cyclin L2 protein can stimulate in vitro mRNA splicing.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Furthermore, overexpression of exogenous cyclin L2 can suppress the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC 7721 cells both in vitro and in vivo, inducing cellular apoptosis, possibly by up-regulating expression of p53 and Bax and down-regulating Bcl-2.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These results suggest that cyclin L2 may be a functional cyclin that associates with transcriptional regulation and participates in regulating the pre-mRNA splicing process.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The mechanism by which cyclin L2 suppresses the growth and induces apoptosis of tumor cells requires further investigation.

0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Human cyclin L2 possesses RS-repeat domains, a characteristic feature of SR protein/spliceosome components, and associates and co-localizes with the known splicing factors SC-35 and 9G8.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	266	 RS domains have been discovered in several factors associated with transcription components, including the SR-like CTD-associated factors (33) and in a 3'-end cleavage factor, cleavage factor-I 68-kDa subunit (34), suggesting that communication between splicing and both transcription and 3'-end processing might in some cases be mediated by interactions involving RS domain proteins (35, 36).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	267	 We have confirmed the stimulatory effect of cyclin L2 in pre-mRNA splicing.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	268	 This activity may be mediated by interaction through its cyclin domains with RNA polymerase II and CDK p110 PITSLRE, or direct or indirect interaction via cyclin domain/RS repeat region with SC-35 and 9G8, as an RNA elongation/processing unit, in the nuclear speckles.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Of note, while this manuscript was in revision, de Graaf et al.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	270	 (37) reported cyclin L1 and cyclin L2 as interaction partners and substrates of DYRK1A (dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A), a nuclear speckle-locating protein kinase with transcription factors and splicing factors as its substrates.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Because human cyclin L2 and cyclin L1 are expressed differentially at different levels in different cells and tissues, it is possible that these two closely related cyclins contribute to tissue-specific regulation of splicing.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	272	The PITSLRE protein kinases are parts of the large family of p34cdc2-related kinases whose functions appear to be linked with progression of the cell cycle and the signal transduction of apoptosis and oncogenesis.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	273	 PITSLRE CDK also interacts selectively with RNAPIIo but not with RNAPIIa, and PITSLRE proteins also contain many serine/arginine dipeptide repeats, characteristic of spliceosome components.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	274	 The p110 PITSLRE has been shown to participate in a signaling pathway that may regulate the processing of RNA transcription.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	275	 It interacts with the RNA-binding protein RNPS1, an activator of mRNA splicing, RNA polymerase II, and multiple transcriptional elongation factors, regulating some aspects of RNA splicing and/or transcription in proliferating cells (38 to 40).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Due to its identification as a partner for human cyclin L1 (12) and its mouse homologue cyclin ANIA-6A (20), it is referred to as CDK11.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	277	 We show that human cyclin L2 can associate with p110 PITSLRE in a cyclin domain-dependent manner, suggesting that it is also likely to be a partner CDK for cyclin L2.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	278	Our work here also revealed that overexpression of human cyclin L2 suppressed the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC 7721 cells both in vitro and in vivo, and induced cellular apoptosis in vitro.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Cyclin L2 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, and in a variety of human cell lines, including SMMC 7721 cells.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Under normal conditions, tumor cells such as SMMC 7721 cells may have anti-apoptotic mechanisms in place which antagonize the apoptosis-inducing effects of cyclin L2.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	281	 However, when cyclin L2 is overexpressed, the apoptosis-inducing effects of cyclin L2 may counterattack these anti-apoptotic mechanisms, resulting in an imbalance between apoptosis and cell survival and cell cycle regulation, if any.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Previous studies have implicated other cyclins in apoptosis and growth inhibition of tumor cells.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	283	 A potential p53-binding site is present in intron 1 of the cyclin K gene, and colony formation assays indicate that overexpression of cyclin K suppresses growth of the glioblastoma cell lines U373MG and T98G and colon carcinoma SW480 cells (41).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	284	 At high levels, cyclin G1, a p53-responsive gene induced in alternative reading frame-arrested cells, also induces a G1-phase arrest in mammalian cells that coincides with p53 activation.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Interestingly, growth inhibition by cyclin G1 does not require p53 but instead exhibits partial retinoblastoma protein dependence (42).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	286	 A recent study by cDNA microarray and RT-PCR indicates that cyclin L1 is commonly overexpressed in well differentiated but not in poorly differentiated primary head and neck tumors, compared with corresponding correlative normal tissues (43).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Other RS repeat-containing proteins such as Hs-BTF (44) can also act as apoptosis-promoting proteins that interact with Bcl-2-related proteins.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	288	 To gain insight into the mechanism of cyclin L2-induced apoptosis in SMMC 7721 cells, we assessed the expression of the apoptosis-related proteins p53, Bax, and Bcl-2.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	289	 In our study, following transient expression of cyclin L2 in SMMC 7721 cells, p53 and Bax expression was observed to increase significantly, and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression could also be observed.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of p53 can transactivate Bax expression and inhibit Bcl-2 expression, resulting in apoptotic cell death (45).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Combined with other observations, including its association with RNAPII, CDK p110 PITSLRE, and splicing factors, and its stimulatory effect in pre-mRNA splicing, our results suggest that overexpression of cyclin L2 might regulate the RNA transcription and processing of certain apoptosis-related factors, possibly through a p53-dependent increase in Bax and reduction in Bcl-2 pathway signaling, leading to tumor cell growth inhibition.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	292	In conclusion, we report here the cloning of human and mouse cyclin L2, the association of human cyclin L2 with p110 PITSLRE and the splicing factors SC-35 and 9G8, and the potential involvement of human cyclin L2 in the stimulation of pre-mRNA splicing.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Growth inhibition and apoptosis-inducing effects of human cyclin L2 on tumor cells was also observed both in vitro and in vivo.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	7	Wing vein development in Drosophila can be subdivided into two temporally distinct stages: initiation and differentiation.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Vein initiation begins during the mid-third larval instar (Waddington, 1940; Garcia-Bellido, 1977; Garcia-Bellido and de Celis, 1992; Sturtevant et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	9	, 1993; Sturtevant and Bier, 1995; Bier, 2000) when the wing imaginal disc is a monolayer of cells.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The wing blade proper derives from an oval region of the wing disc known as the wing pouch, while the remainder of the disc generates elements of the wing hinge and thoracic body wall.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Vein differentiation, the second phase of vein development, occurs during metamorphosis as the wing disc buds out (or everts), folding along the future wing margin.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Ultimately, this eversion leads to the apposition of the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the wing during pupal development, creating the bilayer of cells comprising the mature wing blade.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	13	Genes involved in initiating wing vein development (vein genes) are expressed during the third larval instar in narrow stripes, corresponding to vein primordia, or in broader `provein' stripes, consisting of cells that are competent to become vein cells (Biehs et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Some vein genes are expressed in all vein primordia, while others are expressed in subsets of veins or in single veins.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	15	 For example rhomboid (rho), which encodes an integral membrane protein (Bier et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	16	, 1996), is expressed in all vein primordia and promotes vein formation throughout wing development by locally activating the Egfr signaling pathway (Sturtevant et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	17	, 1994; Bier, 1998a; Bier, 1998b; Guichard et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	18	 caupolican (caup) and the neighboring gene araucan (ara) encode related homeobox genes that promote expression of other vein genes such as rho in odd numbered veins.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Proneural genes such as achaete (ac) and scute (sc) promote neural development in the L1 and L3 primordium (Gomez-Skarmata et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Delta (Dl) encodes a ligand for the Notch (N) receptor, which mediates lateral inhibitory interactions among cells in vein-competent domains during pupal development (Shellenbarger and Mohler, 1978; Kooh et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	21	, 1993; Parody and Muskavitch, 1993).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Delta is also expressed earlier during larval stages of wing development in all longitudinal veins except L2, and is likely to play a role in limiting vein thickness at this stage as well, since loss of Notch function during larval development leads to greatly broadened expression of the vein marker rho (Sturtevant and Bier, 1995).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	23	 kni and knrl, which encode related zinc finger transcription factors in the steroid hormone superfamily (Nauber et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	24	, 1989), are expressed in a single stripe corresponding to the L2 primordium beginning in the mid-third larval instar, and are required to initiate L2 development (Lunde et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	25	 kni also functions as a gap gene in early embryonic development (Nusslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980; Nauber et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	26	The L2 stripe of kni/knrl-expressing cells forms along the anterior border of a broad domain of cells expressing high levels of the related and functionally overlapping spalt-major (salm) (Kuhnlein et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	27	, 1994) and spalt-related (salr) (Barrio et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	28	, 1996) zinc finger transcription factors.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	29	 A variety of evidence indicates that central domain cells expressing the patterning genes salm and salr (together referred to as sal) induce their anterior neighbors, which express very low levels of sal, to become the L2 primordium (Sturtevant et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	30	 For example, in wings containing salm-mutant clones, ectopic branches of L2 are induced that track along and inside the salm- clone borders, mimicking the normal situation in which an L2 vein forms just outside the domain of high-level sal-expressing cells (Sturtevant et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This ability of sal-expressing cells to induce their anterior low-level sal-expressing neighbors to initiate L2 development requires the activity of the kni locus (Lunde et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The induction of kni/knrl expression in the L2 primordium therefore provides an excellent system for studying the transition from spatial patterning to tissue morphogenesis.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	33	Once activated along the anterior sal border, kni and knrl organize development of the L2 vein, in part by activating expression of the key vein-promoting gene rho and by suppressing expression of the intervein gene blistered (bs) (Montagne et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The kni locus is highly selective in regulating downstream gene expression in the L2 primordium as revealed by the observation that several genes expressed in other veins, such as caup and ara, ac and sc, and Delta, are excluded from the L2 primordium.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Thus, the kni locus links patterning to vein-specific morphogenesis by functioning downstream of sal and upstream of genes involved in vein versus intervein development.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	36	The role of the kni locus in L2 formation has been clarified by analysis of likely regulatory alleles of the kni locus, previously known as radius incompletus (ri) (Arajarvi and Hannah-Alava, 1969; Lunde et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Flies with this mutation lack large sections of the L2 vein.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	38	 kniri mutants are homozygous viable, in contrast to kni null mutants, which die as embryos with a gap gene phenotype (Nusslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980; Nauber et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	39	 In support of kniri mutations being wing-specific regulatory alleles of the kni/knrl locus, expression of kni and knrl in the L2 primordium is absent in kniri[1] mutants, and the L2 vein-loss phenotype can be partially rescued by ubiquitous expression of kni in the wing (Lunde et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	40	The findings summarized above suggest that kni and knrl organize the L2 vein developmental program by orchestrating expression of genes that execute distinct subsets of functions required for proper L2 development.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Several important unanswered questions remain, including: what function(s) are disrupted in kniri[1] and other existing kniri mutants?; do these mutations eliminate the function of an L2-specific cis-regulatory element in the kni locus?; and finally, with respect to the definition of L2 versus other veins, is it important to exclude expression of genes expressed in veins other than the L2 primordium?.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	42	In this study we report the identification of an enhancer element upstream of the kni coding region that selectively directs gene expression in the L2 primordium in third instar larval wing discs.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	43	 We show that three separate ri alleles have defects mapping within a minimal 1.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	44	 We demonstrate that two of these mutations eliminate activity of the L2 enhancer, kniri[1], which contains a 252 bp deletion, and kniri[53j], which harbors a single base-pair substitution.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	45	 We find that truncation of the minimal L2 enhancer to a 0.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	46	69 kb fragment leads to ectopic reporter gene expression in the extreme anterior and posterior regions of the wing, indicating that repression contributes to restricting activation of the L2 enhancer.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	47	 In addition, we show that the general wing promoting transcription factor Scalloped (Sd) binds with high affinity to several sites in the L2 enhancer and that sd is required for kni expression in the wing disc.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	48	 We have also employed the L2 enhancer element as a tool to drive expression of various UAS transgenes in the L2 primordium.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	49	 We find that the loss of the L2 vein in ri mutants can be rescued by L2-specific expression of either the kni or knrl genes, or the downstream target gene rho.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In addition, we find that misexpression of genes in the L2 primordium that are normally expressed in veins other than L2 results in abnormal L2 development.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	332	 In contrast, when secreted Egf ligands were expressed in a similar fashion in L2-GAL4 > UAS-vn wings (Fig.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	338	, 1999), we observed ectopic veins that were displaced from the endogenous L2 vein by a few cells.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	339	 The ability of secreted ligands, but not the top construct, to induce ectopic vein formation at a distance cannot be attributed simply to the latter being a weaker activator of Egfr signaling since UAS-top is considerably more effective at generating ectopic veins than UAS-vn when other wing-GAL4 drivers are used (e.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	340	 MS1096-GAL4 or CY2-GAL4, data not shown).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	341	We also observed a non cell-autonomous activity of the Wingless (Wg) ligand in L2-GAL4 > UAS-wg wings (Fig.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	345	ri mutants are L2-enhancer specific regulatory alleles of the kni locus The results described in this study demonstrate definitively that ri mutations are regulatory alleles of the kni locus disrupting the function of a cis-regulatory enhancer element that drives gene expression in the L2 primordium of wing imaginal discs.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	346	 A crucial line of evidence supporting this conclusion is that mutant versions of the L2 enhancer incorporating either the 252 bp deletion present in kniri[1] or the single base pair substitution present in kniri[53j] eliminate the ability of this element to direct gene expression in the L2 primordium.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	347	 In addition, it is possible to completely rescue the vein-loss phenotype of kniri[1] by expressing either the UAS-kni or UAS-knrl transgenes with an L2-GAL4 driver.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Consistent with activation of rho being one of the key effectors of kni/knrl function, it is also possible to rescue the L2 vein-loss phenotype of kniri[1] by expressing a UAS-rho transgene in L2, although rescue is less complete and penetrant than that observed with UAS-kni or UAS-knrl.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	349	The isolation of the L2 enhancer also addresses an unresolved question regarding the basis for the failure of Df(3L)kniri[XT2] and Df(3L)kniFC82 to complement (Lunde et al.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	353	7 kb fragment contains the L2 enhancer.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	354	 The alternative explanation for the ri phenotype of Df(3L)kniri[XT2]/Df(3L)kniFC82 is that transvection (Lewis, 1954; Geyer et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	355	, 1990; Pirrotta, 1999), which normally occurs between regulatory and coding region alleles of the kni locus (Lunde et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	356	, 1998), is interrupted by the large divergent deletions that have little if any overlap.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	360	, 1998), the latter hypothesis that Df(3L)kniri[XT2] and Df(3L)kniFC82 are unable to engage in effective transvection is the most likely explanation for the failure of these two mutations to complement.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	361	Global activation, regional repression and localized induction restrict L2-enhancer activity to a narrow stripe of cells The results of these and previous studies of L2 vein initiation lead to a model in which localized vein inductive signaling acts against a background of regional repression and global wing-specific activation (Fig.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	362	 Previous genetic experiments have suggested a model in which sal-expressing cells produce a short-range L2 inducing signal (X) to which sal-expressing cells themselves cannot respond (Sturtevant et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	363	 According to this `for export only' signaling model, the signal X diffuses into adjacent anterior cells and activates expression of the kni/knrl genes in the L2 primordium, in much the same fashion as Hh, expressed from the refractory posterior compartment, activates expression of target genes such as dpp or ptc in the anterior compartment (reviewed by Bier, 2000).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	364	 Based on the analysis of the L2 enhancer element described in this study, the 252 bp region deleted in kniri[1] mutants may contain response element(s) to this putative factor X.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	365	 It is worth noting, however, that lacZ expression is lost in all cells of the wing disc (posterior and circumferential cells as well as the L2 primordium) when these sequences are deleted from the 4.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	366	 This observation suggests that sequences mediating more general activation (e.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	367	 Sd binding sites, see below) may also be contained within this 252 bp region.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	368	 The sequence surrounding the single nucleotide alteration in kniri[53j] mutants (C596A), however, is a particularly intriguing candidate for mediating the L2-specific activation of kni since introducing this mutation in the context of the minimal 1.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	371	 7B) that binds to the region surrounding the kniri[53j] point mutation and mediates the inductive signal X presumably collaborates with the more generally required wing selector Sd (Halder et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	372	, 2001), since mutation of four of the Sd binding sites (the doublet and two single sites) in the L2 activation domain completely eliminates enhancer activity in the wing disc.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	373	 Clonal analysis with a hypomorphic sd allele also indicates that sd is required for high-level expression of the full 4.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	375	 It is notable that the reduction in lacZ expression in these clones is not as dramatic as the complete loss of L2 activity observed when Sd binding sites in the activation domain are mutated.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	376	 There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	377	 Firstly, the sd mutation used in these experiments is a hypomorphic allele and therefore has residual activity.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	378	 Unfortunately, stronger sd alleles produce even smaller viable clones in the wing disc and thus were not used.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	379	 Secondly, as only small clones can be generated, they must typically have been produced with only two or three intervening cycles of cell division.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	380	 Consequently, the sd  cells may still contain functional levels of wild type Sd (protein perdurance).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	381	 Another possibility is that other activators can partially substitute for Sd, at least in certain regions of the wing.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	382	 Based on the absence of L2 activity when Sd binding sites are mutated and the reduction in L2 activity in sd  hypomorphic clones, we conclude that Sd plays an important role as an activator of the L2 enhancer.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	383	 These results support the view that Sd functions as a general transcriptional activator of genes expressed in the wing field.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	384	Repression also plays a key role in restricting L2 enhancer expression to a narrow stripe of wing disc cells.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	385	 It has been shown previously that salm and salr, which are expressed strongly in the central region of the wing, repress expression of kni and knrl (Lunde et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	386	, 1998), although low levels of sal may also be required to activate kni expression (de Celis and Barrio, 2000).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	387	 In the current study we also find evidence for repression of L2-enhancer activity in peripheral wing disc cells abutting those expressing high levels of sal.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	388	4 kb (fragment EX) L2 enhancer element results in reporter gene expression expanding to fill the anterior and posterior regions of the wing pouch in a pattern complementary to that of sal.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	389	 The region deleted from the EX fragment contains several consensus binding sites for Brinker (Fig.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	390	, 2001), which may mediate this repression since the pattern of brinker (brk) expression in the wing pouch (Campbell and Tomlinson, 1999; Jazwinska et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	391	, 1999) is very similar to that of lacZ expression driven by the 0.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	392	 One way to integrate the action of the localized inductive signal XX' pathway with that of abutting central and peripheral repressive factors is to propose that the signal-dependent activator X' can overcome the repressive action of the peripheral inhibitor but not repression by Salm/Salr (see legend to Fig.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	393	 One feature common to several prominent signaling pathways is that activation of the pathway converts a resting repressor into a transcriptional activator (Barolo and Posakony, 2002).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	394	 In the kni L2 enhancer, activation of the hypothetical signal X pathway may relieve repression by a heterologous repressor since the putative activator (i.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	396	 One example of a signaling pathway that functions by relieving inhibition by a heterologous repressor is the recent report of Egfr signaling inactivating repression by Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) (Tsuda et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	397	 In addition to central and peripheral repression in the wing disc, there may also be a repressor in posterior compartment cells (e.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	398	 7A,B) to prevent activation of the L2 enhancer in cells posterior to the sal expression domain.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	399	8 kb L2 enhancer element lacks some sites for this putative repressor since E-lacZ drives significantly higher levels of gene expression in the posterior stripe than that observed for endogenous kni or knrl expression.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	400	Expression of non-L2 vein genes must be excluded from the L2 primordium All longitudinal veins share several morphological characteristics such as being composed of densely packed cells on both the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the wing that secrete a thickened cuticle.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	401	 The primordia of all longitudinal veins also express the rhomboid gene, which is required for activating the Egfr pathway in vein but not in intervein cells.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	402	 In addition to these shared properties, each vein can be distinguished by expression of other vein genes (Biehs et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	403	 For example, vein L2-specific characteristics include: expression of kni and knrl, lack of Delta expression, lack of cauplara expression, and lack of ac/sc expression.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	404	 Given that all veins are ultimately quite similar morphologically, it is relevant to ask whether the differences in gene expression patterns observed in different veins are important.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	405	In this study, we examined the necessity of excluding expression of non-L2 vein genes in the L2 primordium by forcing expression of genes such as Dl, ara, ac and sc in L2 and asking whether this manipulation had any impact on L2 development.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	406	 These experiments strongly suggest that exclusion of non-L2 vein genes from the L2 primordium is indeed important since misexpression of each of these genes resulted in abnormal L2 development.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	407	 The phenotypes resulting from misexpressing non-L2 vein genes in the L2 primordium can largely be reconciled with the normal functions of these genes.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	408	 For example, forced expression of Dl leads to loss of L2, consistent with suppression of vein formation by Notch signaling.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	409	 The ectopic bristles that form strictly along the L2 vein in wings misexpressing ac or sc are also consistent with the neural promoting function of proneural genes.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	410	 It is less clear why misexpression of the ara gene causes thinning of the L2 primordium, since this gene normally activates expression of the vein-promoting gene rho in odd numbered veins and ac and sc in the L3 primordium.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	411	 Perhaps expression of a gene normally involved in development of the odd numbered dorsal veins is somehow incompatible with development of the ventral L2 vein.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	412	The L2 expression system provides a localized assay for gene function in the wing The sharp stripe of gene expression driven by L2-GAL4 can also be used as a rapid assay to test the function or range of action of various genes in the wing.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	413	 For example, in the case of the Egfr pathway, it is possible to distinguish components exerting cell-autonomous versus non cell-autonomous functions.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	414	 In line with the fact that activation of the Egfr pathway in the wing leads to the formation of veins, L2-GAL4-driven expression of the secreted ligand sSpi generates ectopic veins in the neighborhood of L2 while expression of the equally potent constitutively active top form of the EGF receptor does not result in a non-autonomous phenotype.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	415	 The L2 expression system may also be used to compare the functions of related genes such as the nuclear receptors Kni, Knrl, and Eg.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	416	 Although these three transcription factors share nearly identical DNA binding domains and can all rescue the vein-loss phenotype of ri mutants, they differ in that misexpression of eg in the L2 primordium induces the formation of ectopic bristles along L2.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	417	 This distinct activity of eg may relate to its normal embryonic function in directing cell fate choices in the CNS.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	418	 Using the L2 expression system as an assay, it should be straightforward to map the domain in eg that is responsible for its neural inducing capacity by constructing chimeric molecules composed of different domains of Eg and Kni.

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	5	Received for publication, April 7, 2003.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	6	The life cycle of HPV is coupled to the cellular differentiation program that occurs in the epithelium (7).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Maintenance of the viral genome in infected cells of the basal layer is essential for the viral life cycle and the ensuing pathology.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Maintenance of the HPV episome in primary keratinocyte cultures depends on the function of E1 and E2, a 3'-5' helicase (8) and a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein (9), respectively, which are required for replication of the genome (10).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	9	 HPV DNA replication is initiated by the co-operative binding of E1 and E2 to specific DNA sequences within the viral origin (11 to 14).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Formation of this E1-E2-ori ternary complex is dependent on the interaction of both proteins with DNA but also on a critical interaction between the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of E2 and the C-terminal enzymatic domain of E1 (15 to 22).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Assembly of this initial E1-E2-ori complex serves as a starting point for the recruitment of additional E1 molecules (23, 24) and their assembly into hexamers and double hexamers that have ATPase and helicase activity (25, 26).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	12	Any of the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions occurring at the origin could in principle be targeted for the development of small molecule antivirals to treat HPV infections.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In reality, however, not all targets are readily amenable to inhibition by small molecules.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Protein interactions for example have been considered difficult to inhibit because they often involve large surfaces devoid of small molecule binding pockets (27, 28).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In the absence of structural information, one often has to rely on screening large compound collections to determine whether a protein can be antagonized by small molecules and for the identification of lead inhibitors.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	16	Here we present a class of small molecules that bind reversibly to the E2 transactivation domain and inhibit the E1-E2 protein interaction in vitro and in vivo.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The chemical features and synthetic procedures for these molecules will be described elsewhere.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	18	2 To our knowledge these are the first small molecule inhibitors of HPV DNA replication with cellular activity.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	19	 As such they highlight the potential of the E1-E2 interaction as an antiviral drug target.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	20	Plasmid Constructions The plasmid used for expression of HPV11 E2 TAD (amino acids 2 to 201) fused at its N terminus to a 6-histidine tag (amino acid sequence MGHHHHHH) was constructed by inserting a PCR fragment encoding the TAD and the tag in pET28b (Novagen).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The plasmid to express CRPV E2 by in vitro transcription/translation was constructed by inserting a PCR fragment corresponding to nucleotides 3107 to 4287 of the CRPV genome in plasmid pCR3.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The plasmid containing the CRPV origin of replication was constructed by inserting a PstI restriction fragment corresponding to nucleotides 192 to 7111 of CRPV into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Plasmids pOri-SEAP and pGAL4-SEAP encoding, respectively, the HPV11 origin and five GAL4-binding sites upstream of secreted alkaline phosphatase were constructed by inserting a PCR fragment spanning nucleotides 7884 to 61 of the HPV11 genome or the five GAL4-binding sites from pG5CAT (Clontech) into pSEAP2-Basic (Clontech).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The plasmid encoding E1 fused to the transactivation domain of HSV VP16 (pE1-VP16) was constructed by inserting a PCR fragment encoding E1 into pVP16 (Clontech).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	25	 HPV/CRPV E2 chimeras were constructed by PCR-mediated ligation as described previously (29) and cloned into pCR3.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Site-directed mutagenesis of E2 was performed with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	27	 For the plasmids described above, details of the construction and the sequence of the oligonucleotide primers used for PCR or mutagenesis will be made available upon request.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	28	Proteins His-E2 TAD from HPV11 was expressed from Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS and purified by nickel affinity and size exclusion chromatography (Hi-Trap and Superdex 75, Amersham Biosciences) in a buffer composed of 25 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM TCEP (pH 8.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Yield was 11 mg per liter of culture, and His-TAD was essentially pure as judged by SDS-PAGE or analytical scale size exclusion chromatography.

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used for in vitro translation of E1 and E2 as described (20).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	32	E1-E2-Ori Complex Formation and Related Assays E1-E2-ori complex formation was monitored essentially as described previously (31).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Unless stated otherwise, all E1-E2-ori complex formation assays were performed with purified E2- and E1-containing nuclear extracts.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	34	 E1-containing nuclear extracts were titrated in the assay and used at a concentration yielding 70% maximal activity.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Wells without E1 or E2 served as negative controls.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In assays performed with in vitro translated E2, 2  microl of translation reaction was used per binding reaction.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In this case, wells containing E2 but no E1 were used as negative controls, because the reticulocyte lysate present from the translation reaction decreased background signal.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	38	An assay to detect binding of E2 to the origin in the absence of E1 was carried out in a similar manner using SPA beads linked to anti-mouse IgG and the anti-E2 monoclonal antibody 53.

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	40	A similar assay to detect binding of SV40 large T antigen to its cognate origin was carried out using 100 ng of purified large T antigen and an SV40 ori probe encompassing nucleotides 5191 to 31 of the SV40 genome.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	41	 This probe was generated by PCR using pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences), which contains the SV40 ori, and primers 5'-GCC CCT AAC TCC GCC CAT CCC GC-3' and 5'-ACC AGA CCG CCA CGG CTT ACG GC-3'.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Detection was performed using the monoclonal antibody PAb 101 (32) and protein A-SPA beads.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	43	For assays using in vitro translated CRPV E2 proteins or HPV11/CRPV E2 chimeras containing the CRPV DNA binding domain, a radiolabeled probe for the CRPV origin was used.

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	46	 After the 1-h binding reaction, the mixture was transferred to HVB filter plates (Whatman) to which an SPA bead-E1 antibody suspension had been added previously.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	47	 After incubating the mixture for 1 h with slight shaking, bead-bound protein-DNA complexes were washed by vacuum filtration, which removed the red-colored reticulocyte lysate that slightly quenches detection and also reduced background because unbound probe was washed away.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Scintillation fluid was then added (Microscint 20 (Packard Instrument Co.

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	128	 These results suggested that the E1-E2 protein interaction might be the target of inhibition.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	129	 This hypothesis was tested using an ELISA.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	130	 The E2 protein used in this assay was either purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells or obtained by in vitro translation; both sources yielded similar results.

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Because for HPV11 it is known that the TAD, but not the DBD, interacts with E1 (16, 40), we repeated the titration with a GST fusion protein encoding the E2 TAD, as well as with GST itself as a negative control (Fig.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The results clearly indicated saturable binding of 2 to the GST-TAD but not to GST, indicating that the compound binds to the TAD.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Similar results were also obtained with a polyhistidine-tagged version of the E2 TAD (data not shown).

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	172	 CRPV E2, however, was found to be resistant to inhibition by compound 2 (Fig.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	173	 6), perhaps not surprisingly given the low level of amino acid identity between the TAD of HPV11 and that of CRPV.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Similarly, we found that the inhibitors are inactive against the E2 protein of the high risk HPV types 16, 18, and 31 (data not shown), which at the amino acid level are only 41 to 50% identical to HPV11 E2.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	175	 We made use of the observation that some E2 types are resistant to inhibition to substantiate the finding that the TAD is indeed the target of the inhibitors.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Specifically, we constructed chimeric E2 proteins encoding the HPV11 TAD with the hinge and DNA-binding domain from CRPV, or the opposite combination.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	177	 These chimeras were expressed in vitro and tested in the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay using HPV11 E1.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Both chimeras could bind co-operatively with E1 on the origin, but only the one containing the TAD from HPV11 was sensitive to inhibition by compound 2 (Fig.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	179	 This result provides functional evidence that the TAD is indeed the target of inhibition.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	180	Inhibition Is Reversible It is generally expected to be difficult to identify inhibitors of protein interactions that act by reversible binding rather than by reacting with the target protein or by some other irreversible mechanism (27).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	181	 To determine whether inhibition of E1-E2-ori complex formation was reversible, we performed the preincubation experiment shown in Fig.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In this experiment, E2, the target protein, was incubated with a high concentration of inhibitor and then diluted into the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay to a final compound concentration 10-fold below the IC50.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	183	 We reasoned that if the inhibitor is acting by a reversible mechanism, the activity of E2 should be recovered upon dilution of the inhibitor.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	184	 However, if the mechanism of inhibition is irreversible then significant inhibition should be observed even after dilution.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	185	 As a control, we used the known reactive electrophile, 4-fluoro-7-nitro-(2,1,3)-benzoxadiazole.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Preincubation with this compound resulted in significant inhibition even after dilution to a concentration well below the IC50.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	187	 In contrast, preincubation of E2 with compound 2 did not lead to any significant inhibition upon dilution (compare 3rd bar to 1st and 2nd bars from the left in Fig.

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Specifically, this assay measures the expression of a SEAP reporter gene, placed under the control of the HPV11 minimal origin of replication, upon co-transfection of two plasmids encoding, respectively, E2 and the E1 protein fused to the strong transactivation domain of HSV VP16 (Fig.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	217	 In this assay, neither E2 nor E1-VP16 could by itself activate expression of the reporter gene (Fig.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	218	 The lack of transactivation by E2 is consistent with the previous observation that E2 of the low risk HPV types are weak transactivators (41).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Maximal expression of the reporter gene was dependent on the expression of both E1-VP16 and E2 and on their interaction, because it was greatly reduced by the E39A substitution in E2 which affects E1 binding (Fig.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	220	 As expected, the I73A substitution in E2 had no negative effect.

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	227	 This high level of SEAP is reduced by the E39A substitution in E2, but not by the I73A substitution, suggesting that SEAP expression is dependent on the interaction of E1 with E2.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Little SEAP activity is obtained if E1 is not fused to the VP16 activation domain (data not shown).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	229	Having confirmed that expression of the reporter gene was dependent on the interaction between E1 and E2, we then tested the effect of compounds 2 and 3 in this assay and in a similar one based on E1 and E2 from HPV6.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Compounds 2 and 3 inhibited SEAP synthesis induced by the HPV11 proteins with IC50 values of 14 and 2  microM, respectively (Fig.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	231	 The similar potency of compound 3 in the reporter and transient HPV DNA replication assays suggests that its inhibitory activity on viral DNA replication is indeed due to abrogation of the E1-E2 protein interaction.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Inhibitors 2 and 3 were also found to be active against the HPV6 proteins, albeit with reduced potency, with IC50 values of 22 and 6  microM, respectively.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Interestingly, the difference in potency between HPV11 and HPV6 protein was about 4 to 7-fold in this cellular assay compared with 25 to 30-fold in vitro (Fig.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	234	 The exact reason for the smaller difference in potency against HPV6 and HPV11 proteins in vivo is currently unknown but could be related to slight alterations in the conformation of E2 in vivo compared with in vitro (see under "Discussion").

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	246	To gain additional evidence that the inhibitors were acting in vivo by the same mechanism as in vitro, we made use of a mutant E2 protein that has a higher affinity for this class of inhibitors.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	247	 This mutant protein contains a single amino substitution in the TAD, E100A, which makes it 10-fold more sensitive to this class of inhibitors than wild type E2 in the in vitro E1-E2-ori complex formation assay.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	248	 The E100A substitution was discovered during a mutational analysis of the E2 TAD aimed at identifying residues involved in compound binding (data not shown).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Importantly, this amino acid substitution also increased the sensitivity of E2 in the reporter assay (Fig.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	250	 This result provides strong evidence that the mechanism of action of this class of inhibitors is the same in vivo as in vitro.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	251	The discovery of inhibitors of the E1-E2 protein interaction from HPV types 6 and 11 highlights the potential of E2 as a drug target for the treatment of anogenital warts.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	252	 The genome of HPV6 and HPV11 is present in episomal form in 90% of genital warts (42, 43), and inhibition of the E1-E2 interaction is expected to provide therapeutic benefits (44).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	253	 In this respect, it is worth noting that E1 and E2 are likely to be expressed at much lower levels in natural infections than in transfected cells, a fact that could lead us to underestimate the true potency of these inhibitors.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Determining the real antiviral activity of these inhibitors awaits the development of a straightforward and quantitative HPV viral replication assay.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	255	Specificity of Inhibition The inhibitors presented in this study are active against the E2 protein of the two most prevalent low risk HPV types, 6 and 11, but are nevertheless more potent against the HPV11 protein by 10 to 40-fold in vitro.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	256	 This difference in potency was observed both with purified proteins and with proteins produced by in vitro translation.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Because we have found no evidence that HPV6 E1 and E2 interacts more strongly than the HPV11 proteins (data not shown), we surmise that the inhibitors must bind less tightly to HPV6 E2.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	258	 The HPV6 and HPV11 TAD are 84% identical at the primary amino acid sequence levels, and any of the amino acid differences or combinations thereof could affect binding of the inhibitor.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Surprisingly, we found that the difference in potency observed in cellular assays is less pronounced.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Indeed, the difference in IC50 values is only 3-fold in the transient HPV DNA replication assay.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	261	3 This reduced difference between type 6 and 11 was also observed in the E1-E2 interaction reporter gene assay suggesting that this class of compound does indeed inhibit the E1-E2 interaction of both HPV types with comparable potency in cells.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	262	 It is possible that a conformational change necessary for inhibitor binding has a more similar energetic cost for both HPV types in vivo than in vitro, perhaps because the conformation of E2 in vivo is slightly different as a result of interaction with cellular proteins.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Further studies will be required to address this possibility.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	264	Amino Acids in E2 Involved in Inhibition Prior to this report a 15-amino acid peptide derived from HPV16 E2 and spanning residue Glu-39 was shown to be capable of inhibiting the E1-E2 interaction in vitro (45).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Several studies have suggested an essential role for Glu-39 in interaction with E1.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Specifically, changing this residue to alanine was shown to abrogate the ability of E2 to bind to E1 (36 to 38), as confirmed in this study, while having little effect on its transcriptional activity.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	267	 These findings suggested that Glu-39 might form part of the E1-binding surface on E2.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Two lines of evidence suggest that our inhibitors may bind near Glu-39 to antagonize the E1-E2 interaction.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	269	 First, the Glu-100 residue, which when changed to alanine increases the sensitivity of HPV11 E2 to our inhibitors, is located on the same surface as Glu-39 in the crystal structure of the HPV16 E2 TAD (46).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Second, we found that our inhibitors bind with reduced affinity to the E39A mutant E2 TAD in fluorescence studies similar to those presented in Fig.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	271	 The simplest interpretation of these results is that the surface of the E2 TAD onto which Glu-39 and Glu-100 are located is involved in binding both E1 and our inhibitors.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Because these inhibitors are inactive against HPV16 E2, we did not attempt to model them into the published structure of the HPV16 E2 TAD.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	273	 However, further studies are in progress to localize the inhibitor-binding pocket on the HPV11 E2 TAD.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	274	Protein Interactions as Drug Targets The compounds presented here belong to a relatively small group of small molecules that effectively inhibit protein interactions.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	275	 With only a few exceptions most protein interaction inhibitors have been identified for cases in which the binding surface for one protein is known to be a small contiguous region, such as for receptor-ligand interactions (47, 48).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Many of the small molecules reported to inhibit protein interactions are peptides identified either by screening procedures such as phage display, or from panels of overlapping peptides based on the protein sequence, or selected based on results of structural or mutational studies (49).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Most of these peptides are relatively weak inhibitors, and although in principle these can serve as lead compounds for drug discovery, in practice transformation of such molecules into potent non-peptidic inhibitors is quite challenging.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	278	A variety of reasons has been proposed for the relatively low number of small molecule inhibitors of protein interactions.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	279	 One is that small molecules would have difficulty competing against the large surface area typically involved in protein-protein interface.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	280	 However, it has been shown in a number of cases (e.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	281	 50) that substitution of a single critical residue at an interface, which is conceptually analogous to tight binding of a small molecule, is sufficient to greatly weaken an interaction.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	282	 An example of this may be the E39A substitution in E2, which as argued above may abrogate E1 binding because it is located at the E1-E2 interface.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	283	 A second reason why protein interactions are thought to be difficult targets for small molecules is because their interfaces can be fairly flat and devoid of concave pockets analogous to enzyme-active sites or receptor-binding sites (51).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Although this is true for some complexes, others have been found to be "bumpy" such that small cavities are often present (52, 53).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Perhaps relatively few protein interaction inhibitors have been identified to date only because more effort has been devoted to traditional targets, such as enzymes and receptors.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	286	 We have in fact succeeded in identifying potent small molecule inhibitors of the E1-E2 interaction by high throughput screening.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	287	 This strongly suggests that other investigations will also yield novel small molecule inhibitors of protein interactions as drug candidates.

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In this report, we examine rates of evolution of each ORF by using dN/dS ratios across these subtype pairs and other closely related mucosal types.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Closely related genomes allow examination of evolutionary change prior to saturation of genetic changes.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	16	 We focus specifically on the modular rates of selection exhibited by E2 and a possible explanation for this modularity, in the overlapping ORF, E4.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	17	To clone the potentially novel genomes, PCR primers were designed by alignment of closely related HPV genomes using the sequences of the partial L1 region amplified by MY09/MY11 primers.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Additional primers were used to amplify the entire genome in fragments by using overlapping PCR amplification, as described previously (Terai  and  Burk, 2002).

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	20	 After confirmation of appropriate product sizes, each PCR product was purified (Qiagen gel-extraction kit) and ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Initially, SP6 and T7 primers flanking each HPV DNA insert were used to determine the nucleotide sequence.

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Sequencing was performed in the Albert Einstein Cancer Center DNA-sequencing facility.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Overlapping fragments were assembled manually and several additional primers were used to clarify sequence ambiguities.

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Multiple sequence alignments, providing prototype and subtype phylogenetic context, were generated in the same way.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Calculation of overall, ORF-wide non-synonymous and synonymous changes and rates of non-synonymous and synonymous change were done by using SNAP (Synonymous/Non-synonymous Analysis Program) (Korber, 2002; Nei  and  Gojobori, 1986) and K-Estimator was used to perform sliding-window analysis of dN/dS (Comeron, 1999).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	30	Phylogenetic trees were constructed in PAUP (version 4.

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Alignment gaps were coded as missing before distance and parsimony trees were reconstructed by using equal-weighted characters and 100 bootstrap replicates.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	33	 To ensure adequate searches in the tree space, 100 random-addition heuristic searches and TBR (tree bisection and reconnection) swapping were employed.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	34	HPVs used in this study and their GenBank accession numbers are as follows: HPV7 (NC_001595), HPV11 (NC_001525), HPV27 (NC_001584), HPV40 (NC_001589), HPV44 (NC_001689), HPV54 (NC_001676), HPV55 (NC_001692), HPV82 (NC_002172), HPV13 (NC_001349), HPV26 (NC_001583), HPV30 (NC_001585), HPV32 (NC_001586), HPV42 (NC_001534), HPV51 (NC_001533), HPV53 (NC_001593), HPV56 (NC_001594), HPV66 (NC_001695), HPV69 (NC_002171), HPV74 (NC_004501), HPV91 (NC_004085), HPV54A (AF436129) and HPV82A (AF293961).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	35	The genomes of HPV54A and HPV82A share a high level of similarity with their prototypes.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	36	 A comparison of whole genomes reveals 93 5 % nucleic acid similarity between HPV54 and HPV54A, and 89 8 % similarity between HPV82 and HPV82A.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The currently accepted criterion for HPV classification relies on comparison of L1 nucleotide ORFs.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The L1 ORF in the HPV54 pair diverges by 4 6 %, whilst the HPV82 pair diverges by 7 7 %, placing both isolates within the subtype range.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	39	As expected, subtype and prototype genome lengths are also comparable.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	40	 HPV82 and HPV82A are 7871 and 7904 bp, respectively, whilst HPV54 and HPV54A are 7759 and 7717 bp in length.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Each pair contains the anticipated PV ORFs, including the E6 and E7 proteins, the replication proteins (E1 and E2) and components of the viral capsid (L1 and L2).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The only major difference in genomic architecture across the two pairs is HPV54's lack of an E5 homologue.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	43	 HPV82 contains an unambiguous E5 ORF, but lacks a proximal start codon, whereas the corresponding genomic region in HPV54 is as variable as some sections of its upstream regulatory region.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Lack of evidence for E5 in HPV54 reinforces its status as a unique outlier, rooting members of the -PV species clades 1, 8 and 10 (Fig.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	45	 1), all of which contain an intact E5 ORF.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The identification of an HPV54 subtype implies that this ancient part of the tree still appears to be evolving.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	47	 In their greater phylogenetic context, HPV82A and HPV54A sort into species groups 5 and 13, respectively.

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The subtypes HPV44 and HPV55 and the sister taxa HPV6 and HPV11, HPV7 and HPV40, and HPV2 and HPV27 were chosen because they all exhibit whole-genome divergence of  < 15 %.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	57	 These closely related pairs allow unambiguous alignment and are less likely to be subject to saturation of genetic variation.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	58	 To examine the possibility of directional selection, we calculated the ratio of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	59	 A dN/dS ratio equal to 1 indicates neutrality, a ratio  < 1 indicates purifying selection and a ratio  > 1 indicates positive Darwinian selection (Yang, 1998).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Overall, the small ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous changes and dN/dS values indicate that E1, L1 and L2 are under strong purifying selection, forming a functional core essential to the viral life cycle.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Previously, we had also included E2 in this group because of its presence in all known PVs and its role in viral-genome replication (Narechania et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	62	 However, in the current analysis, a remarkably consistent pattern of elevated non-synonymous E2 variation was observed, a pattern more in line with the values seen for the E6/E7 ORFs than the stable core E1, L1 and L2 ORFs.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The median E2 dN/dS value (0 31) was significantly different from that of the E1/L1/L2 group (0 09) (Mann to Whitney P < 0 0004) (Siegel, 1956).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	64	All values were calculated with SNAP as described by Korber (2000).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	65	  Much of E2's variation is attributable to the hinge region connecting the transcription activation domain (TAD) to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) (Table 2; Fig.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	66	 In all cases except for the HPV54 pair, the hinge region did not manifest the purifying selection that constrains the rest of the E2 ORF (dN/dS median, 1 11).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	67	 HPV16 variant genomes also showed elevated dN/dS ratios in the E2 hinge region (Z.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The TAD and DBD regions display intermediate median dN/dS values (0 18), lower than that for the hinge, but significantly higher than that observed for E1, L1 or L2 (Mann to Whitney P < 0 002).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	69	 This pattern holds in all cases except for the HPV54 pair.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Aside from a low hinge dN/dS and a high TAD dN/dS, the HPV54 pair also exhibits relatively high E1 and L1 dN/dS ratios, again highlighting its status as a unique outlier of species clades 1, 8 and 10.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Although relatively elevated E2 dN/dS values are a trend that is consistent across all analysed pairs, there are many functional protein motifs that are conserved across all types.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	72	 For example, the -1 recognition helix in the E2 DBD is well-conserved across all types used in the current study, as are the cognate DBD sites (ACCgNNNNcGGT) in the long control region (reviewed by Hegde, 2002).

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	78	 These positions were derived by alignment to HPV18 E2 (Hegde, 2002).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Vertical lines above the horizontal axis indicate non-synonymous changes (i.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	80	 amino acid changes), whereas those below the axis correspond to synonymous changes.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The height of the vertical lines both above and below the horizontal axis represents the number of non-synonymous and synonymous changes per codon, respectively.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	82	  The most compelling observations in the current analysis were the high overall dN/dS ratio of E2 and the concentration of non-synonymous changes in the hinge region of this ORF.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	83	 E2 is unique in the PV genome in that it is the only ORF that completely contains another (in this case, E4).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Moreover, E4 frames the hinge region completely in all pairs analysed (for two examples, see Fig.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	85	 In each sliding-window analysis, except for HPV54 where little time has apparently passed since subtype divergence, non-synonymous changes dominate the E2 reading frame, whereas E4 favours synonymous changes.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	86	 This observation is at odds with the prevailing notion concerning overlapping genes  to  that severe evolutionary constraint should operate on nucleotide sequences encoding two layers of protein in the dense genetic environment of viruses (Mizokami et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	87	, 1997; Pavesi, 2000; Pavesi et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	88	 For overlapping genes, codon changes at the third position in one reading frame are unusual, because they result in changes in the second position of the +1 reading frame.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	89	 However, what we see here is a pattern of E4 purifying selection superimposed on the E2 hinge, the one domain that can physically accommodate high levels of non-synonymous change.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The relaxed constraint observed for the hinge is therefore attributable to both its role as a flexible connector between the functionally conserved TAD and DBD domains and the existence of the overlapping E4 reading frame.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	91	 In PVs with no evidence of an E4 ORF, we might expect this phenomenon to disappear.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	92	 However, to our knowledge, all PVs contain an E4-like ORF except for the two avian PVs that have been characterized to date: Psittacus erithacus papillomavirus (PePV) and Fringilla coelebs papillomavirus (FPV) (Terai et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	93	 An alignment of PePV and FPV E2 ORFs yielded only 52 % identity.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	94	 At this level of divergence, saturation becomes a problem and a satisfactory dN/dS analysis could not be performed.

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	101	  Despite the claim that constraint should be the rule in overlapping reading frames, more recent reports indicate that some viral genomes demonstrate simultaneous positive and purifying selection.

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	104	, 2001) all show increased non-synonymous change in one ORF with concurrent dominance of synonymous change in an overlapping reading frame.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	105	 We suggest that the modularity displayed in the E2 dN/dS profile is a probable consequence of the presence of the E4 overlapping reading frame, and that the E2 hinge is the ideal genomic position in which to fix an overlapping gene.

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	136	, 1999), suggesting that specific DNA binding to L2 is necessary to obtain efficient packaging.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	137	 We therefore investigated gene transfer into COS-7 cells, using L1 and L2 synthetic peptides complexed with a pCMV- plasmid and a pPES-CMV- plasmid (El Mehdaoui et al.

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	141	 This suggested that the increase observed in gene transfer with L1 or L2 peptides is not due to differences in gene transfer efficiency of the two plasmids used, nor to a post-entry effect of PES on luciferase expression.

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Absence of DNA binding with PES-positive and PES-negative DNA sequences was observed for the SV40 Large T peptide (A=0 007 plus or minus 0 001 and 0 014 plus or minus 0 007, respectively).
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Increased DNA-binding activity to DNA sequences containing the PES sequence of BPV1 was observed for both the HPV 16 L1 Ctb peptide (0 390 plus or minus 0 040 versus 0 030 plus or minus 0 020) and the HPV 16 L2 Ct peptide (0 440 plus or minus 0 040 versus 0 030 plus or minus 0 020).
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	147	These findings indicated that gene transfer was enhanced in the presence of the BPV PES with all peptides that had the capacity to bind to DNA.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	148	 This confirmed that the PES is not papillomavirus type-specific and suggested that both L1 and L2 proteins recognized BPV PES.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	149	 In addition, the results suggested that the very low level of gene transfer observed with HPV-16 L1 Cta and HPV-31 L1 Ctb peptides in the presence of pCMV-Luc plasmid was not a consequence of the fact that these peptides have a higher affinity for papillomavirus DNA.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	150	Binding of positively charged peptides derived from HPV L1 or L2 proteins to heparin and cell GAGs As L1 and L2 positively charged sequences are able to transfer genes, it could be hypothesized that such peptides bind to DNA and to cells and that the NLS activity of such peptides sends the plasmid DNA to the nucleus where the reporter gene is expressed.

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	157	 To rule out the hypothesis that these findings were due to binding between peptides and VLPs, the interaction between HPV-31 VLPs and HPV-16 L1 Ctb, HPV-31 L1 Cta, HPV-45 L1 Ctb and HPV16 E4 Ag peptides was investigated by ELISA.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	158	 No binding (A < 0 050) of HPV-31 VLPs to any of the peptides investigated was observed.

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	160	 It should be noted that peptides that did not deliver genes into cells did not bind to heparin, nor did they bind efficiently to DNA.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	161	 In addition, the absence of binding of HPV-16 L19 VLPs to heparin (data not shown) confirmed and extended the results of Joyce et al.

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	177	, 2000), indicating that these amino acids are essential for DNA binding and gene transfer.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	178	 These findings are in agreement with those of Giroglou et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	179	 (2001) indicating that HPV-33 VLPs made of L1 protein lacking the last seven amino acids still bind to target cells since we identified a second positively charged sequence able to bind heparan sulfate at positions 472 to 481 of the C terminus of HPV-33 L1 protein.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	180	 However, they are not in agreement with the fact that HPV-33 VLPs made of L1 protein lacking the 22 last amino acids still bind to target cells, since this deletion partially deletes the second DNA- and heparin-binding sequence.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	181	 However, it should be noted that the VLPs used by Giroglou et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	182	 (2001) were composed of L1 and L2 proteins and that binding to heparin could be due to the presence of the two DNA- and heparin-binding sequences identified at the N and C termini of L2.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	183	Structural data available concerning L1 protein (Chen et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	184	, 2000) and immunological and DNA-binding data concerning L2 protein (Zhou et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	185	, 2002) suggest that the peptides tested in this study are inside the virions, where they would be expected to be unavailable for heparin and cell GAG binding.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	186	 However, gene transfer experiments using VLPs have indicated that VLP binding to DNA, to cells and to heparin is linked to the last C-terminal amino acids of the L1 protein (Joyce et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	187	, 2000), suggesting its presence at the surface of the VLPs.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The absence of heparin binding observed for HPV-16 L19 VLPs clearly suggests the involvement of this sequence in cell binding through its binding to GAGs.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	189	The role of the positively charged termini of the L2 protein in viral encapsidation has been fully established (Zhou et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The results of heparin binding obtained with L2 positively charged peptides raise the possibility that these sequences could also be involved in VLP and virion binding to the cell GAGs.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	191	 L1+L2 VLPs lacking either the N or C terminus of the L2 protein have been shown by immunoflurescence studies to bind to cells in the same way as wild-type VLPs (Roden et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	192	, 2001), suggesting that these sequences do not play a central role in binding to cells.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	193	 However, in the absence of data obtained with pseudovirions composed of L1 C-terminal mutants and L2 proteins (both wild-type and N-terminal mutants), it is difficult to conclude whether N-terminal positively charged sequences of the L2 protein are present on the virion surface and play a role in its binding to the cell or not.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	194	In conclusion, using synthetic peptides we have confirmed that the DNA binding of the HPV-16 L1 protein is due to the last C-terminal amino acids.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	195	 We also confirmed the binding properties of N- and C-terminal amino acids of the HPV-16 L2 protein.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In addition, we determined that a second positively charged sequence located upstream from the previous L1 sequence is able to bind DNA for some HPV types (HPV-33 and -45), but not, or not significantly, for other types (HPV-16, -31 and -58).
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The interaction between these DNA-binding peptides and DNA induced protection from DNase degradation and was sufficient to obtain gene transfer in COS-7 cells.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	198	 However, the level of gene transfer with a peptide was around 150 times less efficient than that observed with the corresponding sequence within the VLPs.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	199	 It was also shown that gene transfer is mediated by binding of DNA/peptide complexes to heparan sulfate receptors, as for VLPs, confirming that positively charged DNA complexes can enter cells after binding to membrane-associated sulfated proteoglycans (Mislick  and  Baldeschweiler, 1996; Mounkes et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	200	 In addition, our findings are in agreement with reports that the inclusion of L2 protein in the constitution of HPV VLPs increases their gene transfer capacity (Roden et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	201	, 2001) and thus suggests that L2 participates in DNA encapsidation and could play a role in binding to cells.

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	1	Herpes simplex virus 1 fuses with the plasma membrane of a host cell, and the incoming capsids are efficiently and rapidly transported across the cytosol to the nuclear pore complexes, where the viral DNA genomes are released into the nucleoplasm.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	2	 Using biochemical assays, immunofluorescence, and immunoelectron microscopy in the presence and absence of microtubule depolymerizing agents, it was shown that the cytosolic capsid transport in Vero cells was mediated by microtubules.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Antibody labeling revealed the attachment of dynein, a minus end-directed, microtubule-dependent motor, to the viral capsids.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	4	 We propose that the incoming capsids bind to microtubules and use dynein to propel them from the cell periphery to the nucleus.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	5	The entry of animal viruses into their host cells involves adsorption to cell surface receptors, penetration into the cytosol, and uncoating of the viral genome.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	6	 For viruses that replicate in the nucleus, entry also entails extensive movement of viruses and viral capsids through the cytoplasm.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Transport over long distances is particularly critical for viruses that infect neurons in which the site of entry can be located far from the cell body and the nucleus.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	8	Since movement of virus-sized particles through the cytosol is not likely to occur by free diffusion due to high viscosity and steric obstacles (Bray, 1992; Luby-Phelps, 1994), viruses most likely exploit the cell's motile functions for transport.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The limited information available suggests that viruses can make use of both microtubules (MT)1 and actin filaments.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	10	 EM analysis has shown MT binding of certain viral capsids, such as adenovirus and reovirus in vivo and in vitro (for review see Luftig, 1982) as well as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) in neurons (Lycke et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Way and co-workers have described actin filament-dependent intra- and intercellular transport of vaccinia virus during egress from cells (Cudmore et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Moreover, many viruses take advantage of the retrograde movement of endocytic organelles during entry.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	13	 They are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis and carried within coated vesicles and endosomes from the cell periphery toward the perinuclear area of the cell (see Greber et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	14	, 1994; Marsh and Helenius, 1989).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	15	In this study we have focused on the intracytosolic transport of incoming HSV-1 capsids in Vero cells.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	16	 HSV-1 has three structural components: capsid, tegument, and envelope.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The capsid consists of the viral DNA of 152 kbp and a proteinaceous shell comprising six different proteins; it has a diameter of 125 nm, and the proteins are arranged in an icosahedron formed by 12 pentons and 150 hexons (Booy et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	18	, 1974; Spear and Roizman, 1972).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	19	 VP5 constitutes the major protein component of both hexons and pentons (Newcomb et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The tegument is a protein layer between the envelope and the capsid and contains ~12 different viral polypeptides (Roizman and Furlong, 1974; Roizman and Sears, 1996).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	21	 While the functions of most of these remain to be identified, one is a protein kinase (LeMaster and Roizman, 1980), one induces shut off of host cell protein synthesis (Read and Frenkel, 1983), and some are known to be activators and modulators of viral gene expression (Batterson and Roizman, 1983; Campbell et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The viral envelope contains at least 12 different membrane proteins, some of which are involved in receptor binding and fusion.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	23	The infectious cycle begins with virus binding to heparan sulfate receptors on the cell surface followed by glycoprotein-mediated fusion of the envelope with the plasma membrane (for review see Spear, 1993).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	24	 After release into the cytosol and dissociation from some of the tegument components, the capsids move through the cytosol to the nucleus and bind to nuclear pores (Batterson et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	25	, 1988), whereafter the genome is released into the nucleus.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Transcription, replication of viral DNA, and assembly of progeny capsids take place within the host nucleus (for review see Roizman and Sears, 1996; Steven and Spear, 1996).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The synthesis of early viral proteins peaks after 4-6 h of virus entry, and the first progeny viruses are produced after 8 h (Honess and Roizman, 1973).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	28	We analyzed the transport of incoming HSV-1 capsids to the nucleus in fibroblasts and found that it occurs rapidly and efficiently by an MT-mediated mechanism.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The incoming capsids shed most of the associated tegument proteins and bind dynein, an MT-dependent, minus end- directed motor in the peripheral cytosol, whereafter they are transported along MT toward the cell center.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The viral capsids thus make use of the machinery responsible for retrograde organelle transport in animal cells.

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	379	 Labeling with [35S]methionine demonstrated that nocodazole had no overall effect on protein synthesis in uninfected or HSV-1-infected Vero cells (not shown).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	380	When immunofluorescence microscopy using ICP4 was performed, we found that, under control conditions, viral protein synthesis commenced in many cells already at 2 h postinfection.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	381	 In contrast, in the presence of nocodazole, only very few cells showed ICP4 labeling.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	382	 At 4 h postinfection, all control cells were strongly labeled for ICP4, whereas in the absence of MT, significantly less cells show strong labeling for ICP4 (data not shown).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	383	 However, at later time points, all cells synthezised ICP4, in the presence and absence of MT.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	384	Thus, depolymerization of MT delayed the onset of viral protein synthesis in cultured fibroblasts, but did not prevent viral infection per se.

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	386	Our results strongly suggested that incoming herpes capsids move along MT toward the nucleus.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	387	 Therefore, we ask whether they would use host MT-dependent motors for their transport.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	388	 Since the antibody against tubulin often obscured the morphology of putative tethering factors located between the viral capsids and the MT (see Fig.

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	391	 The morphology of the appendages was variable, but, in some cases (Fig.

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	400	 The appendages are visible at three, four, five, or all six corners visible in a section, which represent the pentons of a viral capsid.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	401	 Some of the appendices have a morphology very similar to purified cytoplasmic dynein (large arrow in d): a large globular stalk with two smaller globular head domains.

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	440	 More than 60% of the capsids delivered to the cytosol were transported to the nucleus within 4 h of uptake, and binding to fibers extending from the nuclear pore complexes seemed to occur.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	441	 The ratio of particles to plaque-forming units for HSV-1 is between 10 and 50 (Frenkel et al.

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	446	A majority of the capsids remained associated with nuclear pores after releasing their DNA (see also Batterson et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	447	 The apparent transient stability of the empty capsids contrasts with adenovirus, another virus that delivers its DNA to the nucleus through the nuclear pore complexes, for which no empty capsids could be detected at the nuclear pore complexes (Greber et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	448	 We cannot formally rule out that, even though the herpes capsids appeared empty at the nuclear membrane, viral DNA release had not been completed yet.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	449	Our results demonstrate that MT are involved in capsid transport from the cell surface to the nucleus.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	450	 Since the distance from the plasma membrane to the nucleus in Vero cells is not as large as in neurons, MT-assisted transport was not essential for infection, but it accelerated both the transfer of the capsids to the nucleus and the onset of viral protein synthesis.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	451	 Having first detached from most of the tegument proteins at the plasma membrane, the capsids moved in minus end direction along MT to the MTOC.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	452	 From there, they were transferred to the nuclear pores by unknown mechanisms.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	453	 At early times (1-2 h PI), the majority of the capsids associated with the nuclear membrane proximal to the MTOC, but later the distribution became more homogenous around the nucleus.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	454	Nocodazole and colchicine, which both depolymerize MT, and vinblastine, which causes MT paracrystal formation, reduced capsid accumulation at the nuclear envelope.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	455	 These drugs were also reported to reduce the amount of infectious HSV-1 recovered from rat dorsal root ganglia infected in vitro (Kristensson et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	456	, 1986) and from the trigeminal ganglia after inoculation of the murine cornea (Topp et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	457	 We think that it is very likely that capsids derived from virions bound to the "apical" plasma membrane in our system (see Fig.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	458	 5 a) reached the nucleus independent of MT, since the distance between the apical plasma membrane and the nuclear membrane is only ~200-300 nm.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	459	 Thus, the larger the distance between the plasma membrane where the virion had bound and the nucleus, the more the transport to the nucleus depended on MT.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	460	 In contrast with the results obtained in neurons (Kristensson et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	461	, 1986), taxol, which stabilizes MT, did not reduce the efficiency of capsid transport, suggesting that the dynamic turnover or "treadmilling" of MT was not required for capsid transport in Vero cells.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	462	 Depolymerization of actin filaments by cytochalasin D had no effect either on HSV-1 internalization or transport to the nucleus.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	463	The presence of dynein heavy chains in the material attached to the cytosolic capsids indicated that the MT-mediated transport was powered by cytoplasmic dynein.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	464	 Cytoplasmic dynein is a multisubunit protein complex of 1,270 kD consisting of two heavy chains, two to three intermediate chains, and a variable number of small subunits (Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994; Schroer, 1994).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	465	 It has a length of ~40-50 nm and a shape reminiscent of the letter Y.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	466	 The two head domains contain the MT binding and ATPase sites, while the base interacts with the cargo (Gilbert and Sloboda, 1989; Vale, 1990; Vallee et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	467	 Dynein is responsible for minus end-directed movement of chromosomes and membrane organelles along MT (Cole and LippincottSchwartz, 1995; Mitchison, 1988).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	468	 Since the plus ends of MT are localized in the periphery of Vero cells close to the plasma membrane and the minus ends are anchored at the perinuclear MTOC, dynein seems a logical choice as a motor for the transport of incoming viral capsids to the nucleus.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	469	 The same applies to the axons of neurons, where the MT have their plus ends toward the synapse, and the minus end anchored at the MTOC in the cell body (Black and Baas, 1989).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	470	 Although some kinesin-like MT minus end-directed motors have been implicated to play a role in mitosis and meiosis, none of them has been demonstrated to be involved in interphase transport processes (Barton and Goldstein, 1996; Hirokawa, 1996).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	471	 Since the MT-mediated transport that is crucial for infection of neurons also operates in cultured fibroblasts, its analysis will be greatly facilitated.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	472	It is believed that dynein attachment to vesicles and kinetochores requires another large multimeric complex, called dynactin, which contains 10 different proteins (Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994; Schroer, 1994; Vallee and Sheetz, 1996).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	473	 So far, receptor molecules for dynein and dynactin have not been identified on any cargo structures, but several studies indicate that the activity of dynein and its binding to cargo may be regulated by phosphorylation (Allen, 1995; Dillman and Pfister, 1994; Lin et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	474	 Whether the binding of dynein to HSV-1 capsids involves dynactin or other cellular components and whether it is regulated by phosphorylation remains unclear at this point.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	475	 The viral protein(s) that serve as dynein receptors also remain to be identified.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	476	 Since the polypeptide composition of the capsids and tegument is known, some potential candidates can, however, be singled out.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	477	 The capsid itself contains six different proteins.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	478	 Of these, only VP5 is known to be located at the pentons (Trus et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	479	, 1992), which were the sites of preferential attachment of proteinaceous material onto cytosolic capsids shown here.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	480	 In addition to the bona fide capsid polypeptides, components derived from the tegument are also likely to be present.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	481	 For example, VP1-2, a 270-kD protein, is particularly tightly associated with the capsids (Roizman and Furlong, 1974) and may constitute part of the material seen attached to the pentons in our electron micrographs.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	482	 Taking advantage of the relative simplicity of the capsids, of existing virus mutants, and of the complete genomic sequence of the virus, work is in progress to identify and to characterize the dynein receptor in HSV-1 capsids.

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	4	The HPV E2 protein plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	5	 E2 proteins are transcription factors that can repress transcription of the E6 and E7 genes of the genital papillomaviruses independently of their oncogenic potential (4 to 8).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Transcriptional repression was shown to result from binding of E2 to sequences within the E6 and E7 early promoters of high risk as well as low risk HPVs (5, 9 to 12).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Other properties of the E2 proteins are also conserved, such as their ability to activate transcription of heterologous promoters containing at least two E2 binding sites in a specific configuration and to activate viral DNA replication in concert with the E1 helicase (13).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Comparative analyses of E2 proteins of high risk and low risk HPV viruses suggested a high degree of conservation in their three-dimensional structure, compatible with their conserved functions in viral DNA replication and transcription (14 to 17).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	9	E2 proteins have also been shown to directly influence host cell biology.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In particular, proapoptotic activity has been demonstrated for the HPV18 E2 protein (18, 19) as well as the HPV16 E2 protein (20) and was shown to be an intrinsic property independent of transcription (18, 19).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	11	 More recently, an interaction between E2 and mitotic chromosomes was described through direct interaction with Brd4, a bromodomain protein associated with acetylated chromatin (21).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	12	 E2 is also associated with the mitotic spindles via tubulin interactions, which was proposed to take part in the segregation of viral genomes during cell division (22).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Finally, we also recently described a novel interaction of high risk HPV E2 proteins with activators of the mitotic ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) which, by inhibiting the degradation of various APC/C substrates, results in a strong genomic instability (23).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These additional functions of the E2 proteins are mediated by direct interactions with cellular proteins rather than through transcriptional control and were shown to be independent of other viral functions.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	15	The E2 proteins are composed of three distinct domains that can be expressed separately and retain their function (24).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The carboxyl-terminal domain forms a small -barrel dimer which binds to specific recognition sequences on the DNA (25).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	17	 A hinge domain, with no specific structure, mainly serves as a flexible linker between the two functional domains.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The amino-terminal domain is composed of two sub-domains separated by a fulcrum; one contains three -helices (at its amino-terminal end), and the other is composed of a succession of -sheets (at its carboxyl-terminal end) (15, 16).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The amino-terminal domain retains functions of E2 involved in regulating transcription and replication.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Above all, it has been shown to interact with cellular proteins involved in transactivation as well as with the E1 helicase that activates viral DNA replication (15, 26) and with Brd4 involved in episomal segregation during mitosis (21).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Other characteristics, such as ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (24) as well as induction of apoptosis (19) involve this domain.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The proapoptotic property of HPV18 E2 has been shown to depend on induction of the extrinsic pathway through activation of caspase 8 (19).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The exact mechanism of this activation is not yet understood, but it appears that E2 activates caspase 8 through direct protein-protein interaction.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	24	5 Induction of apoptosis has also been shown to occur with the HPV16 E2 protein, although the mechanism is not fully understood (20).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	25	In the present work we sought to examine whether some of the autonomous properties of the HPV E2 proteins could differ among virus types, as was shown before for the E6 and E7 proteins.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We examined whether the proapoptotic property of the HPV18 E2 protein is conserved among E2 proteins of other genital HPV subtypes.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	27	 We fused GFP at the amino terminus of the HPV16, HPV11, and HPV6 E2 proteins and used recombinant adenoviruses to express them as previously described for HPV18 E2 (19).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Subcellular localization of the E2 proteins appeared strikingly different; the E2 proteins from low risk viruses HPV6 and HPV11 were exclusively nuclear, whereas proteins from high risk viruses were located in both the nucleus and in the cytoplasm.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	29	 We show that HPV18 E2 protein actively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the infected cells and that partial cytoplasmic localization of high risk E2 proteins correlates with induction of apoptosis through caspase 8 activation.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In contrast E2 proteins of low risk HPVs do not induce apoptosis due to their exclusive nuclear localization.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	31	 These experiments point to important differences in the biological functions of the E2 proteins from high and low risk papillomaviruses infecting the anogenital tract.

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	99	 These experiments indicated that the full-length HPV18 and HPV16 E2 proteins did not accumulate to high levels, partly due to the emergence of specific cleavage products and degradation with increasing m.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The cleavage products were inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD in vivo (Fig.

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Thus, we can conclude from this experiment that the stabilization of E2 does not seem to change the apoptotic phenotype whether the E2 protein is proapoptotic, like high risk HPV18 E2, or not, like low risk HPV11 E2 protein.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	108	High Risk HPV E2 Proteins Induce Apoptosis via a Common Mechanism Involving Caspase 8 Activation in Different Cell Lines Clear differences in the behavior of the E2 proteins from high risk HPVs compared with low risk HPVs in inducing apoptosis was also demonstrated in other cell lines such as breast cancer MCF7 cells, containing a wild-type p53, and osteosarcoma Saos cells, which lack p53 (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	109	 We deduced from these experiments that the E2 proteins from low risk viruses are unable to induce high levels of apoptosis in conditions where E2 proteins from high risk viruses were efficient apoptotic inducers.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	110	We tested whether the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD could inhibit HPV16 as well as HPV18 E2-induced apoptosis as demonstrated before (19).

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	191	 These observations suggested that the HPV18 E2 protein could possess a NES in its amino-terminal domain (34, 35).

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	212	 To further investigate the process of E2 nuclear export, we used leptomycin B, an inhibitor of CRM1, which is one of the main exportins responsible for protein export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	224	 The two amino-terminal deleted HPV18 E2 proteins strikingly differ in their proapoptotic abilities; E2-del53, which is exclusively nuclear, did not induce apoptosis above background, whereas E2-del26, which is partly cytoplasmic, was a strong inducer of apoptosis (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	225	 These results led us to examine the behavior of the NLS point mutants described above.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	226	 We examined the level of apoptosis induced by the HPV18 E2 mutant that has been rendered more nuclear by the addition of the hinge NLS of HPV11 E2.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Our experiments indicated an intermediate phenotype between wild-type E2 and the amino-terminal deleted E2 protein that was difficult to quantify precisely in transfection experiments.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	228	 In contrast, the cytoplasmic NLS mutant HPV11 E2 protein could induce apoptosis, as measured by direct observation and annexin labeling, to higher levels compared with the HPV11 E2 wild-type protein (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	229	 We deduced from these experiments that differences in the induction of apoptosis between the two types of E2 proteins were not due to inherent differences in effector functions but, rather, to their different subcellular localization.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	230	One of the most notable differences between the E2 proteins of the two types of HPV viruses was their subcellular localization.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Although the HPV11 and HPV6 E2 proteins were exclusively nuclear in many cell types tested, the HPV16 and HPV18 proteins were also found in the cytoplasm.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	232	 We could show that these differences in behavior were due to the fact that a dominant functional NLS was present in the hinge domain of the HPV11 E2 protein (33) and absent from the HPV18 and HPV16 E2 proteins.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	233	 In addition, we showed that HPV18 E2 contains an NES in its amino-terminal domain that is responsible for active export of the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (that was repressed by leptomycin B).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Furthermore, inactivating point mutations of the strong NLS of HPV11 E2 protein lead to a clear delocalization of the protein to the cytoplasm of transfected cells, indicating that this NLS is sufficient to explain the strict nuclear localization of the full-length proteins.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	235	 In contrast, more complex phenomena probably dictate the localization of the HPV18 E2 as none of the NLSs appeared sufficient to induce nuclear retention.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	236	 In contrast, a NES is able to delocalize the protein to the cytoplasm, so the subcellular localization of the protein seems to be tightly regulated by a complex interplay of signals and active nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	237	As transcription and replication factors, E2 proteins should be primarily expressed in the nuclei of infected cells during the normal viral life cycle.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Other functions of the high risk virus E2 proteins could account for their cytoplasmic localization, and we have shown that their proapoptotic activity could be one of them.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	239	 There are clear differences between the E2 proteins of the high risk or low risk viruses in inducing apoptosis.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Although E2 proteins from both high risk viruses were able to induce apoptosis at equivalent rates in different cell types, the E2 proteins from low risk viruses were unable to do so.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Caspase 8 activation could be detected in both HPV16- and HPV18 E2-expressing cells, indicating that the mechanism of apoptotic cell death was probably conserved between these two viruses.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	242	 In addition, using mutants of the E2 proteins, we could show that apoptosis is linked to the cytoplasmic expression of E2, linking apoptosis to the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling rather than to inherent properties of the E2 protein.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	243	There are several other viral proteins that have been shown to activate apoptosis of infected cells through various mechanisms (for review, see Refs.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	244	 38 to 40), although the exact role of this specific function in the viral life cycle is generally not fully understood.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Among these viral proteins, there are some that have been shown to induce apoptosis through caspase 8 activation, such as the lyssavirus matrix protein (41), the NS3 protein of hepatitis C (42), or HBx of hepatitis B.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	246	 HBx, among various pleiotropic functions, is a transcription factor that is expressed both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of infected cells.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The cytoplasmic HBx protein can activate caspase 8 by repressing c-FLIP through direct protein interaction, rendering the cells hypersensitive to tumor necrosis- apoptotic activation (43).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of proteins is a frequent event accompanying induction of apoptosis.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Many apoptotic proteins have to be expressed in a specific cellular compartment to be efficient and probably to allow direct protein-protein interactions.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Examples of viral proapototic proteins, which are expressed both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of infected cells, are apoptin, the viral protein associated with chicken anemia and E4orf4 of adenovirus.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Contrary to E2, apoptin has to be expressed in the nucleus to exert its proapoptotic function (44).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	252	 In contrast, E4orf4 exerted its proapoptotic activity by two distinct pathways, one in the nucleus and the other in the cytoplasm (45).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Caspase 8 activation occurs via the extrinsic death pathway as a consequence of the activation of the death-inducing signal complex through death receptors at the cytoplasmic membrane (46).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Because E2 is an intracellular protein, caspase activation might occur within the cytoplasm by direct action on the proteins of the death-inducing signal complex or directly on caspase 8 itself.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	255	 We do not yet know the exact mechanism by which E2 activates apoptosis, but it is clearly due to direct interactions of E2 with cytoplasmic substructures containing activated caspase 8 (results not shown).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	256	Why might viruses induce apoptosis of the infected cells? A plethora of viral proteins inducing apoptosis has been described indicating that the proapoptotic functions play a universal role during the viral life cycle (for review, see Refs.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	257	 One possibility is that apoptosis might help the newly created particles at the end of the viral life cycle to escape from the host cell and spread out.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	258	 This hypothesis, however, raises the question of why this function is not conserved in low risk HPVs.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	259	 There are at least two possibilities.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	260	 First, the low risk E2 proteins could be more efficient in inducing apoptosis in a more physiological situation, in co-expression with other viral proteins, for instance, that could help E2 to shuttle to the cytoplasm.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	261	 This is a particularly attractive hypothesis, since we have shown that the low risk HPV E2 proteins can induce apoptosis if they are artificially directed to the cytoplasm of infected cells.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Another possibility is that this function is expressed by another viral protein, such as E4 for instance, which is a viral protein expressed at later time points in the viral cycle and which has been shown to induce apoptosis (48).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	263	 An alternative hypothesis is that E6 and E7 proteins of high risk HPVs modify the cell cycle and block cellular differentiation.

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	265	 The proapoptotic activity of the high risk E2 proteins would be required to overcome these effects, contrary to the low risk infected cells, where many of the E6 and E7 functions are not conserved.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	266	 The proapoptotic activity of high risk E2 proteins, however, could explain why the high risk viral genomes integrated into the cellular DNA preferentially with disruption of the E2 ORF, with this disruption leading to higher transcription of the E6 and E7 oncogenes and carcinogenic progression.

0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	99	 There were no major differences in proliferation rate between pre-treatment samples from IFN- responders (8 to 50 %, median 35 %) and non-responders (22 to 35 %, median 35 %), or during (10 to 54 %, median 28 %) and after (19 to 47 %, median 37 5 %) IFN- treatment (Table 2).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	100	 More specifically, in the IFN--treated group, in available samples from eight responding patients, the Ki-67 index increased in half and decreased in half of the patients, during or after treatment (Table 2).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	101	 In available samples from the 3/4 IFN- non-responding patients that could be analysed, the Ki-67 index increased in one and decreased in the remaining two patients during or after treatment (Table 2).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	102	In this study, biopsies from 25 respiratory papillomatosis patients, 18 of whom had been subjected to IFN- treatment, were examined for the presence of HPV and to determine viral load and proliferation rate in order to find a possible means of IFN- action and to identify patients who might benefit from therapy.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	103	Of the respiratory papillomatosis biopsies investigated, the majority were determined to be HPV positive, which was similar to previous observations (Lie et al.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Furthermore, also similar to previous studies, HPV6 and HPV11 were found to be the predominant HPV types (Kimberlin  and  Malis, 2000; Rabah et al.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	105	 We also noted a dominance of HPV6 among the Swedish cases, while HPV11 dominated among the Finnish cases (data not shown), showing a variation that has been described previously in other populations (Rabah et al.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	106	Of the patients who were subjected to IFN- therapy, the majority (67 %) responded successfully, which is similar to previously published results (Deunas et al.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	107	 There was no evident difference in age or in the presence of HPV in patients who were or were not subjected to IFN- treatment or who responded.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	108	 However, males were dominant as a whole and more so in the IFN--treated group (Table 1).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	109	Biopsies taken prior to IFN- treatment were available for the majority of the treated patients and presence of HPV was demonstrated by PCR in 11/16 cases and 73 % of the HPV-positive cases responded to therapy.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	110	 It is remarkable that HPV could not be detected in some biopsies before treatment, but this could be due in part to a low viral load.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	111	 In fact, among the five pre-treatment respiratory papillomatosis cases that were originally determined as HPV negative, two biopsies taken later during IFN- treatment were HPV6 positive and these two patients also responded to IFN- treatment.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	112	Summarizing the data on HPV and HPV type, a tendency was observed for HPV6 cases to respond more readily to therapy than HPV11 and HPV-negative cases, but this difference was not statistically significant, although it was close to the borderline (P=0 067) between the HPV6 and HPV-negative groups.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	113	 We have no explanation for the tendency of HPV6-positive papillomas to respond more readily to IFN- treatment than the HPV11-positive cases; however, it has been suggested HPV11-associated papillomatosis is more aggressive than HPV6-associated disease (Rabah et al.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Furthermore, a correlation between virus genotype and response to IFN treatment has been noted for other viruses such as hepatitis C virus (Tan  and  Katze, 2001).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	115	The viral load varied considerably among biopsies, and patients with various pre-treatment loads responded to IFN- therapy, indicating that patients with a low as well as a high viral load can respond to IFN-.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	116	 In addition, viral load was generally not significantly affected during IFN- treatment, although in some HPV6 cases the viral load had a tendency to decrease, while the opposite tendency was observed for the HPV11 cases.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Nevertheless, a significant increase in viral load could be observed after IFN- withdrawal in four cases (Table 2), indicating a risk for rebound phenomena, observed in clinical practice as an increase in the numbers of papillomas (Kimberlin  and  Malis, 2000).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	118	The absence of influence of IFN- on viral load during treatment was not anticipated and could possibly be due to the limited number of patients included in this study.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	119	 However, this has been reported previously although not by quantitative PCR (Steinberg et al.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	120	It is possible that IFN- exerts its mechanisms by other means.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	121	 One possibility is enhancement of an immunological response against the HPV-infected cells, for example by increasing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression (Grander  and  Einhorn, 1998).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	122	 An increase in MHC expression would consequently increase the ability of the immune system to respond to and combat HPV-positive respiratory papillomatosis, without directly influencing the viral load extensively in the remaining respiratory papillomatosis cells during treatment.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	123	 This mechanism could also explain why cell proliferation was not affected during IFN- treatment as discussed below.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	124	Another possibility could be that IFN increases the rate of apoptosis in virus-infected cells.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	125	 This could also lead to a decreased amount of papilloma cells, but with maintained levels of virus.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	126	 IFN- has been shown to act pro-apoptotically in neoplastic cells and we have recently found that expression of the HPV16 E7 oncogene may sensitize tumour cells to IFN-induced apoptosis (Thyrell et al.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Whether induction of apoptosis explains the clinical effects of IFN- in respiratory papillomatosis, however, remains to be investigated.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	128	IFN- is also known to exert anti-proliferative effects in many cell types and this has been suggested also to be of importance in its anti-neoplastic activities (Grander  and  Einhorn, 1998).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	129	Cell proliferation was determined by the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells by immunohistochemistry and there was no significant difference between the cell proliferation observed in patients treated and not treated with IFN-.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Moreover, the Ki-67 index was not significantly affected during IFN- treatment and did not differ significantly between patients who responded or did not respond to IFN- therapy, which was unexpected.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	131	 To our knowledge, there have been no other reports on comparison on the effect of IFN- on the proliferation rate in respiratory papillomatosis.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	132	HPV clearly induces perturbed regulation of the cell cycle, manifested in the relatively high percentage of cycling cells in most papillomas.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	133	 IFN- seems to act as an anti-proliferative agent through alterations impinging on the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase complexes, and the HPV-induced alteration in the cell-cycle machinery may be responsible for the lack of IFN--induced anti-proliferative effects (Sangfelt et al.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	134	 IFN- may also exert its anti-tumour function by other means, such as inhibition of angiogenesis, as well as induction of differentiation (Grander  and  Einhorn, 1998), which could play a role in the papillomatosis setting, although this needs to be studied in detail.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	135	In conclusion, this is one of few studies investigating the putative anti-tumour effects of IFN- in vivo during treatment, aimed at defining the mechanism of action of IFN-, as well as defining predictive markers for IFN- therapy.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	136	 One reason for the limited number of similar studies is that IFN- treatment is not used as a standard therapy for RRP.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Nevertheless, even though the RRP patient group in this study was heterogeneous (age, clinical course, treatment strategy), most IFN--treated patients responded to therapy.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Furthermore, there was a tendency for HPV6-positive cases to respond better than HPV-11-positive and HPV-negative cases to IFN- therapy.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Interestingly, in this highly IFN--responsive disease, the prominent anti-tumour effects were not reflected as IFN--induced changes in fundamental disease-related parameters, such as viral load and the hyperproliferative state of the HPV-affected epithelium.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Finally, although this study does not conclusively pinpoint the mechanism for successful IFN- treatment, it suggests that some of these analysed factors can be ruled out as possible markers for response prediction.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The study also indicates areas for future investigation aimed at selecting patients who may benefit from IFN- treatment.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	7	The small circular double-stranded DNA genome of papillomavirus is actively maintained as a multicopy episome in the nucleus of infected epithelial cells.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This process is dependent on replication of the viral genome by the viral E1 and E2 proteins, in conjunction with the host DNA replication machinery.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	9	 E2 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that has a number of functions in the viral lifecycle.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In addition to its role in the initiation of viral DNA replication, E2 is involved in regulating the transcription of viral genes (2-7), and in the segregation of the viral genome during cell division (8, 9).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	11	 As a replication initiation factor, E2 binds with high affinity to specific sites located within the viral origin (ori) to help recruit it to the E1 helicase (10-13).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Formation of a ternary complex between E1, E2, and the origin relies not only on the interaction of E1 and E2 with specific DNA sequences at the origin but is also critically dependent on a direct interaction between these two proteins (14-18).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	13	The 40-kDa E2 protein exists in solution as a dimer and consists of an N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of 200 residues, a C-terminal DNA binding/dimerization domain of 100 residues, and a connecting "hinge" region of 70 amino acids (19).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The N-terminal TAD is the region of E2 that binds to E1 (14, 15, 18).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	15	Crystal structures have been reported for the TAD of HPV16 (amino acids 1-201) (20) and for a truncated TAD of HPV18 (amino acids 66-215) lacking two N-terminal -helices (21).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The HPV16 and -18 TADs share 45% sequence identity (see Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	17	 1) and have a very similar L-shaped structure composed of a three-helix bundle, partly missing in the structure of the truncated HPV18 TAD, followed by an antiparallel -sheet.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	27	  We recently described a series of small molecules that antagonize the E1-E2 protein-protein interaction by binding reversibly to the E2 TAD (22, 23).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This class of inhibitors, termed "indandiones" because they feature an indandione system spirofused onto a substituted tetrahydrofuran ring, blocks assembly of the HPV11 E1-E2-ori ternary complex at submicromolar concentrations in vitro and abrogates viral DNA replication in a transient transfection assay.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	29	 To our knowledge, these are the only small molecule inhibitors of HPV DNA replication with cellular activity.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	30	Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of the HPV11 TAD and that of a TAD-indandione inhibitor complex.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The HPV11 TAD structure is very similar to that of the analogous domains of HPV16 and -18.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Inhibitor binding does not significantly affect the protein backbone but results in the formation of a deep pocket that makes several well defined interactions with the inhibitor.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Residues that have previously been implicated in binding E1 or the indandione inhibitors, including Gln-12 (24), Glu-39 (25-27), and Glu-100 (23) are in or near this pocket.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The indandione moiety of inhibitor B (left-most portion in the view shown) is well above the protein surface, 7 A from the nearest residue in the binding pocket.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	188	 C, stereo view of selected amino acids within 4 A of inhibitor A are shown as they appear in the apo structure (magenta) and in the inhibitor-TAD complex (green).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Inhibitor A is shown in orange.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The relative positions of residues are based on an all C- superposition of the two structures.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Thin green lines indicate hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor carboxylate and main chain amide nitrogens of residues 99 and 100.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	192	  Because we had demonstrated that the TAD and inhibitor 1 form a 1:1 complex in solution, we were surprised to find two molecules of inhibitor bound per protein monomer (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	193	 We believe that the molecule referred to below as inhibitor A is the one that binds tightly in biological assays (see below).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	194	 In contrast, inhibitor B appears to interact only weakly with a secondary binding pocket, formed not only by the TAD protein alone, but also in part by one surface of inhibitor A, as well as by residues from an adjacent protein monomer in the crystal lattice.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In fact, inhibitor B has approximately equal surface area in contact with each of the two TAD molecules, as well as with inhibitor A (data not shown).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	196	 The close contact between the two inhibitor molecules may distort the observed interaction between the TAD and the dichlorophenyl ring of inhibitor A (see below).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The TAD-TAD interface that incorporates inhibitor B is distinct from that in the apo structure, and in fact does not result in formation of a dimer, but rather an infinite array (along the 41 screw axis of the crystal), which is unlikely to exist in solution except at very high protein and inhibitor concentrations.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	198	To further demonstrate that the region of the TAD near inhibitor A constitutes a better binding pocket than does the one near B, a computational analysis of the protein surface was performed using the Site Finder application within the MOE software package (see "Experimental Procedures").
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	199	 This program uses an shape-based algorithm (44) to identify concave regions on the protein surface.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Furthermore, it evaluates whether these cavities have an appropriate composition of hydrophobic and hydrophilic atoms, as hydrophilic cavities are likely to be highly solvated and thus interact only weakly with organic molecules in aqueous solution.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The TAD surface was evaluated after removal of the two inhibitors, and residues that comprised the best small molecule-binding pocket are highlighted in Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Inhibitor A makes a number of close contacts with these highlighted residues, as described below.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Inhibitor B is located on the periphery of this pocket and does not make any well defined hydrogen bonding or Van der Waals interactions.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The dichlorophenyl ring of inhibitor B is 4 A from the nearest pocket atoms; other portions of the molecule are further from the protein surface (indandione moiety) or make closest contact with non-pocket atoms (thiadiazoylphenyl moiety).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	205	In a separate computational study, binding energies for each inhibitor molecule to the TAD (in the absence of the other) were predicted using three different empirical protein-binding scoring functions (Table III).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	206	 As expected, results significantly favored binding of inhibitor A relative to B, with predicted binding energies 2-fold higher for inhibitor A.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Taken together, these different methods suggest that inhibitor A is solely responsible for inhibition at the low concentrations used in biological assays and that the presence of inhibitor B might be an artifact of crystallization.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	208	 This suggestion is further supported by the mutational analysis of the inhibitor binding pocket, presented below.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Although an artifact, it is possible that the fortuitous presence of this second molecule aided in crystallization of the complex.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	210	View this table:    TABLE III Estimated binding affinities for inhibitors A and B.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	211	Three empirical scoring functions were applied to compound 1 bound in the location of either inhibitor A or B.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	212	 For PMF (35) and PLP (36), a lower (more negative) score indicates better affinity, whereas for LUDI (37) a higher score predicts better affinity.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	213	 For each program, scores are proportional to predicted binding energies.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	216	 However, binding of this inhibitor induces significant movement of several amino acid side chains.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	217	 The indandione moiety of the inhibitor is buried in a pocket that is not present in the apo structure, but results from rotations of the side chains of Tyr-19 (1, 85 degrees ; 2, 40 degrees ) and His-32 (2, 90 degrees ) (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	218	 In the apo structure, the aromatic rings of His-32 and Trp-33 form a T-shaped edge-to-face structure, with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-19 close enough to form a hydrogen bond with the -nitrogen of His-32.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	219	 In the complex structure, this interaction is lost and the rings of His-32 and Trp-33 become parallel to each other.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Two other side chains, Leu-94 and Glu-100, also adjust their conformations to accommodate the inhibitor (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Together, these changes in side chain conformation result in the formation of the observed binding pocket (Fig.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Residues surrounding the shallow end of the binding pocket are colored red.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	226	  The new positions of Tyr-19 and His-32 not only open up the pocket, but also allow the indandione moiety of the inhibitor to become a middle layer of a three-tier -stacking interaction between His-32 and Trp-33.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Additional Van der Waals contacts from the Leu-94 side chain result in a highly complementary shape to the deepest part of the pocket.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Two other important interactions are made with the backbone nitrogen atoms of Tyr-99 and Glu-100; the distance (2.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	229	77 A) and angle between these atoms and the inhibitor carboxylate oxygens suggests the formation of strong hydrogen bonds (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	230	Remaining contacts of inhibitor A with the pocket are less well defined hydrophobic interactions.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	231	 The dichlorophenyl ring lies in a wider but shallower portion of the pocket without making obvious specific interactions.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Although it has been found in previous studies (22) that both chlorine atoms contribute significantly to binding, neither atom is very close to the protein; the closest one being 4 A from the Tyr-19 side chain.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The observed position of the dichlorophenyl ring may be due in part to distortions induced by crystal packing or the presence of the second inhibitor molecule, as discussed above.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	234	 The thiadiazolylphenyl group lies along the protein surface outside of the pocket.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Notably, the phenyl-thiadiazole bond is close to the side chain of Met-101.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	236	 This finding is consistent with recent photoaffinity labeling experiments2 in which the carbon atom para to the amide bond of an analogue was found to be covalently linked to the terminal carbon of Met-101 (see Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	237	Mutational Analysis of the Inhibitor Binding Pocket Several residues in or near the inhibitor binding pocket were mutated to examine the roles of specific side chains in binding the indandione, as well as gain insight into the possible overlap between the E1- and inhibitor-binding sites.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Most residues were mutated to Ala, but a few residues were replaced by amino acids found in other HPV types: His-32 was changed to Tyr as found in HPV16 E2, whereas Ile-30, Met-31, and Ile-36 were changed to Val, Leu, and Met, respectively, as found in HPV6 E2.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	239	 These last three residues are the only ones in the vicinity of inhibitor A that are different between HPV11 and -6 E2.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Also included in this study was the amino acid substitution I73A that is located on the opposite face of the protein and was previously shown to specifically affect the transactivation activity of E2 rather than its replication or E1 binding activity (25).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Each mutant protein was produced by in vitro translation and tested in our previously described E1-E2-ori complex formation assay using radiolabeled origin DNA (Table IV).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	242	 The ability of each protein to interact with E1 was scored qualitatively, because we did not control for variations in the level of protein produced in the in vitro transcription-translation reaction and, in any case, could not assess the proper folding or stability of the proteins.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Most mutant proteins retained at least some ability to productively interact with E1 at the origin.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	245	E1-E2-ori complex assembly reactions were carried out using in vitro translated HPV11 E2, E1-containing extract, and 33P-labeled origin DNA (see "Experimental Procedures").
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	246	 A signal of 3100 cpm and signal: background (S:B) ratio = 21 was observed in assays performed with wild type E2.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	247	 For mutant E2 proteins, E1-E2-ori complex formation was scored qualitatively as follows: + +  >  1000 cpm and S:B  >  8; + = 500-1000 cpm and S:B = 3-8; +/- = 150-500 cpm and S:B = 2-3.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	248	 IC50 values for compound 2 (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	249	 3) were determined by measuring complex assembly in the presence of compound concentrations ranging from 2 nM to 40  microM.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Values shown are the average from duplicate determinations which in most cases differed by 30% or less.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	251	  We also determined the sensitivity of these mutant proteins to inhibitor 2 (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	252	 3), an analogue of compound 1 that we have described previously (23).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	253	 A number of substitutions had little if any effect on interaction with E1 or on inhibitor binding.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	254	 These included V64A and K68A, which interact with inhibitor molecule B in the inhibitor-TAD complex, thereby providing further evidence that binding of this second molecule is not relevant to inhibition.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	255	Substitutions I30V/M31L and I36M, which make the HPV11 TAD more similar to that of HPV6 E2, also had little effect on inhibition.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	256	 These results suggest that none of these three residues are responsible for the 30-fold weaker affinity of HPV6 E2 for compound 2 (23).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	257	 In further support that these residues do not play a major role in the type selectivity of the indandione inhibitors, we found that the corresponding mutations (V30I/L31M and M36I) in HPV6 E2 also had little effect on inhibition (data not shown).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	258	Other substitutions (L15A, Y19A, E39A, and S98A) produced inactive or weakly active proteins.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	259	 In principle this could indicate either that these side chains are directly involved in interaction with E1, or that the mutant proteins are not properly folded.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	260	 The low signals obtained with the Y19A and E39A E2 proteins in the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay were insufficient to assess inhibition.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	261	Substitution of Gln-12, His-32, Leu-43, Ser-65, and Ile-73 had a more deleterious effect on compound binding (IC50 values) than on interaction with E1, suggesting that these residues may have a specific role in binding the inhibitor.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	262	 However, three of these substitutions are at the periphery of the inhibitor-binding site (Gln-12, Leu-43, and Ser-65), and Ile-73 is on the opposite face of the protein.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	263	 A possible rationale for these observations is discussed below.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	264	 In contrast, His-32 is in direct contact with the biologically relevant inhibitor A.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	265	 The presence of a tyrosine instead of a histidine at position 32 of the E2 proteins of HPV16, -18, and -31, (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	266	 1) may contribute to the insensitivity of these proteins to the indandione class of inhibitors.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Consistent with this proposal, we found in other studies3 that an HPV31 E2 carrying the double amino acid substitution D31M/Y32H was significantly more sensitive to compound 2 (IC50 = 6  microM) than its WT counterpart (IC50 = 70  microM), when tested in an assay format similar to that used to generate the results reported in Table IV.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Finally, a particularly interesting result, which we have noted previously (23), was the improved affinity of E100A E2 for this class of inhibitors.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	269	Biophysical and Functional Characterization of Purified Mutant E2 TADs Because the roles of Tyr-19 and Glu-39 in the binding of E1 or inhibitors could not be assessed using the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay, we produced the corresponding mutant TAD proteins in E.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	270	 coli to carry out additional assays and biophysical studies.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	271	 We also expressed the L15A TAD, for which a moderately reduced affinity for E1 and inhibitor 2 were observed, as well as the I73A and E100A proteins, to better understand the significant effects of these two mutations on inhibitor binding.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Analysis of all these proteins by circular dichroism indicated no significant change in secondary structure compared with the WT (data not shown).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	273	 The thermal stability of each mutant protein was determined by differential scanning calorimetry and found to be comparable with that of the WT TAD, with the L15A protein being reproducibly the least stable (Table V).

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Values shown are averages of two determinations that differed by less than 0.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Dissociation constants for compound 3 were determined using a tight-binding equation (see data in Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Parameters for inhibition of E1 ATPase activity were determined using a three-parameter logistic (WT, L15A, I73A, and E100A) or, when not possible, by estimation (Y19A and E39A), see data in Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	279	 For these experiments, values shown are the averages of triplicate or quadruplicate experiments  plus or minus  SD.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	280	  Next, we measured the affinity of each TAD protein for compound 3 (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	281	 3) using an equilibrium binding assay.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	282	 The Kd values for binding of 3 to WT and Y19A TADs were similar (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Because the side chain of Tyr-19 undergoes a substantial change in position upon inhibitor binding, the lack of effect of the Y19A mutation on the affinity for inhibitor 3 may actually be due to a combination of two offsetting effects: a loss of Tyr-19-inhibitor interactions partially compensated for by a reduction in the conformational change (entropic cost) necessary to form the inhibitor binding pocket.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Further mutagenesis of this residue would be necessary to address this possibility.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	285	 The Kd value for 3 binding to E100A was roughly 10-fold lower, but could not be precisely determined in part because the value of Kd is well below the protein concentration used in the experiment (5 versus 50 nM).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	286	 I73A, L15A, and especially E39A had significantly reduced affinities for the compound.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Where a direct comparison can be made, results in Table V are in qualitative agreement with those from the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay shown in Table IV.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	291	 A, dissociation constants for inhibitor 3 were determined by titrating the inhibitor (4-500 nM) into 96-well Ni-chelate Flashplates containing 50 nM TAD.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Lines were determined by non-linear regression using a tight-binding equation and are based on triplicate measurements.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	293	 B, E1 binding was evaluated by the ability of the different proteins to inhibit HPV11 E1 ATPase activity.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	294	 ATPase activity was measured by a scintillation proximity assay as described previously (40, 41) using 3 nM E1 and 20  microM ATP.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Inhibition was measured for each TAD protein at concentrations from 2 to 1000 nM and points are based on averages of three separate experiments.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Lines connecting the points are for ease of visualization only.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	297	  We assessed the relative affinity of each of these TAD proteins for E1 by taking advantage of our earlier finding that the ATPase activity of E1 is inhibited by addition of the transactivation domain.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	298	 TAD binding significantly increases the apparent Km of E1 for ATP.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	299	 However, we observed that TAD-saturated E1 retained some ATPase activity.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	300	 We also reported a corresponding weakening of E2 binding in the presence of high ATP concentrations, which might play a role in the dissociation of E2 and assembly of E1 hexamers at the origin (40).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	301	Although not a direct binding assay, monitoring ATPase activity in the presence of E2 (or the TAD) provides a DNA-independent, solution-phase method of assessing the E1-E2 interaction.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Titration of WT TAD into E1 ATPase assays inhibited activity to a maximum of 86% (Imax = 86%), with an IC50 of 4 nM (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Similar results were obtained for I73A and E100A confirming that these mutations do not affect E1 binding substantially.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	304	 It should be noted, however, that the IC50 values reported for I73A, E100A, and WT TAD are close to the E1 concentration used in these assays (3 nM), and hence that these IC50 values are likely to be an underestimate of the affinity of these proteins for E1.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	305	The remaining three mutant E2 proteins (L15A, Y19A, and E39A) differed from their WT counterpart in two ways.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	306	 First, the maximal degree of E1-ATPase inhibition obtained at saturating concentrations of TAD was lower for these mutants than for WT E2.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	307	 This was more prominent for Y19A and E39A E2, which achieved a maximum inhibition of only 32 and 38%, respectively.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Although we do not completely understand why these mutant E2 TADs achieve a lower maximum level of inhibition it suggests that the geometry of the TAD-E1 complexes that do form for these two proteins is such that the complexes retain greater residual ATPase activity.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	309	 The second way in which these three mutant proteins differed from WT E2 is in their lower affinity for E1, as measured by the IC50 values required to reach their respective maximal level of ATPase inhibition.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	310	 By this measure, L15A was found to reduce only slightly, if at all, the affinity of E2 for E1, whereas Y19A and E39A had a larger effect.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Qualitatively, these results are in good agreement with those obtained in the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay (Table IV) in that the E1-E2 interaction is little affected by I73A and E100A, moderately affected by L15A, but more significantly reduced by Y19A and, as anticipated, by E39A.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Notably, all mutant proteins retained some ability to interact with E1.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	313	Based on the structure of the HPV16 E2 TAD, Antson et al.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	314	 (20) proposed the existence of an additional E2 dimerization interface within the TAD, comprised of the second and third -helices, and notably involving a cluster of conserved residues (Arg-37, Ala-69, Ile-73, Gln-76, Leu-77, Glu-80, and Thr-81).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Although the area of this interface is relatively large (2000 A2), it contains a number of water-mediated interactions and relatively few hydrophobic residue contacts, in contrast to most protein interfaces that are typically less hydrophilic than solvent-exposed surfaces (45, 46).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Our observation that quite distinct monomer-monomer interactions are found in both of our HPV11 TAD structures, together with the results from chromatography and ultracentrifugation experiments that the HPV11 TAD is fully monomeric at concentrations up to 20  microM calls into question the generality of the TAD dimerization interface and thus the likelihood that it plays a fundamental role in the function of E2, at least in the case of HPV11.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	317	Nature of the Inhibitor Binding Site The inhibitor binding pocket (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	318	 7) is not present in the E2 apo structure but rather appears to be induced upon inhibitor binding.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	319	 This pocket is comprised of a large "shallow end" approximately defined by residues Gln-12, Glu-39, Lys-68, and Gln-71 and a smaller "deep end" defined by His-32, Trp-33, and Leu-94.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	320	 The indandione moiety of inhibitor A is complementary to the deep end, and the resulting Van der Waals interactions, together with the hydrogen bonds between the carboxylate and backbone amides, account for the strongly exothermic binding of compounds in this series (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Additional interactions are made by the thiadiazoylphenyl moiety that extends out of the pocket, near Met-101.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	322	Conclusions Based on Studies with Mutant E2 Proteins The Side Chain of Glu-100 May Impede Inhibitor Binding Mutation of Glu-100 to Ala did not affect substantially the interaction of E2 with E1, but specifically enhanced inhibitor binding as we reported previously (23).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	323	 The structure of the inhibitor-TAD complex provides an explanation for this gain in affinity, namely that the entropic cost associated with the conformational change in the Glu-100 side chain necessary for compound binding (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	324	 5C) is likely reduced in the case of Ala-100.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	325	Amino Acids Outside the Pocket Can Reduce Inhibitor Binding A number of substitutions (Q12A, L15A, L43A, S65A, and I73A) clearly affected binding of the inhibitor, although they changed residues that do not directly contact the inhibitor in the structure.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Further structural information would be required to fully understand the effects of these five substitutions, but all of these residues are located on helices in the three-helix bundle that defines the N-terminal subdomain of the TAD.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	327	 The residues that form the deep pocket that binds tightly to the indandione moiety are also located within this three-helix bundle, and given the close fit between the inhibitor and this pocket it is possible that these substitutions subtly affect the packing of the three helices in a way that slightly alters the binding pocket.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Perhaps similar subtle conformational changes explain why the indandione class of inhibitors binds to HPV6 E2 10-30-fold less tightly than to HPV11 E2, because the few amino acid differences in or near the binding pocket did not account for this type of differential activity.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	329	 The effects of these non-binding site residue differences are conceptually similar to some HIV protease resistance mutations that occur well outside of the active site (47).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	330	Importance of His-32 for Inhibitor Binding We found that the specificity for inhibitor binding to low-risk rather than high-risk HPV types is in part because of a residue forming the pocket, His-32, which is a tyrosine in high risk types (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Substitution of His-32 for tyrosine in HPV11 E2 abrogated inhibitor binding, although it did not significantly affect interaction with E1.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	332	 Based on our structure of the inhibitor-TAD complex, this substitution is predicted to prevent formation of the deep end of the inhibitor binding pocket.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Furthermore, the converse experiment of inserting His-32 into HPV31 E2 generated a mutant protein that could interact with compound 2, albeit not to the same extent as HPV11 or HPV6 E2.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	334	A Role for Tyrosine 19 in Binding to E1 Tyr-19 is highly conserved among HPV types although it is an Ile in bovine papillomaviruses.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Substitution of this residue by Ala resulted in an HPV11 E2 protein that was still capable of binding the inhibitor and whose melting temperature and CD spectrum were very similar to that of wild type E2, indicating that this mutation does not affect the overall structure of the TAD.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	336	 However, the Y19A mutant protein was defective in binding to E1 both in an E1-E2-ori complex formation assay and in an E1-ATPase inhibition assay.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	337	 Thus, this mutation appears to specifically affect E1 binding.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	338	 The proximity on the TAD surface of Tyr-19 to Glu-39, the only other residue specifically implicated in binding to E1, suggests that this surface of E2 might form part of the E1-E2 protein-protein interface.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	339	 If so, our results would imply that the interaction of Tyr-19 with E1 is energetically important for formation of this interface and that the indandione class of inhibitors antagonizes E1 binding by competing directly for the same or an overlapping binding surface on E2.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	340	 In fact, the structure of an HPV18 E1-E2 TAD complex has recently been determined, and Tyr-19 does appear to make an important interaction with E1.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	341	Analysis of the two crystal structures presented here has provided a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which the indandione inhibitors bind to E2, to disrupt the E1-E2 protein-protein interaction.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	342	 Comparison of these two structures revealed the induced fit mechanism by which the inhibitor binding pocket is formed and further illustrates that it is very difficult to accurately identify binding pockets or model protein-ligand interactions using only the structure of an unliganded protein (48).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	343	 The binding pocket includes both a deep, narrow cavity filled by the indandione moiety, as well as a wider shallow region that makes only a few contacts with the inhibitor.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	344	 The finding that a second inhibitor molecule can bind to this shallow region of the pocket raises the possibility that molecules could be found that would retain specific interactions with the deep cavity but gain additional binding energy by interaction with the larger shallow region.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	345	 The characterization of a well defined small molecule binding pocket on the E2 TAD represents an important step toward the design of HPV antivirals.

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	3	Passive diffusion of molecules within the cytoplasm is limited by molecular crowding and does not provide targeting to a particular subcellular domain (1).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Thus, many intracellular pathogens subvert existing transport mechanisms and cytoskeletal components, both to efficiently reach their site of replication and also for the exit of their progeny (2).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The cytoskeleton is highly dynamic, and its role in locomotion is regulated by a plethora of actin- and tubulin-binding proteins, kinases, and phosphatases of multiple signaling cascades.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of actin regulatory proteins induce the condensation of actin "comet" tails behind endosomes (3), as well as the bacteria Listeria, Shigella, and Rickettsia (4) and viruses including vaccinia, baculovirus, and SV40, for propulsion through the cytoplasm (5, 6).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Other viruses employ cellular motors such as dyneins and kinesins for transport along microtubules.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	8	 A single virus type can employ several intracellular transport mechanisms.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Indeed, vaccinia particles are driven along microtubules by kinesin, whereupon actin tails take over propulsion (7, 8).

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Upon pull-down with glutathione-Sepharose, actin copurified with the GST-GFP fusion protein containing residues 25-45 (but not residues 299-333) of HPV16 L2 (Fig.

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Therefore, to address the biologic significance of the putative actin-binding domain in HPV16 L2, we compared the uptake of HPV16 VLPs comprising wild-type L1 alone, L1 and L2, and L1 and L2 with residues 25-45 deleted (L1/L225-45).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Whereas wild-type HPV16 L1/L2 VLPs were rapidly transported to the perinuclear region along radial tracts (Fig.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	179	 2A1), L1/L2 VLPs lacking residues 25-45 failed to align along radial tracts in the cytoplasm and did not reach the perinuclear region during a 6-h time course (Fig.

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	181	Because papillomavirus exhibits a high particle to infectivity ratio in vitro (22), it is possible that the uptake of HPV16 VLPs shown in Fig.

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Therefore, to examine the significance of this interaction between L2 and -actin to the infectious process, we generated HPV16 pseudovirions lacking the conserved -actin-binding domain, viz.

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Briefly, the hamster fibroblast cell line BPHE-1 harbors 50-200 episomal copies of the bovine papillomavirus genome/cell (29), but it produces no virus because the L1 and L2 genes are not expressed.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	186	 However, ectopic expression of HPV16 L1 and L2 in BPHE-1 cells via infection with recombinant defective Semliki Forest viruses results in the generation of infectious HPV16 pseudovirions containing the BPV genome within capsids formed of HPV16 L1 and L2 (22).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Like native BPV1 virions, the infectivity of HPV16 {BPV1} pseudovirions can readily be quantified using the in vitro focal transformation of mouse C127 cells (36).

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Given the ability of L2 to bind to actin and the karyophilic nature of full-length L2, we hypothesized that an overabundance of L2 within the cytoplasm might induce changes in the cytoskeleton and cell morphology.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	203	 To test this hypothesis, the fragment of HPV16 L2 encoding residues 25-45 was inserted 3' of the GFP gene in the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C2 to form pEGFP-L2-(25-45).

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Transient expression of GFP fused to HPV16 L2 residues 25-45 within the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells induced a dramatic retraction of transfected cells from the culture surface (Fig.

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	218	During the infectious process, an intracellular pathogen hijacks the normal cellular function of its receptor molecules for transportation to its site of replication.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Thus, study of such infectious pathways can both enhance our understanding of normal cellular transport as well as identify targets for intervention.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Although intracellular pathogens use diverse primary and secondary receptors to gain entry to the cell, the mechanisms employed for intracellular transport are more restricted.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	221	 For example, microorganisms as diverse as Listeria, Shigella, Rickettsia, vaccinia, and SV40 employ different receptors to gain entry to a cell, but a similar mode of intracellular transport (6, 34).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	222	 However, despite their structural similarity to SV40 (18), the papillomaviruses use a distinct cell-surface receptor and entry pathway, about which little is known.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Indeed, three different surface molecules (12-14) have been proposed to bind to the major capsid protein L1 and to function as the primary receptor for papillomavirus.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Papillomavirus L1 pseudovirions prepared in vitro are infectious, although significantly less so than those containing L2 (38-40).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	225	 We have provided genetic evidence that L2 also plays a critical role during papillomavirus infection, but after the initial binding of the particle to the cell surface (23).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	226	 By virtue of its ability to bind to and enter cells, L2 was recently proposed to bind to a secondary viral receptor and to facilitate uptake (24).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	227	 The inability of L1 VLPs to enter the nucleus (41) and the importance of the DNA-binding and karyophilic domains of L2 to the infectious process suggest that interaction of L2 with the viral genome may play a key role in its delivery to the nucleus (23, 42).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	228	The high local protein concentration (as high as 300 mg/ml), organelles, and the cytoskeleton contribute to the molecular crowding within a cell that restricts the free diffusion of molecules of  > 500 kDa (1).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Because the papillomavirus capsid is 55 nm in diameter and  > 2000 kDa, its free diffusion within the cell will be extremely slow (15).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	230	 During infection, the virus needs to rapidly traffic to the nucleus, the site of viral replication, rather than to other organelles such as lysosomes.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	231	 To efficiently transport particles across the cytoplasm during infection, residues 25-45 of HPV16 L2 bind to -actin, and this interaction influences microfilament structure.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	232	 However, understanding the mechanism of locomotion requires further investigation.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	233	The high degree of sequence conservation of the L2 motif (Fig.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	234	 6A) and the ability of both BPV1 and HPV16 L2 to bind actin suggest that this interaction is common to other papillomavirus genotypes and therefore may represent a useful target for the development of pan-papillomavirus-preventative treatments.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Indeed, antibody to L2 (but not L1) neutralizes diverse papillomavirus genotypes, suggesting that a conserved functional domain of L2 is displayed on the capsid surface (25, 43).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Furthermore, L2-specific neutralizing antibodies predominantly recognize its N terminus and do not prevent virions from binding to the cell surface (26), suggesting that neutralization may occur by a blockade of virion uptake or intracellular transport.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	237	Several pathogens have independently evolved mechanisms to harness the power of actin polymerization to get into and out of cells (34).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Indeed, the entry of a wide variety of viruses, including papillomavirus, human immunodeficiency virus, vaccinia, Autographa californica M nucleopolyhedrovirus, adenovirus type 2, and echoviruses, is dependent upon actin polymerization as demonstrated by blockade with the inhibitor cytochalasin D (44).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	239	 However, this does not necessarily reflect a direct interaction between the virus and actin because actin function is necessary for receptor-mediated endocytosis and many other cellular processes.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	240	 californica M nucleopolyhedrovirus induces the formation of thick actin cables that frequently project toward the nucleus.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	241	 These actin cables are transiently formed in association with the viral nucleocapsids prior to viral gene expression and concomitantly with nucleocapsid transport to the nucleus (45).

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	244	 It is unclear how this effect relates to the changes in actin structure produced by overexpression of L2 residues 25-45 within the cytoplasm because neither papillomavirus L1/L2 VLPs nor L2 induces such actin cables.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	245	Both endosomes and diverse pathogens are able to recruit host cytoskeletal factors to induce the polymerization of actin filaments from their surface into a structure known as a comet tail for intracellular propulsion (34).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	246	 However, the presence of L2 or L1/L2 VLPs during infection did not promote the formation of such actin comet tails, suggesting that interaction of L2 with -actin facilitates particle transport by another mechanism.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	247	Actin is an ATPase, and ATP hydrolysis affects the kinetics of polymerization (47).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	248	 In vivo, actin polymerization is a highly regulated process controlled both by ATP binding and hydrolysis and by the action of a number of actin-binding proteins that initiate, cleave, cross-link, stabilize, or destabilize the filaments (48).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Actin comet tails result from a depolymerization of filamentous actin and re-polymerization behind the particle (34).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Interestingly, overexpression of the -actin-binding motif comprising residues 25-45 of HPV16 L2 in the cytoplasm was associated with the redistribution of actin in COS-7 cells and altered cell morphology.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	251	 This is consistent with a functional interaction between L2 and actin in vivo that orchestrates the intracellular motility of papillomavirus during infection.
