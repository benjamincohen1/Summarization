The notion that the differences in response to HPV VLPs between LC and DC are associated with different types of cell binding and intracellular trafficking has been addressed. Inhibition experiments with heparin and sodium chlorate showed that heparan sulfates are necessary for HPV 16 VLPs to bind to DC but not to LC. Electron microscopy analysis demonstrated a colocalization of HPV 16 VLPs and langerin, which is expressed only by LC. This colocalization was observed on the cell surface but also in cytoplasmic vesicles. As anti-langerin antibodies, HPV 16 VLPs were associated with a faster entry kinetics in LC, as reflected by the fact that VLPs were observed near the nuclear membrane of LC within 10 min whereas more than 60 min were needed in DC. However, no difference between LC and DC was observed for the endocytosis pathway. HPV 16 VLPs entered in both DC and LC by a clathrin-dependent-pathway and were then localized in large cytoplasmic vesicles resembling endosomes..

0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Cervical cancer, the second most frequent cause of death by cancer amongst females worldwide, is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and represents one of the best examples of a human cancer preceded by a well characterized preneoplastic period (Richart  and  Barron, 1967; Richart, 1987). Despite the evidence that specific types of HPV are strongly implicated as causative agents in the aetiology of cervical cancer and its precursors, designated squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs), HPV alone is not sufficient for cancer development (Chen et al., 1993). The role of the intrinsic immunity in controlling HPV infection and the subsequent development of SILs is shown indirectly by the increased frequency of HPV-associated lesions in patients with depressed cell-mediated immunity (Petry et al., 1994; Calore et al., 1998; Ellerbrock et al., 2000). Initiation and progression of HPV-associated cancer of the uterine cervix have been shown to be related with functional alterations of Langerhans cells (LC) within the cervical epithelium (Giannini et al., 2002). LC are immature dendritic cells (DC) of myeloid origin resident in squamous epithelia, including skin and genital mucosa. The normal function of LC is to survey cell surfaces for pathogens, capture antigens by micropinocytosis or mannose receptor-mediated uptake, process captured proteins into immunogenic peptides, emigrate from tissue to lymph nodes and present peptides in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to T cells, thereby initiating antigen-specific immune responses. LC are the only cells that constitutively express MHC class II molecules, CD1a (Fithian et al., 1981) and langerin (CD207) (Valladeau et al., 1999) at their cell surface. In addition, LC differ ultrastructurally from other DC through the presence of a unique pentalamellar cytoplasmic organelle, the Birbeck granule..

0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	8	Because of their role in initiating antiviral immune response, DC and LC represent an ideal target for immune evasion by viruses. Several viruses interfere with DC function, especially measles virus (Grosjean et al., 1997), vaccinia virus (Drillien et al., 2000; Engelmayer et al., 1999) and dengue virus (Tassaneetrithep et al., 2003). The study of the interactions between HPV and DC or LC has been complicated by the fact that native infectious HPV virions cannot be isolated in large enough quantities either in vitro or in vivo. However, HPV to DC or HPV to LC interactions may be studied by using HPV virus-like particles (VLPs) that morphologically mimic native virions (Lenz et al., 2001). HPV VLPs are non-enveloped icosahedral particles, composed of the L1 major capsid protein, which form via self-assembly in the nucleus after high level expression of L1 in eukaryotic cells (Kirnbauer et al., 1993; Hagensee et al., 1993; Rose et al., 1993; Touze et al., 1998). Fausch et al. (2002) reported that DC and LC are able to bind and internalize HPV VLPs. However, in contrast to DC, LC incubated with VLPs do not upregulate activation markers, do not initiate immune response and do not migrate in vivo out of skin explants (Fausch et al., 2003)..

In vitro generated LC exhibited morphological (Birbeck granules) and immunohistochemical features of LC as observed by FACS analysis and surface phenotype [CD1a+, CD207+(langerin), E-cadherin+ and CCR6+] (Fig. 1). The proportion of cells expressing CD207 (langerin) in the entire population was 57 plus or minus 9 % (n=8). DC generated from adherent PBMC in the presence of GM-CSF and IL4 also presented classical phenotypical markers of DC (CD1a+, HLA-DR+, CD80+) (data not shown). By electron microscopy, HPV 16 VLPs were shown to bind to both DC and LC (Fig. 2a). HPV 16 VLPs internalization by DC and LC was studied by using CFDA-SE/VLPs and flow cytometry. In order to investigate the integrity of VLP after CFDA-SE-labelling, an ELISA with the H16.V5 mAb specific for conformational epitopes (Christensen et al., 1996) was performed. This antibody reacted similarly with VLP alone or with CFDA-SE/VLP, suggesting that the labelling of VLP with CFDA-SE does not induce VLP epitope conformation changes (Fig. 2b). To determine a suitable incubation time to study VLPs cell-internalization, a kinetics curve for CFDA-SE fluorescence was studied. Mean fluorescence increased with time of incubation and after 6 h, 80 % of cells were fluorescent. To exclude the possibility that the detected fluorescence is caused by non-bound CFDA-SE dye co-migrating with the labelled VLPs, DC and LC were incubated with the fraction of control gradient loaded with CFDA-SE alone. No fluorescence was detected in DC and LC when incubated with this control gradient fraction (data not shown)..

This antibody reacted similarly with VLP alone or with CFDA-SE/VLP, suggesting that the labelling of VLP with CFDA-SE does not induce VLP epitope conformation changes (Fig. 2b). To determine a suitable incubation time to study VLPs cell-internalization, a kinetics curve for CFDA-SE fluorescence was studied. Mean fluorescence increased with time of incubation and after 6 h, 80 % of cells were fluorescent. To exclude the possibility that the detected fluorescence is caused by non-bound CFDA-SE dye co-migrating with the labelled VLPs, DC and LC were incubated with the fraction of control gradient loaded with CFDA-SE alone. No fluorescence was detected in DC and LC when incubated with this control gradient fraction (data not shown)..

After a trypsin treatment to remove uninternalized VLPs and washings, cells were incubated at 37  degrees C for 6 h. Trypsin treatment reduced binding of VLPs as observed by Evander et al. (1997). When cells were incubated for 5 min with labelled VLPs, 69 plus or minus 7 % of LC were fluorescent compared with 27 plus or minus 1 % for DC (Fig. 2c). This difference was also observed after 1 h of incubation (fluorescence in 84 plus or minus 2 % of LC and 35 plus or minus 2 % of DC), suggesting that VLP entry in DC is slower than in LC. With increased incubation times, differences between the two cell populations decreased and at 6 h of incubation 84 plus or minus 12 % of DC and 94 plus or minus 1 % of LC were fluorescent. The faster VLPs entry in LC compared with DC was confirmed by electron microscopy (see Fig. 6). VLPs were observed in LC cytoplasm after only 5 min of incubation (see Fig. 6b). In contrast, a slower kinetic of VLPs entry in DC was observed since VLPs were detected in the cytoplasm after only 20 min of incubation (see Fig. 6e). In LC, VLPs were found near the nuclear membrane after an incubation time of 10 min (see Fig. 6c), whereas more than 1 h was needed for VLPs to reach the nucleus in DC (data not shown)..

Labelled HPV 16 VLPs were preincubated with heparin for 1 h at 37  degrees C and their capacity to enter into DC or LC was investigated by cell fluorescence (Table 1).

To determine if this difference was not due to the origin of cells used to induce the differentiation of DC and LC, we also generated DC with CD34+ cells and showed that the entry of VLPs was inhibited in the presence of heparin (51 plus or minus 13 % of inhibition), suggesting that heparan sulfates are receptors for DC but not for LC. We also investigated the heparan sulfates expression by immunostaining with anti-human syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 antibodies.

Electron microscopy analysis showed that after an incubation at 37  degrees C for 5 min, anti-langerin mAb were present in LC in coated pits (Fig. 4a) or in small vesicles with clathrin morphology (Fig. 4b, c). A proportion of langerin was also localized intracellularly in large multivesicular compartments (Fig. 4d). Electron microscopy also showed that VLPs and langerin are colocalized (Fig. 4e, f, g, h).

These cells were preincubated with chlorpromazine, which inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis. A 70 % inhibition in HPV 16 VLPs endocytosis was observed in both DC and LC populations after chlorpromazine treatment (Fig. 5a). We also tested the effect of cytochalasin D, a potent inhibitor of actin-dependent cellular processes. In the presence of this drug, VLP fluorescence was shown to decrease (Fig. 5b). LC and DC were also treated with nystatin and filipin, which inhibit caveolae-mediated endocytosis and no inhibition was observed with these drugs (Fig. 5c, d). To visually analyse the uptake of HPV VLPs into DC and LC, transmission electron microscopy analysis was also performed. In the presence of HPV 16 VLPs, DC and LC plasma membranes were rich in coated pits where VLPs accumulated (Fig. 6a, d). These coated pits budded off to yield coated vesicles with clathrin morphology confirming that HPV enter by endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits in both DC (Fig. 6e) and LC (Fig. 6b). VLPs were contained in cytoplasmic coated vesicles (Fig. 6b), which enlarged with time by fusion of different coated vesicles (Fig. 6e). The HPV 16 VLPs remained clustered in large vesicles resembling endosome (Fig. 6c, f). At this step, most vesicles were smooth rather than coated. In LC, vesicles containing VLPs were located near the nucleus after an incubation of 10 min (Fig. 6c), whereas more time was needed for DC (data not shown)..

These data suggest that vaccine antigens are efficiently presented to the immune system and may be correlated to the ability of HPV VLPs to activate DC (Rudolf et al., 2001; Fausch et al., 2002). In contrast, Giannini et al. (2002) demonstrated that SILs are deficient in presenting antigens to T cells suggesting that the function of LC is incapacitated in the HPV-transformed epithelium. In agreement with these observations, Fausch et al. (2002) demonstrated that LC in the presence of HPV 16 VLPs are unable to activate T cells..
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	57	The purpose of the present report was to investigate further the interactions between HPV 16 VLPs and DC or LC. We showed that these antigen-presenting cells differentially interact with HPV 16 VLPs. Although DC and LC are able to bind and internalize HPV 16 VLPs, difference in entry kinetics was observed between both cell types with a faster entry of HPV 16 VLPs into LC compared with DC. As a correlation between entry kinetics and cell receptors has been previously shown with other viruses (Narayan et al., 2003), we looked for potential different types of HPV 16 VLPs binding to DC and LC. The most described epithelial receptors for HPV are heparan sulfates and integrin (Evander et al., 1997; Giroglou et al., 2001; Joyce et al., 1999). Our inhibition experiments with heparin or sodium chlorate confirm that DC use heparan sulfates to bind HPV 16 VLPs in contrast to LC in agreement with the data of Yan et al. (2004) showing that HPV 6b L1 VLPs uptake by DC is inhibited in the presence of heparin. Other pathogens such as Chlamydia trachomatis also use heparan sulfates to enter DC (Matyszak et al., 2002). Mummert et al. (2002) suggested that heparan sulfates moiety detected on DC may also play an immunoregulatory role. In fact, heparan sulfates and their degradation products have been reported to deliver costimulatory signals to T cells and maturation signals to DC (Wrenshall et al., 1991; Kodaira  and  Platt, 2000; Johnson et al., 2002). This may explain why HPV VLPs initiate DC (but not LC) maturation and activation..

Langerin is exclusively expressed by LC (Valladeau et al., 1999) and is localized not only on the cell surface, but also intracellularly in close association with Birbeck granules. This molecule functions as an endocytic receptor (Valladeau et al., 1999, 2000). Upon binding to the cell surface, anti-langerin antibodies are rapidly internalized and delivered to Birbeck granules (Valladeau et al., 1999, 2000). Electron microscopy analysis showed that HPV 16 VLPs colocalize with anti-langerin antibodies. Indeed they were detected together in coated pits and in large cytoplasmic vesicles. These data are in agreement with recent studies showing that the processing pathway of HPV 6b L1 VLPs in LC is associated with langerin+ compartments (Yan et al., 2004) and that other viruses, such as HIV, also use langerin and lectin or mannose to enter into LC and DC, respectively (Turville et al., 2002). Our electron microscopy analysis showed a colocalization of HPV 16 VLPs and langerin in large cytoplasmic vesicles resembling to endosome, which may be related to the observation that langerin is associated with the CD1a recycling compartment (McDermott et al., 2002). HPV 6 VLPs were also shown to be colocalized with CD1a+ endosome (Yan et al., 2004), but the loading mechanism was not determined. When mannan, which was shown to be able to inhibit HIV entry in LC, was used a 40 % inhibition of VLP entry was observed suggesting that other proteins are also involved in the VLP binding to LC.

(2003) and Yan et al. (2004). Fausch et al. (2003) showed that DC use a clathrin-mediated endocytosis whereas LC use a different pathway, which is not associated with clathrin or caveolae. Yan et al. (2004) show that HPV 6 VLP enter in LC by a caveolae-dependent pathway. Entry pathways can be inhibited at different stages by specific inhibitors, such as chlorpromazine, cytochalasin D, nystatin and filipin. When using these drugs, HPV 16 VLP entry was only inhibited in the presence of chlorpromazine and cytochalasin D whereas no inhibition was observed with the caveolae inhibitors, nystatin and filipin. These results suggest that VLP enter in DC and LC by a clathrin-mediated pathway and are in agreement with the direct demonstration of HPV 16 VLPs in coated pits and cytoplasmic vesicles with a clathrin morphology in LC and DC preparations processed for electron microscopy. The differences between these studies might be related to the different methods used to analyse HPV VLPs internalization although we cannot exclude different endocytosis pathways according to the origin of cells used to generate LC. In agreement with this hypothesis, the LC used in this study poorly expressed syndecan-1 in contrast to the LC generated by Yan et al. (2004)..

Moreover, a cooperation between these two types of receptors has been shown to be important for the diversity of DC or LC responses and to determine the outcome of the immune response (Gantner et al., 2003). As receptors implicated in DC maturation activate nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (Janeway  and  Medzhitov, 2002), it will be interesting to characterize the cytoplasmic factors implicated in DC or LC maturation in the presence of VLPs and to determine if heparan sulfates are able to interact with these factors..

To investigate the role of this gene in virus replication, a BHV-1 UL25 deletion mutant was constructed. Although the UL25 mutant synthesizes late viral proteins and viral DNA, it fails to produce virus progeny in cells that do not express the UL25 gene, demonstrating that the UL25 protein is essential for the replicative cycle of BHV-1. Moreover, Southern blotting analyses of HindIII-digested DNA from infected non-complementing cells probed with the leftward terminal fragment of the BHV-1 linear genome revealed that the cleavage of the viral DNA produced is not impaired. However, the packaging of this cleaved DNA is compromised severely, since only few full C capsids were observed in infected non-complementing cells by transmission electron microscopy..

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	8	During the replication process, cleavage and packaging of viral DNA are tightly linked functions at least requiring the following seven genes in HSV-1: UL6, UL15, UL17, UL25, UL28, UL32 and UL33 (Poon  and  Roizman, 1993; Taus et al., 1998; McNab et al., 1998; Tengelsen et al., 1993; Addison et al., 1990; Lamberti  and  Weller, 1996, 1998; al-Kobaisi et al., 1991). Viruses mutated in one of these genes synthesize near-wild-type levels of viral DNA but fail to cleave and package concatemeric DNA into capsids, resulting in an accumulation of B (intermediate) capsids in infected cells, with the exception of the UL25 mutant, which was shown to cleave newly synthesized viral DNA (McNab et al., 1998). Moreover, in contrast to the latter study where no packaging of matur DNA was observed, Stow (2001) reported that a significant amount of DNA synthesized by the UL25 mutant was packaged stably into capsids..

For this purpose, RK13 cells (rabbit kidney cells, ATCC CCL-377) were stably transfected with 2  microg ScaI-linearized pRetroTET-OFF/UL25, encoding the complete UL25 ORF under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter (Fig. 1). A selected cell line grown in the absence of doxycycline, a tetracycline derivative compound (Gossen et al., 1995), expressed a 63 kDa protein that reacted specifically with the UL25 antiserum (results not shown; Desloges et al., 2001). This polypeptide represents the full-length product of UL25, since its size correlated with that of the protein observed in BHV-1-infected cells (Desloges et al., 2001). This cell line, named RK13/UL25+, was used subsequently as a complementing host cell for the construction of a UL25 deletion mutant..

The linear genome of BHV-1 is represented at the top with its unique long segment (UL) and its unique short segment (US), the latter being flanked by internal and external inverted repeats (IR and TR, respectively). The HindIII restriction map of the two possible isomers is shown below. The UL25 ORF is located within fragment A at positions 6060262398 (in the leftward orientation). The 4299 bp ApaI to BamHI fragment, representing the region 58917 to 63216 of the viral genome and shown in an expanded view, was subcloned from pKS/Ahd carrying the HindIII fragment A (Simard et al., 1990) to generate pKS/BHV58-63kApa-Bam. This recombinant plasmid was used as illustrated to create the recombinant eukaryotic expression vector pRetroTET-OFF/UL25 for the development of a cell line inducibly expressing UL25. The strategy used to generate the recombinant pKS/58-63kUL25/-gal+ plasmid used to create BHV-1UL25 is shown on the right. The -Gal gene cassette is flanked by the promoter of the gene encoding the BHV-1 gB glycoprotein (pgB) and a consensus polyadenylation signal (pA). The illustrations below the vertical arrows are not drawn to scale..

To genetically engineer a BHV-1 UL25 deletion mutant, we constructed the plasmid pKS/58-63kUL25/-gal+ from pKS/BHV58-63kApa-Bam, by replacing the SalI fragment encoding aa 86 to 393 of the UL25 protein by a -Gal reporter gene cassette (Fig. 1). In this way, the deletion introduced into UL25 should not alter the expression of neighbouring genes. The plasmid pKS/58-63kUL25/-gal+ was linearized and used with BHV-1 viral DNA to co-transfect RK13/UL25+ cells grown in the absence of doxycycline (on-state) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, as described previously (Desloges  and  Simard, 2003). Regenerated progeny viruses were then plated on RK13/UL25+ cells and tested for their ability to form blue plaques in the presence of the chromogenic compound X-Gal. A -Gal-positive mutant virus, designated BHV-1UL25, was plaque-purified five times on RK13/UL25+ cells before virus production..

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	16	To verify that the engineered mutant was indeed incapable of expressing the UL25 gene product, we performed Western blotting analyses of protein extracts from RK13 cells infected for different periods of time with either BHV-1 or BHV-1UL25. As shown in Fig. 2(A), extracts infected with BHV-1 revealed the presence of an abundant 63 kDa protein, which was detected specifically with the UL25 antiserum, accumulating in cells from 12 to 18 h post-infection (p.i.). In contrast, the UL25 antiserum detected no protein in extracts from BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells, thus demonstrating that the virus mutant was incapable of expressing the UL25 protein in RK13 cells (Fig. 2A). This protein was absent in lysates prepared in the presence of phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), a DNA synthesis inhibitor, confirming further our previous findings that BHV-1 UL25 belongs to viral genes of the 2 class, since its expression is dependent strictly on viral DNA synthesis (Desloges et al., 2001)..

Protein cell lysates were fractionated on SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto a PVDF membrane and then reacted with the BHV-1-specific UL25 antiserum (A) or with a monospecific antiserum directed against the product of the BHV-1 UL48 gene (C).

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	18	  To investigate the consequence of the UL25 defect on the replicative cycle of BHV-1, virus production was examined by establishing one-step growth curves of both BHV-1UL25 and BHV-1 in non-complementing RK13 as well as in complementing RK13/UL25+ cells. Cells were infected synchronously with one or the other virus at an m.o.i. of 5 and then harvested at different times p.i., after which the total number of virus particles present either extracellularly or intracellularly in each sample was determined by titration assays, as described previously (Desloges  and  Simard, 2003). BHV-1 was capable of replicating efficiently in both RK13 and RK13/UL25+ cells, reaching similar maximal virus yields at 21 h p.i. (Fig. 2B). In contrast, BHV-1UL25 could only replicate in RK13/UL25+ cells, as no progeny was produced in RK13 cells (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that the UL25 gene product is necessary for virus replication in non-complementing cells, as was observed also with an HSV-1 UL25 deletion mutant (Ali et al., 1996). In addition, the virus yield obtained with BHV-1UL25 on RK13/UL25+ cells was similar to that of BHV-1 virus yield recovered from either cell line, indicating that the RK13/UL25+ cell line was capable of fully complementing the UL25 defect of the mutant virus. These results demonstrate that the amount of the UL25 protein within the complementary cell line is sufficient to allow replication of BHV-1UL25 to BHV-1 levels, indicating that no mutations in other essential genes had been introduced during the recombination event giving rise to the mutant..

For this purpose, the expression of the BHV-1 gene trans-inducing factor protein encoded by the UL48 gene, a late gene (Misra et al., 1994; Desloges et al., 2001), was analysed. At different times p.i., protein lysates were prepared from BHV-1UL25- and BHV-1-infected RK13 cells and analysed by immunoblot for the presence of the UL48 gene product using a BHV-1-specific UL48 antiserum directed against an Escherichia coli-expressed T7 tag to UL48 fusion protein. The antiserum detected a 50 kDa protein in lysates collected at 18 h p.i. from both BHV-1UL25- and BHV-1-infected RK13 cells (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the production of the UL48 gene product was abrogated by PAA treatment (Fig. 2C, +PAA), confirming further that UL48 is a 2 gene. Thus, these results demonstrate that the UL25 defect does not impair the expression of viral genes of the 2 class or, consequently, the expression of genes of the earlier classes (, 1, 2 and 1). These results also demonstrate indirectly that the mutation does not compromise viral DNA synthesis, since genes whose expression is dependent strictly on viral DNA synthesis (such as UL48) are expressed efficiently..

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	22	To obtain direct evidence that the UL25 defect does not compromise viral DNA synthesis in RK13 cells, Southern blotting analysis of HindIII digests of total cell DNA isolated from BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 and RK13/UL25+ cells was performed. The HindIII fragment N, representing the leftward terminal region of the BHV-1 linear viral genome, was used as probe (Fig. 1). Probe N hybridized to a major 2 4 kbp and two minor non-well-resolved 14 and 15 kbp fragments present in DNA from BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells obtained at 12 and 24 h p.i. (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, no hybridization signal was observed at 0 h p.i. (Fig. 3A, lane 1), demonstrating that the bands observed represented newly synthesized viral DNA. The DNA profile observed at 24 h p.i. of RK13 cells (Fig. 3A, lane 3) was very similar to that observed in BHV-1UL25-infected RK13/UL25+ cells (Fig. 3A, lane 4). The 2 4 kbp bands common to the two profiles co-migrated with the KpnI to HindIII insert of the recombinant plasmid pKS/Nhd, which harbours the complete HindIII fragment N (Fig. 3A, lane 5), demonstrating that these bands represented the leftward terminal 2 4 kbp HindIII fragment N of the BHV-1 linear genome. The sizes of the other two bands correlated to those expected for head-to-tail HindIII genomic fragments (Fig. 1, N to F and N to H head-to-tail fragments are in the range of 14 and 15 kbp, respectively), indicating the presence within infected cell lysates of viral DNA, which was in the form of either immature DNA concatemers or of circular unit-length genomes, or both. Interestingly, the levels of the 2 4 kbp fragment observed were similar in the two cell lines. These findings indicate that DNA replication of BHV-1UL25 is as effective in RK13 cells as in complementing RK13/UL25+ cells. Moreover, the much higher abundance of terminal versus head-to-tail HindIII fragments indicate that mutant viral DNA synthesized in infected cells is processed efficiently into linear unit-length genomes..

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	25	  To determine whether mutant viral DNA is packaged into capsids, thin sections of BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 and RK13/UL25+ cells as well as BHV-1-infected RK13 cells, collected at 18 h p.i., were examined by transmission electron microscopy to assess the presence of full (C), intermediate (B) and empty (A) capsids, as described previously (Desloges  and  Simard, 2003). Significant numbers of all three capsid types were found on sections from both BHV-1-infected RK13 cells (A capsids, 35 7 %; B capsids, 16 7 %; C capsids, 47 6 %) and BHV-1UL25-infected RK13/UL25+ cells (A capsids, 29 6 %; B capsids, 51 7 %; C capsids, 18 7 %). Each of these infected cell samples (Fig. 3B, upper left and right panels, respectively) presented several C capsids surrounded by a bilayer envelope. In contrast, most of the capsids in BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells were of types A and B (40 0 and 57 2 %, respectively), as illustrated in Fig. 3(B, lower left panel), showing an accumulation of both capsid types in infected cells. The generation of empty A capsids devoid of both DNA and internal structure is believed to result from an abortive packaging event. Abortive packaging has been observed also in mutants of the dsDNA bacteriophage P22, which presents similarities to alphaherpesviruses concerning the DNA packaging and capsid assembly process. In Salmonella cells infected with mutants of phage P22 defective in genes 4, 10 and 26, it was shown that the procapsids are assembled and that viral concatemeric DNA is packaged but that the newly filled capsids are unstable and lose their DNA (Strauss  and  King, 1984). The phenotype observed in bacterial cells infected with these mutants is an accumulation of empty A capsids, similar to those observed in BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells..
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	26	However, careful examination of these infected cells revealed the presence of few electron-dense cored C capsids (2 8 %). This is demonstrated in Fig. 3(B, lower right panel), in which a complete enveloped C capsid is shown in the extracellular compartment of BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells. It was reported previously that the HSV-1 UL25 mutant (KUL25NS) does not package matur DNA (McNab et al., 1998). Recently, Stow (2001) detected successfully low levels of KUL25NS DNA being packaged and retained into capsids. The latter findings are corroborated in the present study by the observation of few full C capsids in electron micrographs of thin sections of BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells. However, it appears that these enveloped C capsids were either non-infectious or their number was too low for cytopathogenesis, as no virus was detected in one-step growth curve analyses. Also, it could be that UL25 mutant genomes are packaged efficiently into capsids but are released subsequently and then degraded rapidly, as suggested by Stow (2001)..

Our results show that the mutant is not impaired in its ability to synthesize viral proteins and to replicate and cleave viral DNA into unit-length genomes. Moreover, the mutant is still able to encapsidate viral DNA, albeit at very low levels. Further studies will be required to elucidate more precisely the role played by UL25 in the encapsidation process and especially in the stabilization of the packaged DNA into the capsid..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	2	To understand the mechanism by which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) capsids are formed, we have reconstituted the assembly of immature HIV capsids de novo in a cell-free system. Capsid authenticity is established by multiple biochemical and morphologic criteria. Known features of the assembly process are closely reproduced, indicating the fidelity of the cell-free reaction. Assembly is separated into co- and posttranslational phases, and three independent posttranslational requirements are demonstrated: (a) ATP, (b) a detergent-sensitive host factor, and (c) a detergent-insensitive host subcellular fraction that can be depleted and reconstituted. Assembly appears to proceed by way of multiple intermediates whose conversion to completed capsids can be blocked by either ATP depletion or treatment with nondenaturing detergent. Specific subsets of these intermediates accumulate upon expression of various assembly-defective Gag mutants in the cell-free system, suggesting that each mutant is blocked at a particular step in assembly. Furthermore, the accumulation of complexes of similar sizes in cells expressing the corresponding mutants suggests that comparable intermediates may exist in vivo. From these data, we propose a multi-step pathway for the biogenesis of HIV capsids, in which the assembly process can be disrupted at a number of discrete points..

For proper assembly of the capsid to occur, Pr55 chains must undergo myristoylation (Gheysen et al., 1989; Gottlinger et al., 1989), an NH2-terminal modification thought to occur co-translationally (Towler et al., 1988). The myristoylated chains are targeted to the host plasma membrane where assembly takes place concomitant with RNA encapsidation. As capsids are formed, they bud into the plasma membrane, which results in envelopment and subsequent release of viral particles from the cell. Coincident with these events, the immature viral particles undergo a maturation process, involving proteolytic processing of the precursor structural proteins and condensation of the capsids into collapsed, electron-dense cores (for review see Gelderblom, 1991; Wills and Craven, 1991)..

EM studies of these cells have indicated that the plasma membrane is the site of capsid assembly (Gelderblom, 1991; Wills and Craven, 1991). Analysis of various mutants of Pr55 have revealed key domains required for efficient capsid assembly and targeting to the plasma membrane (Gheysen et al., 1989; Gottlinger et al., 1989; Trono et al., 1989; Royer et al., 1991; Jowett et al., 1992; Facke et al., 1993; Wang and Barklis, 1993; Hockley et al., 1994; Spearman et al., 1994; Zhao et al., 1994). However, the actual mechanisms involved in coordinating the formation of an HIV capsid from 1,500 Gag monomers have not been elucidated. Many important questions about HIV capsid assembly remain unanswered, including whether assembly is an energy-dependent process, whether host proteins are required for assembly to take place, and whether assembly proceeds by way of discrete intermediates..

In cells, many of the events in question proceed extremely rapidly and are not readily amenable to manipulation, making it difficult to identify trans-acting factors and energy substrates that may be required for assembly.

We use this system to demonstrate that capsid formation can be dissociated into co- and posttranslational phases, each of which has distinct requirements. The reactions that occur during the posttranslational phase are dependent on ATP and at least two independent host factors, distinguished by their sensitivity to detergent. In addition, the posttranslational phase appears to proceed by way of previously unrecognized assembly intermediates. Expression of Gag mutants that are defective for assembly results in accumulation of these assembly intermediates in the cell-free system. Similar findings are obtained in cellular systems. Together, these data indicate that HIV capsid formation is a regulated, energy-dependent, multi-step process involving trans-acting host factors..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	13	All plasmid constructions for cell-free transcription were made using PCR and other standard nucleic acid techniques (Sambrook et al., 1989). Plasmid vectors were derived from SP64 (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) into which the 5 untranslated region of Xenopus laevis globin had been inserted at the HindIII site (Melton et al., 1984). The gag ORF from HIV genomic DNA (a kind gift of Jay Levy, University of California, San Francisco, CA) was introduced downstream from the SP6 promoter and the globin untranslated region. The GA mutation was made by changing glycine at position 2 of Gag to alanine using PCR. The Pr46 mutant was made by introducing a stop codon after gly 435 which removes p6; Pr41 has a stop codon after arg 363 (in the COOH-terminal region of p24). These truncation mutants are comparable to those described by Jowett et al., 1992. To make the D2 mutant, amino acids from gly 250 through val 260 were deleted (Hockley et al., 1994; Zhao et al., 1994). All changes engineered by PCR were verified by DNA sequencing..

Improved assembly was obtained when wheat germ extract, prepared as described before (Erickson and Blobel, 1983; Lingappa et al., 1994), was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 50,000 rpm (TLA 100 rotor; Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) for 15 min at 4 degrees C and the supernatant used for in vitro translation (Lingappa, J.R., unpublished observations). 10  microM myristol CoA (MCoA; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was added at the start of translation when indicated. Translation reactions ranged in volume from 20 to 100  microl and were incubated at 25 degrees C for 150 min.

Results of some cell-free translation and assembly reactions were repeated using rabbit reticulocyte lysate that was prepared as described previously (Merrick, 1983). In pulse-chase experiments, translation reactions contained [35S]cysteine (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL) for radiolabeling. 4 min into translation, 3 mM unlabeled cysteine was added, and the reaction was continued at 25 degrees C for variable chase times, as indicated..

Sucrose step gradients for batch separation of soluble and particulate material (used in Figs. 1, 2, and 4) contained 600  microl of 66% sucrose, 900  microl of 40% sucrose, and 500  microl of 20% sucrose, and were centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 35 min at 4 degrees C. Particles of 500-750-S partition into fractions 4-6, which were collected for further analysis. Linear 10-50% sucrose gradients (used in Fig. 1) were centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 35 min at 4 degrees C. Fig. 1. Immature HIV capsids synthesized in the cell-free system resemble authentic capsids by biochemical and morphologic criteria. (A and B) Migration of capsids on velocity sedimentation gradients. (A) Cell-free translation and assembly reactions containing 10  microM MCoA and 35S methionine were programmed with HIV Gag transcript and performed as described in Materials and Methods. At the end of the reaction, samples were diluted into buffer containing 1% NP-40 and separated into soluble and particulate fractions on sucrose step gradients. Material in the particulate fraction ( > 500-S) was further analyzed by a variety of methods. Shown here is an analysis of the particulate fraction by velocity sedimentation on a linear sucrose gradient. Radiolabeled Pr55 protein in the gradient fractions was visualized by SDSPAGE and autoradiography. The autoradiograph shows 10 consecutive fractions of a gradient with the top of the gradient at the left side. (B) Cell culture medium was collected from transfected Cos cells that were releasing immature HIV particles. Virus particles were harvested by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion, as described in Materials and Methods. Authentic immature capsids were generated by treating these harvested particles with detergent to remove their envelopes. These authentic capsids were sedimented on a velocity sedimentation gradient, in parallel with the particulate fraction of the cell-free reaction shown in A. Pr55 present in these fractions was visualized by immunoblotting. Fractions are displayed in the same order described for A. (C and D) Examination of buoyant density. The particulate fraction of the cell-free reaction (C) and of authentic immature capsids (D) was analyzed in parallel by equilibrium centrifugation on CsCl. Particle density was obtained by measuring the refractive index of each fraction and plotted on the right ordinate (open circles). Gag polypeptide in the fractions was visualized, and the amount of protein was determined by densitometry of bands and plotted on the left ordinate (closed circles). (E) Examination of electron microscopic appearance. The particulate fraction of the cell-free reaction (1-4) and authentic capsids (5 and 6) were incubated on EM grids that were coated with antibody to HIV Gag. 100-nm particles were visualized by negative staining.

Fractions of 350  microl were collected from the top of gradients using a Haake-Buchler gradient fractionator and were processed immediately. Either aliquots of fractions were loaded directly into SDS-PAGE buffer or the entire fraction was precipitated with TCA and washed with ethanol ether as previously described (Lingappa et al., 1994) before SDS-PAGE analysis. SDS-PAGE was performed using 15% gels, and some gels were fluorographed using Enhance (Dupont Co., Willmington, DE). Radiolabeled products of cell-free translations were visualized by autoradiography. Fig. 5. Pulse-chase analysis of HIV capsid assembly. (A) Analysis of a continuously labeled cell-free reaction by velocity sedimentation. Cell-free translation and assembly of Pr55 were performed as previously described. Upon completion of the cell-free reaction, the products were diluted in 1% NP-40 sample buffer on ice and were analyzed by velocity sedimentation on 13 ml 15- 60% sucrose gradients. Fractions were collected from the top of each gradient as described in Materials and Methods, and the amount of radiolabeled Pr55 protein in each fraction was determined and expressed as a percentage of total Pr55 protein present in the reaction. The calculated positions of 10-, 80-, 150-, 500-, and 750-S complexes are indicated with markers above (see Materials and Methods). 750-S represents the position of authentic immature (de-enveloped) HIV capsids. (B-D) Analysis of a pulse-chase cell-free reaction by velocity sedimentation. Cell-free translation and assembly of Pr55 were performed as previously described, except that [35S]cysteine was used for radiolabeling. At 4 min into translation, an excess of unlabeled cysteine was added to the reaction so that no further radiolabeling would occur. Aliquots of the reaction were collected 25 (C) and 150 min (D) into the reaction. 1  microl of each aliquot was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to reveal the total amount of radiolabeled Pr55 translation product (B, arrow) present at each chase time. The remainder of the aliquots was diluted into 1% NP-40 sample buffer on ice and analyzed by velocity sedimentation on 13 ml 15-60% sucrose gradients (5, C and D, respectively), in the manner described for 5 A above.

Calculated S-values for different fractions in the gradients are labeled as markers above each gradient tracing (Figs. 5-7). Markers such as BSA (5-S), macroglobulin (20-S), Hepatitis B Virus capsids (100-S), ribosomal subunits (40-S and 60-S), and polysomes ( > 100-S) were used to calibrate the gradients and to confirm the calculated S-values. However, it should be noted that the S-value assignments for each Gag-containing complex are meant to be very approximate estimates that allow a general description of the complex and should not be interpreted as constituting a detailed biophysical analysis. Fig. 6. Different assembly-defective mutants in Gag accumulate different assembly intermediates. Cell-free translation and assembly reactions were programmed with wild-type Gag (A), the assembly-competent Pr46 truncation mutant (B), the assembly-defective Pr41 truncation mutant (C), the assembly-defective GA mutant (D), or the assemblydefective D2 mutant (E). At the end of the incubation, reaction products were detergent treated and analyzed by velocity sedimentation on 13 ml sucrose gradients as in Fig. 5 A.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	38	Since we were interested in dissecting the early steps of capsid assembly rather than the better understood late stage of capsid maturation, we chose to study formation of immature HIV capsids, which undergo all of the steps of capsid assembly except the final protease-dependent maturation event. Assembly of immature capsids in cells requires expression of only the HIV Pr55 protein (Gheysen et al., 1989; Smith et al., 1993). However, we and others (Sakalian et al., 1996) have found that standard in vitro translation systems, consisting of a cytosolic extract, amino acids, an ATP regenerating system, and in vitro synthesized transcript coding for Pr55 Gag, fail to support assembly of HIV capsids (data not shown). Since assembly of HIV capsids, as well as assembly of other retroviral capsids, is known to require myristoylation of Gag (Gheysen et al., 1989; Gottlinger et al., 1989) as well as targeting of Gag to membranes (Jacobs et al., 1989; Bryant and Ratner, 1990; Rhee and Hunter, 1990; Wang and Barklis, 1993; Platt and Haffar, 1994; Hockley et al., 1994; Spearman et al., 1994), we modified the standard system to ensure that these events take place. MCoA was added to the reaction, and cellular extracts were fractionated to optimize capsid assembly. Translation of transcript encoding Gag in this cell-free system resulted in the synthesis of ~2 ng of Pr55 protein/ microl translation reaction (data not shown)..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	40	We expected some of these newly synthesized Pr55 chains to become myristoylated, target to membrane vesicles present in the cellular extract, and assemble into stable capsids. Other Pr55 chains might achieve some but not all of the steps in capsid assembly, and would therefore be detectable as heterogeneous assembly intermediates. To quantify the amount of assembly, an efficient method of separating assembled capsids from the remainder of the translation reaction was required. This was achieved in two steps. First, after completion of the assembly reaction, membrane vesicles were solubilized using the nonionic detergent NP-40. This treatment, which removes membranes enveloping capsids but does not affect the integrity of fully assembled capsids (Yu et al., 1993; Spearman et al., 1994), should solubilize unassembled Pr55 chains that may be anchored to membranes. Secondly, the detergent-treated, completed reaction was size fractionated on a sucrose step gradient into a soluble fraction (containing material of  < 500-S) and a particulate fraction (containing material between 500- and 1,000-S) that would be expected to contain completed immature capsids (Royer et al., 1991). Thus, while our standard translation and assembly reaction was carried out in the absence of detergent to allow association with membrane vesicles, analysis of the reaction product was performed in the presence of detergent, allowing the assembly status of the naked proteinacious capsid to be assessed..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	42	We found that the particulate fraction from a typical translation and assembly reaction contained between 15 and 40% of the total Pr55 synthesized (see Fig. 2). To assess whether this fraction contained properly assembled immature capsids, it was further analyzed by velocity sedimentation on linear sucrose gradients, equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl, and EM. For comparison, authentic immature HIV capsids produced in transfected cultured COS-1 cells were analyzed in parallel. We found that both detergent-treated capsids generated in the cell-free system and detergent-treated (de-enveloped) authentic capsids behaved as a relatively homogenous population of particles of ~750-S (Fig. 1, A and B), with a buoyant density of 1.36 g cm3 (Fig. 1, C and D). Additionally, cell-free assembled capsids and the authentic standard were identical in size as judged by gel filtration (data not shown). When examined by EM, we found that capsids made in the cellfree system (Fig. 1 E, 1-4) were morphologically similar to authentic capsids released from transfected cells (Fig. 1 E, 5 and 6) and had the expected diameter of ~100 nm (Gelderblom, 1991). Thus, on average, 25% of the radiolabeled Pr55 protein synthesized in the cell-free system assembles into particles that closely resemble authentic immature HIV capsids generated in transfected cells, as judged by EM appearance as well as the biochemical criteria of size, sedimentation coefficient, and buoyant density..

Studies in cellular systems have demonstrated that myristoylation of Gag is required for proper capsid assembly (Gheysen, 1989; Gottlinger, 1989). This NH2-terminal modification is thought to occur co-translationally (Wilcox et al., 1987). To assess the role of myristoylation in the cell-free system we omitted MCoA from the assembly reaction, or added it posttranslationally at 90 min into the reaction (when  > 90% of Pr55 chains have finished synthesis; data not shown). In both cases, a dramatic decrease in capsid assembly was observed (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with these data, we found that a Gag mutant that fails to become myristoylated (GA) also does not assemble in the cell-free system (see Fig. 3 B)..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	46	In cells, assembly of HIV capsids takes place at the inner surface of the host cell plasma membrane (Gelderblom, 1991; Wills and Craven, 1991). Membrane targeting of Pr55 chains is directed by the NH2-terminal myristate moiety and by internal domains of the Pr55 polypeptide (Jacobs et al., 1989; Bryant and Ratner, 1990; Wang and Barklis, 1993; Platt and Haffar, 1994; Hockley et al., 1994; Spearman et al., 1994). Studies using Pr55 mutations have shown that abolishing membrane targeting results in inefficient capsid assembly and failure of capsid release (Jacobs et al., 1989; Bryant and Ratner 1990). For this reason, targeting to plasma membranes is thought to facilitate the nucleation of Gag chains at a site within the cell where assembly, envelopment, and budding of the newly formed capsids can occur. If immature HIV capsid assembly in the cell-free system requires membrane fragments (which are present in the wheat germ extracts used), it should be sensitive to addition of detergent at concentrations that solubilize membranes. Thus, as a final criterion of authenticity of the cell-free capsid assembly reaction, we investigated the sensitivity of cell-free capsid assembly to the presence of detergent during the translation and assembly reaction. We treated the assembly reaction with a gentle, nonionic detergent that does not inhibit any of the enzymatic reactions involved in protein synthesis (Walter and Blobel, 1980) and thus would not be likely to affect protein interactions involved in assembly. As expected, the detergent Nikkol added to a concentration of 0.1% at the beginning of the translation reaction had no effect on Gag polypeptide synthesis (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 2 B, Nikkol at this concentration largely abolished capsid assembly. This effect was not observed when Nikkol was used at a concentration of 0.002%, which is below that required to disrupt lipid bilayers (Walter and Blobel, 1980). Furthermore, we found that Nikkol added after the completion of the 150 min assembly reaction did not diminish the amount of assembly, even when added to a concentration of 1.0% (data not shown). Thus, it appears that whereas the completed capsid particle itself is not sensitive to Nikkol (even at high concentrations), assembly of this structure is inhibited by concentrations of Nikkol that are sufficient to solubilize membranes. These data are consistent with the idea that membranes are required for newly synthesized Pr55 to be efficiently assembled into capsids in the cell-free system. Thus, the dependence of assembly on cotranslational myristoylation and the apparent requirement for membranes indicate that capsid assembly in the cell-free system faithfully reproduces characteristics of capsid assembly that have been described in cellular systems..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	48	Studies of capsid assembly in cell culture model systems have revealed that certain mutations within the Gag coding region disrupt immature HIV capsid assembly. As a third criterion for fidelity, we examined the assembly phenotypes in the cell-free system of four previously described mutations in Gag (Fig. 3 A): (a) the Pr46 mutant, in which the COOH-terminal p6 domain of Gag is deleted (Royer et al., 1991; Jowett et al., 1992; Hockley et al., 1994; Spearman et al., 1994); (b) the Pr41 mutant, in which the deleted domains include p6, p7, and the distal end of p24 containing the p24-p7 protease cleavage site (Gheysen et al., 1989; Jowett et al., 1992; Hockley et al., 1994); (c) the D2 mutation, in which 10 amino acids of the p24 domain of Gag (upstream of the p24-p7 protease cleavage site) are deleted (Hockley et al., 1994; Zhao et al., 1994); and (d) the GA mutation, an NH2-terminal single amino acid substitution that abolishes myristoylation of Gag (Gottlinger et al., 1989; Bryant and Ratner, 1990). Upon expression in cells, only the Pr46 mutant was capable of producing viral particles indistinguishable from those produced by expression of wild-type Gag (Royer et al., 1991; Jowett et al., 1992; Hockley et al., 1994; Spearman et al., 1994). Each of the other three mutants fails to result in proper viral particle production and release (Gheysen et al., 1989; Gottlinger et al., 1989; Bryant and Ratner, 1990; Jowett et al., 1992; Hockley et al., 1994; Zhao et al., 1994)..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	50	Assembly reactions were programmed with transcript encoding each of these mutations and the amount of immature capsid produced was quantitated as described in the legend of Fig. 3. As is shown in Fig. 3 B, the Pr41 and GA mutants failed to assemble into completed capsids, while ~40% of the total translation product of the assembly-competent Pr46 mutant and wild-type Gag assembled into completed capsids. The D2 mutant appeared to have generated a small amount of material in the region of completed capsids, but further analysis of this material revealed it to be the trail of a large Gag complex (of ~400- 500 S) that does not comigrate with completed capsid (see Fig. 6 E). Thus, like Pr41 and GA, D2 did not assemble into the 750-S completed capsid. Together, these data indicate that the cell-free system appears to faithfully reproduce phenotypes of a variety of assembly-defective and -competent mutations in Gag..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	52	For optimum assembly to occur, the cell-free reaction must be incubated at 25 degrees C for at least 150 min (data not shown). We observed that whereas the majority of Pr55 synthesis occurs during the first hour of this incubation, significant capsid formation does not take place until the final 90 min of the reaction. Thus, an aliquot of the reaction incubated for only 50 min contains ~60% of the full length Pr55 chains that are present in an aliquot incubated for the standard 150 min (data not shown). However, essentially none of the chains present at the 50 min time point has assembled into capsids (data not shown), while at 150 min 25% have completed the assembly process (Fig. 4 A). This indicated to us that it might be possible to completely separate the translation and assembly phases of the reaction. To confirm this, a reaction was split into two aliquots at 50 min into the incubation. To one aliquot we added emetine, which blocks translation by inhibiting chain elongation, and then both aliquots were incubated to 150 min. While total Pr55 synthesis in the emetine-treated reaction was 60% of the control (Fig. 4 A, compare gel lanes 1 and 2), the proportion of capsid assembly in this treated reaction was comparable to that of the untreated control (Fig. 4 A, bar graph), indicating that assembly takes place even when translation is halted. Based on these data, one would expect that manipulations performed after emetine treatment would have effects on only the posttranslational phase of assembly and should not affect Pr55 synthesis, which is already completed..

Thus, an aliquot of the reaction incubated for only 50 min contains ~60% of the full length Pr55 chains that are present in an aliquot incubated for the standard 150 min (data not shown). However, essentially none of the chains present at the 50 min time point has assembled into capsids (data not shown), while at 150 min 25% have completed the assembly process (Fig. 4 A). This indicated to us that it might be possible to completely separate the translation and assembly phases of the reaction. To confirm this, a reaction was split into two aliquots at 50 min into the incubation. To one aliquot we added emetine, which blocks translation by inhibiting chain elongation, and then both aliquots were incubated to 150 min. While total Pr55 synthesis in the emetine-treated reaction was 60% of the control (Fig. 4 A, compare gel lanes 1 and 2), the proportion of capsid assembly in this treated reaction was comparable to that of the untreated control (Fig. 4 A, bar graph), indicating that assembly takes place even when translation is halted. Based on these data, one would expect that manipulations performed after emetine treatment would have effects on only the posttranslational phase of assembly and should not affect Pr55 synthesis, which is already completed..

We treated Pr55 reactions with emetine and 0.1% Nikkol at 50 min into the reaction, continued the incubation to 150 min, and then determined the amount of assembly as previously described. Under these conditions, assembly was dramatically reduced (data not shown), just as it had been when Nikkol was added at the start of translation (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, we conclude that the detergent sensitive step(s) in HIV capsid assembly occurs posttranslationally..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	56	Next we examined whether posttranslational events in capsid assembly are dependent on the presence of ATP. Translation of Gag was allowed to proceed for 50 min, at which point further protein synthesis was inhibited with emetine. The sample was divided, and one aliquot was depleted of ATP by the addition of apyrase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes free ATP. After completion of the assembly reaction, samples were analyzed as previously described for the amount of assembly that had occurred. We found that depletion of free ATP from the assembly reaction resulted in a dramatic reduction in capsid assembly (Fig. 4 A, bar graph). The effect of ATP depletion was not reversed by addition of the nonhydrolyzable analogues, AMP-PNP or GTP-S (data not shown), suggesting that ATP hydrolysis, and not just ATP binding, is required. As expected, addition of apyrase did not change the total amount of Pr55 synthesis (Fig. 4 A, compare gel lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, adding apyrase to the reaction after capsid assembly was completed had no effect on the amount of assembly (data not shown), ruling out the possibility of an effect of apyrase or ATP depletion on capsid stability. These data indicate that there is a requirement for ATP in the capsid assembly process, and that this ATP dependence is distinct from the energy requirements of protein synthesis..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	59	Given that the Gag protein itself is not known to bind or hydrolyze ATP, the requirement for this energy substrate suggests that a host protein or proteins are involved in the assembly reaction. Demonstrating that such a host factor is required would involve showing that assembly fails to occur when this factor is depleted from the cellular extracts used in the assembly reaction. Furthermore, adding back the depleted fraction to the reaction should restore assembly. Thus, we sought to fractionate the translation extract in a manner that would leave intact all of the components needed for translation but remove at least one component required for assembly. The cellular extract used for translation and assembly was subfractionated by ultracentrifugation into two portions: HSS and HSP. The HSS, depleted of components that were 90-S or greater, supported Pr55 translation but not its assembly (Fig. 4 B). This indicates that the HSP likely contains an assembly specific host factor(s). This was demonstrated directly by showing that addition of the HSP posttranslationally (after emetine treatment) to unassembled Gag chains synthesized in the HSS resulted in a considerable restoration of particle assembly (Fig. 4 B). As expected, total synthesis of Pr55 was unaltered by addition of the HSP (Fig. 4 B, gel). Together, these data indicate that a subcellular fraction of the eukaryotic cell lysate is required for posttranslational events in capsid assembly to take place..

The resulting HSP was washed with detergent-free buffer and added posttranslationally to an assembly reaction. We found that the HSP from the detergent-treated extract was as active in promoting posttranslational capsid formation as the control HSP (Fig. 4 B, bar graph). Thus, separate detergent-sensitive and -insensitive host factors appear to be involved in the posttranslational phase of HIV capsid assembly.

To date, such intermediates in capsid assembly have not been described, most likely due to the difficulty of detection in cellular systems where they would be present only transiently and in minute quantities. Since the cell-free system is less efficient at forming completed capsids than are cellular systems, it might constitute a better system for detecting such assembly intermediates. Consistent with this possibility, we found that under conditions where only a small amount of 750-S capsid assembly occurs in the cell-free reaction, analysis of the reaction products on 13 ml velocity sedimentation gradients revealed the presence of a series of Gag-containing complexes, in addition to 750-S completed capsids (Fig. 5 A). These complexes, which have calculated sedimentation coefficients of ~10-S, 80-S, and 150-S, will henceforth be referred to as complexes A, B, and C, respectively..

To assess whether these complexes displayed this behavior, we used a pulse-chase analysis to follow a small cohort of radiolabeled Pr55 chains over time. The cell-free reaction was performed with radiolabeled cysteine. After the first 4 min of translation, an excess of unlabeled cysteine was added to abolish further labeling of subsequently synthesized Pr55 chains. We observed that the total amount of radiolabeled Pr55 was the same at 25 and 150 min into the pulse-chase reaction (Fig. 5 B), indicating that neither further radiolabeling nor degradation of Pr55 had occurred after 25 min and confirming that the same population of Pr55 chains was being analyzed at both times.

In marked contrast, examination of the assembly reaction at 150 min showed that a significant amount of radiolabeled Pr55 was assembled into completed capsids that migrated in the 750-S position (Fig. 5 D). Correspondingly, the amount of Pr55 in complexes A, B, and C was diminished by precisely the amount that was now found to be assembled, demonstrating that at least some of the material in complexes A, B, and C constitutes intermediates in the biogenesis of completed 750-S capsids..

Thus, polysome-associated nascent chains of Gag constitute the starting material in this pathway, and the 10-S complex A, which contains completed Gag chains, is likely to be the first intermediate in the formation of immature capsids.

Furthermore, one would expect that blockade at different points along this pathway would result in accumulation of complexes A, B, and C in various combinations, as determined by the order of their appearance along the assembly pathway. For example, if an ordered pathway of intermediates exists, then blockade at early points in the pathway should result in accumulation of one or two Gag-containing complexes corresponding to early putative assembly intermediates, while blockade at a very late point in the pathway would result in accumulation of all the putative assembly intermediates but not the final completed capsid product. To test these predictions, we blocked assembly in a variety of ways, both pharmacologically and through the use of mutations, and examined the Gag-containing complexes that were formed..

We found that all of the radiolabeled chains at the end of the Pr41 cell-free reaction were contained in a single complex that peaks at ~10-S and corresponds to complex A. Since the 10-S peak was very large and led to an irregular trail that could be masking 80- or 150-S peaks, we reanalyzed the products of a Pr41 reaction on a gradient that allowed high resolution in the 1-200-S size range (data not shown) and confirmed that all of the Pr41 translation product was present in complex A, which was ~10-S in size. Thus, in the cell-free system, it appears that Pr41 fails to progress beyond complex A, which is likely to represent the first intermediate in the assembly pathway..

These data indicate that the GA mutant, which contains the entire Gag coding region except for the myristoylation signal, is capable of forming complex A, which appeared to be the first assembly intermediate in the pulse-chase experiment, as well as complex B, but does not progress further towards forming completed capsids. These data suggest that complex B is likely to be the second assembly intermediate formed in the biogenesis of immature HIV capsids..

Note that complex D trails into the 750-S region, accounting for the appearance of a small amount of assembly in the simpler analysis presented in Fig. 1. However, the detailed analysis presented here makes it clear that in fact there is no discrete peak in the region of completed capsid (750-S). Thus, the D2 mutant appears to form a series of complexes corresponding in size to the assembly intermediates seen in the pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 5), as well as an additional complex of larger size, but fails to produce the completed 750-S product..

Gradient fractions were immunoblotted with Gag antibody, and the relative amount of Gag polypeptide present in each fraction was quantitated as described in Materials and Methods (Fig. 7 A, closed circles). The cell lysate contained Pr55 in a spectrum of complexes ranging from 10- to ~200-S. Since cells efficiently release completed HIV capsids, most of the completed capsid would be expected to be in the medium at steady state. This was confirmed by the finding that a substantial amount of fully assembled 750-S capsid was present in the medium (Fig. 7 A, open circles), while the cell lysate contained no 750-S capsids (Fig. 7 A, closed circles). We conclude, therefore, that within cells, Pr55 is present in a heterogeneous mixture of complexes that have S values similar to complexes A, B, and C, the assembly intermediates found in the cell-free system..

Thus, we examined whether the Pr41 mutant, which appears to be blocked after the first assembly intermediate in the cell-free system, and the D2 mutant, which appears to be blocked at the end of the assembly pathway in the cell-free system, resulted in corresponding patterns of Gag-containing complexes within cells. Cos cells were transfected with each of these mutants, and the medium as well as the lysate were examined by immunoblotting. As expected, medium from cells transfected with the assembly-defective Pr41 or D2 did not contain 750-S completed capsids (data not shown). The cell lysate of Cos cells transfected with the Pr41 mutant contained only material that peaked in the 10-S region of the velocity gradient (Fig. 7 B), resembling what had been found when the Pr41 mutant was expressed in the cell-free system (Fig. 6 C). The observation that the Pr41 reaction product migrated as a single complex that peaked in the 10-S region was confirmed by analysis on a variety of different velocity sedimentation gradients that allowed higher resolution in the 1-200-S size range (data not shown). In contrast, the cell lysate of Cos cells transfected with the D2 mutant contained a spectrum of immunoreactive complexes that ranged in size from 10-500-S (Fig. 7 C), resembling what had been found when D2 was expressed in the cell-free system (Fig. 6 E). Thus, the data from transfected cells suggests that the behavior of Gag mutants in the cell-free system reflects events in capsid assembly that occur in living cells..

The cell lysate of Cos cells transfected with the Pr41 mutant contained only material that peaked in the 10-S region of the velocity gradient (Fig. 7 B), resembling what had been found when the Pr41 mutant was expressed in the cell-free system (Fig. 6 C). The observation that the Pr41 reaction product migrated as a single complex that peaked in the 10-S region was confirmed by analysis on a variety of different velocity sedimentation gradients that allowed higher resolution in the 1-200-S size range (data not shown). In contrast, the cell lysate of Cos cells transfected with the D2 mutant contained a spectrum of immunoreactive complexes that ranged in size from 10-500-S (Fig. 7 C), resembling what had been found when D2 was expressed in the cell-free system (Fig. 6 E). Thus, the data from transfected cells suggests that the behavior of Gag mutants in the cell-free system reflects events in capsid assembly that occur in living cells..

We establish that the capsids produced closely resemble immature HIV capsids produced in cellular systems (Fig. 1) and that key known features of capsid assembly are faithfully reproduced in this cell-free system (Figs. 2 and 3). We then use it to dissect assembly into a number of steps. First, through the use of an inhibitor of protein synthesis, we demonstrate that assembly can be resolved into a co-translational phase, during which Pr55 polypeptides are synthesized, followed by a posttranslational phase, during which additional events necessary for assembly take place. Being able to separate these two phases allows us to analyze reactions specific to the assembly process, independent of other events such as protein synthesis..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	93	By manipulating the posttranslational phase of assembly, we then demonstrate that it has at least three specific requirements (Fig. 4). First, ATP is necessary, since the enzyme apyrase is able to effectively block the posttranslational progression of completed Pr55 chains into fully assembled capsids. Second, this phase is sensitive to nonionic detergent, implying that membrane fragments are likely to be involved. Third, using a depletion and reconstitution approach, we demonstrate that a subcellular fraction of eukaryotic cell lysate is required for the posttranslational assembly events to take place..
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	94	In addition, multiple criteria are used to demonstrate that the posttranslational phase of assembly proceeds by way of a series of Gag-containing complexes that appear to constitute intermediates in the cell-free capsid assembly reaction (Figs. 5 and 6 and Table I). Finally, we show that complexes resembling assembly intermediates may also be present in cellular systems that are producing immature HIV particles, and that mutants in Gag have a similar behavior in both cellular and cell-free systems (Fig. 7)..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	96	To date, studies have not revealed whether HIV capsid assembly occurs by way of a passive process of Gag polypeptide multimerization, or whether assembly is an active, regulated process requiring Gag associations with other proteins, as well as Gag-Gag interactions. By demonstrating that the posttranslational phase of assembly requires ATP and a detergent-insensitive host cell component, our data indicate that in fact HIV capsid assembly is an energydependent, coordinated process in which host proteins play a crucial role. Thus, the model of HIV capsid assembly supported by our data is conceptually very different from the view that many viral capsids are formed from capsid monomers by way of a passive process of "self assembly," requiring no components besides the individual capsid protein subunits (Klug, 1980). Indeed, while host factors have not previously been documented to play a role in the assembly of HIV capsids, the possibility of their existence has been raised by data demonstrating that yeast expressing Gag do not support HIV capsid assembly (Jacobs et al., 1989), while baculovirus and mammalian systems of expression do (for review see Boulanger and Jones, 1996). Such studies imply that yeast either contain a factor that inhibits HIV capsid assembly (that is absent in higher eukaryotes) or lack a factor necessary for assembly (that is present in higher eukaryotes). Our data support the latter possibility. Consistent with the notion that previously unrecognized host factors may be important at various points in the HIV life cycle is the recent demonstration that cyclophilins are associated with the HIV virus particle and are required for infectivity (Luban et al., 1993; Franke et al., 1994; Thali et al., 1994)..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	98	The finding that HIV capsid assembly requires ATP as well as host cell components suggests that the posttranslational phase of assembly may occur via a step-wise pathway of previously unrecognized assembly intermediates. We present three lines of evidence to support this view. First, using a pulse-chase analysis we demonstrate that a population of lower molecular weight Gag-containing complexes, referred to as complexes A, B, and C, is present at early time points in capsid assembly, and that Gag polypeptides from this population are converted into the final capsid product over time. Note that the possibility that these complexes represent polyribosomes has been ruled out by the demonstration that they are not sensitive to RNase A used at concentrations that result in complete digestion of messenger RNA (Lingappa, J.R., unpublished observations). At very short chase times, all of the radiolabeled Pr55 in the pulse-chase reaction is present in complex A, suggesting that this may be the first intermediate in the assembly reaction, appearing after completed Gag chains are released from ribosomes. It remains to be determined whether complex A constitutes either a monomer or dimer of Gag, or whether it is composed of a Gag chain associated with a host protein..

Note that these data do not exclude the existence of other intermediates that might occur later in the pathway. Such intermediates would not be seen with apyrase or detergent blockade, since these agents appear to block assembly by preventing progression beyond the 150-S complex. The demonstration that both detergent and ATP depletion appear to result in the accumulation of the same assembly intermediates raises the possibility that this point in the assembly pathway may be a critical one, in which a variety of events necessary for assembly must take place in a coordinated fashion. Further work will be required to determine whether this represents an important point of regulation in the assembly pathway..

We find that each mutant results in the accumulation of different subsets of these assembly intermediates. Thus, a mutant that appears to be blocked after the first step in the assembly pathway results in the accumulation of complex A alone (Fig. 6 C), while one that appears to be blocked after the second step of the pathway results in accumulation of complex A and complex B (Fig. 6 D). A spectrum of complexes, including complexes A, B, and C, as well as the larger complex D, is seen upon expression of a mutant that appears to be blocked at a very late step in the assembly pathway (Fig. 6 E). Thus, analysis of these mutants supports the existence of intermediates in the assembly of HIV capsids, and also suggests an order to the appearance of such intermediates during the process of capsid assembly..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	104	There are a number of caveats to our demonstration of assembly intermediates. First, one or more of these putative intermediates could in fact constitute a side reaction or dead end byproduct off the main pathway of capsid assembly. The most likely candidate for such a dead-end byproduct is complex D, which is only clearly apparent in the analysis of the assembly-defective D2 mutant (Fig. 6 E). Arguing against the possibility that complexes A, B, or C are simply nonproductive side reactions is the finding that the amount of each of these complexes varies inversely with the amount of completed, immature capsid formed. Such behavior would be expected for assembly intermediates but not for dead-end byproducts or side reactions. For example, the quantity of each of these complexes decreases over time in the pulse-chase experiment, during a period when completed capsids are appearing and the total number of radiolabeled Gag chains present is constant (Fig. 5). Likewise, complexes B and C increase in quantity when formation of capsids is blocked (Table I). Additionally, in an analysis of a mutant that is more efficient in capsid production than wild-type cells, we find that the amount of complex A drops to very low levels when very large amounts of capsid are being made (Hill, R.L., and J.R. Lingappa, unpublished observation). Thus, the simplest interpretation of our data is that the Gag complexes A, B, and C constitute true assembly intermediates, although definitive proof of this must await a functional examination of each of these intermediates in isolation..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	106	A second caveat is that our analysis could be complicated by instability of Gag-containing complexes. Thus, lower molecular weight complexes could actually result from disassembly of a higher order complex. This seems unlikely to be a significant problem in our system, given that we have not observed any of the Gag-containing complexes to be labile in our studies. For example, in the pulse- chase experiments (Fig. 5), there is a clear-cut progression over time from complexes A, B, and C to completed immature capsids. Residual amounts of complexes A and B present at the end of the incubation are likely due to incomplete conversion resulting from depletion and inactivation of necessary factors over time..

While one or more complexes may not appear to be distinct in a particular experiment or a particular gradient (i.e., the 150-S complex in Fig. 5 C), the specific complexes described here have been seen repeatedly in many different experiments and under a variety of gradient conditions and therefore are likely to represent discrete complexes that are difficult to resolve perfectly in every experiment given their transient and dynamic nature..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	111	Together, our results support a model of capsid assembly as a stepwise process consisting of discrete biochemical events with specific requirements for ATP and at least one detergent-insensitive component of eukaryotic cell lysate. The model in Fig. 8 presents the simplest scenario that unifies the data presented here. While further analysis of this system may reveal additional complexities, this scheme presents a biochemical framework against which hypotheses can now be tested. Fig. 8. A model for the assembly of immature HIV capsids. This model is based on the simplest interpretation of the data presented. Newly synthesized Gag proteins are myristoylated cotranslationally. Nascent Gag polypeptides appear to chase into completed immature capsids by way of a series of Gag-containing complexes (complexes A, B, C, and D). Evidence presented in the text suggests that complexes A, B, and C may constitute assembly intermediates. It is less clear whether complex D constitutes an assembly intermediate or a side reaction. Both ATP and a subcellular fraction of eukaryotic cell extract are required for assembly to take place, while detergent and apyrase are proposed to disrupt assembly at the indicated position. The points along the pathway at which various mutants of Gag are arrested are indicated below the model. [View Larger Version of this Image (11K GIF file)].

Further work will be required to determine to what extent the mechanism of cell-free HIV capsid assembly reflects biochemical events that occur in vivo. Here we show that, under steady state conditions, cells releasing immature HIV capsids contain Pr55 complexes that correspond in approximate size to complexes A, B, and C, the assembly intermediates observed in the cell-free system. In addition, assembly-defective mutants arrested at specific complexes in the cell-free system appear to be arrested in the form of similar sized complexes when they are expressed in cells (Fig. 7). While these data do not constitute proof that assembly intermediates exist in cells, they lend support to the idea that the process of HIV capsid assembly in the cell-free system is closely correlated to the capsid assembly process in cells. It should be noted that in other biological systems, transient intermediates that have been well documented in cell-free reactions have yet to be identified in cells. For example, in the case of targeting of nascent secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, signal recognition particle-bound nascent chains have been demonstrated biochemically only in cell-free systems (Walter and Blobel, 1983), even though genetic evidence confirms the importance of signal recognition particles in vivo (Hann and Walter, 1991)..

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	120	Cell-free systems have been used in the past to assemble simple viral particles whose formation is dependent only on cytosolic components of host cells (Molla et al., 1991; Lingappa et al., 1994; Sakalian et al., 1996). In the current study we demonstrate that such systems can also be used to reconstitute the assembly of much more complex viral capsids, such as HIV capsids, that require co-translational modifications as well as membrane targeting for their biogenesis. These data suggest that the cell-free system can be used to examine capsid assembly mechanisms of many different types of viruses..
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	121	Previously, we used a cell-free system to study the mechanism of assembly of a Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), a completely unrelated virus (Lingappa et al., 1994). Unlike HIV capsids, HBV capsids are formed free in the cytoplasm of the host cell (for review see Ganem, 1991). We found that these capsids assemble by way of an intermediate that is associated with at least one host protein. When this intermediate was isolated, manipulation of energy substrates resulted in release of the completed capsid end product. Thus, while cell-free HIV and HBV capsid assembly differ greatly in many details and in their complexity, they share some general mechanistic themes. Capsid formation in both systems involves assembly intermediates, the use of energy substrates, and association with host proteins. Thus, we propose that viruses of very different types may assemble their capsids via a step-wise pathway using host cell machinery. Whether the same or different host machinery is recruited by various viruses remains to be determined..

Now that the method has been established, it should be possible to supplement this system with such additional components in a manner that will extend the reconstitution and allow the roles of other components in capsid assembly to be determined. For example, using a modified version of this system, it should be possible to determine the requirements for encapsidation of viral RNA and viral specific enzymes. Note that although no HIV-specific RNA besides the gag transcript is included in the cell-free reactions described in this study, it is entirely possible that nonspecific RNA from the cellular extract becomes incorporated into the capsids that are made..

Antiretroviral agents currently in use target only two aspects of the HIV life- cycle, namely reverse transcription and protease-dependent virion maturation. In order to develop novel targets for future antiretroviral therapy, a mechanistic analysis of other aspects of the HIV life cycle, such as capsid assembly, must be aggressively pursued. The work presented here establishes a means of carrying out such a biochemical analysis for assembly of the HIV capsid. Furthermore, these data indicate the existence of novel steps in viral assembly that appear to be amenable to blockade..

0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Development of strategies to prevent herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection requires knowledge of cellular pathways harnessed by the virus for invasion. This study demonstrates that HSV induces rapid phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in several human target cells and that phosphorylation is important for entry post-binding. Nuclear transport of the viral tegument protein VP16, transport of viral capsids to the nuclear pore, and downstream events (including expression of immediate-early genes and viral plaque formation) were substantially reduced in cells transfected with dominant-negative mutants of FAK or small interfering RNA designed to inhibit FAK expression. These observations were substantiated using mouse embryonic fibroblast cells derived from embryonic FAK-deficient mice. Infection was reduced by  > 90% in knockout cells relative to control cells and was further reduced if the knockout cells were transfected with small interfering RNA targeting proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2, which was also phosphorylated in response to HSV. The knockout cells were permissive for viral binding, and virus triggered an intracellular calcium response, but nuclear transport was inhibited. Together, these results support a novel model for invasion that implicates FAK phosphorylation as important for delivery of viral capsids to the nuclear pore..

0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Herpes simplex virus (HSV)1 type 2 is a major global health problem, the leading cause of genital herpes and neonatal herpes encephalitis, and a major cofactor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Novel strategies to prevent HSV-2 and other sexually transmitted infections are urgently needed. Development of new approaches requires an understanding of the molecular and cellular events critical for the establishment of infection. Previous work demonstrates that HSV entry is a complex process requiring the following steps: (i) binding to heparan sulfate receptors; (ii) engagement of glycoprotein D coreceptors; (iii) penetration, which, for human epithelial cells, is mediated primarily by fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane; (iv) transport of the viral tegument protein VP16 (trans-inducing factor (TIF)) to the nucleus; and (v) transport of viral capsids to the nuclear pore with release of viral DNA into the nucleoplasm (1, 2). Glycoprotein B plays the major role in mediating binding of HSV-2 to heparan sulfate receptors, whereas glycoprotein C plays a more dominant role in mediating binding of HSV-1 (3, 4). For both serotypes, glycoproteins B, D, and H-L are required for penetration, but their precise role and the cellular pathways important for viral invasion have not been fully elucidated. The observations that heparan sulfate is the major attachment receptor for HSV and that heparan sulfate moieties also interact with gp120 of HIV fostered the development of sulfated or sulfonated polymers as candidate topical microbicides to prevent viral transmission. These compounds prevent genital herpes in the mouse and simian immunodeficiency virus in the macaque and are currently being evaluated in Phase II/III clinical trials (5, 6). However, competitive antagonists of viral binding are not likely to be sufficient to fully protect against sexual transmission. Experience with systemic therapy indicates that combination therapies that target more than one step in the viral life cycle are optimal. Thus, elucidating the cellular pathways required for viral entry may provide novel targets for microbicide development..

0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	7	We reported previously that both serotypes of HSV trigger inositol triphosphate-mediated release of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores and that Ca2+ signaling plays a critical role in viral entry (7). Pharmacological inhibition of ER Ca2+ release or chelation of intracellular Ca2+ reduces nuclear transport of the viral tegument protein VP16, a surrogate marker for capsid transport, and the downstream events in the viral life cycle, including expression of viral immediate-early genes and viral plaque formation. Activation of Ca2+ signaling is associated with triggering of phosphorylation signaling pathways. Specifically, we observed previously that HSV-1 and HSV-2 trigger the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) within 5-10 min following exposure of Vero (monkey kidney) or CaSki (human cervical epithelial) cells to virus. FAK phosphorylation appears to occur downstream of release of ER Ca2+ stores, as treatment of cells with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, an inositol triphosphate receptor antagonist that prevents release of ER Ca2+, or chelation of intracellular Ca2+ blocks the virus-induced phosphorylation of FAK. Activation of both pathways (Ca2+ and FAK phosphorylation) requires exposure to entry-competent virus, as HSV-1 deleted in the glycoproteins essential for penetration (glycoproteins B, D, and H-L) fails to induce Ca2+ release or to trigger FAK phosphorylation, whereas Ca2+ release and phosphorylation are preserved following exposure to the repaired viruses and to inactivated virus, which retain the ability to penetrate cells. These findings led to the proposal of a new paradigm for HSV entry in which HSV triggers inositol triphosphate-mediated release of ER Ca2+ stores, which may facilitate fusion of the viral envelope and cell membrane, allowing delivery of capsids to the cytoplasm (7). In response to activation of the Ca2+ pathways, we hypothesize that FAK and related signaling pathways are activated, which may promote transport of the viral capsids to the nuclear pores. This study was designed to test this hypothesis and to evaluate whether HSV exploits FAK signaling pathways to promote its nuclear transport. We used complementary molecular techniques, including dominant-negative variants, small interfering RNA (siRNA), and knockout cells, to explore the role played by FAK in HSV invasion. We tested the hypothesis with both serotypes using human and murine cells. Our findings indicate that FAK phosphorylation plays a central role in promoting transport of viral capsids..

HSV-2 induced an 3-fold increase in the level of phosphorylated FAK as a percentage of total FAK compared with mock-infected cells (Fig. 2A, left panel); the response persisted for 1 h.

Notably, no reduction in susceptibility to vesicular stomatitis virus was observed for FAK-/- cells relative to FAK+/+ cells. Susceptibility to HSV infection was partially restored if cells were transfected with the wild-type FAK gene (data not shown)..

The results demonstrate that there was no reduction in binding of virus to cells in FAK-/- cells relative to FAK+/+ cells (Fig. 3A). However, nuclear transport of VP16 1 h after citrate treatment was substantially reduced in FAK-/- cells compared with FAK+/+ cells (Fig. 3B). The blots were scanned, and optical densitometry corrected for differences in loading. At a m.o.i. of 10 pfu/cell, there was an 93% reduction in the relative amounts of VP16 detected in the nuclei of FAK-/- cells compared with FAK+/+ cells. The amount of nuclear VP16 detected was comparable with that observed if FAK+/+ cells were infected with 10-fold less virus (m.o.i. = 1 pfu/cell). To ensure that nuclear VP16 reflects transported and not newly synthesized protein, experiments were also conducted in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis (Fig. 3C). Comparable amounts of nuclear VP16 were detected 1 h after citrate treatment in FAK+/+ cells independent of cycloheximide treatment and accounted for 73% of total cell-associated VP16. As anticipated, a substantial reduction in viral ICP4 expression was also observed in FAK-/- cells compared with FAK+/+ cells, consistent with impaired delivery of viral DNA to the cell nucleus and thus viral gene expression (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that, in the absence of FAK, viral invasion is blocked at a step post-binding, leading to reduced nuclear transport of VP16 and inhibition of downstream events, including expression of immediate-early gene products and plaque formation..

Together, these results suggest that HSV induces phosphorylation of Pyk2 independent of phosphorylation of FAK and that, although FAK plays the predominant role, activation of both kinases contributes to viral infection..

Compared with cells transfected with control nonspecific siRNA, HSV-2 infection was inhibited by 74  plus or minus  6, 60  plus or minus  5, and 94  plus or minus  7% in CaSki cells transfected with siRNA for FAK, Pyk2, or both, respectively (Fig. 10A). Consistent with the low level of Pyk2 phosphorylation observed in FAK+/+ cells (Fig. 9A), transfection of these cells with Pyk2-specific siRNA had little inhibitory effect (22%), whereas transfection with FAK-specific siRNA reduced viral infection by 71%. In contrast, transfection of FAK-/- cells with Pyk2-specific siRNA further reduced viral infection by  > 99%. To directly evaluate whether Pyk2 phosphorylation also contributes to nuclear transport, CaSki cells were transfected with nonspecific or Pyk2-specific siRNA, and the effects on viral binding and VP16 transport to the nucleus were evaluated. Transfection with Pyk2-specific siRNA had no effect on viral binding (Fig. 10B), but had a modest inhibitory effect on nuclear transport of VP16 (Fig. 10C).

However, viruses presumably also must harness host cell pathways for entry and egress (16). The results obtained in this study demonstrate for the first time that HSV triggers phosphorylation of the cellular kinases FAK and Pyk2 to promote successful invasion. HSV independently induces phosphorylation of FAK and Pyk2, and disruption of these pathways impedes delivery of the tegument protein VP16 to the nucleus and delivery of capsids to the nuclear pore, leading to a reduction in downstream events (viral gene expression and plaque formation)..

Immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that HSV-1 capsids co-localize with dynein and dynactin. Microtubule-depolymerizing agents, such as nocodazole, block HSV infection in culture and in animal models (1). Moreover, nuclear transport of capsids is reduced by dynein inhibitors (19). Precisely how HSV (or other viruses) engages and regulates the microtubule complexes is not known. It has been suggested that cellular kinases triggered by viral infection or perhaps encoded by viruses themselves may play this regulatory role. The results obtained in this study support this notion and suggest that cellular FAK and the related tyrosine kinase Pyk2 are activated by HSV to promote transport along microtubules..

More recent studies indicate that FAK also participates in the regulation of microtubule function. For example, integrin-mediated activation of FAK is required for microtubule stabilization in mouse fibroblasts (20). Additionally, FAK phosphorylation at Ser732 is important for microtubule organization, nuclear movement, and neuronal migration (21). The latter study suggests that FAK phosphorylation regulates microtubule-based nuclear translocation and neuronal migration. Pyk2 (also called FAK2) belongs to the same family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases as does FAK. In contrast to FAK, which is expressed ubiquitously, Pyk2 expression is more restricted, but is found in hematopoietic, neuronal, and epithelial cells. Pyk2 shares substantial homology with FAK and interacts with intracellular signaling molecules to activate a variety of cellular pathways, including regulation of microtubules (15). Notably, increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels are associated with Pyk2 phosphorylation. We found that HSV also induces Pyk2 phosphorylation independent of FAK. Pyk2 phosphorylation was most evident in FAK-/- fibroblasts, which are known to overexpress Pyk2 (15), and also contributed to viral infection post-binding. Thus, the observation that HSV capsid nuclear transport occurs via microtubules and the association of FAK and Pyk2 with microtubule regulation suggest that HSV triggers these cellular kinases to harness the microtubule machinery for its nuclear transport..

FAK is activated by integrin binding and aggregation. Thus, viruses that bind integrin receptors, such as adenovirus and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), trigger FAK phosphorylation. Adenovirus induces tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK within 15 min following infection of human corneal fibroblasts, but its role in viral pathogenicity is not known (22). HHV-8 glycoprotein B, which possesses an RGD motif, binds to integrin receptors on target cells and triggers rapid phosphorylation of FAK and related signaling pathways. The finding that HHV-8 infection of FAK-null cells is substantially reduced suggests that FAK may also be required for HHV-8 entry, but this has not yet been experimentally demonstrated (23-25). Additionally, binding of HIV gp120 to T cells also triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (26), which may promote apoptosis (27), but has not yet been demonstrated to play any role in HIV entry or nuclear transport..

This notion is supported by the findings that HSV induces an increase in [Ca2+]i in FAK-/- cells (Fig. 9) and that treatment of cells with pharmacological agents that block release of ER Ca2+ stores or chelation of intracellular Ca2+ prevents the virus-induced phosphorylation of FAK (7). In contrast to what has been observed for HHV-8 glycoprotein B or HIV gp120, no single HSV glycoprotein-cell interaction appears to be sufficient to activate the requisite cell signaling pathways. Our studies with deletion viruses indicate that penetration-competent virus is required to induce signaling. This follows from the observations that HSV-1 deleted in glycoprotein L or glycoprotein D, both of which bind but do not penetrate, fails to induce the signaling responses, whereas heat-inactivated virus induces phosphorylated FAK (7). Possibly, one of the HSV envelope glycoproteins interacts with a cell-surface receptor to trigger the signaling cascade, but the interaction is dependent on the other glycoproteins being present in the viral envelope. This could occur if, for example, the other glycoproteins induce a conformational change in and/or recruit the requisite glycoprotein(s) to a specific site at the membrane..

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the floral identity protein LEAFY has strong non-autonomous effects when expressed in the epidermis, mediated by its movement into underlying tissue layers. By contrast, a structurally unrelated floral identity protein, APETALA1, has only limited non-autonomous effects. Using GFP fusions to monitor protein movement in the shoot apical meristem and in floral primordia of Arabidopsis, we found a strong correlation between cytoplasmic localization of proteins and their ability to move to adjacent cells. The graded distribution of several GFP fusions with their highest levels in the cells where they are produced is compatible with the notion that this movement is driven by diffusion. We also present evidence that protein movement is more restricted laterally within layers than it is from L1 into underlying layers of the Arabidopsis apex. Based on these observations, we propose that intercellular movement of transcription factors can occur in a non-targeted fashion as a result of simple diffusion. This hypothesis raises the possibility that diffusion is the default state for many macromolecules in the Arabidopsis apex, unless they are specifically retained..

We also present evidence that protein movement is more restricted laterally within layers than it is from L1 into underlying layers of the Arabidopsis apex. Based on these observations, we propose that intercellular movement of transcription factors can occur in a non-targeted fashion as a result of simple diffusion. This hypothesis raises the possibility that diffusion is the default state for many macromolecules in the Arabidopsis apex, unless they are specifically retained..

In animals, this process relies mainly on secreted signaling peptides, which interact with the extracellular matrix, and specific cell surface receptors. The interaction first triggers a signal transduction response in the cytoplasm of the target cells, and eventually leads to changes in gene expression. Complex protein-protein interactions and multiple protein phosphorylation steps are involved in many of these pathways, such as the EGF, TGFss, Notch, Hedgehog and WNT family signaling pathways. An alternative form of communication is achieved by the diffusion of transcription factors from their sources to the target nuclei through a continuous cytoplasm, such as the syncytium of Drosophila blastoderm embryos, one of the best understood model systems for transcriptional regulation (Rivera-Pomar and Jackle, 1996). However, syncytial organization is restricted to only a few tissues in metazoans..

However, in contrast to animals, cytoplasmic continuity between plant cells is the rule, not the exception. Most plant cells are connected by plasmodesmata, plasma membrane-lined channels that provide cytoplasmic continuity between adjacent cells. Plasmodesmata, which are used in the transport of nutrients and signaling molecules including RNAs and proteins, can be divided into two major groups (Crawford and Zambryski, 1999; Haywood et al., 2002; Lucas, 1995). The primary plasmodesmata form during cytokinesis, whereas the secondary plasmodesmata develop between cells that are not necessarily clonally related. The size exclusion limit (SEL) of the different types of plasmodesmata can be measured using fluorescent tracer molecules. In most cases, plasmodesmata in younger tissues have larger SEL and are morphologically simpler than those in older tissue (Crawford and Zambryski, 2001)..
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	9	Two modes of movement through plasmodesmata have been proposed. Targeted movement involves specific interactions between the transported macromolecules and plasmodesmata components. This leads to an increase in the SEL and is therefore not limited by the endogenous SEL of a given cell. By contrast, non-targeted movement resembles passive diffusion and is governed by the endogenous SEL of the plasmodesmata involved (Crawford and Zambryski, 2000; Imlau et al., 1999; Oparka et al., 1999). The best understood case of targeted movement is probably the trafficking of plant viral movement proteins (MPs), which can move over long distances in plants and are key to the spreading of plant viral infections. A good example of non-targeted movement is provided by green fluorescent protein (GFP). Using transient transfection by bombardment, it has been shown that native GFP can move several cells away from its source. In addition to the SEL, multimerization and the addition of nuclear or ER localization signals can hinder, or even prevent, GFP from leaving the source cell (Crawford and Zambryski, 2000; Crawford and Zambryski, 2001)..

A good example is the sucrose transporter SUT1, whose mRNA is transported into the phloem before it is translated (Kuhn et al., 1997). Moreover, grafting experiments have demonstrated the existence of long-distance mRNA movement in plants (Kim et al., 2001; Ruiz-Medrano et al., 1999). More recently, studies conducted in several plant species have demonstrated that non-cell-autonomous effects of transcription factors involved in plant development can be mediated by protein movement (reviewed by Haywood et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2002)..

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	13	The first example of transcription factor movement was discovered through studies of the homeodomain protein KNOTTED1 (KN1) in maize. Most plant organs originate post-embryonically from meristems, which include stem cells set aside during embryogenesis. In the aerial part of the plant, new organs emerge from the shoot apical meristem (SAM), which consists of three tissue layers, L1-L3. KN1 protein is found throughout the maize SAM but kn1 mRNA is absent from the L1 layer (Jackson et al., 1994; Smith et al., 1992). In leaf injection experiments, not only was KN1 transported to the surrounding tissue through plasmodesmata, but KN1 also increased the SEL of plasmodesmata, enabling the transport of kn1 sense RNA and protein complexes (Kragler et al., 2000; Lucas et al., 1995). KN1 can also move away from its source of expression when expressed from heterologous promoters in Arabidopsis (Kim et al., 2002). There is similar evidence that the Antirrhinum MADS-box transcription factor DEFICIENS (DEF) moves from inner to outer tissue layers in developing flowers, although the extent of movement is stage- and organ-dependent (Perbal et al., 1996)..

RNA of the GRAS-family transcription factor SHR is expressed in the stele of the root (Helariutta et al., 2000), but SHR protein is found in both the stele and the surrounding endodermis, which is missing in shr mutants. Further studies using transgenic misexpression confirmed that movement of SHR from the root stele to endodermis is required for endodermis development (Nakajima et al., 2001). RNA of the plant-specific transcription factor LFY is expressed in all three layers of young floral primordia, which are mis-specified as shoots in strong lfy mutants (Weigel et al., 1992). Surprisingly, LFY RNA expression in the L1 of developing flowers is sufficient to fully rescue the lfy-mutant phenotype. In such transgenic plants, LFY protein, but not LFY RNA, is detected in all layers of the rescued flowers, indicating that LFY protein moves from the L1 into inner layers (Sessions et al., 2000). By contrast, the transcription factor APETALA1 (AP1), which has similar in vivo functions as LFY but is structurally unrelated, behaves largely cell-autonomously (Sessions et al., 2000)..

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	17	Although movement of transcription factors in Arabidopsis and other plants is by now well-established, there are still major gaps in understanding the underlying mechanisms. Here, we characterize the mode of LFY movement in Arabidopsis SAMs and floral primordia. Using functional LFY-GFP fusion proteins, we show that LFY moves more readily from the L1 into deeper cell layers than laterally into adjacent, clonally related cells. By contrast, a functional AP1-GFP fusion is unable to move from its source cells. Comparison of the dynamics of LFY-GFP fusion proteins with other GFP fusions suggests that this movement is driven by diffusion. Deletion experiments failed to identify a specific movement signal in LFY, which is compatible with the conclusion that LFY movement is non-targeted. The hypothesis of non-targeted movement is also supported by the finding of a correlation between cytoplasmic localization and the ability of these proteins to move to adjacent cells..

To provide data relevant to transcription factor movement in Arabidopsis meristems, we first set out to examine the movement of these two types of proteins from the L1 layer when expressed in intact plants. When we expressed the Turnip Vein Clearing Virus Movement Protein fused to GFP (TVCVMP:GFP) in the L1, using the L1-specific ML1 promoter (Sessions et al., 1999), GFP fluorescence was detected in all cells of vegetative and inflorescence apices, although the signal was slightly higher in the L1 layer (Fig. 1A). In situ hybridization (Fig. 1A, inset) demonstrated that TVCVMP:GFP RNA was restricted to the L1 in these plants, not only confirming the specificity of the ML1 promoter, but also confirming that TVCVMP does not transport its own RNA. In the maturing leaf epidermis, which is part of the L1 layer and where cellular boundaries are clearly visible, TVCVMP:GFP was found specifically associated with the cell wall in a punctate pattern (Fig. 1D), which may coincide with the location of plasmodesmata pit fields (Crawford and Zambryski, 2001; Heinlein et al., 1998). Deeper optical sections also revealed that a substantial fraction of TVCVMP:GFP can enter the mesophyll cells from the leaf epidermis (data not shown).

Inset in A shows that TVCVMP:GFP RNA is restricted to the L1, as detected by in situ hybridization. In D-F, the GFP fluorescence channel is overlaid with the transmissible light channel. TVCVMP:GFP is found in all cells in the inflorescence apex (A), and it is associated with the cell wall in a punctate pattern (D). 2xGFP forms a gradient of six to ten cells in the apex, with the highest concentration in L1 (B). It is located in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (E). NLS:2xGFP can move efficiently only one cell layer from the L1 in the apex (C), and it appears mostly nuclear (F)..

Here, 2xGFP and NLS:2xGFP, when expressed stably in the L1, behaved similarly. In vegetative and inflorescence apices, 2xGFP could move at least six cells into the L2 and L3 layers, forming a gradient with the highest levels in the L1 (Fig. 1B). It appeared both cytoplasmic and nuclear in the leaf epidermis (Fig. 1E). In agreement with bombardment studies, only a small amount of NLS:2xGFP was able to enter the L2 layer in apices, with no GFP signal detected in the L3 layer (Fig. 1C).

We have previously reported that AP1 has largely cell-autonomous effects when expressed in the L1 layer, indicating that AP1 does not move into internal layers, although protein localization was not directly examined (Sessions et al., 2000). In strong ap1 mutants, sepals and petals fail to develop, and secondary flowers develop in the axil of sepals that have been converted into bracts. A 1.7 kb promoter fragment drives expression of a reporter gene in a pattern similar to that of endogenous AP1 (Hempel et al., 1997), and when fused to an AP1 cDNA can largely rescue the phenotype of the strong ap1-15 allele (M. Yanofsky, personal communication). Expression of the C-terminal AP1:GFP fusion from the AP1 promoter rescued most aspects of the ap1-15 mutant phenotype, although rescue was variable in different lines (Fig. 2A).

The N-terminal fusion GFP:AP1 does not rescue ap1-15 mutant flowers when expressed from the AP1 promoter (B). Confocal images of GFP fluorescence in inflorescence apices of 2-week-old ML1::AP1:GFP (D,E) and ML1::GFP:AP1 (F) plants are shown. AP1:GFP does not move from the L1 (D; optical section through the shoot apex), and is tightly associated with nuclei (E; tangential section through the L1 of a floral primordium).

When AP1:GFP (55 kDa) was expressed under the ML1 promoter, we observed some gain-of-function phenotypes associated with the overexpression of AP1 in the L1 (Sessions et al., 2000), such as the development of bracts subtending the flowers (Fig. 2C). The GFP signal in apices from these plants was restricted to the L1 layer (Fig. 2D), and was very tightly associated with the cell nuclei (Fig. 2E). This observation supports the previous conclusion that AP1 does not move from the L1 layer into the inner tissue, and that only some transcription factors can move between tissue layers in the Arabidopsis apex. GFP:AP1, which appeared non-functional when expressed from the AP1 promoter, moved into all tissue layers from the L1 in ML1::GFP:AP1 apices (Fig. 2F). The subcellular localization of GFP:AP1 was also abnormal; instead of being exclusively nuclear like the functional AP1:GFP fusion, it produced a mostly cytoplasmic signal. The cytoplasmic localization may well be causally related to the ability of this fusion to move and to the inability to rescue the mutant phenotype; however, it is unlikely that movement itself interferes with AP1 function. Western blots probed with an anti-GFP antibody showed that both fusions migrated at approximately 52 kDa (expected size 55 kDa; arrow, Fig. 4B).

We used these fusions, which increase the size of LFY by about half, from 47 to 74 kDa, to further characterize the movement of LFY, which has been previously detected using anti-LFY antibodies (Sessions et al., 2000). The fusions were introduced into lfy-12/+ plants under the control of the ML1 promoter. To test independently for functionality, the N- and C-terminally tagged versions were also expressed under the control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter. All five transgenes were able to rescue the lfy-12 mutant phenotype, and to cause the typical gain-of-function phenotypes associated with overexpression of LFY (Weigel and Nilsson, 1995), which indicates that the three GFP fusions were fully functional..

All three fusions were detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, which was best seen in leaf epidermal cells (GLFY shown in Fig. 3C), and all produced more cytoplasmic signal than NLS:2xGFP (Fig. 1F). In leaf epidermal cells, a punctate signal that appeared along the cell wall was observed with all three fusions (GLFY shown in Fig. 3C), which suggests a possible association with plasmodesmata pit fields. GLFY and GFP:LFY moved three to four cell layers into the L2 and L3 in both the vegetative and inflorescence apices, forming a gradient with the highest concentration in the L1 (Fig. 3A,B). Both GLFY and GFP:LFY were restricted to the epidermal layer in maturing leaves (data not shown). LFY:GFP moved further, approximately 10 cell layers in apices (Fig. 3D). In leaves, its distribution in the epidermis was similar to that of GLFY and GFP:LFY, but it could also be detected in the underlying mesophyll cells (data not shown). Overall, LFY:GFP appeared more cytoplasmic than GLFY and GFP:LFY. This observation was confirmed by quantifying the total signal intensity in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the epidermal cells of emerging leaves from all three fusions (see Materials and Methods). For GLFY and GFP:LFY, the nuclear to cytoplasmic signal ratios were very similar, 1:2.3 and 1:2.5, respectively. By contrast, the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of LFY:GFP was 1:5.4, a twofold increase compared with GLFY and GFP:LFY. Western blots probed with an anti-GFP antibody demonstrated that there was little degradation of the fusion proteins, indicating that the in vivo fluorescence signal came from the intact fusion proteins (Fig. 4C). Taken together, the behavior of LFY-GFP fusions is intermediate between that of 2xGFP and NLS:2xGPF, both with respect to their cytoplasmic localization and their ability to move from the L1 layer..

GLFY moves several cell layers into the underlying tissue from the L1 in the apex (A). GFP:LFY shows a similar gradient from the L1 as GLFY (B). The signal from LFY:GFP, which has the longest moving range, appears `fuzzy' because of its higher cytoplasmic localization (D).

To study the lateral movement of LFY within each tissue layer, we took advantage of a mutated enhancer from the AGAMOUS (AG) gene, which drives reporter gene expression in the inflorescence meristem in addition to the normal AG domain in the center of floral meristems (Hong et al., 2003)..

Except for the subcellular localization, the expression patterns of NLS:2xGFP (Fig. 5A) and 2xGFP (Fig. 5B) were indistinguishable, with fluorescent signal in the inflorescence meristem and central domain of young floral primordia. The signal in both the shoot and floral meristems had discrete boundaries, indicating that GFP neither moved from the inflorescence meristem into emerging floral primordia, nor moved from the center of stage 3 flowers to the periphery (Fig. 5D,E). However, a gradient of 2xGFP could be seen extending into deeper cell layers in L3 in stage 3 flowers (Fig. 5E), which is consistent with our earlier observation. Thus, compared with movement from the L1 to internal layers, lateral movement of 2xGFP and NLS:2xGFP within tissue layers is much more limited, or possibly even absent. The much reduced movement of 2xGFP and NLS:2xGFP within L1 and L2, compared with movement between layers, suggests that the plasmodesmata SEL within these two layers is lower than that between layers..

We have previously found that periclinal, as well as anticlinal, sectors of LFY can rescue mutant parts of flowers, indicating that LFY moves in both directions (Sessions et al., 2000). One possibility for the apparently different behavior of LFY and GLFY is that the greater size of GLFY, compared with endogenous LFY, reduces its ability to move laterally within tissue layers..

When we expressed LFY and GLFY under the control of this enhancer in lfy-12 plants, the same fraction of transgenic lines showed rescue in flowers (4 out of 12 lines for LFY and 4 out of 11 lines for GLFY; no significant difference using Fisher's exact test), suggesting that GLFY has similar activity to LFY. However, the rescued flowers differed in phenotype. Both GLFY and LFY rescued the development of the two inner whorls, which contain stamens and carpels, and in which the AG enhancer is active (Fig. 6), but only LFY was able to rescue petal development. All four of the lfy-12; AG intron*::LFY lines that showed phenotypic rescue produced at least some flowers with petals, and many flowers had the normal complement of four petals. By contrast, none of the four lfy-12; AG intron*::GLFY lines produced flowers with petals. As GLFY appears to be as active as LFY in the inner two whorls where it is produced, the difference in their activity in the outer two whorls is consistent with the conclusion that LFY can move more extensively than GLFY..

The difference between LFY and GLFY in their apparent ability to move within layers allowed us to address this question by expressing LFY and GLFY under the control of the LFY promoter and comparing their ability to rescue lfy-12 mutants. Of ten LFY::LFY transgenic lines in the lfy-12 background, three showed complete rescue, and the remaining seven showed nearly complete rescue, with only a few flowers having reduced petal or stamen number. By contrast, only six out of fourteen LFY::GLFY lines in the lfy-12 background showed a similar degree of rescue; the remaining eight lines resembled weak or intermediate lfy mutants and were sterile. This difference between their ability to rescue is statistically significant based on Fisher's exact test. Although only the opposite result  to  full ability of movement-compromised LFY to rescue lfy mutants  to  would have been entirely conclusive, our finding is consistent with the notion that LFY movement may be required for normal flower development. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that GLFY is somewhat less active as a transcription factor than native LFY, although no difference in activity could be observed when tested from the 35S and AtML1 promoters..

Three large, non-overlapping deletions were made in the LFY coding sequence, each removing approximately one third of the protein (Fig. 7A). All three were linked to GFP at the N terminus and expressed under the ML1 promoter. Although they differed in the extent with which they moved from L1 to inner layers, all three deletion variants were still able to move from L1 into the inner layers in both vegetative and inflorescence apices. GFP:LFY1, with an N-terminal deletion, behaved very similar to GFP:LFY. It was mostly located in the nucleus, and formed a gradient of four to five cell layers into the L2 and L3 (Fig. 7B). GFP:LFY2, with a central deletion, was expressed at lower levels and was largely cytoplasmic, presumably because of the deletion of the NLS. GFP signal could be clearly detected for at least three cell layers into the L2 and L3 (Fig. 7C), but its low expression levels may have been limiting our ability to determine its actual range of movement. GFP:LFY3, with a C-terminal deletion, showed the least degree of movement, moving only one to two cell layers from the L1 (Fig. 7D). However, most of the GFP signal was found in large aggregates, sometimes associated with the cell membrane when imaged in the leaf epidermis (data not shown), suggesting that GFP:LFY3 is improperly folded and localizes to a specific subcellular compartment, which may affect its movement.

All four fusions were functional, as they rescued lfy-12 plants to the phenotype corresponding to the lfy allele used for the fusion. When expressed in the L1 layer, all of them could move into the underlying tissue layers. Products of the fusions of the two weak lfy alleles, glfy-2 and glfy-20, showed near wild-type movement (Fig. 8A,D; compare with Fig. 3A), whereas the products of the two intermediate alleles, glfy-3 and glfy-9, moved somewhat less well into the L2 and L3, about two to three cell layers (Fig. 8B,C).

We have performed several tests to determine whether there is evidence for targeted movement of LFY.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	85	Mode of LFY movement Several lines of evidence are compatible with the view that LFY movement is non-targeted. First, GFP-LFY fusions produced in the L1 formed limited gradients extending into deeper layers. Their movement range was between that of 2xGFP and NLS:2xGFP, which move in a non-targeted fashion (Crawford and Zambryski, 1999; Crawford and Zambryski, 2000; Kim et al., 2002). This is in contrast to the nearly uniform distribution in the shoot apex (reflecting an active mechanism of cell-to-cell transport) that is observed when a viral movement protein fusion is expressed in the L1. Second, size affects LFY movement, as native LFY was more effective in rescuing lfy defects in adjacent cells in the same tissue layer than the larger GLFY fusion. The effect of size is one of the prominent characteristics of non-targeted movement (Zambryski and Crawford, 2000). Third, although differing in stability and sub-cellular localization, all three GFP-LFY truncations and fusions of four mutant lfy alleles were able to move from the L1 into interior cell layers. Although one cannot exclude the possibility that LFY has several redundant movement signals, the simpler explanation is that the LFY protein sequence does not contain a specific movement or export signal..

The potential localization of foci of GFP-LFY fusion proteins along the cell wall in the leaf epidermis supports this hypothesis. This also suggests that the size exclusion limit of the secondary plasmodesmata connecting tissue layers in the Arabidopsis apex is greater than 74 kDa (the size of the LFY-GFP fusions), which is consistent with previous estimates for nascent leaves (Zambryski and Crawford, 2000)..

Using in vivo function as a criterion, we found that the GLFY fusion was less efficient than the native LFY in moving from the center of floral primordia to the periphery. This functional difference is most likely a result of their size difference, because both proteins are fully functional in the cells where they are produced. Similar to previous studies that have demonstrated that the inner central zone (L3) does not allow fluorescent tracer uploading from the vascular tissue (Gisel et al., 1999; Gisel et al., 2002), we observed much more limited lateral movement within the L3. Thus, intercellular movement needs to be considered in the context of the specific location and developmental stage within the plant..

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	91	That lateral movement is less easily achieved than apical-basal movement may also explain the fact that LFY does not move out of floral primordia into the inflorescence meristem in wild type (Parcy et al., 1998; Sessions et al., 2000), as lateral movement would be required for efficient protein exchange between the two tissues. The inflorescence meristem may even form a symplasmic domain that is insulated from emerging floral primordia (Rinne and van der Schoot, 1998), thus restricting movement of all macromolecules. Alternatively, there may be selective gating, such that movement of only certain macromolecules from floral primordia into the inflorescence meristem (and vice versa) is permitted. A similar mechanism may also be responsible for maintaining discrete whorl boundaries within the flower. In this context, it is noteworthy that floral homeotic proteins that are expressed in distinct whorls of the developing Arabidopsis flower, such as AP1 and AP3, do not move, whereas LFY, which is expressed throughout the flower, does (Jenik and Irish, 2001; Sessions et al., 2000)..
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	92	Movement and subcellular localization LFY and LFY-GFP fusions can move into the inner tissue layers from the L1. By contrast, AP1:GFP does not move between tissue layers. This cannot be simply due to size, because an N-terminal fusion, GFP:AP1, could move well. Furthermore, GFP:AP1 (55 kDa) is smaller than either NLS:2xGFP (57 kDa) or LFY-GFP fusions (74 kDa). Therefore, if LFY is moving by diffusion, AP1 and AP1:GFP must be actively retained in the cells where they are expressed. One way to achieve the retention may be by subcellular localization, such as nuclear or ER localization. From this study, we have found that there is a good correlation between nuclear localization and movement: 2xGFP, which is highly cytoplasmic, can move a considerable distance from the L1, and the same is true for the predominantly cytoplasmic GFP:AP1 fusion. AP1:GFP, which appeared to be exclusively nuclear, did not move. Between these two extremes, NLS:2xGFP showed little cytoplasmic localization and moved only one cell layer. The GFP-LFY fusions all showed more cytoplasmic localization than NLS:2xGFP, and all moved farther than NLS:2xGFP but less than 2xGFP. Among the three GFP-LFY fusions, LFY:GFP had the most cytoplasmic localization and moved the farthest..

This may contribute to the retention of MADS domain proteins such as AP1, as several of them, including AP1, are known to form heteromultimers in the absence of DNA (Egea-Cortines et al., 1999; Honma and Goto, 2001). In addition, it has been shown that AP3, a MADS-domain transcription factor that does not move between tissue layers, needs to heterodimerize with another MADS-domain protein, PISTILLATA (PI), in order to localize to the nucleus (McGonigle et al., 1996). It is possible that the GFP:AP1 fusion disrupts such interactions, thereby interfering with biological activity and nuclear localization, as well as with retention in the cells where it is produced..

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	98	Mechanisms of movement Our results are compatible with the view that LFY movement is driven by diffusion. However, it remains unclear whether the same conclusion can be drawn regarding the intercellular movement of other transcription factors. Another well-studied example of a trafficking transcription factor is KN1 of maize (Kim et al., 2002; Kragler et al., 2000; Lucas et al., 1995). As with LFY, KN1-GFP fusions are detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and in a punctate pattern associated with the cell wall (Kim et al., 2002). In contrast to LFY, for which various deletions did not prevent movement, a simple mutation in the homeodomain and the potential NLS of KN1 abolished its movement. Furthermore, experiments with tobacco have indicated the presence of a cellular component that is limiting for KN1 movement, and have suggested that the mode of KN1 trafficking may be related to the targeted movement of viral movement proteins (Kragler et al., 2000). However, other results are consistent with KN1 moving in a non-targeted fashion. In bombardment assays, KN1-GFP moved considerably less well than a fusion of GFP to the movement protein of TVCV (Kim et al., 2002). Furthermore, movement of KN1 expressed from the SCR promoter in the shoot apex of transgenic Arabidopsis plants was rather limited (Kim et al., 2002), similar to that of NLS:2xGFP or GFP:LFY expressed from the ML1 promoter (this work). Further studies in a nonheterologous system will be required to clarify the mechanisms behind KN1 movement. A complex relationship between targeted and non-targeted movement is also indicated by a recent study, in which a dominant-negative form of the tobacco NON-CELL-AUTONOMOUS PATHWAY PROTEIN 1 (NtNCAPP1) was overexpressed. In such transgenic plants, trafficking of viral movement protein, but not of KN1, was affected (Lee et al., 2003). Interestingly, tobacco LFY protein appears more uniform in such transgenic plants, which also have phenotypes reminiscent of LFY overexpressing plants. The causal relationship between these observations needs further investigation, but it will be interesting to combine the dominant-negative NtCAPP1 overexpressing plants with the tools presented here..

Like LFY, its Antirrhinum ortholog FLORICAULA (FLO) has non-cell-autonomous effects in mosaic studies (Carpenter and Coen, 1995). In contrast to LFY, the extent to which FLO can rescue mutant flowers varies depending on the layer in which FLO is expressed (Hantke et al., 1995; Sessions et al., 2000). As FLO protein has not been examined in these mosaics, it is unknown whether the differential rescue ability is caused by differences in FLO movement, or is only a result of downstream effects, such as the documented abnormalities in target gene expression in the mosaics (Hantke et al., 1995). Another example of interspecific differences is provided by DEF of Antirrhinum, which was found to move from the L2 to the L1 in a stage- and organ-dependent manner (Perbal et al., 1996). However, the DEF ortholog AP3 of Arabidopsis does not move between layers (Jenik and Irish, 2001), which indicates that subtle differences in sequence, or interspecific differences in the translocation machinery, affect transcription factor movement, the latter being consistent with the interspecific differences that have been reported for GFP movement (Crawford and Zambryski, 2001). These observations highlight that care must be taken when extrapolating from one transcription factor assayed in a single species or single tissue..

We are proposing the testable hypothesis that movement is a default mechanism for many proteins in the Arabidopsis shoot apex, unless they are either efficiently targeted to specific subcellular locations or retained through formation of protein complexes. More case studies are needed to determine whether our results can indeed be generalized to include other proteins, other tissues and other species..

In plants, a novel mechanism for cell-to-cell communication involves the intercellular trafficking of regulatory proteins and mRNAs. The maize KNOTTED1 (KN1) gene acts non cell-autonomously in the maize leaf, and KN1 was the first plant protein shown to traffic cell-to-cell, presumably through plasmodesmata. We have compared the intercellular trafficking of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions of KN1 and Arabidopsis KN1-related homeobox proteins to that of the viral movement protein from turnip vein clearing tobamovirus. We show that there is specific developmental regulation of GFPKN1 trafficking. GFPKN1 was able to traffic from the inner layers of the leaf to the epidermis, but not in the opposite direction, from epidermis to mesophyll. However, GFP or the GFPmovement protein fusion moved readily out of the epidermis. GFPKN1 was however able to traffic out of the epidermal (L1) layer in the shoot apical meristem, indicating that KN1 movement out of the L1 was developmentally regulated. GFPKNAT1/BREVIPEDICELLUS and GFPSHOOTMERISTEMLESS fusions could also traffic from the L1 to the L2/L3 layers of the meristem. In a test for the functional significance of trafficking, we showed that L1-specific expression of KN1 or of KNAT1 was able to partially complement the strong shootmeristemless-11 (stm-11) mutant. However, a cell-autonomous GUS fusion to KN1 showed neither trafficking ability nor complementation of stm-11 when expressed in the L1. These results suggest that the activity of KN1 and related homeobox proteins is maintained following intercellular trafficking, and that trafficking may be required for their normal developmental function..

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION TOP SUMMARY INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In the last few years, the intercellular trafficking of regulatory proteins and mRNAs has emerged as a novel mechanism of cell-to-cell communication in plant development (Ding, 1998; Zambryski and Crawford, 2000; Jackson, 2001; Haywood et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2002). Many studies on trafficking of macromolecules relate to virus infection, as some plant viruses move from cell to cell through plasmodesmata (PD). However, the smallest viruses or viral nucleic acids are estimated to be larger than the channel size of PDs (Ding et al., 1992b), and viruses traffic via an active pathway that requires virus encoded movement proteins (MPs) (Gibbs, 1976; Wang et al., 1998). For example, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) encodes a 30 kDa MP that interacts with PDs to increase their size exclusion limit (SEL), traffics itself and facilitates spread of the virus (Deom et al., 1987; Wolf et al., 1989; Waigmann et al., 1994). The observation of viral MP trafficking prompted speculation that endogenous macromolecules might also traffic through PD (Lucas and Wolf, 1993; Lucas et al., 1993; Maule, 1994)..
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	7	The use of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) greatly facilitated the development of in vivo trafficking assays. Tissue-specific GFP expression studies also revealed dynamic regulation of PD SEL. Estimates for PD SEL in mesophyll or trichome cells of mature leaves have been obtained from microinjection experiments, and range from one to a few kDa (Wolf et al., 1989; Waigmann and Zambryski, 1995). However, in immature sink tissues the observation of GFP diffusion suggests that the PD SEL may be as high as 30-50 kDa in these tissues (Imlau et al., 1999; Oparka et al., 1999). Developmental changes in GFP diffusion are correlated with changes in PD structure during leaf development, from simple linear channels to complex branched forms (Oparka et al., 1999). It is also evident that GFP can diffuse cell-to-cell in some mature tissues, depending on the tissue type and species (Crawford and Zambryski, 2000; Itaya et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2002). Developmental modifications to PDs are also relevant to MP localization and trafficking. For example, TMV or cucumber mosaic virus MP has been shown to be targeted to plasmodesmata and trafficked between cells only when the leaf reached a certain developmental stage (Ding et al., 1992; Moore et al., 1992; Itaya et al., 1998). These observations of GFP diffusion and MP trafficking reveal developmental regulation of PD function, suggesting that signaling through PDs is important in plant development. The idea that MP trafficking is related to that of endogenous proteins is also supported by the fact that trafficking is extremely rapid (Ding, 1998), and that a plant MP-related protein, CmPP16, can traffic itself and mRNA through PDs (Xoconostle-Cazares et al., 1999). However, the extent to which trafficking of endogenous proteins is developmentally regulated is unclear. Endogenous trafficking proteins include phloem proteins (Balachandran et al., 1997) as well as several developmental transcription factors such as LEAFY (LFY), SHORTROOT (SHR) and KNOTTED1 (KN1). The LFY meristem identity protein acts non-autonomously and is able to traffic from the L1 layer to the L2 and L3 meristem cells and to complement a lfy mutant (Sessions et al., 2000). In the root, the SHR protein traffics from the stele into the endodermal cell layer, and trafficking appears to be required for its function in cell fate specification (Nakajima et al., 2001). The influence of tissue-specific or developmental signals in trafficking of these proteins is largely unknown..

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	9	The first endogenous protein shown to traffic cell-to-cell was the maize homeodomain protein, KN1. Mosaic analysis of a dominant Kn1 allele showed that it acts non-autonomously during maize leaf development (Hake and Freeling, 1986). Later, in situ hybridization and immunolocalization experiments showed that KN1 protein is detected outside the domain of mRNA expression, suggesting the possibility of KN1 trafficking (Jackson et al., 1994). Microinjection studies of fluorescently labeled KN1 protein showed directly that KN1 has the ability to traffic between mesophyll cells, to increase PD SEL and to specifically transport its mRNA (Lucas et al., 1995). These studies suggested that the KN1 protein itself could be the cell non-autonomous signal, and in support of this hypothesis we showed that a GFP-tagged KN1 fusion is able to traffic in the leaf and shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis (Kim et al., 2002). Arabidopsis encodes four class I KN1-related homeobox (KNOX) genes (Bharathan et al., 1999; Reiser et al., 2000; Semiarti et al., 2001). The most closely related to KN1 are KNOTTED 1-like homeobox protein 1/BREVIPEDICELLUS (KNAT1/BP) and SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM); KNAT1 is thought to be the Arabidopsis ortholog of KN1 (Bharathan et al., 1999; Reiser et al., 2000), but STM has closer functional similarity to KN1 on the basis of similar null mutant phenotypes and expression patterns (Long et al., 1996; Vollbrecht et al., 2000). STM and KN1 function in SAM initiation and/or maintenance, and KNAT1/BP is involved in the regulation of inflorescence architecture (Byrne et al., 2002; Douglas et al., 2002; Venglat et al., 2002). The possible involvement of trafficking in the function of the Arabidopsis KNOX proteins has not been investigated..

We also show that GFPKN1 trafficking is under tissue-specific regulation and can be influenced by developmental stage. In support of a biological function of KNOX protein trafficking, KN1 and the related Arabidopsis proteins STM and KNAT1 could traffic out of the L1 layer of the shoot apical meristem, and movement was correlated with the complementation of stm-11 mutant phenotypes.

We used a 10-alanine linker (represented as `') between GFP and KN1 to improve stability and folding (Doyle and Botstein, 1996; Kim et al., 2002). The MP coding region (GenBank accession no. U03357) of turnip vein clearing tobamovirus (TVCV) that is capable of viral movement/infection in Arabidopsis (Lartey et al., 1997) was amplified using proofreading PCR to insert restriction enzyme sites, allowing the replacement of KN1 to produce pUAS-GFPMP. The RbcS2b, LTP1 and AtML1 gene promoters were amplified by PCR from Ler genomic DNA and inserted upstream of the GAL4 gene in vector pCambia2300. The primers used were: pRbcS2b (5' primer: GCTGCTAGCTTTACCCTAACTACTCCTTT/3' primer: GTCGTCGACCCCGGGTTGTTGTTTCTCTTCTTCTTTT), pLTP1 (5' primer: GGGAAGCTTGACCAAAATGATTAACTTGCATTAC/3' primer: GGGGGATCCATTGATCTCTTAGGTAGTGTTTTATGT) and pAtML1 (5' primer: GAGGAATTCTTAATTAACATTGATTCTGAACTGTACCC/3' primer: CATGGATCCGGCGCGCCAACCGGTGGATTCAGGGAG).

Two stm primers (5' primer: GGGCTTGATCAATTCATGGAAGCTTACTGTGAAATGCTCGTGCAGTATGAG, 3' primer: CCCTAGTAACAACCATCAAAG) were used to produce a 350 bp fragment from genomic DNA. PCR was performed as follows: 95 degrees C 3 minutes, then 35 cycles (94 degrees C 45 seconds, 60 degrees C 45 seconds, 72 degrees C 1 minute) followed by 72 degrees C for 6 minutes. The MwoI restriction enzyme cuts 50 bp from the 5' end of the amplified wild-type fragment, but does not cut the stm-11 fragment. The enzyme digestion was visualized after running on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide..

For green tissue (primarily mesophyll and guard cells) we used the rubisco small subunit gene (RbcS2b) promoter (Kim et al., 2002). In practical terms for trafficking assays, pRbcS2b serves as a mesophyll-specific promoter, because the guard cells are symplastically isolated from other epidermal cells from an early stage of development (Wille and Lucas, 1984; Ding et al., 1997). For epidermis-specific expression we used the LIPID TRANSFER PROTEIN 1 (LTP1) and MERISTEM LAYER 1 (AtML1) promoters (Thoma et al., 1994; Sessions et al., 1999). These promoters were used in the two component GAL4 system to drive the expression of four reporters, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized cell-autonomous GFP (mGFP5-ER), `free' cytoplasmic GFP, and fusions of GFP to the TVCV MP or to KN1 (Haseloff et al., 1997; Kim et al., 2002). The GAL4-driver and UAS-reporter constructs were sequentially transformed into Arabidopsis (Kim et al., 2002)..

(The term `driver' means a promoter in the GAL4/UAS two-component system.) We observed movement of GFPKN1 (Fig. 2D-F), GFPTVCV MP (Fig. 2G-I) and free GFP (Fig. 2J-L) to the epidermis. In each case, the level of fluorescence in the epidermal cells was approximately equal to that in the mesophyll. We assessed the sub-cellular localization of these fusion proteins at a higher magnification in paradermal confocal sections. Both GFPKN1 and GFPTVCV MP localized to the nuclei, the cytoplasm and to punctate spots between cells (Fig. 2F,I). Similar spots were not seen in plants expressing mGFP5-ER or free GFP (Fig. 2C,L). The GFPKN1 fusion protein was also detected in epidermal cell nuclei using the anti-KN1 antibody (Fig. 2N,O, lower panel) (Smith et al., 1992), suggesting that the epidermal GFP fluorescence in these lines represented the intact GFPKN1 fusion protein and not a free GFP degradation product. This observation of GFPKN1 trafficking was consistent with results using an enhancer trap line to express this fusion in perivascular cells (Kim et al., 2002), and here we showed that both free GFP and GFPTVCV MP were also able to move from mesophyll to epidermal cells..

Since we saw a high level of GFP fluorescence from the GFPTVCV MP fusion in mesophyll and vascular tissues of the shoot, we investigated how far GFPTVCV MP could traffic in the plant, by imaging roots of pAtML1-GFPTVCV MP plants. AtML1 mRNA is not detectable in the root (Lu et al., 1996), and mGFP5-ER expression was not detected in the mature region of pAtML1-mGFP5-ER roots (Fig. 3L, upper panel). However in seedlings carrying the UAS-GFPTVCV MP construct, green fluorescence was detected in vascular and cortical tissue throughout the length of the root (Fig. 3L, lower panel), indicating that MP trafficking occurred over a long distance from the shoot epidermis into the root, presumably through the phloem. Since MP binds to MP RNA and facilitates its cell-to-cell trafficking (Nguyen et al., 1996), it is possible that RNA trafficking is responsible for some of the non autonomous effects..

However, that study did not determine specifically whether GFPKN1 could traffic out of the L1.

A GUSGFP fusion was similarly restricted to the L1 (Fig. 4B). In contrast to the situation in the leaf, we found that GFPKN1 could traffic from the L1 into the L2 and L3 layers (Fig. 4C). We also tested if this cell-to-cell trafficking property of KN1 was conserved in its Arabidopsis homologs. GFPKNAT1 and GFPSTM expressed using pAtML1 did traffic in the SAM and showed strong L1 and weaker L2 fluorescence (Fig. 4D,E and inset). L3 GFP fluorescence from GFPKNAT1 and GFPSTM was not evident from the confocal images, but GFPKNAT1 was detected using a two-photon microscope (Fig. 4F). Quantification of the two-photon signal indicated that the photon number in the outer cell layer of the L3 was at least two-fold higher than background levels (Fig. 4G). The nuclear accumulation of the GFP-tagged protein was less evident in the two-photon image than in the confocal image because the two-photon microscope collects light from a narrower Z-section (1  microm). However, nuclear signal was evident in some cells in the two-photon image (arrowed in Fig. 4F). We also expressed GFPMP and GFP in the L1 layer, and these proteins could also traffic out of the L1.

However, the STM promoter used in this study drove strong GUS expression only in the peripheral region (Fig. 5A; A. Fernandez and M. K. Barton, personal communication)..

(A) GUS expression from the STM promoter (pSTM) was detected mainly in the peripheral region of the SAM. (B) pSTM driven GFPKN1 expression shows a similar pattern to that of GUS, but with GFP fluorescence also in the central region (arrowhead). (C) The pSTM-GFPKN1 transgene complemented stm-11, producing stm homozygous plants with shoots showing relatively normal phyllotaxy and flower morphology (inset) (an stm-11 seedling with fused cotyledons and no true leaves is shown in M, upper left). (D) L1-specific expression of KN1 (left) and GFPKN1 (right) under the control of pAtML1 partially rescued stm-11. (E) pAtML1-GFPSTM (or STM) expression resulted in a severe phenotype in most plants, although some of the partially rescued stm-11 homozygous plants had a bushy phenotype (F). (G) L1-specific GFPKNAT1 expression could also partially rescue stm-11. (H-K) The GUSKN1 fusion protein was cell-autonomous in the leaf (H-J) and in the SAM (K). Perivascular-specific GUS staining of the leaf of a J2111/UAS-GUSKN1 plant seen from the top down (H) and in cross section view (I). (J,K) In pAtML1-GUS-KN1 plants, GUS activity was epidermis specific in the leaf (J) and in the shoot apex (K). The inset in K shows epidermal GUSKN1 expression in a whole-mount stm-11 seedling. (L,M) In 35S-GUSKN1 plants, GUS activity was detected in all SAM layers (L), and 35S-GUSKN1 could partially rescue stm-11; two rescued stm-11 seedlings (right), stm-11 seedling (top left) and wild-type seedling (bottom left) are shown in M. However, over-expression of GUSKN1 in the leaf does not lead to over-expression phenotypes. (N,O) A J2111/UAS-GFPKN1 plant shows KN1 over-expression phenotypes (N), while J2111/UAS-GUSKN1 plants had wild-type morphology (O). (P) Similarly, 35S-GUSKN1 overexpressing plants (stm-11/STM genotype) did not show any KN1 over-expression phenotypes, despite showing high GUS activity (inset).

Barton, personal communication). We observed shoot rescue in stm-11 homozygotes carrying the pSTM-GFPKN1 transgene, and a representative plant is shown in Fig. 5C. Similar rescue phenotypes were observed in 50% of the independent transgenic lines (4 lines total). The complemented plants showed relatively normal phyllotaxy, leaf and flower morphology (Fig. 5C, inset), but were shorter, had additional axillary shoots and were sterile. In contrast, transgenic lines carrying pSTM-KN1 showed full complementation of stm-11 (not shown), including normal stature, flower morphology and fertile seeds. Therefore KN1 could fully complement stm when expressed from the STM promoter, and the fusion of GFP to KN1 slightly impaired its function..

In the T1 generation 21/32 (66%) of the stm-11 homozygotes showed partial complementation of the stm-11 phenotype (Fig. 5D). All complemented plants showed abnormal phyllotaxy and lacked flowers or had abnormal, sterile flowers (Fig. 5D, right) that were similar to those of the weak stm-2 mutant (Clark et al., 1996; Endrizzi et al., 1996). Therefore, the L1 expression of GFPKN1 gave partial complementation of stm-11 that was less complete than the complementation we observed using with pSTM-GFPKN1. To identify whether the partial complementation by L1 expression of GFPKN1 was because of the GFP fusion to KN1, we also transformed stm-11 heterozygotes with a pAtML1-KN1 construct. The T1 stm-11 seedlings ( > 20 independent lines) carrying the pAtML1-KN1 construct showed similar phenotypes to those with pAtML1-GFPKN1, i.e. they also showed only partial complementation (Fig. 5D, left). We also analyzed the T2 generation from the stm-11 heterozygous T1 plants carrying pAtML1-KN1.

Plants expressing STM or GFPSTM from pAtML1 showed a very severe phenotype of stunted growth, small lobed leaves, no cauline leaves and flowers defective in sepal, petal and stamen development (Fig. 5E). This phenotypes was presumably partly due to ectopic expression of STM in the leaves and floral organs. A few plants showed milder, bushy phenotypes (Fig. 5F). These bushy plants were homozygous stm-11 (not shown), suggesting therefore partial complementation by the L1-specific expression of STM. L1 expression of KNAT1 also resulted in partial complementation, as about 30% (7 /24) of T1 plants expressing GFPKNAT1 in the L1 showed partial rescue of stm-11.

We observed no rescue of the stm-11 phenotype in 16 independent T1 stm-11 seedlings and in more than 200 stm-11 seedlings from 4 independent T2 lines that expressed GUSKN1 strongly in the L1 (Fig. 5K, inset). This failure to complement could be because GUSKN1 was unable to traffic into L2 and L3 layers, or because the GUS fusion blocked KN1 function independently of its inhibition of KN1 trafficking. To distinguish these possibilities, we asked if expression of GUSKN1 in all cell layers of the SAM was sufficient to rescue stm-11. To this end, a 35S-GUSKN1 construct was transformed into stm-11 heterozygotes. As expected, the transgenic plants showed constitutive GUS activity in all SAM layers (Fig. 5L). We confirmed GUSKN1 over-expression by western blotting using the anti-KN1 antibody (Smith et al., 1992) (data not shown). We observed shoot rescue in five out of 15 independent T2 lines (33%) that segregated for stm-11, indicating that the GUSKN1 fusion was indeed functional in this shoot rescue assay (Fig. 5M). The rescue phenotypes were generally weaker than those of the GFPKN1 lines, though some of the 35S-GUSKN1-rescued seedlings developed inflorescence shoots, similar to the stm-11 plants rescued by L1-specific expression of KNOX proteins (not shown).

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	74	Developmental and tissue-specific control of KN1 trafficking In plants with simple leaves, KNOX genes are usually expressed only in the SAM, though developmental consequences of ectopic leaf expression and the expression of KNOX genes in compound leaves indicate that they can function during leaf development (Bharathan et al., 2002). We found that GFPKN1 trafficking was regulated tissue-specifically in the leaf. Whereas it could traffic from mesophyll to epidermis, trafficking did not occur from epidermis to mesophyll, in either leaf primordia or in fully expanded leaves. Consistent with these observations, distinctive phenotypes arose from layer-specific expression of KN1. As expected, the mesophyll-specific expression of GFPKN1 resulted in strong KNOX over-expression phenotypes, similar to constitutive (35S promoter driven) expression (Lincoln et al., 1994; Chuck et al., 1996). However, epidermal-specific expression of GFPKN1 produced a relatively mild, rumpled phenotype. This mild phenotype is probably due to the restriction of KN1 in the epidermis, though the fact that epidermal expression is able to alter leaf shape does indicate a non autonomous effect of KN1 that is presumably not due to trafficking. Similar unidirectional signaling was observed in periclinal chimeras of the floral organ identity genes GLOBOSA (GLO) and DEFICIENS (DEF) in Antirrhinum. Some effects of DEF and GLO expression were non cell-autonomous, however these effects were only partially explained by movement, as DEF also moves from L2 to L1 but not in the opposite direction (Perbal et al., 1996). In this study we showed that the lack of protein movement out of the epidermis was not, however, a general phenomenon. Both GFP and GFPTVCV MP moved freely from epidermis to mesophyll, demonstrating that the PDs between epidermal and mesophyll cells are open to both diffusion-mediated and selective protein movement..
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	75	Uni-directional trafficking of KN1 in the leaf suggests that KN1 normally traffics from inner to outer layers, and may reveal a directional signaling pathway. Although class I KNOX genes are not normally expressed in the simple leaves of maize, rice and Arabidopsis, they are expressed in compound leaves (Bharathan et al., 2002). For example, LeT6 is expressed in tomato leaf primordia as well as in the SAM (Chen et al., 1997; Kim et al., 2001). Chen et al. showed that LeT6 mRNA expression was strong in the L2/L3 layers and reduced or absent from the L1 layer of the SAM, and we note that this expression pattern continues in the young leaf primordia (Chen et al., 1997). It would be interesting therefore to test whether KNOX proteins traffic directionally in the tomato compound leaf; such a process could provide a mechanism for regulation of leaf morphology by signaling from inner to outer layers during development. Classic studies involving inter-specific periclinal leaf chimeras indeed indicate the potential for direction signaling during leaf morphogenesis (reviewed by Tilney-Bassett, 1986)..

Our results imply, however, that the mechanism of KN1 trafficking differs from that of the viral MP. This could be because tissue-specific receptors that recognize distinct trafficking motifs in the different proteins. This idea is supported by the recent report that non-cell-autonomous pathway protein (NCAPP1), a putative PD receptor, interacts with CmPP16 and TMV MP but not with KN1 (Lee et al., 2003). Alternatively, tissue-specific post-translational modification(s) of KN1 might affect its ability to traffic. For example, phosphorylation regulates the trafficking of TMV MP (Citovsky et al., 1993; Waigmann et al., 2000), and perhaps a similar mechanism controls KN1 trafficking..

Two Arabidopsis homologs of KN1, KNAT1 and STM, could also traffic in the SAM, suggesting that hypothetical signal(s) for trafficking in KN1 are conserved in other KNOX proteins. These signal(s) could be made up of a simple, short sequence and/or complex structural motif(s). So far, studies using viral MPs and rice phloem proteins suggest that recognition by the PD trafficking machinery involves structural motifs (Haywood et al., 2002; Ishiwatari et al., 1998), though a short sequence motif appears to control the trafficking of the heat shock cognate 70 chaperone (Aoki et al., 2002). In the case of KN1, a short peptide, homologous to a region near the N terminus of the protein, can interfere with its trafficking, though it is not known whether this sequence motif is sufficient for trafficking (Kragler et al., 1998)..

In contrast, GFPKN1 can traffic over at least 3-5 cell layers in the leaf (Kim et al., 2002). GFPTVCV MP or free GFP moved further than GFPKNOX in the SAM, through more than six cell layers. This suggests that KNOX protein trafficking in the meristem is relatively restricted, and may be used for short range signaling. The more pronounced nuclear localization of GFPKN1 in the meristem than in the leaf may be the cause of its shorter range of trafficking, as nuclear localization probably restricts its chance to interact with PD. A similar mechanism was proposed for the restriction of SHR trafficking (Nakajima et al., 2001) and of GFP diffusion (Crawford and Zambryski, 2000). In the maize shoot apex, a KN1 protein gradient is also evident between the SAM and leaf primordia (Jackson, 2002). Although the biological significance of these KNOX protein gradients is not yet clear, it is possible that they are used to activate target genes at different positions along the gradient (Jackson, 2002)..

The conservation of trafficking ability in KNOX proteins of different species suggests that their function requires trafficking, and the nuclear localization of GFPKNOX proteins following trafficking in the SAM suggests that they can function in transcription in target cells. Cell-to-cell trafficking of KNAT1 could explain the non cell-autonomous regulation of epidermal cell fate by KNAT1, reported by Venglat et al. (Venglat et al., 2002)..

Whereas this failure to rescue could be because GUSKN1 was inactive, this was not the case since it could partially rescue stm-11 when expressed in all meristem cell layers using the 35S promoter. However, the rescue of stm-11 by 35S-GUSKN1 was only partial, and we speculate that full KN1 function in the SAM might require its intercellular trafficking. A functional requirement for KN1 trafficking in the wild-type situation remains to be tested by determining if expression of the non-trafficking version of KN1 under a faithful STM promoter can complement the stm mutant..

In contrast to the AtML1 promoter, use of the STM promoter resulted in GFPKN1 expression at a relatively homogeneous level in the different SAM layers. These expression differences are probably the reason why the two constructs resulted in different complementation phenotypes; pAtML1-GFPKN1 (or KN1) expression always resulted in partial complementation of stm and abnormal phyllotaxy, while complementation using pSTM-GFPKN1 (or KN1) was more complete and produced seedlings with normal phyllotaxy. In this regard, intercellular protein trafficking might provide a way to regulate the distribution and concentration of key developmental regulators across a cellular domain like the SAM. Intercellular KN1/STM trafficking may be a redundant `fail-safe' mechanism to ensure all cells adopt the SAM fate, analogous to the mechanism originally proposed by Mezitt and Lucas (Mezitt and Lucas, 1996) for non-autonomous action of FLORICAULA, and supported by the demonstration of LFY trafficking (Sessions et al., 2000)..

We therefore hypothesize that KN1 trafficking might be required to generate the over-expression phenotypes, or that movement per-se is important for function, rather than simply which cells contain KN1. One possible mechanism would be if KN1 was modified and gained a novel function during intercellular movement. Partial unfolding of KN1 is required for passage through PDs (Kragler et al., 1998), and could expose KN1 to post-translational modification(s). Alternatively, the lack of a KNOX overexpression phenotype in the 35S-GUSKN1 plants could be because the fusion of GUS inhibits the ability KN1 to interact with partner proteins, such as Arabidopsis homologs of KN1 interacting protein (KIP), a BEL1-like TALE homeodomain protein (Smith et al., 2002). Such interacting proteins may be differentially expressed or differentially required for the over-expression and SAM functions of KN1. Lastly, the nuclear localization of STM is required for its activity (Gallois et al., 2002), and if the fusion of GUS interfered with KN1 nuclear localization specifically in the leaf this could also affect its ability to generate over-expression phenotypes..

To study this process in RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcribed genes we have analysed the effect of transcription on tandem HIV-1 promoters integrated into the genome of HeLa cells. We show that transcriptional activation at the upstream promoter reduces transcription from the downstream promoter, as compared with basal transcription conditions (in the absence of an activator). Furthermore, insertion of a strong transcriptional termination element between the two promoters alleviates this transcriptional interference, resulting in elevated levels of transcription from the downstream promoter. Actual protein interactions with the downstream (occluded) promoter were analysed by in vivo footprinting. Binding of Sp1 transcription factors to the occluded promoter was reduced, when compared with the footprint pattern of the promoter protected by the terminator. This suggests that promoter occlusion is due to disruption of certain transcription factors and that it can be blocked by an intervening transcriptional terminator. Chromatin mapping with DNase I indicates that a factor binds to the termination element under both basal and induced conditions..

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	6	Termination of transcription may be defined as arrest of the elongating polymerase followed by release of the transcription complex and nascent RNA from the DNA template. It is known that in eukaryotes functional poly(A) signals are required for efficient transcriptional termination by RNA polymerase II (pol II), since mutations which disrupt polyadenylation also result in the loss of termination (1-3). Furthermore, the strength of the poly(A) signal correlates with termination efficiency, since a stronger processing signal is more effective in directing termination (4). Actual termination sites remain ill defined and in most cases studied so far transcription continues well beyond the poly(A) site (5) until a downstream element is encountered which forces the elongating polymerase to pause or arrest (6,7). Pause sites can take various forms, such as DNA-bound protein complexes or intrinsic DNA sequence elements, either of which are capable of causing poly(A) site-dependent termination of transcription (6,8-11)..

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	8	It has been reported that inefficient transcriptional termination can cause interference with DNA replication and with transcription of an adjacent, downstream gene, leading to impairment of these central cellular processes (12-16). This emphasizes the need for an efficient termination process in some cases. Transcriptional interference (promoter occlusion) has been observed in various eukaryotic systems, including genes transcribed by pol I and II, in prokaryotic operons and in certain viruses (12). In vitro experiments in the pol I system have suggested a mechanism for promoter occlusion where transcription through the promoter may cause displacement of a bound transcription factor. Interference is prevented by terminator elements which reside upstream of each pol I promoter (17,18). In contrast to the less complex pol I promoter, transcription by pol II depends on multiple protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in the promoter and enhancer regions, which form stable initiation complexes (19)..

We investigated the importance of an intervening transcriptional terminator in this context and furthermore have also investigated DNA-protein interactions on the downstream promoter. Analysis of cytoplasmic RNA revealed that upon transactivation with the viral Tat protein transcription from the downstream promoter is reduced (as compared with already high basal transcriptional conditions). A transcriptional terminator placed between the two LTR promoters allowed increased transcription from both promoters upon transactivation by Tat. Actual DNA-protein interactions on the downstream promoter were analysed by DMS in vivo footprinting. While we consistently observed footprints when the promoter was preceded by the terminator, these were reduced when the protective intervening terminator was absent, suggesting reduced binding of transcription factors to the occluded promoter. The footprint pattern changed mainly across the binding sites for transcription factor Sp1. Furthermore, DNase I footprinting in vivo indicated binding of a protein to the 5[prime]-end of the pause site, corresponding to the position where the termination factor MAZ has been shown to bind in vitro (11). This binding activity is stable under induced conditions. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a pol II termination element located between strong pol II promoters plays a critical role in preventing transcriptional interference in a chromosomal context. We suggest that transcriptional interference may result in destabilization of specific transcription factors on the occluded promoter..

CII contains a termination element placed between the LTR promoters [the SpA poly(A) site followed by the C2 pause site], allowing termination of L1 transcripts upstream of the L2 promoter. L1 transcripts derived from the CI construct have to read through the L2 promoter to use the HIV poly(A) site (HpA).

To study promoter interference in a chromosomal context we stably integrated these tandem promoter constructs into HeLa cells. Two constructs (CI and CII; Fig. 1) were transfected, one containing an intervening termination signal [SPAC, consisting of the strong poly(A) site SPA and the downstream C2 pause element] between the two LTRs (CII; 25) and the other without this intervening termination signal (CI). Individual cell clones containing the CI and CII transgenes respectively were expanded and maintained in selective (G418-containing) medium. Since the HIV-1 promoter is inducible by the viral transactivator Tat, we were able to detect transcriptional interference by enhancing transcription with Tat. This was achieved by stably transfecting these clonally derived CI and CII cells lines with a Tat-expressing vector, allowing a direct comparison of basal and Tat trans-activated transcription of one particular clone. Tat expression was monitored at the RNA level by S1 nuclease mapping of the Tat transcript (data not shown). In the experiments described below we analysed individual clones derived from these stable transfections which were checked for their integrity and copy number by Southern blotting (data not shown). Clones containing single copy integrants were employed. Furthermore, to obtain position-independent values we also analysed complex cell pools consisiting of >100 positive clones..

Even so, the presence of Tat further activated the LTR promoters and allowed detection of transcriptional interference effects between the adjacent LTR promoters..

Cytoplasmic RNA, extracted from various individual clones and pools, was analysed using a mixture of two riboprobes: probe L, an LTR-specific riboprobe which recognizes both LTR transcripts simultaneously and distinguishes between L1 read-through and L2 initiating transcripts (derived as a PvuII-SmaI fragment from L2); probe S hybridizes to transcripts initiated at the SV40 promoter (which drives transcription of the neo gene contained within the transfected plasmid). Probe S was included as an internal control in each assay which allowed direct comparison of a single clone under basal and trans-activated conditions, when normalized to the internal standard..

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	33	As shown in Figure 2, RNase protection analysis of transcripts derived from three CI clones yields two major products of 134 and 230 nt, corresponding to transcripts initiating on the L1 and L2 promoters respectively. Figure 2 also shows quantitative analysis of this data as well as comparable data for a CI pool. These results demonstrate a relatively small change in L1 and L2 promoter activity following trans-activation by Tat, presumably due to their already high basal levels. Using the SV40 RNA as an internal standard (which is not responsive to Tat), a direct assessment of the change in LTR promoter activity under induced conditions was determined. Under basal conditions (-Tat) the L2/L1 ratio was calculated as ~3 (varying from 2.4 to 3.5 between the three clonal and pool RNAs, taking the number of labeled residues into account). However, in the presence of Tat, while the activity of L1 increased, L2 activity actually decreased (relative to basal transcription conditions), indicating that the trans-activated upstream promoter may be reducing transcription from the downstream promoter. The LTR fragment comprising L2 contains an additional 20 bp from the LTR at its 3[prime]-end, which might explain the consistently higher L2 promoter activity. As mentioned above, using these chromosomally integrated constructs transcription from the HIV-1 promoters is rather high, even in the absence of Tat. In contrast, transcription from the same constructs (lacking the SV40 driven neo gene) could hardly be detected without Tat in transient expression assays (20). The most likely explanation for this difference is the presence of the SV40 regulatory region containing the enhancer (380 bp from SfiI to PvuII), which has been shown to influence expression from the HIV-1 and human globin gene promoters (28). The proximity of this potent enhancer could affect basal transcription rates, thereby leading to the relatively muted Tat enhancement (27,28). However, since these tandem promoters are differently affected by Tat, we infer that the activated L1 promoter (+Tat) reduces transcription from the downstream L2 promoter..

In particular, the L1 transcript is polyadenylated at the downstream L2 HIV poly(A) site (HpA; Fig. 1), giving rise to a 116 nt 3[prime] doublet. A small fraction of transcripts read through this poly(A) site, generating bands of ~150 and 248 nt. The 248 nt species arises from read-through of Hp(A) in L2 to the 5[prime] splice site of the [alpha]-globin reporter gene. The origin of the 150 nt species may derive from a cryptic splice site. Both of these L1 species, as well as the major 134 nt fragment, increase upon trans-activation. The constant band of ~200 nt does not change upon trans-activation and derives from incompletely digested riboprobe. Overall the 3[prime]-end products of transcription initiated at the L1 promoter are clearly present at much lower levels than the 134 nt 5[prime] product using probe L. Presumably a significant fraction of L1 transcripts is spliced out in the L2 region. Identification of these various minor L1-derived bands was confirmed by S1 nuclease mapping (data not shown)..

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	38	To examine the role of a strong transcriptional termination element placed between two pol II promoters in a chromosomal context, cytoplasmic RNA extracted from clones and pools stably transfected with the CII construct was analysed by RNase protection (Fig. 3). CII contains a strong synthetic poly(A) site (SPA) followed by the C2 transcriptional pause site (11,25,29) between the two LTR promoters. As mentioned above, transcriptional termination signals have previously been shown to relieve interference in transient transfection assays (30). Since promoters may be regulated differently when part of higher order chromatin we wished to examine the role of this termination element between the LTR promoters in stable integrants. As shown in Figure 3, no read-in transcripts were detected from the L1 promoter, suggesting 100% SPA use. Secondly, whereas trans-activaton led to a relative decrease of L2 in CI clones, we consistently observed an increase for both promoters, L1 and L2, in CII when transcription was enhanced by Tat. These results suggest that transcription from the downstream promoter, upon trans-activation, can only increase when preceded by the termination element..

Binding sites for transcription factor Sp1 are clearly visible as compared with the control (co, lane 7). As expected, these sites are engaged in protein interactions on an active HIV-1 promoter (32). In detail, the CII profiles compared with the control DNA (lane 7) indicate a partial protection of G residues in Sp1 sites 1 and 2, in particular at positions -54 and -55 with respect to the transcriptional start site, a hypersensitive site between the proximal Sp1 sites 1 and 2, at position -60, strong protections in Sp1 site 3 and a hypersensitive site at -79. The distal Sp1 site 3 is known to have the highest affinity for Sp1 in vitro (33). Whereas these footprints are clearly apparent in CII clones (and pools), they are significantly reduced in CI clones (and pools) lacking the intervening terminator. The clearest differences are seen over the distal, high affinity Sp1 site 3, where all G residues are less protected in CI integrants. Also, the G residues at -54 and -55 are markedly less protected in the CI clones (G residues in SP1 site 1 are also slightly less protected). A reduction in hypersensity over the NF-[kappa]B sites was also noted (mainly in CI clones), although with less consistency. Overall these results indicate that protein interactions on the downstream promoter, especially over the Sp1 sites, in CI clones are reduced when compared with those on the corresponding promoter preceded by the terminator. We also observed minor differences in the protein interactions in CI clones when trans-activated by Tat as compared with basal conditions.

The data also indicated that the pattern did not change upon Tat induction (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting stable binding of the protein to this site under basal and induced conditions.

To examine the importance of terminators between transcription units in the genome we used HIV-1 LTR driven reporter constructs stably integrated into HeLa cells. Since the HIV promoter is trans-activated by Tat we could directly compare individual clones under basal and trans-activated conditions and the effect of a trans-activated promoter on the downstream transcription unit. As mentioned above, the high basic transcription rates of the transgenes were ascribed to the proximity of the SV40 regulatory region with its strong enhancer. Therefore, the relative increase in transcription in the presence of Tat in this system was not drastic (27). Nevertheless, upon trans-activation, while transcription from the upstream promoter L1 increased up to 5-fold, transcription from the downstream L2 promoter increased only when preceded by the terminator. Mapping the 3[prime]-end of the upstream L1 transcript revealed its extension into the L2 promoter in CI (-terminator) cell lines, whereas in CII lines it was processed at the intervening terminator. The same terminator consisting of the strong synthetic poly(A) site SPA linked to the C2 pause site (SPAC) has been shown to prevent promoter interference between the MLV LTR promoter and the keratin 10 gene in a recent study (22). Stable cell lines transfected with an MLV expression vector containing the whole keratin 10 gene downstream of the MLV promoter followed by a hygromycin B resistance gene were selected and tested for keratin expression by western blotting.

Comparison of occluded versus protected L2 promoter by DMS in vivo footprinting revealed reduced footprints at the occluded promoter. Differences in the protein binding pattern in CI and CII were mainly evident across the three Sp1 binding sites and to a lesser degree at the tandem NF-[kappa]B binding sites.

Since Sp1 activates transcription synergistically (34) and partly by interacting with TAF 110, a component of the basal transcription factor TFIID (37), loss of Sp1 would be expected to result in a reduction in transcriptional activity. Interestingly, Sp1 sites were shown to have no effect on transcriptional termination (10), whereas a bound CAAT box binding protein was effective in termination.

Insertion of the C2 pause site between two poly(A) sites greatly increased use of the weak upstream site, probably by pausing the polymerase. Binding of this factor to the pause site might be necessary to halt the polymerase (Fig. 6). The role of MAZ in the termination process is currently being investigated in vitro..

The absence of a terminator can lead to reduction or impairment of adjacent gene expression, probably resulting from a disruption of DNA-bound regulatory proteins by a processive polymerase complex. We are currently testing our model for transcriptional interference (Fig. 6) in yeast, where transcription units are densely packed and therefore efficient transcriptional termination of more significance..

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In the spherical virion of the parvovirus minute virus of mice, several amino acid side chains of the capsid were previously found to be involved in interactions with the viral single-stranded DNA molecule. We have individually truncated by mutation to alanine many (ten) of these side chains and analyzed the effects on capsid assembly, stability and conformation, viral DNA encapsidation, and virion infectivity. Mutation of residues Tyr-270, Asp-273, or Asp-474 led to a drastic reduction in infectivity. Mutant Y270A was defective in capsid assembly; mutant D273A formed stable capsids, but it was essentially unable to encapsidate the viral DNA or to externalize the N terminus of the capsid protein VP2, a connected conformational event. Mutation of residues Asp-58, Trp-60, Asn-183, Thr-267, or Lys-471 led to a moderate reduction in infectivity. None of these mutations had an effect on capsid assembly or stability, or on the DNA encapsidation process. However, those five mutant virions were substantially less stable than the parental virion in thermal inactivation assays. The results with this model spherical virus indicate that several capsid residues that are found to be involved in polar interactions or multiple hydrophobic contacts with the viral DNA molecule contribute to preserving the active conformation of the infectious viral particle. Their effect appears to be mediated by the non-covalent interactions they establish with the viral DNA. In addition, at least one acidic residue at each DNA-binding region is needed for DNA packaging..

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	7	The structure of a helical virus, tobacco mosaic virus, has revealed defined interactions between repeating sets of three nucleotides in its ssRNA genome and each capsid subunit (reviewed in Ref. 1). In the crystal structures of spherical viruses (reviewed in Refs. 2 to 6) a large part, or all, of the nucleic acid component is invisible, because it is randomly oriented within the viral particles that form the crystal. Fortunately, in a few icosahedral viruses some segments of the nucleic acid molecule (10 to 60% of the total) are arranged with the same symmetry as the capsid, and could be visualized. The structural analysis (reviewed in Refs. 4, 7 to 10) has revealed that the visible capsid-nucleic acid interfaces generally include a limited number of amino acids and some 7 to 30 nucleotides that in several, but not in all cases, form intramolecular double-helical segments. The tertiary structure acquired by the nucleic acid within the virion may be at least partly independent of the nucleotide sequence (11). Consistent with this observation, a capsid-binding nucleotide motif is not repeated exactly along the sequence, and thus the modeled nucleic acid stretch represents an average of the true individual sequences bound. Accordingly, many of the interactions detected in viral nucleic acid-capsid interfaces are van der Waals and polar interactions with the nonspecific phosphate and pentose moieties, but more specific interactions with the bases are also observed. Ionic interactions between some phosphates and basic side chains protruding from the internal surface of the capsid, or located in disordered N-terminal (Nt) arms of capsid proteins, occur in several ssRNA plant viruses (12 to 17) and nodaviruses (18 to 20), and in the ssDNA bacteriophage X174 (21 to 23). Such interactions were not observed in the ssRNA bean pod mottle virus (24) or in ssDNA parvoviruses (25 to 30), but many nucleic acid-capsid van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds were detected in the latter (25 to 30). A high resolution structural model of the ssRNA satellite tobacco mosaic virus showed that binding of the RNA occurs mainly through an intricate network of direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds (15). Specific and nonspecific capsid protein-oligonucleotide interactions were also analyzed in detail in artificial complexes formed by a recombinant capsid of the bacteriophage MS2 and identical copies of a unique viral ssRNA fragment (OR) involved in translational repression and initiation of capsid assembly (31, 32). This allowed a structural interpretation of mutational analyses on the formation of a biologically relevant complex between OR and an MS2 capsid protein dimer (32 to 37)..
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	8	Several studies have provided evidence for a functional role of the viral nucleic acid and its interactions with viral proteins in the assembly, conformation, stability, and/or disassembly of spherical virions (for some examples see Refs. 4, 5, 9, 38 to 47). However, and partly due to the limited structural information available, mutational analyses to dissect the individual role(s) of specific capsid side chains that interact with the nucleic acid molecule are scarce (e.g. Refs. 41, 46, 47). Also, no single-residue scanning of capsid side chains involved in major interactions at the viral nucleic acid-capsid interface had, to our knowledge, been described..

The icosahedral T = 1 capsid of MVM (29, 30) or CPV (25 to 28) is formed by 60 protein subunits that are contributed by three non-identical polypeptides, which are derived from a single gene and show identical fold and core sequence. VP2 is the major capsid component, VP1 includes the VP2 sequence plus a Nt extension, and VP3 results from the cleavage of the Nt of some VP2 subunits (48, 49). The DNA recognition site is essentially equivalent in CPV and MVM (strain i), and the major ordered ssDNA stretch (11 nucleotides) adopts a very similar conformation in both viruses (25, 26, 30). This DNA segment interacts through multiple hydrophobic contacts and/or hydrogen bonds mainly with 7 to 9 side chains of the capsid of either CPV or MVM (25, 26, 30) (see Table I). Most of these side chains are chemically and sterically identical or similar in both viruses (50) and participate in similar interactions with the DNA. For MVMi, a few shorter DNA stretches, spatially close to the major ordered DNA segment, could also be modeled (29, 30). We have individually truncated to alanine many of those residues of the MVM capsid that were previously (26, 30) found to be more involved in interactions with ordered nucleic acid in the structural model of the virion. The individual effects of the mutations on virus infectivity, viral particle assembly, conformational stability, and DNA packaging have been analyzed..

To estimate the amount of viral DNA, the samples bound to membranes were denatured in 0.4 N NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl for 5 min at room temperature, neutralized by incubation with 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 M NaCl during 5 min, and bound to the membrane by heating at 80  degrees C for 2 h. Filters were hybridized under high stringency as described (51) using as a probe a 2.4-kpb EcoRI restriction fragment of the MVM genome (nucleotides 1105 to 3547 (62)) labeled by random priming with digoxigenin, and incubated with a solution of nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Roche Applied Science)..

Each mutation would disrupt any interaction of the truncated side chain (beyond C) with the DNA while minimizing the possibility of altering the conformation of the polypeptide backbone (65). Some of those side chains are additionally involved in interactions with neighboring amino acid residues, which would also be disrupted by the mutation; this has also been contemplated in our experimental approach (see below)..

The sterically similar replacements of Asp-58 and Tyr-270 in MVM by Asn-56 and Phe-266 in CPV do not disrupt the major interactions of these residues with the DNA (Table I). Residues Trp-60 and Asn-491 in MVM appear to be involved in major interactions with two neighboring, shorter DNA stretches that could not be clearly visualized in the CPV structure (30). However, these residues are conserved in CPV (Trp-58 and Asn-492), and their interactions could also be conserved.

In brief, the ten residues of the MVM capsid chosen for mutation include many of those involved in major interactions with the viral nucleic acid, and most of those residues and their interactions with the DNA are conserved between MVM and CPV..

Thus, DNA-containing virions can be specifically detected in cells by in situ immunofluorescence with an antibody specific for epitopes located at the VP2 Nt (56).

As described above, Y270A yielded very low amounts of assembled capsids, and the reactivity with the anti-VP2 Nt antibody was proportionally reduced (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, the D273A mutant, which showed normal reactivity with the anti-VP and anti-capsid antibodies (Fig. 2A), showed an extremely reduced reactivity with the anti-VP2 Nt antibody (Fig. 2B)..

The results suggest that infectivity may be lost in two steps (Fig. 5C). The first step involved a moderate (5-fold) reduction in infectivity at about 50 to 55  degrees C, a temperature that was approximately coincident with that of the first transition observed by fluorescence (see above). The second step involved a drastic reduction of infectivity (several orders of magnitude) that started at about 70  degrees C and led to a nearly complete loss of infectivity at about 80  degrees C, temperatures that corresponded approximately to those of dissociation of the virion, empty capsids, and VLPs (see above and Refs. 59 and 66)..

However, the conformational stability of mutant infectious virions could be compared by following the reduction of infectivity in thermal inactivation kinetic assays, which required only a small amount of partially purified virions (61). The results of these assays are shown in Fig. 6 for some representative variants and summarized in Table II for all of the mutants analyzed. The stability of mutants D273A, Y270A and, possibly, N491A was not substantially different to that of the non-mutated control. In contrast, the stability of most mutants, namely D58A, W60A, N183A, T267A, K278A, K471A, and D474A was clearly reduced (Table II). To summarize, no mutation tested affected the thermal stability of the empty capsid, but most of them affected the thermal sensitivity of the infectious virion..

Aliquots of the virus preparations were incubated at 70  degrees C for the periods of time indicated, and the titers determined were normalized using the titer obtained in the absence of heating (t = 0). Black bars, non-mutated virion; gray bars, mutant K471A; white bars, mutant N183A. Titers were determined in triplicate. The standard deviation was in each case about 15% of the average, except for t = 99 min. In the latter case the number of plaque-forming units was very low, leading to somewhat larger errors..

First, the error in atomic positions in the MVM crystal structure (29, 30) in the absence of a complete refinement, and the necessary averaging of the true DNA sequences bound to symmetry-related sites in the capsid, introduce some uncertainty in the amino acid residues and interactions that participate in the DNA-capsid interface as defined in Table I. However, several evidences indicate that major DNA-capsid interactions (hydrogen bonds and multiple hydrophobic contacts), which involve the capsid residues analyzed in this study do occur in the MVM virion: (i) the conformations of the major visible DNA stretch in the MVMi and the CPV models are extremely similar (25, 26, 30); (ii) for many of the visible nucleotides the electron density is distinctive for purine or pyrimidine, and in some cases for individual base type (26, 30); (iii) a complete refinement of the CPV structure did not change in essence the major DNA-capsid interactions observed or the residues involved (25 to 27); (iv) the capsid residues involved in most interactions with ordered DNA are either conserved or conservatively substituted in both viruses (50); and (v) most of the interactions between these residues and the DNA are similar in both the MVMi and the refined CPV structural models (26, 30)..

The structure of the CPV (68) or the MVM capsid (29, 58) is nearly identical in both the empty particle and in the DNA-full virion. For CPV, a comparison of the refined structures of the virion and the empty capsid showed some local differences in the conformation of several residues in the DNA-binding region (68). However, a detailed contact analysis using the same structural models indicated that the residues equivalent to those of MVM we subjected to mutational analysis are involved in similar interactions in both the virion and the empty capsid: The side chains of Tyr-270 and Trp-60 in MVM, and the equivalent Phe-266 and Trp-58 in CPV, participate in multiple hydrophobic contacts with neighboring amino acid residues in the virion; in the empty capsid of CPV, nearly all of these contacts are preserved (further contacts were observed). Lys-278 and Asp-474 in MVM and the equivalent Arg-274 and Asp-475 in CPV are linked in the virion by an intersubunit salt bridge, and this salt bridge is also preserved in the empty capsid of CPV..

This latter fact indicates that those mutants are also able to encapsidate the DNA, as confirmed by direct encapsidation analysis using mutant W60A. The side chains of Trp-60 and Lys-278, but not the others, not only may interact with the DNA, but are also involved in multiple interactions with other capsid residues as well. However, none of those seven mutations had any significant effect on the stability of the capsid itself. In contrast, all of those mutations (with the possible exception of N491A, which had a lesser inhibitory effect on infectivity) caused a substantial reduction in the thermal sensitivity of the infectious virion. These results indicate that the interactions of the mutated residues with the DNA, and not the interactions with other capsid residues, have a role in preserving the virion conformation needed for the infectivity of the virus particle. The aromatic ring of Trp-60 is oriented perpendicularly to the ring of a neighboring purine base, which allows extensive van der Waals contacts and favorable dipole interactions. Asp-58, and Asn-183 and Asn-491, may be hydrogen-bonded, respectively, to a purine base and to the sugar-phosphate backbone. Thr-267 is involved in several van der Waals contacts. Lys-278 and Lys-471 showed no contacts with the DNA, but they were relatively close to DNA phosphates, and could contribute to medium-range electrostatic interactions..

We propose that the manyfold repeated hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between the viral DNA and Asp-58, Trp-60, Asn-183, Thr-267, Lys-278, and Lys-471, and perhaps other residues involved in capsid protein-viral DNA interactions (Table I) that have not been analyzed in the present study, may help to counteract the potential destabilization caused by repulsion between non-neutralized DNA phosphates in the virion. Truncation of the side chain of any of these residues except Lys-278 led to a reduction of infectivity by about one order of magnitude. The individual contribution to virion stability and infectivity of each of those few residues involved in major interactions between the viral DNA and each capsid subunit is, thus, relatively moderate. However, their combined effect, if additive as expected, could be dramatically important..

Asp-273 is very close to a DNA phosphate, but not to any acidic or basic amino acid residue (the closest basic residue is Lys-494 at a distance of 4.7 A), and it makes no visible contacts with the DNA or with other amino acid residues. One possibility is that the charge distribution at the capsid internal surface, which may be significantly altered if 60 negative charges are removed by the D273A mutation, may be critical for DNA packaging. In addition, the D273A phenotype provides further support to the previous suggestion that encapsidation of the MVM genome occurs in empty capsids previously assembled inside the cell nucleus (56)..

Because most of these residues are not involved in substantial intracapsid interactions, and none of them contributes to the stability of the capsid itself, their effect may be directly mediated by the multiple non-covalent interactions they establish with the viral DNA. In addition, at least one acidic residue at each DNA-binding region is needed for DNA packaging..

The requirement to treat women with VIN has recently stimulated the use of immunotherapy with E6/E7 oncogene vaccines. Animal models have shown that E2 may also be a useful vaccine target for HPV-associated disease; however, little is known about E2 immunity in humans. This study investigated the prevalence of HPV-16 E2-specific serological and T-cell responses in 18 women with HPV-16-associated VIN and 17 healthy volunteers. E2 responses were determined by full-length E2 to GST ELISA with ELISPOT and proliferation assays using E2 C-terminal protein. As positive controls, HPV-16 L1 responses were measured using virus-like particles (VLPs) and L1 to GST ELISA with ELISPOT and proliferation using VLPs as antigen. The VIN patients all showed a strong serological response to L1 compared with the healthy volunteers by VLP (15/18 vs 1/17, P < 0 001) and L1 to GST ELISA (18/18 vs 1/17, P < 0 001).

The requirement to treat women with VIN has recently stimulated the use of immunotherapy with E6/E7 oncogene vaccines. Animal models have shown that E2 may also be a useful vaccine target for HPV-associated disease; however, little is known about E2 immunity in humans. This study investigated the prevalence of HPV-16 E2-specific serological and T-cell responses in 18 women with HPV-16-associated VIN and 17 healthy volunteers. E2 responses were determined by full-length E2 to GST ELISA with ELISPOT and proliferation assays using E2 C-terminal protein. As positive controls, HPV-16 L1 responses were measured using virus-like particles (VLPs) and L1 to GST ELISA with ELISPOT and proliferation using VLPs as antigen. The VIN patients all showed a strong serological response to L1 compared with the healthy volunteers by VLP (15/18 vs 1/17, P < 0 001) and L1 to GST ELISA (18/18 vs 1/17, P < 0 001). In contrast, L1-specific cellular immune responses were detected in a significant proportion of controls but were more prevalent in the VIN patients by proliferation assay (9/17 vs 17/18, P < 0 02) and interferon- ELISPOT (9/17 vs 13/18, P=not significant).

While the majority of infections are inconsequential and short-lived, virus persistence is associated with anogenital disease, especially cervical carcinogenesis (Rozendaal et al., 1996). Several observations have indicated that host immunity plays an important role in effecting viral clearance, and this has provided the impetus for the development of vaccines to prevent and/or treat cancer of the cervix and its precursor lesions. Most of these approaches have concentrated on eliciting specific immunity against the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which are expressed throughout the spectrum of HPV-associated disease development (Borysiewicz et al., 1996; Klencke et al., 2002; Muderspach et al., 2000; Santin et al., 2002)..

This has been supported by data from the cotton tail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) model, where vaccination of rabbits with DNA encoding CRPV E2 was found to protect against the development of papillomas following subsequent tumour challenge (Han et al., 2000a, b). There are limited data on responses to E2 in patients with HPV-associated disease. Serology studies have provided conflicting results with IgA and IgG responses to a cryptic peptide correlating with antigen exposure in cervical cancer patients (Dillner et al., 1994; Hamsikova et al., 1994; Lehtinen et al., 1992; Lenner et al., 1995), while IgA (but not IgG) responses detected using a baculovirus-produced E2 protein were associated with low- rather than high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia CIN) and cervical cancer (Rocha-Zavaleta et al., 1997). These assays variously can detect linear or conformational epitopes, respectively, so their lack of concordance may not be surprising. A single study has investigated naturally occurring E2-specific T-cell responses in women with HPV-associated CIN where helper T-cell responses to the E2 C terminus, but not to the N terminus, occurred at the time of viral clearance (Bontkes et al., 1999). Clearly there is a need for further baseline investigations of naturally occurring E2-specific immune responses in patients with HPV-associated disease..

It is a chronic disease characterized by recurrence following standard treatment (Herod et al., 1996). It therefore provides an excellent opportunity for the study of naturally occurring HPV-specific immune responses in women with persistent high-risk HPV infections. This immunity is likely to have arisen as a consequence of chronic exposure to the virus but may be insufficient to effect disease regression and virus clearance. The relapsing and recurring nature of VIN is likely to represent an ongoing battle between viral and immune factors in the natural control of this disease. Thus, a comparison of HPV-specific immunity in women with chronic HPV infections and in those without may provide some insight into those immunological responses that play an important role in the natural history of HPV-associated disease..
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	10	We have previously described an interferon- (IFN-) ELISPOT assay, which facilitates the detection of HPV-16 E2-specific memory T-cell responses to E2 C terminus protein following its processing and presentation by autologous dendritic cells (DCs) (Davidson et al., 2001). The advantage of this system is that it is not limited by the use of HLA-restricted peptides but rather allows the study of the full range of T-cell responses that may have arisen as a consequence of natural antigen presentation in vivo. In the present study, we have measured the 86 amino acid C-terminal E2- and virus-like particle (VLP) L1-specific T-cell responses in women with HPV-16-associated VIN and healthy female volunteers using this methodology and proliferation. HPV-16 L1 VLP-specific T-cell responses were measured as a positive control, since previous studies have found high proportions of healthy volunteers and patients with HPV-16-associated high-grade CIN to respond to this antigen. In addition we measured full-length GST to E2- and both GST to L1 and VLP L1-specific serological responses in the VIN and control subjects..

The HPV-16 L1 gene was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcGHLT (Pharmingen) and co-transfected with baculovirus DNA into Sf9 cells (obtained from Wei Zhang, Dept of Pathology, University of Cambridge). The resultant supernatant was then titrated and used for infection. Flasks of 80 to 90 % confluent Sf9 cells were infected with baculovirus expressing the HPV-16 L1 protein for 72 h under constant agitation at 27  degrees C. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 200 g and processed in a similar manner to that previously described (Kirnbauer et al., 1993; Zhou et al., 1992). In summary, cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer, and then centrifuged at 7500 r.p.m. in a JA20 rotor. The pellet was resuspended, and then sonicated at 22  microm using a probe sonicator. This was loaded on to 40 % sucrose and centrifuged at high speed (45 000 r.p.m.) in an SW50 Ti rotor for 2 h. The pellet was resuspended and sonicated again briefly before mixing with caesium chloride solution to a final density of 1 33 g cm-3. This mixture was centrifuged overnight at 45 000 r.p.m. in an SW50 Ti rotor and the resultant VLP band at a density of 1 29 g cm-3 was collected.

Protein immobilizer microwell plates (Exiqon) were coated with baculovirus HPV-16 VLP at 2  microg ml-1 in PBS (antigen) or with PBS only (control) at 37  degrees C for 1 h. The plate was washed thoroughly with 0 05 % Tween in PBS (PBST; Sigma) after this and each subsequent step. Plasma dilutions (1 : 100, 1 : 400 and 1 : 1600) were prepared in 3 % BSA (highly purified  > 97 %; Sigma) and added to the plate in duplicate wells for 1 h at room temperature. One plasma sample with a high HPV-16 L1 VLP absorbance was included as a positive control on every plate. Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with goat anti-human IgG (heavy and light chain; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) (1 : 2400 in 1 % BSA), followed by biotinylated rabbit anti-goat (1 : 5000 in 1 % BSA; Dako) each for 1 h and streptavidin to HRP (1 : 5000 in 1 % BSA; Dako) for 30 min. The plates were developed with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Sigma) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in phosphate/citrate buffer (pH 5). The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 M H2SO4 and the plates read on an automatic plate reader. The sample total VLP-specific absorbance was determined by subtracting the mean absorbance of the control-coated wells at a plasma dilution of 1 : 400 from the mean absorbance of the antigen-coated wells at the same plasma dilution (1 : 400). This was normalized across the plates by dividing the sample total VLP-specific absorbance by the positive control total VLP-specific absorbance from that particular plate..

PHA and tuberculin PPD were included as positive control antigens in both assays. All donors showed strong proliferative responses to PHA and PPD. Two different ELISPOT assays were used; in the first, PBMCs were incubated with the protein antigens for 24 h before testing for IFN- release. In the second, protein-loaded DCs were used to stimulate autologous T cells for 4 days before testing the latter for IFN- release. In both ELISPOT assays, strong PHA and PPD responses were observed, although the frequency of responding cells was much greater in the DC-stimulated T-cell assays than in the full PBMC assays.

Studies in cervical neoplasia have shown that antibodies against the viral capsids are seen concomitantly with or within a few months following acquisition of HPV-16 DNA in up to 70 % of those infected (Carter et al., 1996; Wikstrom et al., 1995) and are stable with time (Carter et al., 1996), even after 15 years of follow-up (Shah et al., 1997). There is therefore little evidence of exposure to HPV-16 in our cohort of healthy volunteers. This may be partly explained by their lifetime history of normal cervical cytology, although genital high-risk HPV infections are frequent and not always associated with abnormal smears. The cut-off values that were defined in this study for both assays were consistent with the absorbance values measured from sera from virgins (data not shown), suggesting that the normal sera were generally representative of a population not previously exposed to HPV-16. In contrast, VLP- and L1-specific antibodies were associated with the majority of HPV-16-positive high-grade VIN patients (15/18 and 17/18, respectively) compared with just one of the healthy volunteers demonstrating seropositivity..

0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	42	A dominant antibody response in humans against HPV-16 capsids involves a type-specific epitope only present on assembled capsids and not on the individual pentavalent capsomeres (Heino et al., 1995; Wang et al., 1997). The L1 forms pentamers when its N terminus is fused to GST and this can allow detection of other L1-reactive antibodies. Thus, the GST to L1 assay may allow epitopes that are ordinarily hidden within the fully assembled capsid phenotype to become available for serological reactivity and this may explain why more responses were seen using this assay than with the VLP assay. Previous studies of HPV-16 VLP-specific antibodies in women with high-grade VIN found approximately 60 % of patients to be seropositive, but these studies did not determine the HPV status of the lesions and therefore may not have identified HPV-16-negative disease (Hildesheim et al., 1997; Sun et al., 1996)..
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	43	We found HPV-16 E2-specific Ig in one of the healthy volunteers, consistent with this population's lack of exposure to HPV-16, but only 2/18 HPV-16-positive high-grade VIN patients were seropositive. From previous studies, serological responses to the E2 protein appear to correlate with antigen exposure (Lehtinen et al., 1992; Lenner et al., 1995). However, it is not clear how the different assays (baculoviral protein, peptide and GST fusion) for E2 antibodies can be directly compared. In particular, we do not know whether the GST to E2 fusion protein has any native conformation in the ELISA. Nevertheless, the relatively infrequent detection of E2-specific Ig responses in our VIN patient cohort may indicate a lack of E2 expression by high-grade VIN lesions. The E2 open reading frame is typically disrupted following virus integration into the host cell genome, a process that has been shown to occur during the malignant transformation of HPV-infected cells (Graham  and  Herrington, 2000; Peitsaro et al., 2002; Stevenson et al., 2000; Tonon et al., 2001)..

0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	45	Cell-mediated immunity is likely to play a pivotal role in eradicating established HPV infection and effecting disease regression. IFN- ELISPOT potentially allows the detection of low-frequency memory CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) cells, since both release IFN- following re-exposure to specific antigens (Sallusto et al., 1999; van der Burg et al., 2001). Multiple restimulation of normal donor T-cell cultures with autologous E2 C terminus protein-pulsed DCs was shown to induce CTLs capable of E2-specific lysis of autologous lymphoblastoid cell lines infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding HPV-16 E2 (Davidson et al., 2001). Thus, there is an E2-specific CTL repertoire available in normal individuals. Other studies using overlapping peptides from the HPV-16 E2 protein have revealed a broad E2-specific T helper cell repertoire in healthy volunteers (de Jong et al., 2002). DCs pulsed with HPV-16 VLP have also been shown to stimulate primarily type 1-dominated T helper cell responses (Lenz et al., 2001) and MHC class I-restricted CTL responses (Rudolf et al., 2001) in vitro. The specific release of IFN- by CD4+ Th1 cells and CD8+ CTLs following stimulation with E2 and VLP protein antigens may therefore provide a useful measure of those cell-mediated immune responses that are likely to be important in the natural clearance of HPV infections. In the present study, ELISPOT responses to C-terminal E2 and L1 required a 4 day stimulation of T cells with autologous protein-pulsed DCs; a 24 h stimulation of bulk PBMC cultures with antigen was not sufficient to reveal these responses. This suggests that appropriate antigen processing and presentation is necessary to demonstrate these low-frequency memory responses..

There is evidence for this in the studies of Williams et al. (2002) for HPV-11 and Steele et al. (2002) for HPV-1. Overall, HPV-16-positive VIN patients have high levels of antibodies to the viral capsid proteins and these are likely to be capable of neutralizing the virus.

None of the healthy volunteers showed evidence of E2-specific T-cell responses either by proliferation assay or by ELISPOT. This is consistent with the results of Bontkes et al.

0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	51	There are several explanations for the discrepancies noted in these studies. Firstly, there was only evidence of exposure to HPV-16 in one of the healthy volunteers recruited into this study. By comparison, de Jong et al. (2002) tested anonymous donors for E2-specific T-helper cell responses and had no details regarding the age, sex, cervical smear history or HPV-16 VLP antibody status of their subjects. Secondly, the methodology used was very different. De Jong et al. used 30-mer overlapping peptides from the full HPV-16 E2 sequence. Significant cross-reactivity was seen between particular HPV-16 E2-specific T-cell responses and homologous peptides from other HPV types. Thus, the measured responses may reflect priming with HPV types other than HPV-16 itself. Furthermore, it is not clear whether all of the peptides investigated in this study are naturally processed by antigen-presenting cells in vivo. In contrast, since the intact E2 C terminus protein was used to measure T-cell responses in this study, any measured E2-specific immunity must reflect stimulation with naturally processed peptides. This is also true for the study by Bontkes et al. (1999), where E2 C terminus or N terminus proteins were used to stimulate PBMCs for 7 days before testing the supernatant for IL-2 concentration. However, the assays used in the present study should also test responses to the HPV-16 E2 N terminus, since it is possible that we are missing a significant response not evident in the IL-2 release assays (Bontkes et al., 1999)..

0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	53	It appears that exposure to HPV-16-positive VIN stimulates both antibody and T-cell responses to L1 protein but these may not always be sufficient to clear the lesions. In contrast, E2-specific T-cell responses are rare, although a repertoire exists, so it is possible that their absence may facilitate the persistence of VIN lesions. Without clear proof of E2-specific T-cell responses associated with lesion resolution, it is unclear whether a lack of responsiveness indicates the inappropriateness of the assay or a true absence of E2-specific T cells. Nevertheless, these studies of immunity to an early and late HPV-16 protein in VIN provide a baseline for comparison of responses to vaccines such as chimeric VLPs including L1 to E7 to E2 (Schiller  and  Hildesheim, 2000). The challenge is to demonstrate such immune responses in patients at the time of virus clearance (systemic and local analyses), and for this, long term follow-up studies of large numbers of young women are required. This will resolve whether E2 is simply non-immunogenic or whether absence of immunogenicity is specifically associated with persistence of HPV-16 infection..

0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	4	We examined gene and surface expression and activity of the endothelin (ET)-1 receptors (ETA and ETB) in subendothelial (L1) and inner medial (L2) cells from the main pulmonary artery of sheep with continuous air embolization (CAE)-induced chronic pulmonary hypertension (CPH). According to quantitative real-time RT-PCR, basal gene expression of both receptors was significantly higher in L2 than L1 cells, and hypertensive L2 cells showed significantly higher gene expression of ETB than controls. Expression of both genes in hypertensive L1 cells was similar to controls. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis confirmed the increased distribution of ETB in hypertensive L2 cells. Although only the ETA receptors in control L2 cells showed significant binding of [125I]-labeled ET-1 at 1 h, both receptors bound ET-1 to hypertensive cells. Exposure to exogenous ET-1 for 18 h revealed that only the L2 cells internalized ET-1, and internalization by hypertensive L2 cells was significantly reduced when compared with controls. Treatment with ETA (BQ-610) and ETB (BQ-788) receptor antagonists demonstrated that both receptors contributed to internalization of ET-1 in control L2 cells, whereas in hypertensive cells only when both receptor antagonists were used in combination was significant suppression of ET-1 internalization found. We conclude that in sheep receiving CAE, alterations in ETB receptors in cells of the L2 layer may contribute to the maintenance of CPH via alterations in their expression, distribution, and activity..

Exposure to exogenous ET-1 for 18 h revealed that only the L2 cells internalized ET-1, and internalization by hypertensive L2 cells was significantly reduced when compared with controls. Treatment with ETA (BQ-610) and ETB (BQ-788) receptor antagonists demonstrated that both receptors contributed to internalization of ET-1 in control L2 cells, whereas in hypertensive cells only when both receptor antagonists were used in combination was significant suppression of ET-1 internalization found. We conclude that in sheep receiving CAE, alterations in ETB receptors in cells of the L2 layer may contribute to the maintenance of CPH via alterations in their expression, distribution, and activity..

The ET family of 21 amino acid peptides exists in three distinct isoforms: ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3. It is an extremely potent vasoconstrictor resulting in slowly developing and sustained contraction. Although the endothelial cell was originally described as the source of ET-1, it is now known that several other cell types, including pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells, synthesize this peptide (33, 36)..

The affinity of the ETA receptor for ET-1 has been shown to be ~100 times that for ET-3 (ET-1  >  ET-2  >  ET-3), whereas the affinity of the ETB receptor is equipotent for all three isoforms of ET (34). Early reports indicated that the ETA receptor on smooth muscle was responsible for the vasoconstrictor effect of ET-1, whereas the ETB receptor on endothelial cells modulated ET-1-induced vasodilation. However, recent pharmacological studies suggest that there are two classes of ETB with cell specific effects, ETB1 on endothelial cells mediating vasodilation and ETB2 on smooth muscle cells mediating vasoconstriction (9). The ETB receptor also functions as a "clearance receptor" and is particularly important in the lung, where 50% of ET-1 is retained (22, 29)..

Increased expression of the peptide has been demonstrated in endothelial cells of pulmonary arteries from patients with idiopathic and secondary forms of pulmonary hypertension (15), and arterial-to-venous ratios of ET-1 protein were found to be elevated above the normal range in patients with pulmonary hypertension (40). Several studies have linked increased expression of ET-1 to the development of hypoxia-induced CPH in rats (5, 24), and use of ET-1 receptor antagonists has been shown both to inhibit progression of the disease and to promote recovery (4, 10, 43)..

Furthermore, we found in a model of CPH, sheep receiving continuous air embolization (CAE) into the main pulmonary artery, that ppET-1 gene expression in the main pulmonary artery and peripheral lung gradually decreased with the onset of pulmonary hypertension while the midregion artery (9th-10th generation) showed a gradual increase (42)..

The present study examines whether ETA and ETB gene and surface expression is altered in L1 and L2 cells from control and hypertensive sheep.

0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	19	Sheep model of CPH. The protocol for delivery of CAE into the sheep pulmonary artery has been described previously, and the physiological and structural changes for this model of CPH have been reported in detail (16, 32). Briefly, a left thoracotomy was performed on yearling mixed-breed sheep under general anesthesia, and pulmonary artery and left atrial catheters were inserted. A jugular venous introducer and carotid artery catheter were placed through a neck incision. After a recovery period of 3-5 days, a Swan-Ganz catheter was positioned in the pulmonary artery through the jugular vein introducer. Baseline measurements of pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa), cardiac output (CO), and left atrial pressure (Pla) were made, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was calculated using the formula: PVR = (Ppa  Pla)/CO. After baseline measurements, the sheep received CAE (n = 3) into the pulmonary artery by way of the proximal port (lying in the right heart) of the Swan-Ganz catheter over a 12-day period. The rate of air embolization administered was sufficient to cause an increase in PVR that was ~2.5 times baseline. Physiological measurements were performed each day, and the rate of air flow was adjusted as necessary to maintain the elevation in PVR. Surgically prepared animals not receiving air but maintained for the same time period served as controls (n = 3)..

At the end of the experiment, the animals were killed with an overdose of sodium barbiturate (pentobarbital sodium 325 mg   ml1   5 kg1 body wt, Euthanazia-5 solution; Henry Schein, Port Washington, NY), and the lungs were removed. The main pulmonary artery was dissected from a point 1 cm from its exit from the right ventricle to its point of entry into the right and left lungs, and a section was taken for routine light microscopy and for 1- microm sections of epoxy-embedded tissue. Cells were isolated from the subendothelial (L1) and inner medial (L2) layers of the main pulmonary artery from control and hypertensive sheep as previously described (41, 42). Briefly, the artery was opened, and the endothelial layer was removed by gentle scraping; the subendothelial L1 cells were isolated from pulmonary artery segments by deep scraping. The inner media L2 cells were isolated either by a modified explant technique or by enzymatic dissociation. Using phase contrast microscopy, we identified L1 and L2 cell colonies by their morphology, trypsinized them in "cloning rings" and transferred them into culture dishes. Both cells types were seeded and cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100  microg/ml streptomycin, 40  microg/ml gentamicin, 2 mmol/l L-glutamine (GIBCO-BRL, Grand Island, NY), and 15% heat-inactivated calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA). Confluent cells (passages 3-6) were used for all experiments; higher passage numbers have been associated with a substantial increase in ETB receptor density (27). Cell lines cultured from each of three different control and three different hypertensive animals were used for each assay..
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	21	Experimental protocols. All experiments were carried out in RPMI-1640 containing 0.1% BSA. Experiments were initiated after overnight incubation of the cells in that medium. For real-time RT-PCR analysis of ETA and ETB gene expression, cells were harvested 90 min after addition of 0.1% BSA in RPMI-1640. For dose-response studies of ET-1 internalization, intracellular levels of ET-1 were measured after 18-h exposure to exogenous ET-1 at concentrations from 0.01 to 1,000 nM. Experiments with ETA (BQ-610) and ETB (BQ-788) antagonists included a 2-h preincubation period before addition of exogenous ET-1 (10 nM) for 18 h. The dose of each antagonist used in these experiments was based on dose-response curves. The concentrations of BQ-610 tested were from 1 to 100  microM, and those for BQ-788 were from 0.01 to 100  microM. The dose chosen was the dose that gave a 50% reduction in uptake of exogenous ET-1 by control L2 cells. For ET-1 binding assays, cells in two P150 dishes were pretreated with either BQ-610 or BQ-788 for 2 h before isolation of cell membranes. Untreated L1 and L2 cells and cells treated with each antagonist alone served as controls..

The amplification program for ETA consisted of heating at 20 degrees C/s to 95 degrees C, cooling at 20 degrees C/s to 57 degrees C, annealing at 57 degrees C for 5 s, heating at 20 degrees C/s to 72 degrees C, elongation at 72 degrees C for 29 s, and heating at 5 degrees C/s to 86 degrees C for fluorescence acquisition.

The specificity of the amplimer in each reaction was confirmed by melting curve analysis, with initial gel confirmation that this large peak corresponded to the expected amplimer (representative melting curve analysis for ETB shown in Fig. 4C) (38). The contribution to fluorescence signal of any nonspecific products and/or primer dimers was eliminated by increasing the temperature to 2 degrees C below the melting temperature of the specific product, which eliminated any other minor cDNAs (which have lower melting temperatures) (38). Copy numbers of mRNA were calculated from serially diluted standard curves generated from cDNA or RNA templates (17, 38). Serial dilutions (1:10) over a range of three orders of magnitude were used to generate the standard curves. The serially diluted standards were simultaneously amplified with the unknown samples to generate a linear standard curve by the fit-points method of analysis with five points. Standard curves for both ETA and ETB consistently had correlation coefficients of 0.97-1.00 (representative sample for ETB is shown in Fig. 4B). Control samples run in triplicate had a variance of ~10%. All biological samples fell on the standard curves, and copy numbers of the unknown samples were calculated with the Lightcycler software (version 3).

Intracellular levels of mature ET-1 were determined in homogenates from both L1 and L2 cells as described previously (42). Briefly, at the end of the experiment, cells were washed three times in serum-free medium and trypsinized, and cell number was counted using a hemocytometer. After centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 10 min, the cell pellets were homogenized in 0.1% Triton X-100 with a Teflon glass pestle. The homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatants were collected for solid-phase extraction. The cell supernatants were acidified by 2 M HCl and loaded in Sep-Pak C18 cartridges, which were prewashed with 100% methanol, acetonitrile-5 mmol/l trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and distilled H2O with 5 mmol/l TFA. Each cartridge was then washed in distilled H2O with 5 mmol/l TFA and eluted with 2 ml of 80% methanol containing 0.1% TFA. The samples were divided into two tubes and dried under vacuum. Levels of ET-1 were determined in 100- microl aliquots of L1 and L2 homogenates using a commercially available ET-1 ELISA system (Biotrak ELISA System; Amersham International). The ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The assay is sensitive to values of  > 1 fmol and cross-reacts with 100% of ET-1 and ET-2 (ET-2 is not generally found in the walls of the pulmonary vasculature) but not with ET-3 ( < 0.001% cross reactivity). Each sample was run in duplicate. Results were expressed as femtomoles of ET-1 per 106 cells..

L1 cells, like endothelial cells, were found to synthesize and release ET-1, whereas L2 cells had less synthetic capacity for ET-1 but, rather, had the propensity to internalize exogenous ET-1. The present study extends these findings and examines ETA and ETB gene and surface expression, Bmax sites, and activity as assessed by ET-1 internalization by L1 and L2 cells from the main pulmonary artery of control sheep and those with sustained pulmonary hypertension induced by CAE. The present in vitro study documents that the hypertensive L2 cells, as seen in vivo, maintain their hypertrophic appearance, whereas the L1 cells from the thickened subendothelial layer revert to an appearance similar to controls. In addition, we show that L2 cells from control and hypertensive animals exhibit significantly higher basal expression of both the ETA and ETB genes than L1 cells and that ETB gene and surface expression in hypertensive L2 cells was significantly increased compared with controls. The present findings also confirm that L2, but not L1, cells from control sheep internalize exogenous ET-1 in a dose-dependent manner and further demonstrate that L2 cells from hypertensive sheep internalize less ET-1 than controls. In addition, we found that in control cells, the ETA receptors were mainly responsible for binding ET-1 to the L2 cells, but after 18 h of exposure to ET-1, both receptors played a role in internalization. Using ETA and ETB receptor antagonists, our study also demonstrates that in hypertensive cells, both receptors bound radiolabeled ET-1; internalization of ET-1, however, was inhibited only when the ETA and ETB antagonists were used in combination..

In pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells, the ETA receptor is linked to vasoconstriction as well as hypertrophy and smooth muscle proliferation, whereas the ETB receptor is linked to clearance of ET-1 from the circulation as well as both vasoconstriction and vasodilation (22, 36, 39). Studies in the pulmonary vasculature suggest that the actions of ET-1 are mediated by at least three receptors: one ETA receptor and two ETB receptor subtypes. Pharmacological studies in several species indicate that the endothelial ETB receptor (designated ETB1) mediates vasodilatation, whereas the ETB2 receptor expressed in smooth muscle acts as vasoconstrictor (5, 7, 9)..

In humans, ETA receptors have been shown to have a prolonged period of desensitization occurring within 5 min of exposure to ET-1; sensitization is restored between 80 and 120 min (8). This prolonged desensitization period seems to be unique to the ETA receptor and may explain, at least in part, the prolonged contraction of smooth muscle cells in response to ET-1 (6). The ETB receptors, on the other hand, are rapidly deactivated (via phosphorylation and dehydration) and lose  > 80% of their initial activity within 5 min of agonist stimulation. This rapid deactivation of ETB has been linked to the short-term vasodilatory effect of ET-1 (7). The present study shows that both ETA and ETB receptors bind and are responsible for internalization of exogenous ET-1; however, our data in hypertensive cells suggest that both receptors types have become desensitized..

Both ETA and ETB receptors have been identified in pulmonary and systemic vascular smooth muscle cells, e.g., rat aorta (30), human internal mammary artery and vein, porcine coronary arteries (37), and rat and human pulmonary artery (28). In humans, ETA receptors were found in both resistance and conduit arteries, and in the main pulmonary artery, ETA receptors predominated (90%) (5). Tracheal smooth muscle from rats and mice, however, exhibited approximately equal numbers of the two receptor subtypes (18), whereas ETB receptors were 50% more numerous than ETA in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (23). Thus the distribution and density of ET-1 receptors on various smooth muscle types may vary between species and location (5, 31)..

With long-term exposure, however, it seems that both receptors participate equally in the internalization process. This difference is likely to reflect the effects of long- and short-term exposure, the ETB receptor becoming more active when exposure to ET-1 is prolonged perhaps as a result of an increase in the requirement for internalization, and degradation of ET-1. Previous studies in isolated, perfused rat lungs (29) have also shown that both receptors play a role in clearance of ET-1 (14)..

For example, increased ETA gene expression was demonstrated in rat lungs and increased ETB gene expression in the rat main pulmonary artery after exposure to hypoxia for 48 h (25). After 14 days of hypoxia, increased expression of both ETA and ETB was found in the distal pulmonary arteries of rats, ETA expression occurring mainly in the media and ETB in the intima; no change in expression of either receptor was found in the large muscular pulmonary arteries (39). In contrast to the hypoxic models, in monocrotaline-induced CPH, ETB receptor mRNA was shown to be decreased in the lung (46)..

Further confirmation of the increase in ETB receptors on hypertensive L2 cells is shown by our finding of an increase in early internalization of ET-1 by ETB. Similar increases in ETB gene expression have been reported in the pulmonary arteries of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (44). The ETB signaling pathway has been linked to the regulation of ppET-1 gene expression in rat mesangial cells (19). The present study confirms this notion since, in a previous study, we showed that ppET-1 gene expression in the main pulmonary artery was decreased in hypertensive sheep compared with controls..

Rather, our data demonstrate that ET-1-stimulated internalization of exogenous ET-1 is decreased in hypertensive L2 cells compared with controls and that the sensitivity of the individual ET-1 receptors is lost. It is only when the ETA and ETB antagonists are added simultaneously that suppression of ET-1 uptake occurs. Similar findings have been demonstrated in isolated perfused lungs from rats with hypoxic CPH (23). One possible explanation for the failure of each antagonist alone to inhibit ET-1 uptake is that the concentration of antagonists used in the study was not sufficient to inhibit ETA and ETB receptors in hypertensive L2 cells. This would seem unlikely, because both antagonists failed to exert an inhibitory effect. Another possibility is that phosphorylation of the receptor/ligand complex and/or receptor recycling are altered in the hypertensive cells. This notion requires further study..

0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	89	Another possible explanation is that concurrent treatment with the ETA and ETB antagonists involves simultaneous activation and heterodimerization of the two receptors (26). Recent studies suggest that ET-1 binds simultaneously to both an ETA and ETB receptor (2, 11). This heterodimerization between two fully functional G protein-coupled receptors is suggested to result in a new receptor/ligand binding complex with functional properties different from those of either receptor alone (21). Thus it is possible that when the individual ETA and ETB receptors of hypertensive L2 cells are desensitized to exogenous ET-1, their simultaneous stimulation results in heterodimerization of ETA and ETB receptors and internalization of ET-1 by a different pathway. This new pathway would seem to be extremely effective, since intracellular levels of ET-1 in the hypertensive L2 cells returned almost to basal values. Further studies are needed to elucidate this possible explanation..

0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	91	In summary, we have shown that gene and surface expression and activity of the ETB, but not the ETA, receptors in L1 and L2 cells from control and hypertensive sheep are different. Control and hypertensive L2 cells exhibit significantly higher steady-state basal expression of both the ETA and ETB genes than L1 cells. In agreement with this finding, we found that only the L2 cells internalize exogenous ET-1. In the short term, the ETA receptors are mainly responsible for binding of ET-1, but with longer exposure, both receptors contribute to internalization. In hypertensive L2 cells, we showed that ETB gene and surface expression and Bmax by this receptor were significantly elevated above baseline. Uptake of exogenous ET-1 by these cells, however, was less pronounced than in control cells. Furthermore, we found that only concurrent treatment with both ETA and ETB antagonists suppressed ET-1 uptake in the hypertensive cells, suggesting an alteration in their structure. We conclude that changes in gene and surface expression and activity of the ETB receptors in L2 cells from hypertensive sheep may contribute to the development and maintenance of CPH through an altered sensitivity to locally produced ET-1..

The IgG response was similar in women with low-risk HPV-associated LSIL and controls (P=0 1). In contrast, more than 90 % of patients with high-risk HPV-associated LSIL were seropositive. Although tumours from cancer patients were all positive for the presence of high-risk HPV DNA, the level of seropositivity decreased significantly in this group (P < 0 0001). Cervical IgA antibodies were also detected in a significantly high proportion of women with high-risk HPV-associated LSIL compared with controls. However, the proportion of IgA-positive patients was lower than the proportion of IgG seropositives. In conclusion, the 16L1 peptide appears to be a high-risk type-common epitope that induces cross-reactive antibodies in high-risk, but not low-risk, HPV-associated LSIL patients, allowing differentiation of high- and low-risk infected women at this stage of infection..

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that  low-risk  HPV genotypes, mainly types 6 and 11, induce benign genital warts. In contrast,  high-risk  genotypes, including HPV-16, -18 and related types, are associated with the development of cervical cancer (Walboomers et al., 1999). Cervical cancer is still one of the most prevalent cancers in the developing world (Parkin et al., 1999). HPV-16 and related types (31, 33, 52, 58 and 35), together with HPV-18 and related types (45, 59, 39 and 68), are associated with 91 % of cervical tumours in Central and South America (Bosch et al., 1995). Thus, early detection of genital infections by these high-risk HPV types would be of value for the prevention of cervical cancer..

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	8	Genital HPV infection frequently induces antibody-mediated immune responses, mostly directed against the viral capsid (Wang et al., 1996; Carter et al., 2000; Rocha-Zavaleta et al., 2003). The HPV capsid is composed of two structural proteins, a largely internal minor capsid protein (L2) and a major protein (L1), which is 30 times more abundant than L2 (Kirnbauer et al., 1993) and represents about 80 % of the total viral protein. L1 is an important target of the immune system. Immunological assays based on the use of HPV capsids are known to detect type-restricted antibodies, possibly due to the presentation of type-specific conformational epitopes. Interestingly, the HPV-16 capsid exposes not only type-restricted but also type-common antigenic epitopes (Heino et al., 1995). Thus, in addition to specific antibodies (Cason et al., 1992), widely cross-reactive antibodies have been found to react against peptide sequences on the L1 protein of both high- and low-risk HPV types (LeCann et al., 1995)..
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	9	We have previously described a peptide (IHSMNSTIL) derived from the HPV-16 L1 protein (16L1 peptide) that binds to HLA class I allele B*3901 and elicits proliferative responses in lymphocytes from patients with cervical cancer associated with either HPV-16 or -18 (Monroy-Garcia et al., 2002). Further analysis of this peptide using Lipman and Pearson's ALIGN program showed that the sequence presented a substantial amino acid identity with the corresponding sequence in HPV-18 (88 9 % identity), HPV-16-related types (77 8 to 66 7 % identity) and HPV-18-related types (88 9 to 66 7 % identity). Interestingly, comparison with the corresponding sequences in HPV-6 and -11 demonstrated an identity level of 55 6 %. This observation raised the question of whether antibodies generated against these sequences could cross-react with the 16L1 peptide. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-peptide reactivity of antibodies produced in patients with high-risk HPV-associated low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and cervical cancer and to compare it with the reaction of antibodies from women with low-risk HPV-associated LSIL to assess their potential cross-reactivity..

The study population was selected from patients attending the National Center for Clinics of Dysplasias (CENACLID), General Hospital of Mexico, and the National Institute of Cancerology (INCAN), Mexico City, Mexico. Samples were collected between 1997 and 2002. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Human material was handled according to institutional experimentation and safety guidelines. CENACLID provides gynaecological services to women referred for colposcopy because of abnormal cytology and women without a history of cervical abnormalities who ask for a routine examination. In the present study, women from both groups were analysed. Women with a history of previous high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) were not included in the study. All women underwent cytological and histopathological analysis of colposcopy-directed biopsies. All Pap smears were examined independently by two experienced cytotechnologists. Samples with an inconsistent diagnosis were excluded from the study. Cytology diagnoses were classified according to the Bethesda system into normal, atypical squamous cells with undetermined significance (ASCUS), LSIL, HSIL and cervical carcinoma. Samples with ASCUS and HSIL were excluded from the study. Blood samples, cervical washes and colposcopy-directed biopsies were obtained from all patients. Serum was separated from blood samples by centrifugation at 9000 g for 15 min. Cervical mucus was collected by washing the uterine cervix with 1 ml sterile PBS. Cell debris was eliminated by centrifugation at 9000 g for 5 min. Cervical washes containing blood contamination were not considered for antibody detection. Cervical mucus and serum samples were stored at  to 70  degrees C until tested. Cervical biopsies were placed immediately in tubes containing sterile, contaminant-free PBS (Roche Applied Science) and processed the same day. Investigators who performed molecular and immunological assays were not aware of the clinical status of samples. To avoid contamination, cases and controls were tested in separate batches. All samples underwent molecular analysis by PCR and hybrid capture. Women who were consistently negative for both clinical and molecular tests were considered as negative controls. Only patients (LSIL and cervical carcinoma) with consistently positive results for PCR and hybrid capture tests were included in the study..

Biopsies were treated with proteinase K as described elsewhere (Kaye et al., 1994). DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. HPV DNA was amplified using the general primers MY09 (5'-CGTCCMARRGGAWACTGATC-3') and MY11 (5'-GCMCAGGGWCATAAYAATGG-3') (Manos et al., 1989), which amplified a conserved 450 bp fragment from the L1 gene. Genomic DNA (100 ng) was denatured by heating the reaction to 95  degrees C for 30 s. Annealing of primers was performed at 45  degrees C for 30 s and extension at 72  degrees C for 60 s. The cycle was repeated 30 times. PCR products were electrophoresed in 2 % agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized in a UV transilluminator. Specific amplification of HPV-16 was achieved by using the primers Pr3 (5'-GTCAAAAGCCACTGTGTCCT-3') and Pr4 (5'-CCATCCATTACATCCCGTAC-3'), which amplified a 499 bp fragment covering the HPV-16 E7 gene plus fragments of the E6 and E1 genes. Amplification of HPV-18 was performed using the primers Pr1 (5'-CCGAGCACGACAGGAACGACT-3') and Pr2 (5'-TCGTTTTCTTCCTCTGAGTCGCTT-3'), which amplified a 172 bp fragment including parts of the HPV-18 E6 and E7 genes, as described previously (Karlsen et al., 1996). An internal control to ensure DNA integrity was performed by amplifying the -globin gene using the primers PC03 and PC04 as described previously (Saiki et al., 1986). As a positive control, DNA from SiHa (a cervical cancer-derived cell line containing one to two HPV-16 copies per cell) or HeLa (a cervical cancer-derived cell line positive for the presence of HPV-18) cells was run concurrently with each reaction. Additionally, negative controls to assess the presence of contaminants were carried out using purified water (Gibco-BRL) and PBS instead of template DNA. Patients whose DNA sample could not be amplified were excluded from the study..
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	13	Detection of high- and low-risk HPV types by hybrid capture. The HPV Test Hybrid Capture II kit (Digene) for the detection of high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 68) or low-risk types (6, 11, 42, 43 and 44) was used. DNA (250 to 500 ng in 20  microl) was extracted from cervical tissue and placed in a tube containing 30  microl specimen transport medium. NaOH-based denaturation reagent (25  microl) was added to each sample and the tubes were mixed vigorously and incubated at 65  degrees C for 45 min. Hybridization and hybrid detection were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Carrier DNA and plasmid DNA containing the HPV-16 or HPV-11 genome were used as negative and positive calibrators, respectively, and were run in triplicate with each test. An assay was considered valid only when the results from the negative and positive calibrators showed a coefficient of variation 15 % and the positive : negative calibrator mean values ratio was 2 0. The cut-off value for positivity was calculated for each assay and was defined as the mean relative light units (RLU) value of the positive calibrator. Patients who were positive for both low- and high-risk types were excluded from the study..

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	15	Peptide synthesis. The nonamer peptide IHSMNSTIL was generated by solid-phase synthesis on a multiple peptide automatic synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Synergy Personal Peptide Synthesizer 432A; Perkin Elmer). Repeated cycles of addition of 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-protected amino acids to a polystyrene resin were alternated with an Fmoc deprotection procedure (Gausepohl et al., 1992). After completion of the synthesis, the peptide was cleaved from the resin and the side chain-protective groups removed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid containing 5 % water. Finally, the peptide was analysed by reverse-phase HPLC for amino acid composition and purity. A 75 % pure peptide preparation was lyophilized and dissolved in sterile PBS before use..
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	16	Peptide ELISA. Serum IgG and mucosal IgA antibodies were detected using the 16L1 peptide as the target antigen in a standard ELISA. ELISA plates (Maxisorp; Nalge Nunc) were coated with 500 ng 16L1 peptide per well diluted in sodium carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (0 1 M sodium carbonate, 0 1 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 9 6) at 4  degrees C overnight. Plates were then washed four times with TBS containing 0 1 % Tween 20 (TBS/Tween 20). Non-specific binding sites were blocked with 200  microl 2 % BSA in TBS/Tween 20 for 2 h at 37  degrees C. After washing as described above, 100  microl cervical mucus diluted 1 : 2 or serum diluted 1 : 100 in blocking buffer was added to the plate and further incubated for 2 h at 37  degrees C. After washing, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgA secretory component (Dako), which reacts specifically with free human secretory component and secretory component bound to secretory IgA, or rabbit-anti human IgG (Dako) were diluted 1 : 500 in blocking buffer and 100  microl was added to each well. The plates were incubated for 1 5 h at 37  degrees C. After washing, alkaline phosphatase substrate Sigma 104 (Sigma) was diluted in a 10 % diethanolamine solution (pH 9 8; Sigma) and added to the plates. The absorbance was read at 405 nm in an ELISA plate reader. All samples were tested in triplicate for each antibody class. The assay was considered valid only when the coefficient of variation of the triplicates was 10 %. Additionally, all samples were tested on two wells not coated with peptide to define non-specific reactivity. The final ELISA value was calculated by subtracting the non-specific reactivity mean absorbance from the triplicate mean absorbance. To control for inter-assay variation, positive IgG and IgA controls selected from a previous study (Rocha-Zavaleta et al., 2003) were included in each plate and tested as described. Plates with an inter-assay coefficient of variation  > 10 % were not considered valid. The cut-off value for positivity was calculated on the basis of the distribution of absorbance of the control group and was defined as the mean absorbance+3 SD after exclusion of outliers. The calculated cut-off value for IgG seropositivity was 0 440 and for IgA was 0 237..

To evaluate the differences between the proportions of positive samples in the different groups, data were arranged in the form of two-by-two contingency tables and analysed by Fisher's exact test to calculate the odds ratios (OR), 95 % confidence intervals (CI) and P values. The Wilcoxon signed rank test and Student's t-test were used to compare the mean signal strength (absorbance) of the various groups. All tests were two-tailed and the basic significance level was taken as P=0 05. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and efficiency of the ELISA were calculated using standard medical biostatistical formulae..

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	23	  We first investigated the presence of IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide in serum samples. A small proportion of patients with low-risk HPV-associated LSIL (6 5 %) tested positive for the presence of IgG antibodies. This proportion was similar to the proportion of seropositive individuals in the normal population (P=0 1) (Fig. 1). In contrast, more than 90 % of patients infected with high-risk HPV were positive for the presence of IgG. The difference between this group and the negative controls was highly significant (P < 0 0001). Moreover, the mean signal strength of antibody response in high-risk HPV-associated LSIL patients was 3 7-fold higher than the mean signal strength in control samples. PCR analysis of DNA from high-risk HPV-associated LSIL samples indicated that 60 8 % of patients were infected with HPV-16, while 17 4 % were infected with HPV-18 and 21 6 % with other high-risk types. However, the proportion of seropositive subjects in each group was similar (P > 0 1) (Table 2). This seemed to indicate that most LSIL patients infected by high-risk HPV types produced antibodies that reacted against the 16L1 peptide. Thus, we next addressed the question of whether these antibodies could also be found in patients who had developed a high-risk HPV-associated cervical tumour. Results showed that only 57 7 % of cervical cancer patients had antibodies against the 16L1 peptide. The proportion of seropositive subjects in the cervical cancer group was significantly higher than that observed in the negative controls (P < 0 0001). However, seropositivity in cervical cancer patients was significantly lower than that detected in high-risk HPV-associated LSIL patients (P < 0 0001). This suggested that the presence of viral DNA in cervical cancer patients does not correlate with the presence of IgG antibodies against the peptide. Furthermore, statistical analysis revealed that the proportion of seropositive patients whose tumours were HPV-18 positive was significantly lower than the proportion in patients with HPV-16-associated tumours (P=0 03) (Table 2)..

Thus, we next addressed the significance of the 16L1 peptide-based ELISA for the detection of high-risk HPV infection in LSIL and cervical cancer patients. As shown in Table 3, the 16L1 peptide-based ELISA was able to detect a high proportion (91 6 %) of LSIL patients who were actually infected with high-risk HPV types and produced low levels of false-positive and false-negative results. The probability that an LSIL patient is infected with high-risk HPV types, given a positive ELISA value, was high (positive predictive value=97 7 %). However, the probability of not being infected with high-risk genotypes, given a negative ELISA result, was lower (negative predictive value=87 7 %). The efficiency of the ELISA to detect high-risk HPV infection in LSIL patients was higher than 90 %. In comparison, the ELISA was not quite as sensitive for the detection of high-risk viruses in patients with cervical cancer, having a low negative predictive value (52 7 %) and, as a consequence, a reduced level of efficiency (70 4 %)..

Once more, ELISAs revealed that LSIL patients infected with low-risk HPV genotypes were largely negative for the presence of anti-16L1 peptide antibodies (Fig. 2). In addition, IgA reactivity in the high-risk HPV-associated LSIL population was significantly higher than that observed in the negative-control group and in the low-risk HPV group. HPV-16 is by far the most frequent high-risk HPV type infecting women in Latin America (Bosch et al., 1995). Thus, to determine whether mucosal IgA antibodies against the 16L1 peptide were more prevalent in women infected with HPV-16 than in women infected with any high-risk HPV type, we evaluated the presence of IgA in cervical secretions of HPV-16-associated LSIL patients. As shown in Fig. 2, the proportion of IgA-positive subjects in the HPV-16-infected group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0 0001). However, statistical comparison of the IgA positivity in the high-risk HPV- and HPV-16-associated LSIL groups indicated that the responses were similar in both groups [OR=1 3; 95 % CI=0 8 to 2 1; P=0 09]..

As shown in Table 4, there was no difference in the proportion of women positive for the presence of IgG and IgA in the non-infected group (P=0 4). Interestingly, when all patients diagnosed with LSIL were analysed together, no difference was detected between the IgG and IgA responses (P=0 06). However, separate analysis of LSIL patients infected by low- or high-risk HPV types showed that the proportion of cervical IgA responders was significantly higher than the proportion of IgG seropositives in the group of patients infected by low-risk HPV types. In contrast, in the patients infected with high-risk HPV, the proportion of IgG seropositives was significantly higher than that of cervical IgA positives (P < 0 0001). In this group, the likelihood of presenting circulating IgG antibodies to the 16L1 peptide was six times higher than that of presenting mucosal IgA antibodies against the peptide. This suggested that, during early infection by high-risk HPV genotypes, the antibody response is mediated predominantly by systemic IgG antibodies..

Antibodies against HPV 16L1-derived peptides have been demonstrated previously (Cason et al., 1992; Dillner et al., 1995; LeCann et al., 1995; Sharma et al., 1996). However, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a peptide-based serological assay capable of differentiating low-risk from high-risk HPV infections in LSIL patients. Previously, a conformation-dependent HPV 16L1 epitope was suggested to be an immunodominant site recognized by most human sera following HPV infection (Wang et al., 1997). This site turned out to be a major neutralizing epitope on HPV-16 (White et al., 1999) that seemed to induce an antibody response in more than 75 % of infected patients. Nevertheless, this epitope covers non-contiguous regions of the capsid surface, making its use difficult as a detection reagent for early HPV infection..

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	39	Serological studies, using virus-like particles (VLPs) as antigenic targets, have demonstrated that the majority of women infected with HPV-16 produce an IgG antibody response (Kirnbauer et al., 1994). Here, we found that most women with high-risk HPV type-associated LSIL generated systemic IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide. However, antibodies detected in VLP-based assays are mainly type restricted and directed against conformational epitopes (Christensen et al., 1994, 1996). Therefore, it might be possible that anti-16L1 and anti-VLP antibodies are generated in parallel as a response against infection. To ascertain whether these antibodies co-exist in infected humans, the population studied herein is currently being tested in a VLP-based ELISA..
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	40	It is generally accepted that IgG antibodies against HPV capsid antigens are long lasting (Af Geijersstam et al., 1998; Shah et al., 1997; Carter et al., 2000) and may be a marker of past and current infection. From the information presented in Table 3, it appears that systemic IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide are good indicators of current infection. Nevertheless, we cannot conclude this, because we did not analyse women with a previous history of HPV infection and the number of seropositive patients who were negative for the presence of viral DNA was too small. To ascertain whether antibodies against the 16L1 peptide are markers of prior infection, it will be necessary to test groups of currently non-infected women, who had a previous infection that was either treated successfully or cleared naturally. On the other hand, we observed that a small proportion of patients with LSIL were seronegative, regardless of the presence of HPV DNA. With reference to this, an earlier study of incident HPV infection demonstrated that some women with a persistent HPV infection never seroconverted (Carter et al., 2000). Thus, it is possible that the seronegative patients detected in this work do not produce antibodies against the peptide..
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	41	Here we demonstrated that IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide were detected in sera from most LSIL patients infected with high-risk HPV types and were almost absent in low-risk HPV-associated LSIL and uninfected women. In as much as HPV infection is associated with risk factors such as age and sexual activity (Giuliano et al., 1999), it could be postulated that the apparent cross-reactivity between high-risk HPV types might reflect shared epidemiological risk factors. This is unlikely, because the epidemiological data presented in Table 1 showed that mean values for age, number of sexual partners and pregnancies were similar between high- and low-risk HPV-associated LSIL and even non-infected women. This suggests strongly that the antibodies detected are not associated with these risk factors. Another possibility might be that patients included in the high-risk HPV-associated LSIL group were previously infected with HPV-16. To determine whether previous HPV-16 infection occurred in these women, a study of the presence of HPV-16 DNA in archive tissue samples is warranted..

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	43	A more likely explanation might be that the difference in antibody responses is associated with the level of sequence conservation of the peptide region. This hypothesis is supported by previous work in which antibodies raised against a peptide sequence containing the 16L1 peptide reacted with HPV-16 VLPs but not with HPV-11 VLPs (Heino et al., 1995). The 16L1 peptide is located within the structure of the h2 and h3 -helices of the C-terminal laterally projecting domain of L1 (Chen et al., 2000). They form, together with the h4 helix, the surface of contact with other L1 monomers. Consequently, this site is important for the assembly of viral capsids and is relatively conserved among different HPV types. However, comparison of the corresponding sequences in the high- and low-risk types detected by the hybrid capture test used in this work showed interesting differences. For instance, all five low-risk types differed at three or more amino acid positions from the 16L1 peptide sequence. In contrast, only three of the 12 high-risk types differed at more than three amino acid positions from the 16L1 peptide. Moreover, changes at positions 1, 5 or 8 were found in four of five low-risk types, while only four of 12 high-risk types had these changes..

In an earlier study (Dillner et al., 1990), IgG responses to peptides covering the complete amino acid sequence of the HPV-16 L1 protein were examined in sera from patients with cervical cancer. Interestingly, a peptide region that included the 16L1 peptide sequence was demonstrated to be largely unreactive. This divergence might be attributable to differences in the amino acid sequences. In the work by Dillner et al. (1990), the 16L1 peptide sequence was included as a part of a 20 amino acid peptide, which meant an extension of nine amino acids at the N terminus and one amino acid at the C terminus of the 16L1 peptide. In this respect, there is evidence to indicate that recognition and binding of antibodies to a particular epitope are highly influenced by the extension of a peptide sequence. In fact, extension of a single amino acid can induce a reduction in monoclonal antibody recognition of two to three orders of magnitude (Uray et al., 2003), while an extension of 13 amino acids can result in complete loss of antibody binding (Calderon-Aranda et al., 1999). Therefore, extensions of the 16L1 peptide might account for the lack of response observed in the former report..

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	47	Interestingly, patients with high-risk HPV-associated invasive cervical cancer showed a reduced antibody response against the 16L1 peptide compared with high-risk HPV-associated LSIL. In agreement with our results, previous studies have shown that IgG responses against different L1-derived peptides are significantly prevalent in patients with premalignant lesions (Sharma et al., 1996), but are not associated with cervical cancer (Dillner et al., 1995). Reduction of anti-peptide IgG responses in cervical cancer may be due to a natural decline in antibody titres that occurs over time in infected individuals (Andersson-Ellstrom et al., 1996; Carter et al., 2000), or may be associated with a lack of antigen expression. It is known that transcription of the L1 gene is restricted to terminally differentiated keratinocytes and that the level of cellular differentiation decreases as the grade of neoplasia increases (Stoler et al., 1992). Consequently, the expression of the L1 protein is significantly reduced in advanced lesions associated with high-risk HPV genotypes (Melsheimer et al., 2003). Furthermore, integration of HPV DNA in cervical cancer may cause disruption of the L1 gene (Walboomers  and  Meijer, 1997), affecting the expression of the L1 protein. Indeed, integration of viral DNA occurs more frequently in HPV-18- than in HPV-16-associated tumours. This is consistent with our observation that the prevalence of antibodies was lower in patients with HPV-18- than in patients with HPV-16-associated cervical cancer..

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	6	   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References   Dynamic regulation of the cell surface expression of adhesion molecules is an important mechanism for controlling neuronal growth cone motility and guidance. Clathrin-mediated vesicular internalization of L1 via the tyrosine-based endocytosis motif YRSL regulates adhesion and signaling by this Ig superfamily molecule. Here, we present evidence that tyrosine-1176 (Y1176) of the YRSL motif is phosphorylated in vivo. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (p60src) is implicated in L1-mediated neurite outgrowth, and we find that p60src phosphorylates Y1176 in vitro. Phosphorylation of Y1176 prevents L1 binding to AP-2, an adaptor required for clathrin-mediated internalization of L1. mAb 74-5H7 recognizes the sequence immediately NH2-terminal to the tyrosine-based motif and binds L1 only when Y1176 is dephosphorylated. 74-5H7 identifies a subset of L1 present at points of cell to cell contact and in vesicle-like structures that colocalize with an endocytosis marker. L1 to L1 binding or L1 cross-linking induces a rapid increase in 74-5H7 immunoreactivity. Our data suggest a model in which homophilic binding or L1 cross-linking triggers transient dephosphorylation of the YRSL motif that makes L1 available for endocytosis. Thus, the regulation of L1 endocytosis through dephosphorylation of Y1176 is a critical regulatory point of L1-mediated adhesion and signaling..

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	11	The L1 cytoplasmic domain (L1CD)* is not required for adhesion, but it is needed for regulation of adhesion by signal transduction and internalization. Interestingly, mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of the human L1 gene impair the formation of major axon tracts in neural development (for review see Kamiguchi et al., 1998a). One important function of the L1CD that has been analyzed in detail is the regulation of endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and cell surface distribution of L1. Neuronal L1 differs from L1 found in nonneuronal cells such as Schwann cells and neuroblastoma cell lines in that it contains four amino acids (RSLE) in the cytoplasmic domain encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 28 (Miura et al., 1991). The RSLE stretch immediately follows tyrosine 1176. The composite sequence (YRSLE) forms a tyrosine-based sorting motif that is required for endocytosis of L1 via clathrin-coated pits (Kamiguchi et al., 1998b). Like tyrosine-based sorting signals characterized in other proteins (Ohno et al., 1996), the YRSLE sequence found in L1 serves as a binding site for the  micro2 chain of the clathrin-associated AP-2 complex in vitro, and a number of endocytic machinery components can be coimmunoprecipitated with L1. Furthermore, mutating tyrosine 1176 (Y1176) or removing the RSLE exon also prevents L1 from interacting with AP-2, and consequently prevents clathrin-mediated endocytosis of L1 (Kamiguchi et al., 1998b). In dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons growing on an L1-Fc substrate, clathrin-mediated endocytosis of L1 occurs preferentially at the rear of growth cones, suggesting local regulation of L1 endocytosis and that its recycling may be important in growth cone motility (Kamiguchi and Lemmon, 2000). Indeed, blocking AP-2 to mediated internalization of L1 inhibits L1-based neurite growth in part by disrupting a gradient of L1 adhesivity from the growth cone periphery to the central domain (Kamiguchi and Yoshihara, 2001). Finally, the neuronal form of L1 (with YRSLE) is significantly less adhesive than the nonneuronal form due to its more rapid internalization and shorter dwell time on the cell surface (Long et al., 2001)..

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	13	Phosphorylation is likely to play a critical role in regulating L1-mediated processes such as neurite outgrowth (Atashi et al., 1992). L1 is phosphorylated on both serine and tyrosine residues in cultured neurons, and clustering of L1 on cultured cells with cross-linking antibodies can trigger changes in both kinase and phosphatase activity (Klinz et al., 1995; Schaefer et al., 1999), as well as in the phosphorylation state of L1 (Zisch et al., 1995; Kunz et al., 1996). Several kinase activities coimmunoprecipitate with L1. We have identified three L1-associated kinases, CKII, p90rsk, and ERK2, that can phosphorylate certain serine residues in the L1CD in vitro (Wong et al., 1996a,b; Schaefer et al., 1999). Inhibition of p90rsk phosphorylation of L1 impairs DRG neurite outgrowth on L1 but not on laminin substrates. Furthermore, activation of the MAP kinase cascade, which includes p90rsk and ERK2, requires L1 endocytosis. Tyrosine kinases, such as p60src and FGF receptor, have also been implicated in L1 signaling (Ignelzi et al., 1994; Doherty and Walsh, 1996), and the receptor tyrosine kinase, EphB2, is capable of phosphorylating L1 (Zisch et al., 1997). Tyrosine phosphorylation may regulate associations between L1 and the cytoskeleton. For example, both L1 and the L1 family members neurofascin and NrCAM associate with the membrane cytoskeleton protein ankyrin, and phosphorylation of a tyrosine within the ankyrin binding site of neurofascin, which is conserved in L1, disrupts this association (Tuvia et al., 1997)..

The 74-5H7 epitope is regulated by phosphorylation of L1 and maps to the region immediately preceding the tyrosine-based sorting motif. In vitro studies show that phosphorylation within the epitope prevents recognition by 74-5H7 and also binding of AP-2 to L1. We have identified the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase p60src as an L1-phosphorylating kinase that preferentially phosphorylates Y1176 of the tyrosine-based sorting motif in vitro. Cell to cell contact is able to induce changes in the phosphorylation state of L1 that is recognized by 74-5H7.

When mAb 74-5H7 was used for immunocytochemistry, however, we were surprised to find that immunoreactivity (IR) was concentrated at points of contact between DRG neuron cell bodies in culture (Fig. 1, A to C). Previous characterization of 74-5H7 indicated that it recognizes L1 exclusively on Western blots of whole brain extracts and can immunoprecipitate mammalian and chick L1 (Lemmon et al., 1989). It does not bind to Western blots of membranes of L1 knockout mice, demonstrating that it does not cross react with other L1 subfamily members (unpublished data). The 74-5H7 recognizes the 200 to 220-kD full-length L1, as well as the 85-kD carboxy-terminal portion including the cytoplasmic tail, and it does not bind to live neurons. Therefore, the mAb epitope is likely to reside near or within the L1 cytoplasmic domain. The immunolabeling pattern in cultured neurons suggests the mAb epitope is not present or not accessible in the majority of cell surface L1, but is exposed or induced in L1 when clustered and engaged with its binding partners at points of cell to cell contact. This implies that cell to cell contact induces changes in the cytoplasmic domain of L1 that can be visualized with this mAb..

In growth cones of DRG neurons extending on an L1-Fc substrate, 74-5H7-IR revealed a vesicle-like distribution that was predominately restricted to lamellipodial and central domains of the growth cones rather than filopodia (Fig. 1 D). It was also in axon shafts. In contrast, immunolabeling with a rabbit anti-L1 antibody (8D9) showed that total L1 was distributed along the entire surface of the growth cone and axon shaft with strong labeling extending into the filopodia tips (Fig. 1 E). Measurement of the size of the 74-5H7-IR vesicle-like structures using the image analysis software of the confocal microscope revealed that they were  < 0.3  microm in radius, which is consistent with the size of clathrin coated vesicles. Our detailed analysis of the pattern of 74-5H7-IR, in conjunction with our earlier report showing that 74-5H7-IR can colocalize at the rear of growth cones with the endocytosis marker protein Eps15 (Kamiguchi et al., 1998b), indicates that 74-5H7 recognizes a subset of L1 that is in vesicle-like structures and on the cell surface at points of cell to cell contact. Therefore, expression of the 74-5H7 epitope correlates with a functional state of L1 that occurs when L1 is engaged in adhesion at the cell surface and during trafficking..

First, we synthesized two peptides spanning the first 33 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain and asked whether 74-5H7 recognized either on dot blots. Our analysis indicates that 74-5H7 recognizes a 14 amino acid peptide, SEARPMKDETFGEY (residues 1163 to 1176; Fig. 2 B), but not the peptide, KRSKGGKYSVKDKEDTQVDS (residues 1144 to 1163), consisting of the first 20 amino acids of the L1CD. We then used synthetic peptides with alanine scanning substitutions through the 14 amino acid peptide to determine which residues are essential for recognition by 74-5H7. This analysis identified five amino acids, SEARPMKDETFGEY (underlined) that when individually changed to alanine, abolish 74-5H7 binding (Fig. 2 C). Although only these five amino acids were identified as critical for 74-5H7 binding, we were unable to detect binding to peptides shorter than the SEARPMKDETFGEY sequence, suggesting there may be structural contributions to the epitope from other residues (unpublished data). The SEARPMKDETFGEY peptide also competed with purified L1 for 74-5H7 binding, confirming the importance of this sequence for mAb recognition of L1 (Fig. 2 D, lane 2).

However, phosphothreonine has never been reported in L1 (for review see Schaefer et al., 1999)..
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	30	p60src phosphorylates the L1CD Although phosphorylation of both threonine 1172 and Y1176 disrupt the 74-5H7 epitope, phosphorylation of threonine residues in L1 has not been reported either in vitro or in vivo (Salton et al., 1983; Faissner et al., 1985; Linnemann et al., 1988; Sadoul et al., 1989; Kunz et al., 1996; Wong et al., 1996a,b; Zisch et al., 1997). In contrast, at least two reports indicate that L1 is tyrosine phosphorylated in vivo (Heiland et al., 1996; Zisch et al., 1997). Therefore, we were interested in determining which kinase(s) can phosphorylate L1 on Y1176. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase p60src has been implicated in L1 function (Ignelzi et al., 1994). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the CTLA-4 T-lymphocyte receptor endocytosis motif by src family kinases is implicated in regulation of its cell surface expression (Bradshaw et al., 1997). To determine if L1 could be a substrate for p60src, we tested the ability of purified p60src to phosphorylate recombinant L1CD in vitro, and found that L1 is phosphorylated by this kinase (Fig. 3 A). The phosphorylated L1CD was digested with endoproteinase Asp-N, and the resulting fragments were separated by reverse phase HPLC. One major peptide, DETFGEYRSLES, was identified associated with radioactivity. The site of phosphorylation of this peptide was determined to be the seventh residue by assessing the elution of radioactivity using covalent sequencing supports to allow tracking of the radiolabeled residue(s); this corresponds to Y1176. Phosphorylated peptide fragments containing the other three tyrosines present within the L1CD did not coelute with radioactivity, indicating that p60src preferentially phosphorylates Y1176, an amino acid residue that plays a critical role in regulating L1 trafficking and endocytosis..

To demonstrate that Y1176 was, indeed, phosphorylated in vivo, we produced a new Ra-pYRSLE antibody.

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	35	To support the idea that phosphorylation of the Y1176 was responsible for regulating the 74-5H7 epitope in vivo, fresh chick brains were homogenized in the presence and absence of a cocktail of tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (0.1 mM ammonium molybdate, 0.2 mM phenyl arsine oxide, 5 nM microcystin, and 100 pM cypermethrin, 10 mM pervanadate; Tonks et al., 1988). The anti-pY antibody recognized two very prominent bands in the brain extract that were not L1 but served as indicators for the effectiveness of the phosphatase inhibitors. When the inhibitors were absent, a strong signal for the 74-5H7 epitope was seen, whereas the anti-pY antibody gave a relatively weak signal (Fig. 4, lane A). Alternatively, when the inhibitors were present, the 74-5H7-IR was relatively weak but the pY-IR was strong (Fig. 4, lane B). The simplest interpretation of this data is that the phosphatase inhibitors prevent dephosphorylation of Y1176 on L1 and thereby block 74-5H7 binding..

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	38	  Phosphorylation of L1 Y1176 inhibits L1 binding to AP-2 We have shown previously, using an in vitro peptide competition assay, that the peptide FGEYRSLESDNEE blocks binding of a biotin-labeled TGN38 peptide to AP-2 purified from rat brain (Kamiguchi et al., 1998b). This, and other data, showed that the YRSLE sequence mediates L1 binding to AP-2 (Kamiguchi et al., 1998b). It is known that phosphorylation of a tyrosine in the tyrosine-based sorting motif of CTLA-4 can inhibit binding to AP-2 and, as a result, can inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the CTLA-4 (Shiratori et al., 1997). To test this for L1, we compared the ability of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated L1 peptides to compete with a peptide spanning the TGN38 tyrosine-based sorting motif for binding to AP-2 (Fig. 5). The FGEpYRSLESDNEE peptide phosphorylated on Y1176 failed to block the interaction between TGN38 peptide and AP-2, indicating that L1 phosphorylated at Y1176 cannot bind to AP-2. In contrast, phosphorylation of S1181, which we have shown is the residue phosphorylated by CKII (Wong et al., 1996b), gave a peptide that retained its ability to block TGN38 binding to AP-2, demonstrating that CKII phosphorylation of L1 would not inhibit binding to AP-2..

Therefore, to ask whether the increase in 74-5H7-IR can be induced specifically by L1 to L1 interactions, we used stable lines of myeloma cells transfected to express L1. These cells are normally nonadhesive, but form L1-dependent aggregates when they express L1 (Wong et al., 1995). Immunocytochemistry of myeloma cells expressing full-length L1 shows 74-5H7-IR localized to regions of cell to cell contact (Fig. 7 A), whereas labeling L1 with a polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant L1CD shows a more uniform cell surface distribution for L1 (Fig. 7 B). Colocalization of the two antibodies is shown in yellow at the cell to cell contact site (Fig. 7 C).

Cross-linking L1 with antibodies has been shown to induce changes in a number of intracellular second messengers including Ca2+, IP2, and IP3 (von Bohlen und Halbach et al., 1992), as well as to activate the MAPK signaling cascade (Schaefer et al., 1999) and phosphatase(s) (Klinz et al., 1995). In addition, cross-linking L1 or the L1 heterophilic binding partners, axonin-1 and F3/F11, can also regulate the phosphorylation state of L1 (Zisch et al., 1995; Kunz et al., 1996). 74-5H7-IR was observed at points of cell to cell contact in cultured neurons without L1 antibody cross-linking (Fig. 9 B). 74-5H7-IR was dramatically up-regulated by cross-linking L1 on DRG neurons in culture with polyclonal anti-L1 antibodies (8D9) (Fig. 9 C) as compared with isolated neurons without L1 antibody cross-linking (Fig. 9 A).

This regulation of L1 internalization provides a means to control adhesion and facilitate growth cone movement. Our present studies depend in large measure on mAb 74-5H7. Several lines of evidence showed that this antibody binds to a subset of L1 and binding to L1 is negatively regulated by phosphorylation. First, several epitope mapping experiments demonstrate that 74-5H7 recognizes the sequence SEARPMKDETFGEY, and that phosphorylation of Y1176 inhibits recognition. Second, L1 purified from brain extract in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors has weak 74-5H7-IR, whereas L1 purified in the absence of inhibitors shows stronger 74-5H7-IR. We showed that the L1CD could be phosphorylated by src on Y1176 and that an antibody specific for pYRSLE showed that the corresponding epitope on L1 was present in brain. Immunohistochemical studies of growth cones with 74-5H7 revealed that this form of L1 is restricted, being absent from filopodia and concentrated in vesicle-like structures. Finally, experiments using neurons and L1 expressing myelomas showed that cell contact or antibody cross-linking of L1 caused significant but transient changes in the phosphorylation state of L1 on Y1176. Together, these data show that L1 mediated contact causes an outside-in signal that alters the phosphorylation state of L1 and this, in turn, alters L1 internalization and adhesion, a form of inside-out signaling..

Second, L1 purified from brain extract in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors has weak 74-5H7-IR, whereas L1 purified in the absence of inhibitors shows stronger 74-5H7-IR. We showed that the L1CD could be phosphorylated by src on Y1176 and that an antibody specific for pYRSLE showed that the corresponding epitope on L1 was present in brain. Immunohistochemical studies of growth cones with 74-5H7 revealed that this form of L1 is restricted, being absent from filopodia and concentrated in vesicle-like structures. Finally, experiments using neurons and L1 expressing myelomas showed that cell contact or antibody cross-linking of L1 caused significant but transient changes in the phosphorylation state of L1 on Y1176. Together, these data show that L1 mediated contact causes an outside-in signal that alters the phosphorylation state of L1 and this, in turn, alters L1 internalization and adhesion, a form of inside-out signaling..

Although the complete SEARPMKDETFGEY sequence is not conserved in other vertebrate L1 homologues, acidic residues NH2-terminal to Y1176 and a hydrophobic residue at the Y-3 position are conserved not just in direct L1 homologues, but also in the L1 family members Nr-CAM and neurofascin (Hortsch, 1996). Previous data implicate p60 src in L1 function, because src-/- neurons extend poorly on L1 substrates, suggesting their response to L1 is impaired (Ignelzi et al., 1994). Our finding that p60src can phosphorylate Y1176 provides potential mechanistic insight into this phenotype. We suggest that L1 in src-/- neurons grown on L1 may be relatively hypophosphorylated at Y1176. This could alter the regulation of L1 endocytosis; disruption of L1 trafficking could in turn impair neurite outgrowth on L1. Suter and Forscher (2001) recently showed that p60src activity could be involved in a positive feedback loop strengthening CAM interactions with their cytoskeletal linkages. Our data support a similar role for p60src in which it could phosphorylate L1 under certain conditions, thereby inhibiting internalization and increasing adhesion..

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	61	The 74-5H7 epitope is adjacent to the tyrosine-based motif, Yxx ( is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid) in the L1CD that mediates L1 endocytosis (Kamiguchi et al., 1998b). Studies of tyrosine-based sorting motifs in other proteins indicate that the tyrosine has to be in a nonphosphorylated state for the signals to be active in sorting and endocytosis; i.e., phosphorylation of the tyrosine prevents binding of adaptin proteins to the motif (Boll et al., 1996; Ohno et al., 1996). Indeed, our in vitro peptide competition experiments using peptides derived from L1 show that a Y1176-phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the potential p60src phosphorylation site, FGEpYRSLESDNEE, is no longer able to bind the  micro2 chain of AP-2, whereas a serine 1181-phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the CKII phosphorylation site, FGEYRSLEpSDNEE, retains its capacity to associate with  micro2. It is highly unlikely that T1172 influences L1 to AP-2 interactions because there is no evidence suggesting it is phosphorylated, and extensive studies show that the fourth residue in the amino-terminal direction does not influence  micro2 binding to tyrosine-based sorting motifs (Boll et al., 1996). Our results show that the 74-5H7-IR is inhibited by phosphorylation of Y1176 and that src family kinases may mediate this. Similarly, clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the T lymphocyte receptor, CTLA-4, has been shown to be negatively regulated by phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine in the endocytosis motif (Bradshaw et al., 1997; Shiratori et al., 1997) and this is likely by src family kinases (Miyatake et al., 1998). Overall, our results imply that only L1 that can bind 74-5H7 is capable of interacting with the clathrin-mediated endocytic machinery. This is consistent with the finding that in growth cones growing on L1 substrates, 74-5H7-IR is at the rear of growth cones, where L1 is internalized and colocalizes with Eps15, a marker for clathrin-coated pits (Kamiguchi et al., 1998b). We have shown previously that inhibition of L1 endocytosis dramatically increases L1-mediated adhesion (Long et al., 2001). L1 at the rear of growth cones growing on L1 is less adhesive than L1 at the front of the growth cones, but this differential is not observed on growth cones growing on N-cadherin (Kamiguchi and Yoshihara, 2001). Therefore, phosphorylation of Y1176 provides a rapid but reversible means of increasing L1-mediated adhesion..
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	62	The hypothesis that the 74-5H7 epitope is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation implies the involvement of L1 phosphatases in its regulation and is consistent with early results that show that cross-linking L1 activates tyrosine and serine phosphatases (Klinz et al., 1995). A number of potential candidate phosphatases exist. These include phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) that prefer substrates containing acidic residues NH2-terminal to the phosphotyrosine such as PTP1B, and rat brain PTP1 (for review see Zhou and Cantley, 1995). Another candidate is the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase ss because of its ability to bind heterophilically with L1 family CAMs. The phosphatase may also be coexpressed in some of the same cell types as L1 (Peles et al., 1998). It has been suggested that acidic residues NH2-terminal to the phosphotyrosine residue are a hallmark for targeted dephosphorylation (Pinna and Ruzzene, 1996) and that the number, nature, and position of the acidic residues may create consensus sequences that are recognized selectively by individual PTPases (Pinna and Donella-Deana, 1994)..
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	63	The simplest interpretation of our biochemical analysis of the 74-5H7 epitope is that unengaged L1 is phosphorylated on Y1176, and that Y1176 becomes dephosphorylated subsequent to L1 ligand binding. Dephosphorylation allows interaction with AP-2 and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this paradigm, the time course of 74-5H7-IR observed in the cell pelleting experiments could reflect internalization and subsequent recycling (and rephosphorylation) of L1. Our immunohistochemical observations of the distribution of 74-5H7-IR suggest the situation is more complex, however, and that L1 to L1 binding does not always induce L1 endocytosis. First, L1 can mediate stable axon fasciculation, suggesting it is not invariably endocytosed at points of L1 to L1 binding. Second, although growing DRG neurons on L1 increases L1 internalization and subsequent recycling (Kamiguchi and Lemmon, 2000; Kamiguchi and Yoshihara, 2001), endocytosis of L1 occurs preferentially at the rear of the growth cone. 74-5H7-IR is colocalized with vesicle-like structures in these neurons, rather than just at points of contact between the growth cone and the L1-Fc substrate (Kamiguchi et al., 1998b). These observations suggest that dephosphorylation of Y1176 and L1 endocytosis in growth cones are not regulated solely by L1 to L1 binding, but also by restricted localization of the dephosphorylation machinery. We cannot rule out the possibility that, in vivo, the 74-5H7 epitope in some L1 is masked by interactions with other proteins, such as cytoskeletal components (Brophy, 2001). Thus, although 74-5H7 clearly identifies a subset of L1 in cells that are dephosphorylated at Y1176, there may be other populations of L1 that are dephosphorylated at Y1176, but not accessible to the antibody and thus not visualized in immunocytochemical experiments..

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	65	In summary, we have used 74-5H7 to show that L1 is dephosphorylated at Y1176 where L1 is internalized and trafficking in growth cones. We have also shown that the phosphorylation state of Y1176 determines whether L1 can interact with the clathrin internalization machinery. A variety of experiments showed that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation state of L1 is regulated by cell contact and restricted to specific sites in neurons. The phosphorylation of the L1CD on Y1176 by p60src that is important for L1-mediated neurite outgrowth raises the possibility that the regulation of L1 internalization by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation represents a critical regulatory point for L1. The ability of L1 to L1 adhesion to influence its endocytosis is reminiscent of how other surfaces can influence integrin expression on neurites (Condic and Letourneau, 1997). In Aplysia, the distribution of apCAM, an IgSF CAM member, is acutely regulated by endocytosis during learning-induced synaptic remodeling (Bailey et al., 1992), whereas in Drosophila, changing the distribution of another IgSF member, fasciclin II, alters synapse size (Schuster et al., 1996). It appears that regulated endocytosis may be a general mechanism underlying CAM functions in dynamic processes such as cell migration, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic plasticity..

The peptides included FGEYRSLESDNEE, which corresponds to amino acids 1173 to 1185 of the L1CD, and two phosphopeptides, FGEpYRSLESDNEE and FGEYRSLEpSDNEE. After allowing the mixtures to incubate in the dark, they were cross-linked with UV. The samples were then run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with streptavidin-conjugated HRP (Boehringer). The labeled bands were detected via chemiluminescence..

Paradoxically, little is known about the route taken by retroviruses to reach the nucleus at the early stages of infection. To get insight into this stage of virus replication, we have studied the trafficking of foamy retroviruses and have previously shown that incoming viral proteins reach the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) prior to nuclear translocation of the viral genome. Here, we show that incoming viruses concentrate around the MTOC as free and structured capsids. Interestingly, the Gag protein, the scaffold component of viral capsids, targets the pericentrosomal region in transfected cells in the absence of any other viral components but in a microtubule- and dynein/dynactin-dependent manner. Trafficking of Gag towards the centrosome requires a minimal 30 amino acid coiled-coil motif in the N-terminus of the molecule. Finally, we describe a direct interaction between Gag and dynein light chain 8 that probably accounts for the specific routing of the incoming capsids to the centrosome prior to nuclear import of the viral genome..

0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	6	   Introduction Top Summary Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   After penetration into the host cell, pathogens have to reach their sites of replication. To facilitate their spread within the infected cells, viruses have evolved many specific mechanisms to hijack the cellular cytoskeleton (Ploubidou and Way, 2001). For example, microtubules (MTs) are essential for the herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Sodeik et al., 1997), adenovirus (Suomalainen et al., 1999) and vaccinia virus (VV) (Ploubidou et al., 2000) to reach the nuclei of the infected cells. VV is unique because it sequentially exploits the MT network for its intracellular movement (Rietdorf et al., 2001; Ward and Moss, 2001) and the actin cytoskeleton to enhance its cell-to-cell spread (Geada et al., 2001; Hollinshead et al., 2001). Intracellular VV particles are propelled on actin tails those formation is induced by the virus itself, which mimics the cellular receptor tyrosine kinase signaling cascades that normally occur for actin polymerization at the plasma membrane (Frischknecht et al., 1999; Frischknecht and Way, 2001; Moreau et al., 2000), a situation already reported for intracellular movements of Listeria and Shigella (reviewed in Frischknecht and Way, 2001). In the case of the murine leukemia virus (MuLV), an interaction between the Gag protein, the scaffold component of retroviral capsids, and KIF4, a microtubule plus-end directed motor, is needed for trafficking towards the plasma membrane during the late step of infection (Tang et al., 1999). However, despite our growing knowledge of host-virus interactions, little is known about how retroviruses are transported from the periphery to the center of the cell during the early stages of infection. Gaining better insight into the mechanism by which retroviruses move within the infected cells might improve retrovirus-based gene therapy and might allow the design of new therapeutic approaches against retroviral pathogens..

Although surface Env glycoproteins are needed to enter target cells, interaction and subsequent self-multimerization of Gag molecules lead to capsid formation (Eastman and Linial, 2001; Tobaly-Tapiero et al., 2001). Several functional regions were identified along the scaffold Gag protein. There are three glycine(G)/arginine(R)-rich sequences, the so-called GR boxes, in the C-terminus that are implicated in viral nucleic acid binding and harbor a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (Schliephake and Rethwilm, 1994; Yu et al., 1996), a 18 amino acid motif (amino acids 43-60) resembling the cytoplasmic targeting and retention signal (CTRS) of type D retroviruses that allows cytoplasmic targeting of Gag (Eastman and Linial, 2001) and, finally, a coiled-coil domain (amino acids 130-160) that is necessary for Gag-Gag interaction (Tobaly-Tapiero et al., 2001). The last two motifs are required for capsid assembly. Although compelling studies have demonstrated the requirement for Gag in the late steps of infection (i.e. packaging of genomic RNA or virus egress), little is known about its role during the early steps of virus cycle..

0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	10	We have previously shown that incoming human foamy virus (HFV), the prototype of FVs, targets the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) prior to nuclear translocation. Centrosomal targeting of incoming viral proteins and subsequent viral replication were inhibited by a treatment with nocodazole, demonstrating the involvement of the MT network in FV replication (Saib et al., 1997). However, the precise status of the viral material at the MTOC and the mechanism of transport towards this organelle were unknown. Here, we show that incoming HFV reaches the MTOC as naked and structured capsids. Remarkably, the Gag protein by itself harbors the determinant to target the MTOC, requiring a domain of 30 amino acids predicted to fold into a coiled coil. Transport of Gag to the MTOC necessitates the retrograde, MT-dependent, dynein/dynactin motor because it is prevented by overexpression of the central coiled-coil domain (CC1) of p150Glued, the dynactin sidearm subunit. Finally, a direct interaction between HFV Gag and the cytoplasmic light chain of the dynein LC8 was described, identifying a molecular basis of retroviral transport in infected cells during the early steps of infection..

The full-length green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Gag expression plasmid (pGFP-Gag) was generated by inserting the PCR product of the Gag open reading frame into the BamHI/HindIII sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Mutants M1 to M8 (except M7) were derived from the pGFP-Gag plasmid following either digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes or by the QuickChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence encoding the first 200 amino acids of Gag was amplified by PCR and inserted into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of the pEGFPN1 vector (Clontech), leading to the M7 mutant. The infectious clone harboring the L171G mutation in the Gag open reading frame (ORF) was obtained by subcloning the 2884 bp EagI-SwaI fragment of pHFV13 (generated by PCR) into the pGEM-T vector (Promega).

Moreover, we reported that, as early as 5 hours after infection, most of incoming Gag antigens concentrated around the MTOC (Saib et al., 1997). However, it was unknown whether Gag is transported to the centrosome as free assembled capsids or as unstructured aggregates (as is the case for other retroviruses; McDonald et al., 2002). To deal with this issue, permissive BHK21 cells were infected with HFV at a low (1) and a high (10) multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.), fixed 5 hours later and analysed by electron microscopy (EM). As shown in Fig. 1, incoming viruses were mainly detected as naked and intact capsids of 50 nm diameter near the MTOC, close to MTs. Analysis of a dozen EM thin sections of infected cells revealed an average of 20 capsids per section around the MTOC at low m.o.i. and an average of 600 capsids per section at high m.o.i. Viral capsids were never observed in the nucleus or close to nuclear pores..

For that purpose, a full-length Gag expression vector (pSG-Gag) was transfected into Cos6 cells and Gag localization was followed by confocal microscopy using polyclonal anti-Gag antibodies. 20 hours after transfection, Gag was mainly detected as a unique cytoplasmic dot, close to the nucleus (Fig. 2, left). Double labeling using a mAb (clone CTR910) directed against a centriolar component confirmed that this staining corresponds to the accumulation of Gag molecules around the centrosome (Fig. 2, left). Expression of other structural (Pol and Env) or regulatory (Tas and Bet) viral proteins never leads to a centrosomal staining (data not shown)..

Aggresome formation induces a striking redistribution of the intermediate filament protein vimentin into a characteristic halo-like cage around aggregates of proteins (Kopito, 2000). To determine whether accumulation of Gag around the MTOC corresponded to the formation of an aggresome owing to a high level of Gag expression in transfected cells, Cos6 cells transfected with pSG-Gag were labeled with both anti-Gag and anti-vimentin antibodies. As shown by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2, right), the vimentin network is not affected in Gag-expressing cells, demonstrating that accumulation of Gag around the MTOC does not lead to the formation of an aggresome..

0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	32	Mapping of the minimal Gag sequence involved in MTOC targeting Several functional domains have been already mapped along the HFV Gag protein. To determine whether these domains (the C-terminal GR boxes and the two recently characterized N-terminal regions responsible for Gag self-assembly) are involved in MTOC targeting, the subcellular localization of a full-length GFP-Gag fusion protein and of deletion mutants was investigated (Fig. 3A). Cos6 cells were transfected with these constructs and the GFP fluorescence was directly observed 20 hours after transfection, following cell fixation. Although GFP alone diffusely localizes in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of transfected cells, and never accumulates around the MTOC (data not shown), fusion of GFP to the full-length Gag targets the fusion protein to the centrosome (Fig. 3C). Serial deletions of the C-terminus of Gag, up to residue 270 (mutant M1), do not impair MTOC targeting of the corresponding GFP-Gag fusions. Deletion of amino acids 180-200 (mutant M3) or 200-250 (mutant M4) has no effect on MTOC targeting, whereas deletion of amino acids 165-180 (mutant M5) totally abolishes centrosomal targeting. Finally, GFP-Gag150-250 (mutant M2) is present around this organelle. Taken together, these results suggest that the domain implicated in MTOC targeting encompasses amino acids 150-180. This conclusion is, however, clouded by the fact that the M6 mutant encoding for GFP-Gag1-201 is no longer detected at the centrosome. To assess whether the absence of MTOC targeting of mutant M6 is due to inadequate positioning of the putative implicated domain regarding the entire fusion protein, the first 200 amino acids of Gag were fused to the N-terminus of GFP and transfected in Cos6 cells. In that case, the fusion protein Gag1-200-GFP (mutant M7) was detected at the centrosome, suggesting that the domain involved in MTOC targeting must be flanked with minimal amino acid sequences at both sides to be functional. Taken together, these results indicate that proper centrosomal targeting does not require the presence of the GR boxes or the domains involved in capsid assembly, but necessitates the sequence between amino acids 150 and 180. All constructions were controlled by sequence analysis and protein expression was verified by western blot (Fig. 3B)..

0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	35	It is noteworthy that the N-terminus of HFV Gag harbors three putative coiled-coil motifs as revealed by the COILS program (Tobaly-Tapiero et al., 2001). We have previously shown that the coiled-coil motif located between amino acids 130 and 160 is crucial for Gag-Gag interaction (Tobaly-Tapiero et al., 2001). Interestingly, the second coiled-coil encompassing amino acids 160-180 strikingly matches the domain required in MTOC targeting identified here. To assess whether this motif is involved in centriolar targeting, we have generated a GFP-Gag fusion harboring a mutation at position 171 exchanging a crucial leucine into a glycine, disrupting the coiled-coil motif (mutant M8). As shown in Fig. 3C, this mutant is no longer able to reach the centrosome in transfected Cos6 cells..

The motor activity can be dislodged from the cargo by overexpression of p50/dynamitin, a component of the dynactin complex, disrupting their association (Burkhardt et al., 1997). This approach is widely used to demonstrate the involvement of the dynein-dynactin complex in the movement of viruses (Alonso et al., 2001; Dohner et al., 2002; Sodeik et al., 1997; Suomalainen et al., 1999). However, whereas dynamitin overexpression was reported to have no other effect on the cytoskeleton in HeLa cells (Burkhardt et al., 1997), it might affect MT organization and centrosome integrity in Cos cells (Quintyne et al., 1999). Interestingly, it has been shown that overexpression of the central coiled-coil domain (CC1) of p150Glued, the dynactin sidearm subunit, has a more specific inhibitory effect on dynein-based transport than does p50/dynamitin (Quintyne et al., 1999). Thus, in our assays, HeLa cells and a CC1-expressing vector were used instead of Cos6 cells and p50/dynamitin. As shown in Fig. 4A, overexpression of DsRed-CC1 did not affect the MT network, confirming previous studies. However, the presence of CC1 prevented MTOC targeting of Gag in co-transfected HeLa cells, whereas Gag was still associated with this organelle in cells transfected with empty DS-Red vector. These observations demonstrate that targeting of Gag to the MTOC requires the dynein-dynactin retrograde motor. In all these experiments, we only analysed cells that contained evenly distributed recombinant proteins, avoiding those (10% of the transfected cells) that harbored large protein aggregates already reported when using DsRed expressing vectors..

For lyssaviruses, a specific interaction has been demonstrated between the dynein light chain 8 (LC8) and the P phosphoprotein, a component of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex, providing a molecular basis for the axonal transport of these neurotropic viruses (Jacob et al., 2000; Raux et al., 2000). To assess whether HFV Gag could interact with LC8, we first examined their subcellular distribution in co-transfected cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that between 87% and 98% of Gag localized with GFP-LC8 at the MTOC, depending on the experiment analysed (Fig. 5A), consistent with a possible interaction between the molecules, whereas GFP-LC8 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm when expressed alone (Fig. 5A) (Alonso et al., 2001; Jacob et al., 2000)..

By contrast, LC8Flag was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibodies in the corresponding transfected cells following metabolic labeling. These immune complexes were subsequently analysed by western blot using anti-Gag antibodies, revealing the presence of Gag575 in cells co-transfected with pLC8Flag and pSG-Gag575, whereas no signal was detected in cells expressing Gag575L171G and LC8Flag (Fig. 6B). Similarly, following the same procedure, an interaction with LC8 was detected when using the M2 mutant encoding GFP-Gag150-250, whereas no interaction was observed in cells co-transfected with a vector encoding GFP-Gag deleted from amino acids 144-277 (mutant M9), which lacks the domain required to target the MTOC..

Cos6 were transfected with the wild-type pHFV13, pHFVGagL171G harboring the L171G mutation in the Gag ORF, pSG-Gag or pCgp9 (a vector encoding for only HFV Gag and Pol viral proteins); 72 hours later, viral protein expression in transfected cells and virus production in culture supernatants were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 7, in cell extracts both proviral clones express similar levels of Gag molecules, which are detected as a doublet of 71 kDa and 68 kDa by polyclonal anti-Gag antibodies, demonstrating that the L171G point mutation has no effect on Gag expression, stability and maturation. Indeed, the 71 kDa band corresponds to the full-length Gag precursor (p71), as visualized in pSG-Gag transfected cells, whereas the 68 kDa product represents its main cleavage product (p68), mirroring the presence of an active viral protease (Giron et al., 1997). To assess whether the Gag mutation affected virus egress, supernatants from transfected cells were ultracentrifuged on a sucrose gradient and the resulting pellets, which contained extracellular virions were analysed by western blot using polyclonal anti-Gag antibodies. In that case, no major difference was observed between pHFV13 and pHFVGagL171G, demonstrating that virus egress was not impaired by this helix-breaking point mutation in Gag.

Direct fluorescence observed 48 hours after infection reveals a significant virus production from pHFV13 transfected cells (9x104 FCFU ml to 1), whereas the Gag mutation dramatically reduced infectivity of the corresponding provirus but did not totally abolished it (6.2x103 FCFU ml to 1).

0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	53	By EM, we show here that incoming HFV proteins concentrate in the pericentrosomal region as free and structured capsids close to MTs. More viral capsids surround the MTOC than expected from the multiplicity of infection used. Indeed, most extracellular retroviral particles produced during an infection harbor a defective genome and are therefore unable to transactivate the viral LTR of GFP-indicator cells (Tobaly-Tapiero et al., 2001). In the case of HIV-1, it has been reported that infectivity to particle ratio is as low as 1 in 60,000 (Kimpton and Emerman, 1992; Piatak et al., 1993), whereas a more recent study softened this conclusion by showing a ratio up to 1 infectious particle in 10 (Andreadis et al., 2000). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the determinants required to reach the pericentrosomal area are harbored by the scaffold component of viral capsids, the structural Gag protein, because this protein alone targets the centrosome in transfected cells in the absence of other viral partners..

However, similar to the formation of this inclusion body (Garcia-Mata et al., 1999), Gag transport towards the MTOC involves the retrograde dynein-dynactin motor, because it is prevented by overproduction of CC1, the central coiled-coil domain of p150Glued, reported to disrupt the function of this retrograde motor. Other viruses have been shown to use the MT network for their intracellular transport. For instance, adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) and HSV, two nuclear replicative DNA viruses entering the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis and direct membrane fusion respectively, are transported as naked capsids towards the nucleus via the MT network (Sodeik et al., 1997; Soll, 1997). For ASFV and rabies viruses, two other viruses that use the MT network to move within the infected cell, an interaction with LC8 forms a molecular basis of this trafficking (Alonso et al., 2001; Jacob et al., 2000; Raux et al., 2000). The interaction between LC8 and HFV Gag described here could play such a role in the case of FVs..

Since then, this evolutionarily conserved molecule has been shown to interact with many cellular complexes, such as the nitric oxide synthase (Jaffrey and Snyder, 1996) and myosin V (Goode et al., 2000; Naisbitt et al., 2000), an actin-based motor mainly located at the plasma membrane that shuttles between the cell periphery and the MTOC along the MT network (Espreafico et al., 1998; Tsakraklides et al., 1999). LC8 is encoded by at least two genes in humans (Naisbitt et al., 2000), leading to the synthesis of dynein light chain 2 (DLC2) and dynein light chain 1 (DLC1), the isoform used in our work. Interestingly, myosin V has been shown to interact with DLC2 but not with DLC1 (Naisbitt et al., 2000; Puthalakath et al., 2001). Thus, migration of HFV capsids towards the centrosome on the microtubule network probably involves an interaction with dynein LC8 (DLC1) rather than myosin V LC8 (DLC2). In that sense, HFV efficiently targets the centrosomal region and replicates in myosin-V-deficient melanoma S91-6 cells (E. Espreafico and A. Saib, unpublished). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that HFV Gag also interacts with DLC2 as a component of myosin V, favoring its trafficking on actin beneath the plasma membrane devoid of microtubules. Therefore, interaction between incoming FV capsids and the multifunctional LC8 could provide a bridge to shuttle between an actin-based motor beneath the plasma membrane and the MT network within the cytoplasm. Remarkably, a similar MT- and dynein-dependent trafficking towards the centrosome was recently described for incoming HIV-1, although the viral and cellular protagonists involved in this retrograde transport were not determined (McDonald et al., 2002). Nevertheless, these observations suggest that distinct classes of retroviruses might tether the dynein-dynactin complex motor on the MT network during the early stage of infection to reach the nucleus, opening new perspectives in the development of anti-retroviral drugs..

This region does not harbor any obvious similarities with the two previously described LC8-interacting motifs, (K/R)XTQT and GIQVD (Lo et al., 2001; Rodriguez-Crespo et al., 2001), but a coiled-coil motif conserved in all primate foamy viruses (Tobaly-Tapiero et al., 2001) seems to be involved in centriolar targeting of Gag. In that sense, a single point mutation (L171G) in the Gag ORF, leading to the disruption of the coiled-coil motif, abolishes MTOC targeting of the corresponding GFP-Gag fusion and renders a full-length viral clone non-infectious. Indeed, whereas Gag assembly and virus release are not affected by this helix-breaking point mutation, productive infection of naive cells is dramatically reduced. Because this mutation was shown to prevent Gag/LC8 interaction, tethering of the dynein retrograde motor following its entry into the cytoplasm might be impaired, a hypothesis that we are currently exploring. The L171G point mutation does not totally abolish infectivity, suggesting that other trafficking pathways might be used by FVs to reach the center of the cell. In that sense, intracellular trafficking involving the actin cytoskeleton might account for this observation, an alternative route already put forward for HIV-1 (McDonald et al., 2002) and previously suggested for FVs because Gag was also shown to interact with actin (Giron et al., 1997)..

We have used cryoelectron microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction to study this compartment in the case of L-A, a yeast virus whose capsid consists of 60 asymmetric dimers of Gag protein (76 kD). At 16-A resolution, we distinguish multiple domains in the elongated Gag subunits, whose nonequivalent packing is reflected in subtly different morphologies of the two protomers. Small holes, 10-15 A across, perforate the capsid wall, which functions as a molecular sieve, allowing the exit of transcripts and the influx of metabolites, while retaining dsRNA and excluding degradative enzymes. Scanning transmission electron microscope measurements of mass-per-unit length suggest that L-A RNA is an A-form duplex, and that RNA filaments emanating from disrupted virions often consist of two or more closely associated duplexes. Nuclease protection experiments confirm that the genome is entirely sequestered inside full capsids, but it is packed relatively loosely; in L-A, the center-to-center spacing between duplexes is 40-45 A, compared with 25-30 A in other double-stranded viruses. The looser packing of L-A RNA allows for maneuverability in the crowded capsid interior, in which the genome (in both replication and transcription) must be translocated sequentially past the polymerase immobilized on the inner capsid wall..

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	7	The present study addresses the capsid structure and the organization of encapsidated RNA in the L-A virus of yeast, an excellent model system because of its relative simplicity and well-known molecular biology. The L-A genome is a 4.6-kbp, single-segment molecule that encodes a major capsid protein (Gag; 680 residues, 76 kD) and a minor capsid protein. The latter molecule is a fusion of Gag with Pol, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol; 868 residues, 100 kD) (Fujimura and Wickner, 1988a; Icho and Wickner, 1989) that is generated by ribosomal frameshifting (Dinman et al., 1991; Tu et al., 1992). The L-A capsid is a spherical particle, ~430 A in diam, composed of 120 copies of Gag (Esteban and Wickner, 1986; Cheng et al., 1994), of which approximately two carry the Pol moiety (Dinman and Wickner, 1992; Ribas, J.C., and R.B. Wickner, unpublished results). Its surface lattice has the unusual property of being composed of 60 asymmetric dimers (Cheng et al., 1994), configured as an otherwise conventional icosahedron of triangulation class T = 1 (Caspar and Klug, 1962). Interestingly, 120-subunit capsids have been detected in several other dsRNA viruses, including bacteriophage 6 (Mindich and Bamford, 1988), reovirus (Dryden et al., 1993), orbivirus (Burroughs et al., 1995), aquareovirus (Shaw et al., 1996), and rotavirus (Estes, 1996), but thus far, in no other kind of virus..

Micrographs were recorded under minimal exposure conditions at nominal magnifications of  x 36,000 or  x 46,000 (~8 e/A2) on Kodak SO-163 films, using an electron microscope (EM400RT; Philips Technologies, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) equipped with modified Gatan anticontaminator blades and a Gatan 626 cryoholder (Gatan, Warrendale, PA). In some experiments, bacteriophage T4 was mixed with L-A, and the 40.5-A axial spacing of its tail-sheath (Moody and Makowski, 1981) was used as an internal magnification standard. Micrographs were assessed for resolution and stigmation by optical diffraction of large areas, and their defocus values estimated from the positions of the first zero of the contrast transfer function (CTF). For the micrographs chosen for analysis, the first zero was in the range of (15 A)1-(27 A)1 (Table I).

They were then diluted in buffer A until (when examined by negative staining) a uniform, dense but not continuous, distribution of particles was observed. 5- microl drops of virus at this concentration (typically, 2-5 mg/ml) were applied to holey carbon films on 400 mesh copper grids, and observed by cryoelectron microscopy, essentially as described (Booy et al., 1991; Booy, 1993). Micrographs were recorded under minimal exposure conditions at nominal magnifications of  x 36,000 or  x 46,000 (~8 e/A2) on Kodak SO-163 films, using an electron microscope (EM400RT; Philips Technologies, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) equipped with modified Gatan anticontaminator blades and a Gatan 626 cryoholder (Gatan, Warrendale, PA). In some experiments, bacteriophage T4 was mixed with L-A, and the 40.5-A axial spacing of its tail-sheath (Moody and Makowski, 1981) was used as an internal magnification standard. Micrographs were assessed for resolution and stigmation by optical diffraction of large areas, and their defocus values estimated from the positions of the first zero of the contrast transfer function (CTF). For the micrographs chosen for analysis, the first zero was in the range of (15 A)1-(27 A)1 (Table I). Underfocus values () were calculated according to  = 1/k2 , where  is the wavelength of the 100 keV electrons (0.037 A), and k is the spatial frequency of the first zero (Lepault and Leonard, 1985)..
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	15	Micrographs were digitized on a Perkin Elmer 1010MG microdensitometer (Norwalk, CT) at 12- microm intervals ( x 36,000 negatives) or 16- microm intervals ( x 46,000 negatives), corresponding to 3.13 or 3.30 A per pixel, respectively. General image processing operations were carried out using the PIC Software system (Trus et al., 1996), running on Alpha workstations (Digital Equipment Co., Maynard, MA). Particles were extracted and preprocessed using the automated procedure of Conway et al. (1993). Particle orientations were determined by means of the Polar Fourier Transform algorithm, an iterative, model-based procedure (Baker and Cheng, 1996). As a starting model, we used our earlier 26A resolution three-dimensional (3-D) map of empty L-A particles (Cheng et al., 1994). In all micrographs analyzed, reconstructions of empty and full particles were calculated separately, using Fourier-Bessel techniques (Crowther, 1971; Fuller, 1987; Baker et al., 1988). Complete icosahedral (532) symmetry was imposed on the final density map. The contour level imposed for surface rendering was based on 100% of expected volume, assuming a protein density of 1.3 g/cm3. Resolution of the three-dimensional maps was estimated in terms of a Fourier shell correlation procedure (Saxton and Baumeister, 1982; Conway et al., 1993), and was, in each case, very close to the first zero of the CTF. Data quality was also assessed by eigenvalue spectra (Fuller et al., 1996)..

All three micrographs were well stigmated and had first zeros at ~(15 A)1. Three independent reconstructions were first calculated and mutually scaled to the same magnification and density by matching their spherically averaged radial density profiles (Booy et al., 1994). A composite reconstruction including  > 80 particles (Table I) was then calculated, the orientation and alignment parameters of each particle refined, and a final map calculated. The resolution was 16 A by the above criterion..

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	18	To visualize the internal contents of full particles, we first calculated reconstructions from micrographs recorded at several different defocus values. The contribution of the capsid shell to each such image was obtained by reprojecting the three-dimensional map in the corresponding orientation, after setting the internal densities to background (solvent) level. Finally, the projected capsid shell was subtracted from the raw image (Baker et al., 1990; Booy et al., 1991), thus providing an unobstructed view of the encapsidated dsRNA. As a control, the same procedure was applied to images of empty particles. Diffraction patterns were calculated for all difference images in each data set. These were then added together with equal weighting (combining empty and full particles separately), and azimuthally averaged to obtain the respective one-dimensional powder patterns..

As expected, the image contrast increases with defocus; however, L-A exhibits no conspicuous surface relief, even at quite high defocus (Fig. 1 d). Empty particles are clearly distinguished from full ones, and almost all capsids appear intact (see below). We observed a small percentage of a distinctive polymorphic variant, the "dimeric" capsid (e.g., Fig. 1 d, large arrowhead), it seems to be a fusion of two capsids, both lacking one icosahedral cap. Whether they arise from pairing of two partially dissociated capsids or are simply aberrant assembly products is not known. Filamentous material, presumably RNA released from virions, is usually visible (e.g., Fig. 1, small arrowheads). Some full particles exhibit "swirl" patterns of curved striations (e.g., Fig. 1 c, large arrowhead), we attribute this to the encapsidated RNA as they were never seen on empty capsids. The spacing between these striations is 35-40 A. More often, full particles present punctate, nonsymmetric, motifs. Fig. 1.

The outer diameter and average thickness of the capsid shell were measured from spherically averaged radial density profiles (not shown) of maps whose magnification was carefully calibrated, as 430 and 46 A, respectively. However, the reconstructions reveal local variations in shell thickness, which is maximally, ~54 A (compare with Fig. 2 b). Fig. 2. Three-dimensional density maps of L-A capsids at 16 A resolution. (a) Stereo views of the outer (upper panels) and inner (lower panels) surfaces of the full capsid, viewed along a fivefold axis of symmetry. The internal contents were computationally removed to expose the inner surface. (b) Transverse central sections taken from the maps of empty (left) and full (right) capsids, viewed along a twofold axis. Darker shades represent higher densities (corresponding to protein and/or RNA). Black arrowheads, fivefold symmetry axes; black lollipops, threefold axes; and white arrowheads, twofold axes. The two shells are virtually identical. In the full capsid (right), the closest contacts between the inner surface of the protein shell and the underlying RNA appear to take place around the lateral twofolds. The white rings just inside and outside the shell represent interference fringes arising from phase contrast. Since the holes in the capsid wall are too small to admit an A-form duplex (see Discussion), it seems likely that the empty capsids lost their RNA through a hole created by the dislodging of one or a few Gag subunits. With the averaging that takes place in calculating a density map, such a loss would not significantly affect the average density at that lattice site, and thus may be reconciled with the essentially identical structures visualized for full and empty capsids.

In the empty capsid, internal density is (as expected) at the same level as the solvent outside. In the full capsid map, the internal density gives the impression of three concentric shells 35-40 A apart (Fig. 2 b, right). We do not interpret this to mean that the viral RNA is strictly confined to three spherical shells. Rather, because the micrographs contain a strong signal at these spacings, arising from the distances between nearest-neighbor RNA filaments, the icosahedral density map calculated from them also contains strong features at the same spacings. The density of these shells diminishes progressively towards the center, which is probably a valid indication that proportionately more RNA resides at higher radii..

Consequently, we favor the two more compact arrangements (Fig. 3 d, bottom), in which there are more extensive interactions to stabilize the dimer..

A-subunits cluster around the fivefold axis via A1-A1 interactions. The corresponding region of the B-subunit (B1) makes contacts with A1 and A2, further out from the fivefold axis. Three B3 domains meet around the threefold axis, whereas across the twofold axis, the contacts are head- to-head between A3 and B3. Interactions between twofold and threefold axes take place deep in the lattice, from radii at ~184 to 197 A (whereas the protein shell extends from radii 171 to 217 A) via arclike densities (Fig. 3 a, top, far right)..

To obtain unimpeded views of encapsidated genomes, we erased the shell contributions from virion images, computationally (Booy et al., 1991). The resulting difference images show punctate motifs and/ or swirls; some examples are shown in Fig. 4. To estimate the interstrand spacings, we measured the positions of diffraction peaks in powder patterns calculated from many such images (Fig. 5). Because phase-contrast imaging accentuates particular spatial frequencies, depending on the defocus, this analysis was performed for micrographs that cover a range of defocus values. All of these patterns exhibited broad peaks extending from ~(31 A)1 to ~(47 A)1. The position of the peak varied slightly with defocus but was invariably between (36 A)1 and (40 A)1. As a control, the same procedure was applied to empty capsids. The resulting profile (Fig. 5, dashes) has a small peak in this range, this probably reflects noise amplified by the phase-contrast at this defocus value. It is, however, much weaker than the corresponding peak of the full particle powder pattern, confirming that this peak primarily reflects scattering from the RNA..

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	53	The interstrand spacings measured above are considerably larger than the values obtained for other dsDNA and dsRNA viruses (Lepault et al., 1987; Booy et al., 1991, 1992; Dryden et al., 1993). Accordingly, one might wonder whether their RNA is partly extruded, with a concomitant loosening up of the portion remaining inside the capsid. The presence of empty capsids and free RNA in electron micrographs is consistent with such a hypothesis. To test it, we conducted accessibility experiments with RNase III, a nuclease specific for dsRNA. The genomes of freshly prepared virions proved entirely resistant to the enzyme (Fig. 6); whereas in a positive control, isolated L-A RNA was extensively digested (Fig. 6, lane 3). When virions were preincubated in a low salt buffer, (known to destabilize them) (Esteban and Wickner, 1986), their RNA partially degraded (Fig. 6, lane 8). These results imply that the dsRNA is entirely sequestered inside freshly prepared virions. This conclusion is consistent with earlier STEM mass measurements that yielded masses for full L-A virions consistent with their containing whole genomes (Cheng et al., 1994). RNA is gradually lost on storage, but release from any given particle, once started, appears to proceed quite rapidly. The conclusion that the L-A genome is indeed packed more loosely than in other viruses is supported by calculations of packing density (see Discussion). Fig. 6. RNase III accessibility for L-A dsRNA. Purified RNA (lanes 1-3), dsRNA in intact full particles (lanes 4-6), and dsRNA from disrupted full particles (lanes 7 and 8) were treated with RNase III as described in Material and Methods, in the absence (lanes 2, 5, and 7) or presence (lanes 3, 6, and 8) of 10 mM MgCl2. Lanes 1 and 4 are controls for purified dsRNA and dsRNA from intact full particles without RNase III treatment, respectively. On the left, molecular weight markers. After RNase treatment, RNA was separated in a 1.5% agarose gel and detected by ethidium bromide staining. The digestion products are diffusely spread out in lane 8, whereas in the other lanes the genome band is either present at the appropriate position or absent, having been digested to small fragments.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	54	We used dark-field electron microscopy to measure the mass-per-unit length of L-A chromosomes, both after purification (e.g., Fig. 7 a) and as released from, but still connected to, disrupted capsids (e.g., Fig. 7 b). The data obtained for purified RNA molecules observe a quasi-Gaussian distribution with a mean of 2.8  plus or minus  0.6 kD/nm (standard deviation). For RNA filaments emanating from capsids, the distribution (Fig. 7 b) is broader, displaced to higher values, and is suggestive of multiple components. The lower values (~30-40% of the data) match those obtained for purified molecules. The other measurements are higher and appear to represent structures in which two or more duplexes associate laterally to form multistranded filaments. We think it unlikely that their higher density reflects coating of the RNA with protein since these preparations contain no protein other than Gag in detectable amounts. When a similar experiment was carried out with particles that had been stored for a few days at 4 degrees C (L-A virions gradually lose their dsRNA upon storage, see above), most of the measurements matched those obtained for purified molecules. Fig. 7. STEM dark-field images of unstained L-A RNA molecules. (a) Freeze-dried preparation of purified dsRNA, with a few tobacco mosaic virions (the rodlike particles), included as internal mass standards. At right is a histogram of mass-per-unit length measurements made from these micrographs (n = 53). (b) Purified L-A virions, with some free RNA; at right, the histogram of mass-per-unit length data (n = 275). These measurements were restricted to RNA segments visibly connected to capsids. The arrows indicate densities corresponding to integral numbers of strands per filament, assuming 2.8 kD/nm for an A-form RNA duplex (Results). Black arrows mark even numbers of strands, i.e., multiple duplexes. The precision of the measurements is insufficient to resolve the distribution into a set of well-defined peaks. In principle, these densities could be biased to higher values by residual salt deposits, as a consequence of insufficient grid washing. However, in this case, one would expect greater variability in the data, and the standard deviation of the measurements made on TMV particles to be considerably higher. In fact, the SDs were very similar, at 3.81% for the TMV in the experiments with purified RNA molecules, and 4.48% for those on capsid-connected RNA filaments. Bar, 1,000 A.

It is of interest to know whether this commonality extends to more detailed aspects of capsid architecture. Here, fewer data are available, but we note a definite morphological similarity between L-A capsid and the core of Bluetongue virus (Hewat et al., 1992); this virus is also composed of 120 subunits (Burroughs et al., 1995). Aquareovirus cores also show 120 morphological subunits on their surface (Shaw et al., 1996). Although reovirus cores are more complex than the L-A capsid, the presence of Y-shaped domains on their inner surface (Dryden et al., 1993) is a shared feature.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	60	Our current three-dimensional map at 16-A resolution depicts the 76-kD Gag monomer as an elongated molecule with multiple domains coiled around a central cavity. The structural differences seen between the nonequivalent A- and B-subunits are minor, but their bonding environments are entirely different (Fig. 3 c). As shown by expression studies (Fujimura et al., 1992), Gag can selfassemble into correctly sized capsids. This reaction should be controlled by some switching event that specifies the A and B conformations (Johnson, 1996). This switch may operate at the level of dimer formation, yielding protomers of which 60 equivalent copies would then self-assemble into a conventional T = 1 icosahedron. The plausibility of this model is supported indirectly by observations in other systems (e.g., the human growth hormone receptor [de Vos et al., 1992]), which attest that an asymmetric homodimer can be a stable state of assembly. Alternatively, A-subunits might associate into homo-pentamers, with the switch accompanying the accretion of B-subunits to convert them into decamers capable of forming the capsid pentons. The fact that Gag-Pol appears to nucleate assembly of L-A in vivo (Fujimura and Wickner, 1988b), and there are only 1-2 copies of this protein per capsid, argues against the pentamer-based model..

It has been previously demonstrated by spectroscopy that packaged 6 dsRNA has an A-form structure (Bamford et al., 1993). However, x-ray diffraction studies of crystallized reovirus dsRNA (for review see Nibert et al., 1996) were indicative of a double helix with 10 or 11 bp per turn and a 3-A pitch, this corresponds to a structure intermediate between A-form (2.81-A rise per bp) and B-form (3.38-A rise per bp)..

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	65	One striking feature revealed by our capsid model is its porosity; the capsid wall is perforated by many small holes. While their sizes may be revised somewhat when higher resolution data become available, current estimates suggest a strategically useful property. None of these holes is large enough to pass an A-form duplex (~23-A diam), but the largest holes (triangular, average distance from apex to base ~15 A; Fig. 3 e) should readily allow passage of an ssRNA molecule. Thus the capsid appears to be configured to function as a molecular sieve: duplex RNA is retained inside, but transcripts may exit. It would be expedient for freshly synthesized transcript to be fed directly into an exit port (Fig. 8), as this would forestall formation of secondary structure that might impede export. Since there are only one to two copies of Pol per capsid, presumably no more than two transcripts per capsid are being exported at any one time. However, the other holes should facilitate the infusion of nucleotides, of which a steady supply is required to sustain synthesis during transcription or replication. A further filtering property is that the holes are presumably small enough to exclude potentially degradative enzymes. Fig. 8. Hypothetical model of a transcriptionally active L-A virion. The polymerase (Pol) is covalently attached to a Gag subunit, which we assume to be integrated into the icosahedral surface lattice, thus immobilizing Pol (Icho and Wickner, 1989). Pol (and the COOH terminus of Gag) are assumed to reside on the inner surface of the shell, to facilitate access to the substrate dsRNA. The shape assigned to Pol in this diagram is arbitrary. In this scenario, it is necessary for the genome to be propelled sequentially past Pol as transcription proceeds.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	68	In projection, encapsidated L-A genomes exhibit punctate and/or swirl motifs (Fig. 4.). Presumably, these two classes of motifs represent distinct views, although it is not clear that the genome is packed in the same way in each particle. We infer that the genomes are loosely coiled, with variable spacing between adjacent filaments. The diffraction peaks (Fig. 5) have average Bragg spacings of 36-40 A, corresponding to a center-to-center spacing of 41-46 A between filaments. The L-A motifs differ from those of dsDNA viruses such as phages T4 and  (Lepault et al., 1987), T7 (Booy et al., 1992) and herpes simplex virus (Booy et al., 1991), and other dsRNA viruses such as reovirus (Dryden et al., 1993); these are relatively highly ordered and tightly packed, with center-to-center spacings of 25-30 A. In part, the larger spacing in L-A reflects the fact that A-form duplexes are wider than B-form duplexes. However, the average interduplex spacing may be calculated independently from the volume available (average internal capsid diam = 348 A) and genome length (1.287  microm, given 4.579 kbp, and 2.81 A axial rise per bp). Assuming quasi-hexagonal close packing to a uniform density, a spacing of ~40 A is obtained. There is some flexibility in this figure, arising from the center being less populated with RNA, the packing not being perfectly crystalline, and possibly also from some local compaction into multistranded filaments (see below). Nevertheless, this figure is in good agreement with the spacings measured directly from the powder patterns (Fig. 5). Its consistency supports our inferences that (a) the dsRNA genome is fully internalized, and (b) its packing is much looser than in other double-stranded viruses..

We have not observed these thicker filaments in preparations of isolated dsRNA, and see no obvious way in which they might arise as an artifact of specimen preparation. It may be that within the confines of the capsid, i.e., under conditions of high packing density, some piecewise condensation of duplexes into higher order filaments takes place.

This occurs by "headful replication," whereby one viral (+) strand is packaged, and replicates inside the particle until it is full. Subsequently synthesized (+) strands are extruded from the particle (Esteban and Wickner, 1986; Fujimura et al., 1990). As noted above, much more room remains available in the packaged L-A capsid than in other double-stranded viruses. We can think of two explanations. In one, the Gag gene has evolved recently to provide a more capacious capsid, but the genome as a whole has not yet evolved to fully exploit this opportunity for expansion.

The polymerase is thought to reside on the inner surface, anchored by integration of its Gag moiety into the surface lattice (Wickner, 1996a,b). In transcription (Fig. 8), large tracts of dsRNA must be propelled sequentially past this fixed point. In so doing, the organization of the entire packaged genome must undergo constant revision, or "churning" motion. (In contrast, the tightly compressed genomes of dsDNA phages are thought to be in a static vegetative state.) RNA polymerases are known to be powerful translocases, capable of generating forces in the range of 14 piconewtons (Yin et al., 1995). The ability of L-A Pol to function in replication and transcription depends on its being capable of overcoming the frictional drag imposed by the packaged genome. We infer that this resistance increases with higher packing density, whence the observed packing density may represent the highest level of frictional resistance against which the enzyme can function effectively. This idea is testable by generating insertions in the L-A genome..

However, these systems, in which transcriptionally active particles have been visualized (Yeager, M., S.G. Weiner, and K.M. Coombs. 1996. Biophys. J. 70:116a.; Lawton et al., 1997), are considerably more complex; more proteins and many more RNA segments are involved, and precisely calibrated spacings for their packaged genomes have yet to be reported. Transcription of reovirions is thought to require "activation" by proteases, and concomitant conformational changes (Powell et al., 1984; Dryden et al., 1993), which, we conjecture, may rearrange the core structure, so as to facilitate motion of the dsRNA during transcription. Nevertheless, the same overall requirements apply. It will be fascinating to learn more about possible solutions to this problem, and the properties of protein shells that are not only closed containers but also active metabolic compartments..

The consideration that dsRNA appears to be packed more densely in the cores of both reovirus (Dryden et al., 1993) and rotavirus (Prasad et al., 1996) than in L-A might suggest otherwise.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   A novel method employing filter arrays of a cDNA expression library for the identification of substrates for protein kinases was developed. With this technique, we identified a new member of the cyclin family, cyclin L2, as a substrate of the nuclear protein kinase DYRK1A. Cyclin L2 contains an N-terminal cyclin domain and a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich domain (RS domain), which is a hallmark of many proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing. The gene for cyclin L2 encodes the full-length cyclin L2, which is predominantly expressed in testis, as well as a truncated splicing variant (cyclin L2S) that lacks the RS domain and is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. Full-length cyclin L2, but not cyclin L2S, was associated with the cyclin-dependent kinase PITSLRE. Cyclin L2 interacted with splicing factor 2 in vitro and was co-localized with the splicing factor SC35 in the nuclear speckle compartment. Photobleaching experiments showed that a fusion protein of green fluorescent protein and cyclin L2 in nuclear speckles rapidly exchanged with unbleached molecules in the nucleus, similar to other RS domain-containing proteins. In striking contrast, the closely related green fluorescent protein-cyclin L1 was immobile in the speckle compartment. DYRK1A interacted with cyclin L2 in pull-down assays, and overexpression of DYRK1A stimulated phosphorylation of cyclin L2 in COS-7 cells. These data characterize cyclin L2 as a highly mobile component of nuclear speckles and suggest that DYRK1A may regulate splicing by phosphorylation of cyclin L2..

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   DYRK1A (dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A) is a nuclear protein kinase that appears to play an important role in brain development (for a review, see Ref. 1). The first evidence for a role of DYRK1A in neurogenesis came from its similarity with the Drosophila orthologue, the minibrain kinase (2). Mutant flies with a reduced expression of minibrain show a significant reduction of neurons in distinct areas of the brain, correlated with specific behavioral defects (2). In addition, the human DYRK1A gene is located on chromosome 21 in the "Down syndrome critical region" (3 to 5). Consistent with a potential involvement of the DYRK1A gene in the pathogenesis of mental retardation in Down syndrome, overexpression of DYRK1A in transgenic mice causes learning deficits and neurodevelopmental alterations (5, 6). Furthermore, mice heterozygous for a targeted deletion of the Dyrk1a gene (Dyrk1a+/- mice) develop abnormal brain morphology (7). In early embryonal development, DYRK1A is expressed in neural progenitor cells during the transition from proliferating to neurogenic divisions (8). Altogether, these findings suggest a relevant function of DYRK1A during neuronal development, related to proliferation and/or differentiation..
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	7	In recent years, several transcription factors have been identified as substrates of DYRK1A (for a review, see Ref. 9). Particularly, overexpression of DYRK1A has been shown to modulate the transactivation potential of FKHR (forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma) (10, 11), cAMP-response element-binding protein (12), and GLI1 (13). Cytoplasmic proteins like eukaryotic initiation factor 2B, tau (14), and dynamin (15) have also been reported to be phosphorylated by DYRK1A, but these proteins might equally well be targets of the cytoplasmic kinases DYRK2 or DYRK3. However, although DYRK1A contains a canonical nuclear localization signal and is indeed predominantly targeted to the nucleus (16, 17), a significant fraction of the kinase is also present in the cytoplasm (18). Within the nucleus, DYRK1A is localized in "nuclear speckles," which represent the splicing factor compartment (17, 19). The precise function of DYRK1A in the nucleus is still largely unknown, and it is an open question whether any of the known substrates of DYRK1A is a key mediator of its functions on cell differentiation and proliferation. We have therefore performed a more extensive search for interacting proteins and substrates to address this problem..
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	8	Several methods have been employed to identify novel substrates of protein kinases. Routine interaction screens like the yeast two-hybrid system, phage display, and phage expression library screening, yield in many cases substrates of kinases (20 to 23). Other approaches are based on the specificity of substrate recognition by kinases and aim to identify substrate proteins by searching data bases with experimentally determined or predicted consensus phosphorylation sequences (24, 25). More direct strategies include the phosphorylation screening of phage expression libraries (26) or of cell lysates (27), and the identification of phosphoproteins by functional proteomics and mass spectrometry (28)..

In this approach, we used an arrayed protein expression library (29, 30) both for interaction screening by overlaying with the radiolabeled recombinant kinase (31), and for a substrate screen by solid phase phosphorylation (26). The use of the filter array allowed us to directly identify positive clones without the need of further rounds of purification. Several DYRK1A-interacting and/or phosphorylated proteins were identified by this approach, and one protein was found in both screens. This protein turned out to be a novel member of the cyclin family and was designated cyclin L2..

The C-terminally truncated mutant of DYRK1A was used as a probe in order to avoid potential nonspecific binding of the repeat structures in the C-terminal domain of DYRK1A (32). The kinase-negative point mutant (K188R) of DYRK1A should exhibit enhanced enzyme-substrate interactions. For labeling, 20 to 25  microg of GST-DYRK1A-C-K188R bound to glutathione S-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated in a volume of 110  microl with 10 units of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (New England Biolabs) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 6 mg/ml dithiothreitol for 30 min at 4  degrees C in the presence of 45  microCi of [-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol).

The labeled protein was then eluted for 10 min on ice in 500  microl of glutathione elution buffer (10 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0).

A total of four proteins with RS domains were identified (SFRS4, cyclin L2, SFRS5, and SWAP2) as in vitro substrates of DYRK1A, suggesting that DYRK1A may be involved in splicing catalysis. We therefore performed in vitro kinase assays to compare the phosphorylation of RS domain-containing proteins by DYRK1A. In addition to the proteins identified in the present screen, two additional RS domain-containing proteins (hTRA21 and SF2/ASF) and a well characterized in vitro substrate of DYRK1A (myelin basic protein) (34) were included in this experiment. As shown in Fig. 2, cyclin L2 and hTRA21 were phosphorylated with markedly higher intensities than the other RS proteins. Thus, DYRK1A does not indiscriminately phosphorylate serine residues in the context of RS domains. In the present study, we concentrated on the characterization of cyclin L2 and its interaction with DYRK1A, because this protein was independently identified in both screens and because cyclin L2 was an excellent substrate of DYRK1A (see below; Fig. 2)..

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	60	Genomic Organization of CCNL2 The human CCNL2 gene is located on chromosome 1 (1p36.33). The gene spans about 13 kb and comprises 11 exons (Fig. 3C). The comparison of the genomic sequence with public expressed sequence tag sequences allowed us to deduce the existence of three different transcripts, T1 to T3 (Fig. 3C). The different transcripts are generated by alternative splicing of exon 6a and by the use of alternative polyadenylation sites within exon 6a. Inclusion of exon 6a introduces a stop codon, and therefore transcripts T1 and T3 encode a truncated version of cyclin L2 that lacks the RS domain (cyclin L2S, "s" represents "short," Fig. 3, A and B). Because exon 6a is skipped in transcript T2, the resulting mRNA (AY037150 [GenBank] ) encodes the long version of the protein, which is named cyclin L2 and includes the RS domain..
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	61	Alternatively Spliced Transcripts of CCNL2 and CCNL1  We performed Northern blot analyses with exon-specific hybridization probes (Fig. 3C) and PCR analysis in order to determine the expression pattern of CCNL2 in different tissues and to verify the existence of the hypothesized transcripts of the CCNL2 gene. On Northern blots of RNA from different human tissues, two major bands of about 4.5 and 2.4 kb were detected by a probe corresponding to the 3'-untranslated region in exon 11 of CCNL2 (Fig. 4A, upper left panel). These sizes correspond very well to the calculated lengths of the transcripts T1 and T2 (see Fig. 3C). Transcript T1, which encodes cyclin L2S, was ubiquitously found in all tissues tested, although signal intensities varied. In ovary, testis, prostate, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and liver, T1 appeared to be more abundant than in blood, colon, lung, and brain. In contrast, transcript T2 was weakly detected in a few tissues (skeletal muscle, and spleen), and only testis RNA contained comparable levels of both transcripts (T1 and T2). The 2.4-kb transcript (T2) appears as a double band on the autoradiogram, because there are two polyadenylation sites in exon 11 that are separated by 211 bp (see Fig. 3C). To confirm the identification of T1 and T2, we hybridized identical blots with a probe derived from the 5'-end of exon 6a (Fig. 4A, lower left panel). As expected, this probe detected the same 4.5-kb band (T1) as the 3'-untranslated region probe but did not hybridize with the 2.4-kb transcript (T2). In addition, we identified a band with an approximate size of 1.2 kb. We hypothesize that this band corresponds to a transcript comprising exons 1 to 5 (a total of 677 bp) and about 500 bp of exon 6a (transcript T3 in Fig. 3C). Indeed, exon 6a harbors a potential polyadenylation signal (AAUACA) (43) at nucleotide 1165 of BC016333 [GenBank] (GenBankTM accession number). We identified this clone in the human data bases as a full-length mRNA, which represents transcript T3. Consistent with this identification of the 1.2-kb band, a probe specific for the 3'-end of exon 6a (E6a-3') detected only the 4.5-kb band and reacted neither with the 1.2-kb transcript nor the 2.4-kb transcript (data not shown)..

The short polymerization time of 30 s did not allow the amplification of T1 by primer E6brev. Control PCRs of T1/T3 (primers E2for and E6arev) and T2 (primers E2for and E6brev) with a human testis cDNA library as template are shown in the right panel.

First-strand cDNAs from the indicated human and mouse tissues were subjected to PCR analysis with primers E2for, E6arev, and E6brev in a single reaction.

PCR products from mouse tissues were visualized by ethidium bromide staining..
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	64	  The structure of the CCNL1 gene resembles that of CCNL2, and there are alternative splicing variants of cyclin L1 that result in a long and a short form of the protein (41, 39), similar to cyclin L2 and cyclin L2S. To directly compare the expression patterns of CCNL1 and CCNL2, we hybridized the same Northern blots with CCNL1-specific probes that corresponded to the probes used for detection of CCNL2 mRNA. Similar to CCNL2, a probe specific for the last exon of CCNL1 detected two bands of 4.3 and 2.3 kb (Fig. 4A, upper right panel). This result suggests that alternative transcripts of CCNL1 are generated in the same way as T1 and T2 of CCNL2. Consistent with this identification of the bands in the Northern blot, a probe equivalent to E6a-5' detected only the longer transcript of CCNL1 (Fig. 4A, lower right panel). No transcript of CCNL1 was detected that corresponded to T3 of CCNL2. As in CCNL2, a stop codon in the longer transcript results in a truncated version of the protein. These data suggest that alternative splicing occurs in the same way in both isoforms of cyclin L; inclusion of exon 6a of CCNL2 or the corresponding region of CCNL1 leads to a larger transcript, which encodes a truncated protein lacking the RS-domain and part of the cyclin domain..

We designed exon-specific primers to amplify transcripts T1/T3, coding for the short protein (cyclin L2S), and transcript T2, coding for the long form (cyclin L2) (Fig. 4B). Combination of the three primers in a single reaction (multiplex PCR) allowed us to compare the expression ratios of T1/T3 with T2 in different tissues (Fig. 4C). It should be noted that the ratio of the PCR products is not necessarily equal to the ratio of the respective cDNA sequences, because the different products may have been amplified with different efficiencies. However, the data indicate whether this ratio differs between different samples (e.g. brain and testis cDNA). As shown in Fig. 4C, transcript T2 was detected in all tissues analyzed except for human brain. Nevertheless, transcript T2 was readily amplified from brain cDNA when only T2-specific primers were used for the PCR (data not shown). Consistent with the Northern blot data, stronger signals were obtained in most tissues for transcripts T1/T3 than for T2, except for testis, which contained relatively higher levels of T2. In mouse tissues, the ratio of T2 and T1/T3 was also higher in testis than in brain (Fig. 4C).

After washing five times, proteins retained on the Sepharose and 5% of the input (GFP-CycL2-N-containing lysate) were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting (WB) using a GFP-specific antibody (upper panel). Ponceau staining shows the amounts of the bait proteins (lower panel). The bands corresponding the full-length protein are marked by asterisks. DYRK1A-NT has a calculated size of 44 kDa, indicating that most of the protein is truncated. The baits used are schematically shown in the right panel. The percentage of identical amino acids between DYRK1A and DYRK2 in the DH box and the catalytic domain (cat) is indicated..

This result indicates that the C-terminal part of cyclin L2 can interact comparably well with other RS domain-containing proteins and with the protein kinase DYRK1A. Cyclin L2 bound also to the related kinase, DYRK2. Notably, sequence similarity between DYRK2 and DYRK1A is limited to the catalytic domain and a short segment immediately N-terminal of the catalytic domain that we earlier designated the "DYRK homology box" (DH box) (48). The DH box contains a large number of negative charges (35) and may thus bind the RS domain of cyclin L2 by ionic interactions. Both DYRK1A-NC, which lacks the DH box, and the N-terminal domain alone bound cyclin L2 only very weakly. Taken together, these results suggest that optimal binding of cyclin L2 to DYRK1A (or DYRK2) requires the presence of both the catalytic domain and the DH box..

Bacterially expressed His6-cyclin L2 was phosphorylated by DYRK1A in vitro and subjected to SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 9, two slower migrating bands appeared after phosphorylation of cyclin L2 by DYRK1A. The three bands were individually analyzed for phosphorylated amino acids by mass spectroscopy in comparison with unphosphorylated cyclin L2. Three phosphoserines were identified in the slower migrating bands (Fig. 9; Ser-330, Ser-338, and Ser-369). All of these serine residues are located N-terminal of proline residues, consistent with our previous classification of DYRK1A as a "proline-directed" kinase. It should be noted that other phosphorylation sites may have escaped detection, since the predicted size of the tryptic fragments from the RS domain would have been too small to successfully purify and analyze by the present methodology..

These advantages made it feasible to select 58 positive clones to verify the original screening results with recombinant proteins (Fig. 1B). All tested clones were able to bind to DYRK1A and/or to be phosphorylated by DYRK1A, demonstrating the reliability of the screening results.

This unusual domain structure is conserved in the homologous proteins from invertebrates and plants (Drosophila, Caenorhabditis, and Arabidopsis (41)), providing evidence for a conserved function of the RS domain in these proteins. The RS domain is a hallmark of many proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing, including the serine/arginine-rich splicing factors (SR proteins), which contain at least one RNA-binding motif, and the SR protein-related polypeptides (50, 51, 47, 52). SR protein-related polypeptides constitute an inhomogeneous family of proteins that contain the RS domain in combination with additional domains (e.g. the protein kinase domains in CLK1-CLK4 and CrkRS/CRK7 or the DEAD/H box in RNA helicases) (47, 52). The modular domain architecture of cyclin L1 and L2 is thus a typical feature of SR protein-related proteins, although unusual for members of the cyclin family..

This subcellular distribution is very likely mediated by the RS domain, since a construct of cyclin L2 that lacked the major part of the cyclin domain (cyclin L21 to 222) exhibited a subnuclear distribution indistinguishable from that of the full-length construct (data not shown). In contrast, cyclin L2S, which lacks the RS domain, was distributed both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5).

Moreover, FLIP analysis showed that a considerable portion of nuclear GFP-CycL2 transits a given small region of the nucleus within a time period of 60 s (Fig. 6B), indicating that the protein diffuses freely in the nucleoplasm when not associated with speckles. In contrast, GFP-CycL1 was found immobile in both FRAP and FLIP analysis. To our knowledge, the observation that GFP-CycL1 is an immobile component of nuclear speckles is unprecedented in the analysis of proteins with RS domains (for a review, see Ref. 44). The different mobilities of cyclin L1 and cyclin L2 indicate that the proteins have different functions despite their highly similar structures. Presently, we can only speculate on the reason for the different mobilities of cyclin L1 and cyclin L2. The fact that cyclin L1 was co-immunoprecipitated with PITSLREp110 argues against the possibility that the GFP fusion protein is grossly misfolded in the cell. Instead, the association of cyclin L1 with its cyclin dependent kinase, PITSLREp110, may constrain the mobility of cyclin L1, whereas the association of cyclin L2 and PITSLREp110 appears weaker (Fig. 8)..

In contrast, the mRNA for full-length cyclin L2 was detected mainly in testis, whereas the short variant, cyclin L2S, was nearly ubiquitously expressed. Furthermore, we found that the transcripts of CCNL1 and CCNL2 were differentially regulated by extracellular stimuli; phorbol ester and cycloheximide specifically induced the mRNA for full-length cyclin L1 in human RT112 keratinocytes, whereas levels of the cyclin L2 transcripts were only weakly affected by cycloheximide and not at all by phorbol ester.2 These results are in accordance with a more extensive analysis of cyclin L1 expression in rat neurons by Berke et al. (41), who identified CCNL1 as an immediate early gene induced by cocaine and dopamine. Taken together, the present characterization of the cyclin L2 gene suggests that CCNL1 and CCNL2 originated by gene duplication and have acquired different patterns of expression by divergent evolution of their promoters..

Identical results have been reported for cyclin L1S (39, 41). The existence of these short variants with no apparent function is reminiscent of the alternative splicing in the CLK kinases (61). CLK1 is regulated through alternative splicing of the CLK1 pre-mRNA, yielding mRNAs encoding the catalytically active kinase and truncated polypeptides lacking the kinase domain. CLK1 regulates splicing by phosphorylation of SR proteins and controls its own expression, since the presence of the active kinase favors the production of the truncated, inactive polypeptide (61). There are other known cases of splicing factors that are subject to autoregulation by alternative splicing (62, 63), and we hypothesize that the existence of the short splicing variants of cyclins L1 and L2 provides a means to control the levels of the full-length proteins at the level of splicing..

The original cyclin L2 clone isolated from the expression library lacked the cyclin domain, thus allowing the conclusion that DYRK1A interacts with the RS domain of cyclin L2. The results of the pull-down assays indicate that the catalytic domain of DYRK1A alone is able to bind cyclin L2 but that this interaction is greatly enhanced by the presence of a small conserved region preceding the catalytic domain, called the DH box. This region contains a large number of acidic residues (35) and is conserved in all kinases of the DYRK family and in several related kinases that are involved in the regulation of splicing (CLK family, PRP4 (48)). It appears reasonable to assume that the negatively charged DH box is engaged in ionic interactions with the positively charged RS domain..

This finding confirms our previous classification of DYRK1A as a proline-directed kinase (35). Notably, none of the target sites in cyclin L2 contains an arginine residue in position P-2 or P-3 that we and others have previously found to be critical for substrate recognition (14, 34, 64). We could further show that cyclin L2 is indeed a phosphoprotein when expressed in COS-7 cells. The phosphate content of cyclin L2 was not significantly altered by co-expressed DYRK1A (Fig. 10A), probably because RS domains are generally highly phosphorylated by endogenous kinases (47). However, overexpression in COS-7 cells of catalytically active DYRK1A, but not of a kinase-inactive mutant, induced a mobility of shift of cyclin L2, resembling the result of the in vitro phosphorylation of His6-CycL2 by DYRK1A (Fig. 9). This result strongly suggests that DYRK1A directly phosphorylates cyclin L2 in living cells. The phosphorylation of SR proteins is necessary for their recruitment from nuclear speckles to sites of transcription/pre-mRNA processing (44, 65). Interestingly, Alvarez et al. (19) have recently reported that kinase-active DYRK1A, but not an inactive point mutant, induced speckle disassembly. However, it remains to be determined whether phosphorylation of cyclin L2 is involved in this action of DYRK1A..

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	3	Hemolysin BL (HBL) is a unique membrane-lytic toxin from Bacillus cereus composed of three distinct proteins, designated B, L1, and L2. HBL produces a paradoxical zone phenomenon in gel diffusion assays in sheep blood agar. Lysis does not begin immediately adjacent to the source of diffusion; rather, it begins several millimeters away. Cells near the source and at intersections of lysis zones remain intact longer. Here, we developed a spectrophotometric hemolysis assay system that measures the activities of the individual HBL components and used it to analyze the mechanisms of hemolysis and the paradoxical zone phenomenon. The B component was rate-limiting, and erythrocytes were slowly primed by B at an optimal concentration of about 1.3 nM to rapid lytic action by the combination of the L components (L1+2). All of the individual components bound to cells independently, and membrane-associated HBL components were neutralized by specific antibodies, suggesting that lysis was caused by formation of a membrane attack complex on the cell surface. Osmotic protection experiments indicate a colloid osmotic lysis mechanism. Concentrations of the B component above 1.3 nM caused inhibition of L1-mediated lysis, and L1 inhibited the priming reaction of B over a similar concentration range. From analyses of spectrophotometric and diffusion assays we constructed a basic model for the interactions between HBL components and for the paradoxical zone phenomenon in blood agar. In the latter, areas of slow lysis near diffusion sources are caused primarily by the accumulation of inhibitory levels of L1 reached before cells are primed by B..

Separately, the HBL components are nontoxic, but when combined they exhibit a variety of toxic activities including hemolysis, cytotoxicity, vascular permeability, dermonecrosis, enterotoxicity, and ocular toxicity (1, 2, 3, 4). When HBL diffuses from a bacterial colony or a well in blood agar, it produces an unusual discontinuous hemolysis pattern (5), called a paradoxical zone phenomenon (6). Lysis begins away from the well or colony, followed by slow lysis nearer the source (5). A similar zone phenomenon is seen in spectrophotometric assays in which there is decreased hemolysis at HBL concentrations above a maximally effective dose (4)..

Their respective sizes are 37.8, 38.5, and 43.2 kDa, and their pI values are 5.34, 5.33, and 5.33 (4), as determined electrophoretically. The genes for all three components have been cloned, and the sequences have been determined (7, 8). The amino acid sequences predicted from the nucleotide sequences are in complete agreement with published N-terminal amino acid sequences determined chemically (4). All of the proteins appear unique and exhibit no significant similarity with other known proteins. The three genes are immediately adjacent to one another, apparently in an operon (8). Methods for purification of relatively large quantities of pure HBL components were developed only recently (4); therefore, little is known about the mode of action of HBL at the molecular level..

These assays are based on a fundamental difference between the activities of the B and L components and allow analysis of the activities of the individual HBL components. When sheep erythrocytes were treated with B they did not lyse, but they slowly became primed to lysis by the combination of the two L components (L1+2). The discrete proportion of cells primed at a given time could be used as a measure of the activity of B. The priming reaction, which took less than 1 h at 42  degrees C could be nearly stopped by reducing the temperature to 22  degrees C or below, creating a quasistable population of B-primed red blood cells (RBC-B). The addition of L1+2 to RBC-B at 22  degrees C caused rapid lysis of cells that was over 3000 times faster than the priming rate at that temperature.

These assays are based on a fundamental difference between the activities of the B and L components and allow analysis of the activities of the individual HBL components. When sheep erythrocytes were treated with B they did not lyse, but they slowly became primed to lysis by the combination of the two L components (L1+2). The discrete proportion of cells primed at a given time could be used as a measure of the activity of B. The priming reaction, which took less than 1 h at 42  degrees C could be nearly stopped by reducing the temperature to 22  degrees C or below, creating a quasistable population of B-primed red blood cells (RBC-B). The addition of L1+2 to RBC-B at 22  degrees C caused rapid lysis of cells that was over 3000 times faster than the priming rate at that temperature. Consequently, numerous samples of the L components could be analyzed against an RBC-B preparation with little change in the primed cells..

Complete neutralization of membrane-bound L components by specific antibodies suggest that HBL causes hemolysis via the interaction of at least the L components in a "membrane attack complex" and not by enzymatic degradation of the membrane.

Hemolysis is slow near the HBL source because excess (and therefore inhibitory) concentrations of B and L1 accumulate before cells can be primed by B. The initial location of lysis occurs at a point at which the diffusion rate has decreased enough so that the rate of priming by B exceeds the rate at which excess components accumulate..

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	23	Fig. 1 depicts the main steps and reactions in the assay of the HBL components. Standard RBC suspensions, consisting of 1.3  x  107 cells ml1 were prepared by diluting washed cells into TBS such that the optical density (OD) at 630 nm through a 1-cm path length was 0.7. Below this value, the OD630 was directly proportional to the number of intact cells present. Naive standardized RBCs were primed to the lytic action of the L components by treatment with the B component. Cells in the B-primed state are referred to as RBC-B. The priming reaction (reaction 1 in Fig. 1) was conducted for desired times or until all RBCs were primed (100% RBC-B), at 42  degrees C with 1.3 nM B, unless otherwise indicated. After priming, the cells were cooled to 22  degrees C, and lysis was initiated in 1-ml cuvettes by the addition of 7  microl of the L component stock (100 times the desired final concentration) to 693  microl of RBC-B. Lysis (reaction 2 in Fig. 1) was measured continually by the decrease of the OD630 over time. The activity of the B component was measured as the proportion of cells primed (%RBC-B; Fig. 1) at a given time. This proportion was evident as a distinct terminal plateau in the lysis curve, and proportion of primed cells was estimated as illustrated in Fig. 1B. For some samples with low hemolytic activity, the terminal plateau was approached gradually over a long assay period. In these cases the plateau was measured at the point at which the OD630 did not change for at least 12 s. --> Fig. 1. Spectrophotometric determination of the activities of the B and L components of HBL. A, a representation of steps comprising the spectrophotometric hemolysis assay for individual HBL components. In reaction 1 standardized RBC (1.3  x  107 RBC ml1) are treated with 1.3 nM B at 37 or 42  degrees C. During this treatment, RBC do not lyse; rather, they slowly become primed to the lytic action of the combined L components. The priming reaction is "stopped" by cooling the cells to 22  degrees C or below, and primed cells (RBC-B) are distributed to cuvettes. The addition of the combination of the two L components (L1+2) produces reaction 2, the rapid lysis of RBC-B.  , the absorbance of primed RBC is generally lower than the starting OD value due to slight dilution with sample and a small amount of spontaneous lysis, but OD does not differ from that of untreated control cells. B, the graph is a time trace of the lysis of B-primed cells upon the addition of L1+2, illustrating reaction 2 from panel A. Cells underwent priming (reaction 1) at 37  degrees C for 60, 100, and 145 min as indicated above each curve. After cooling, lysis was initiated by the simultaneous addition of 2 nM of each of the two L components at t = 0. The decrease over time in OD630 in each curve is due to hemolysis of RBC-B by L1+2. The difference between the starting OD value and the plateau on each curve reflects the discrete proportion of erythrocytes that are primed (%RBC-B) at a given time. The values for the maximum hemolysis velocity (OD630 min1) are shown beside each curve. Velocity varies directly with the concentration of L1+2 for a given RBC-B preparation and is used as a measure of L activity. C, priming reaction of B at 42, 37, and 22  degrees C. Cells underwent reaction 1 at 42, 37, or 22  degrees C for the times indicated on the x axis. %RBC-B was calculated from the terminal plateaus of lysis curves in reaction 2 of the HBL assay. *, values corresponding to the lysis curves shown in B.

Practically, this means that the priming reaction can be nearly stopped at 22  degrees C.

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	30	It is generally thought that pore-forming hemolysins cause lysis by a colloid osmotic mechanism. When pores form in the membrane, external solutes that are smaller than the pores enter the cell, creating an osmotic gradient. This in turn produces a net flow of water into the cell, which swells and lyses from excess osmotic pressure. Osmotic protection experiments are the standard methods for detecting colloid osmotic lysis. Theoretically, if pores of defined size are produced, and the diameters of the external solutes are larger than the diameters of the pores, those solutes cannot enter the cell. This prevents the production of an osmotic gradient, thereby protecting cells from lysis (9)..

This pore size should only be considered a rough estimate, because calculated values vary greatly with assay conditions (9). --> Fig. 2.

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	34	RBC did not lyse when treated with isolated B, but became primed to the lytic action of the combined L components. Fig. 1B depicts three lysis curves generated by the simultaneous addition of both L components (L1+2) to RBC that had been treated at 37  degrees C for the times indicated above each curve. The difference between the starting OD and that of the terminal plateau following the lysis phase in each curve, measures the discrete proportion of cells primed by B to lytic action by L1+2 (%RBC-B). This value at 42, 37, and 22  degrees C (by 1.3 nM B) is plotted versus time in Fig. 1C. Note that the time scale is in hours for the priming reaction (Fig. 1C) and in seconds for the lysis reaction of primed cells by L1+2 (Fig. 1B). The priming reaction of B at 47, 37, and 22  degrees C was, respectively, 1, 2, and 3 orders of magnitude lower than the lysis velocity of 100% RBC-B caused by comparable concentrations of L1+2 at 22  degrees C. This slow priming rate of B corresponds to the slow hemolysis reaction that occurs in the presence all three HBL components (4), which required more than 1.5 h for complete lysis at 37  degrees C. This shows that the priming reaction of the B component is the rate-limiting step of HBL hemolysis..

There was no significant effect on inhibition of lysis although the concentration of antibody exposed to L1+2 was 100 times that exposed to RBC-B. This indicates that the inhibitory effect of the antibody was due to interaction with B on the surface of RBC-B and not due to an interaction with the L1+2 preparation.

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	46	We previously found that, when equal concentrations of all three HBL components were simultaneously varied, hemolysis exhibited a paradoxical zone phenomenon (4). Hemolysis was higher within a certain low concentration range than at higher concentrations. The effect of the concentration of the B component on the priming rate of B and the lysis velocity of L1+2 is illustrated in Fig. 5A. The extent of priming and the L-induced lysis velocity were both maximal around 1.3 nM B. When the time course of priming at 37  degrees C was followed, the maximum priming rate at the inflection point of the sigmoidal priming curve was 1.15% min1 at 1.3 nM B and 0.61% min1 at 4.5 nM B, supporting the idea that there is an antagonistic effect of excess B on itself (not shown). Above 4.5 nM B, the priming rate increased slightly, but lysis velocity was further inhibited. --> Fig. 5. Inhibition of L1-induced lysis by excess component B. A, effect of the concentration of B on the priming reaction of B and the lysis velocity of L1+2. Erythrocytes were primed at 37  degrees C for 60 min with the B concentrations indicated on the x axis. Lysis was initiated by the addition of 5 nM L1+2.

Hemolysis was higher within a certain low concentration range than at higher concentrations. The effect of the concentration of the B component on the priming rate of B and the lysis velocity of L1+2 is illustrated in Fig. 5A. The extent of priming and the L-induced lysis velocity were both maximal around 1.3 nM B. When the time course of priming at 37  degrees C was followed, the maximum priming rate at the inflection point of the sigmoidal priming curve was 1.15% min1 at 1.3 nM B and 0.61% min1 at 4.5 nM B, supporting the idea that there is an antagonistic effect of excess B on itself (not shown). Above 4.5 nM B, the priming rate increased slightly, but lysis velocity was further inhibited. --> Fig. 5. Inhibition of L1-induced lysis by excess component B. A, effect of the concentration of B on the priming reaction of B and the lysis velocity of L1+2. Erythrocytes were primed at 37  degrees C for 60 min with the B concentrations indicated on the x axis. Lysis was initiated by the addition of 5 nM L1+2. The percentage of primed cells (%RBC-B) and lysis velocity were measured as described under "Experimental Procedures." B, inhibition of hemolysis of RBC-B by Bi. Bi (5 nM) was added to primed erythrocytes prior to, simultaneously with, or following L1+2 (2 nM). The labels for each curve indicate the time (min) at which Bi was added relative to t = 0 on the x axis. Inset, plot of percentage of inhibition of velocity versus the time of the addition of Bi.

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	48	The inhibitory effect of excess B on L1+2 was observed even when B was added to previously primed erythrocytes (Fig. 5B). Erythrocytes were completely primed (100% RBC-B) and stabilized, and then excess B (an inhibitory concentration, Bi) was added prior to, simultaneously with, or following L1+2. The addition of Bi simultaneously with L1+2 resulted in nearly 60% inhibition of the lysis velocity. Inhibition did not increase if B was preincubated with RBC-B, and inhibition decreased drastically when B was added after L1+2. This indicates that under these conditions, B did not alter the cell surface, but it did interfere either with the binding or an intermediate step of one or both L components, and B did not interfere with lysis once binding or an intermediate step occurred..
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	49	The sequential addition of L1, L2, and Bi to RBC-B in various permutations indicated that Bi inhibits L1 and not L2 (Fig. 5C). When either L component was added to RBC-B, the cells did not lyse until the second L was added (Fig. 5C, curves A and B). When Bi was added at t = 0, lysis was inhibited regardless of the order of addition of the L components. But when Bi was added with an L component at t = 180 s, inhibition only occurred when L1 was added at that time (curve B), suggesting that B interferes with L1 and not L2. With respect to curve A (L1 at 0 s, L2 at 180 s), Bi inhibited lysis when added at 0 s but not when added at 180 s. The kinetics of the loss of inhibitory activity of Bi is graphically illustrated by the closed circle scatter plot in Fig. 5C. When L1 was added first (at t = 0), less inhibition occurred the later Bi was added until no inhibition occurred at 180 s..
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	50	RBC were primed by B in the presence of increasing concentrations of either L1 or L2, and the extent of priming was measured by the addition of the complementary L component (Fig. 6A). L1 drastically inhibited the priming reaction above ~1.5 nM. The inhibition dose response was very similar to the inhibition of L1 by B in Fig. 5A. The priming reaction of B could be inhibited by adding an excess concentration of L1 at any time before 100% RBC-B occurred (Fig. 6A, inset). The L2 component did not significantly inhibit the priming reaction in the concentration range tested, just as Bi did not inhibit L2. --> Fig. 6. Inhibition of component B by excess L1. A, effect of the concentrations of L1 and L2 on the priming reaction of B. RBCs were primed at 42  degrees C with 1.3 mM B in the presence of either L1 or L2 at the concentrations indicated on the x axis. The extent of priming was measured after 1 h by the addition of the complementary L component (5 nM) to lyse susceptible cells as described under "Experimental Procedures." Inset, inhibition of the B component by the addition of L1 (5 nM) at any time during priming. RBCs were primed with 1.3 nM B at 37  degrees C. Excess L1 was either not added (circles) or added at 5 (squares) or 15 min (triangles) as indicated by the arrows. The extent of priming (%RBC-B) was determined at the times indicated on the x axis by the addition of L2 to RBC-B. B, inhibition of hemolysis in a gel diffusion assay by excess L1. Lack of lysis was observed within the intersections of HBL hemolysis zones. The diffusion assay was performed, and the blood agar gel was prepared as described previously (10). Each well (3-mm diameter) received 4 pmol (~150 ng) of the respective HBL components. Wells labeled H received all three HBL components. The remaining wells received components B, L1, and L2 as indicated. The gel was photographed after 8 h at 24  degrees C. [View Larger Version of this Image (46K GIF file)].
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	51	An implication of the above observations is that, in blood agar, the inhibition of lysis near the HBL diffusion source and at the intersections of lysis zones (10) is a function of the mutual inhibitory activity between B and L1. To test this idea, the separated components were added to wells adjacent to wells containing all three components (Fig. 6B). Consistent with the above observations, the L1 component inhibited lysis in the adjacent zone, and the L2 component had no apparent effect on the adjacent pattern. Lysis was enhanced adjacent to the B component. This superficially contradicts the observation that excess B inhibits lysis by L1, but it is consistent with the overall kinetics of the system, as discussed below..

These binary toxins include staphylococcal -hemolysin and the related leukocidins (12, 13); anthrax toxin (14); Clostridium botulinum C2 and the related toxins of Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium spiroforme, and Clostridium difficile (15); and Bacillus sphaericus binary toxin (16). For all of these (except possibly the B. sphaericus toxin), the components exhibit a compulsory cell-binding order. Also the protective antigen of anthrax toxin, which acts as a docking protein, must be cleaved by a cellular protease before the complementary proteins will bind. The observations presented here allowed us to address related questions about the mechanism of HBL and helped answer three basic questions. Does HBL cause lysis enzymatically or by formation of a membrane attack complex? Do the HBL components act randomly or in a compulsory order? What is the basis for the paradoxical zone phenomenon exhibited by HBL?.

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	55	Hemolysins are thought to lyse cells by two general mechanisms (17). First, the cell surface may be enzymatically altered to an extent that causes membrane degeneration. This usually involves phospholipases, and there are numerous examples of hemolysis that require two enzymes acting in a compulsory order (18). In some systems a phospholipase acts on the cell, which is subsequently lysed by a nonphospholipase enzyme or nonenzymatic protein. In the second hemolysis mechanism, lysin molecules insert into the membrane and form functional transmembrane pores (19), or "leaky patches" (20). Such lesions are generally composed of oligomers of one protein or multiple proteins. Complement is an example of a lytic system that produces lesions composed of more than one different protein. Complement lesions are called membrane attack complexes (MACs) to account for their multicomponent composition (21). Hemolysins may also exhibit detergent-like activity and "solubilize" membranes, but this mechanism may not occur for hemolytic proteins (17)..

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	57	The experiment shown in Fig. 3 demonstrates that both L components bound to erythrocyte membranes independently of any other HBL component. After priming of L1- or L2-treated and washed cells by B, the addition of antibodies specific to either membrane-bound L component completely neutralized hemolysis by the complementary L component. This indicates that the L components remained associated with the membranes after washing and that each needed to be present for a competent lytic lesion to be formed. It also strongly suggests that a competent lesion is only formed when L1 and L2 physically interact on the cell surface, which, by definition, describes a MAC. If the L components were simple enzymes that caused lysis by independently damaging membranes, then antibodies to an L component would not reverse the membrane damage and protect cells from lysis by the other HBL components. It appears, therefore, that HBL ultimately causes lysis by forming a lesion analogous to a complement MAC that has a minimum structure consisting of an L1-L2 heterodimer. Osmotic protection of erythrocytes treated with HBL (Fig. 2) suggests that the putative MAC results in formation of transmembrane pores but does not indicate whether the pores are protein-lined or simply perturbations of the phospholipid bilayer surrounding the HBL components..
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	58	Antibodies specific for the B component also interfered with the ability of the L components to lyse B-primed cells (Fig. 4), suggesting that L components interact with B to form an integral three-component heteromeric membrane lesion. However, although the anti-B antibodies completely neutralized the autonomous priming reaction of B, they could only partially inhibit lysis once cells were primed. If HBL lysis does involve a three-component MAC, there are several possibilities as to what might occur during the priming reaction that decreases the ability of the anti-B antibodies to neutralize lysis. During priming, the B component may insert into the membrane, possibly forming oligomers. This would allow antibodies to bind only to exposed portions of B and not to portions sequestered within the membrane. Any conformational changes experienced by B might also decrease the avidity of antibodies prepared to its native conformation. It is also possible that B is altered by a membrane component, such as occurs in the proteolytic processing of the protective antigen component of anthrax toxin (14). Antibodies prepared to native B may bind poorly to the processed version..

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	60	The inability of anti-B antibodies to completely neutralize lysis of RBC-B by L1+2 might also be diagnostic of an enzymatic mechanism for B. A situation can be envisioned in which B binds to a membrane and converts a substrate to a product that is subsequently recognized by the L components, leading to lysis. If the product was to accumulate in a pool in the immediate vicinity of the membrane-bound B, partial inhibition might occur if B-associated antibody sterically prevented access of L components to the product. Such a mechanism seems rather unlikely, but it cannot be ruled out with present observations..

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	62	The next question addressed by our data is whether the HBL components act in an ordered or random manner. It is clear from Figs. 1 and 3 that all three HBL components bind to erythrocytes independently (i.e. randomly). However, as pointed out by Ponder in 1948 (6), hemolysis is a relatively complex multistep process. Pore assembly models for staphylococcal -toxin and for streptolysin O provide examples of such a multistep process (22). -Toxin monomers bind to membranes, diffuse laterally into a prepore complex on the membrane surface, and subsequently insert and form pores. SLO also binds as monomers and then undergoes a rate-limiting nucleation process involving formation of dimers on the membrane surface, followed by dimer insertion, and then rapid accumulation of monomers around the dimer nucleus to form the functional lesion. The complexity of these processes demonstrates that simple association of toxin components with erythrocytes does not provide a picture of the overall hemolysis mechanism..
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	63	Our evidence suggests that HBL components form pores after they form a complex. The L1 and L2 components rapidly contribute to the complex in a manner that does not appear to depend on the sequence of their addition. However, the B component clearly must undergo an autonomous, rate-limiting reaction before a functional lesion can be formed with the L components. Therefore, although all of the components bind independently to the cell, final lesion formation appears to follow a specific order with respect to the B and L components. It is possible that the appearance of an ordered reaction is an artifact of the kinetics of the individual components. All of the components might undergo analogous independent priming reactions, with the reaction of B being extremely slow relative to the reactions of the L components. However, our data suggest that the priming process followed by B is fundamentally different from those followed by the L components, because antibodies could completely protect cells when reacted with either membrane-associated L component, but not when reacted with B-primed cells..

Figs. 5 and 6 indicate that B and L1 are mutually inhibitory above a threshold concentration and that this antagonism is responsible for the paradoxical hemolysis behavior seen in gel diffusion and suspension assays..

Fig. 5B shows that lysis velocity could be inhibited even if Bi was added after cells were completely primed (100% RBC-B). The inhibition of lysis did not increase if RBC-B were pretreated with Bi (Fig. 5B, inset), indicating that inhibition was not due to an enzymatic action of Bi on the cells. Inhibition decreased, however, if Bi was added after L1 (Fig. 5, B and C), indicating that Bi interferes with the incorporation of L1 into the lesion and not with the function of a preformed lesion..

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	68	The kinetics of the inhibition of L1 by B in Fig. 5C is noteworthy. Inhibition decreased linearly with time (r = 0.976). This suggests a first order process for the incorporation of L1 into lesions, which is in distinct contrast to the complex shape of hemolysis curves. This type of measurement was possible only because of the special situation in which B does not appear to interfere with lysis once L1 has been incorporated into a lesion..
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	69	Fig. 6 shows that, above a threshold concentration, L1 also inhibited the priming reaction of B. The dose-response of L1-mediated inhibition of the priming reaction was nearly identical to that for inhibition of L1 by excess B (Fig. 5A). In addition, excess L1 inhibited hemolysis caused by HBL placed in adjacent wells in blood agar (Fig. 6B)..
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	70	The hemolysis data presented here provide an explanation for the paradoxical zone phenomenon of HBL and the lysis patterns seen in Fig. 6B. HBL hemolysis in blood agar is discontinuous and begins away from a well containing the components. However, diffusing molecules create a continuous concentration gradient, and the components must therefore reach a concentration that promotes hemolysis at every point between the well edge and the zone in which lysis begins; this is the paradox, and we propose the following model to explain it. A cell will not lyse unless it has been primed by B, and maximal priming occurs only at permissive concentrations of B and L1. When membrane-bound B or L1 exceeds a critical ratio versus a membrane constituent, the other component is inhibited from forming a functional lesion (or perhaps produces an inefficient lesion). Priming by B is slow and, since L1 can inhibit B at any time during the reaction (Fig. 6A, insert), priming is inhibited near a well when L1 diffuses rapidly enough to accumulate to inhibitory levels before cells are primed. Hemolysis only begins in a zone in which the B concentration is high enough to prime cells, but the diffusion rate of L1 is too low for it to reach an inhibitory concentration before the cells are primed. Inhibition at the intersections of zones is due to accumulation of excess L1 before cells are primed. It is unlikely that inhibition is caused by an excess ratio of B to L1 or vice versa, because a paradoxical zone phenomenon occurs in suspension assays simply by increasing the concentration of all three components at a constant ratio of each to the others (4)..
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	71	The influence on hemolysis patterns of the inhibitory effect of L1 is seen in Fig. 6B. Just as lysis is inhibited at the intersections of HBL hemolysis zones, lysis was also inhibited at the intersection of an HBL hemolysis zone and an L1 diffusion zone. As expected from Fig. 6A, L2 had no appreciable effect on an adjacent hemolysis pattern. The enhanced lysis between wells containing either HBL or B only seems contradictory in light of the observation that excess B inhibits lysis by L1, but it is consistent with the mechanism of HBL. The B component primes cells independently of the other components (Fig. 1, B and C), and once primed, cells are rapidly lysed by any concentration of L1+2. The lysis within the B diffusion zone occurred simply because cells were primed by B in the absence of inhibitory concentrations of L1. The priming reaction of B is over 1000 times slower than the lytic action of L1 at room temperature. Therefore, even in the presence of excess B, the lysis rate of RBC-B will not be noticeably slower than the rate at which cells are primed by B. On the other hand, any inhibition by L1 of the priming reaction of B should be profoundly evident. This seems to be born out in the lysis patterns in Fig. 6B..
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	72	Our hemolysis data provide some insights into the mechanism of HBL, which appears to involve novel modes of interactions between proteins and membranes. The three proteins that comprise HBL are collectively called a toxin because of an early simplifying assumption that they represent a single functional unit to the bacterium that produces them. This work supports that assumption. New findings show that the genes for all three components are arranged immediately adjacent to one another, probably in an operon (8), lending additional weight to the idea that the three proteins comprise a functional unit. HBL is unlike any previously described cytolytic toxin, from its complex composition to the unique hemolytic phenomena that it causes. Further study of this toxin promises to add a new perspective to perceptions about the mechanisms and utility of cytolytic toxins..

This dual role of the capsid in the viral life cycle must be tightly regulated to ensure efficient virus spread. Here, we used the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) infection model to analyze the effects of capsid phosphorylation and hydrogen bond formation. The potential key phosphorylation site at serine 245 within the core protein, the building block of DHBV capsids, was substituted by alanine (S245A), aspartic acid (S245D) and asparagine (S245N), respectively. Mutant capsids were analyzed for replication competence, stability, nuclear transport, and infectivity. All mutants formed DHBV DNA-containing nucleocapsids. Wild-type and S245N but not S245A and S245D fully protected capsid-associated mature viral DNA from nuclease action. A negative ionic charge as contributed by phosphorylated serine or aspartic acid-supported nuclear localization of the viral capsid and generation of nuclear superhelical DNA. Finally, wild-type and S245D but not S245N virions were infectious in primary duck hepatocytes. These results suggest that hydrogen bonds formed by non-phosphorylated serine 245 stabilize the quarterny structure of DHBV nucleocapsids during viral assembly, while serine phosphorylation plays an important role in nuclear targeting and DNA release from capsids during viral infection..

This dual role of the capsid in the viral life cycle must be tightly regulated to ensure efficient virus spread. Here, we used the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) infection model to analyze the effects of capsid phosphorylation and hydrogen bond formation. The potential key phosphorylation site at serine 245 within the core protein, the building block of DHBV capsids, was substituted by alanine (S245A), aspartic acid (S245D) and asparagine (S245N), respectively. Mutant capsids were analyzed for replication competence, stability, nuclear transport, and infectivity. All mutants formed DHBV DNA-containing nucleocapsids. Wild-type and S245N but not S245A and S245D fully protected capsid-associated mature viral DNA from nuclease action. A negative ionic charge as contributed by phosphorylated serine or aspartic acid-supported nuclear localization of the viral capsid and generation of nuclear superhelical DNA. Finally, wild-type and S245D but not S245N virions were infectious in primary duck hepatocytes.

0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Hepadnaviruses are a group of small enveloped DNA viruses with a narrow host range and a relative tropism for the liver. Hepatitis B virus (HBV),1 the prototypic member of the hepadnavirus family, is a major cause of liver disease worldwide, ranging from acute and chronic hepatitis to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (1, 2). Other members of the family include the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) (3, 4). Similar to other viruses the hepadnaviral genome is protected by a nucleocapsid, which is formed by icosahedrally arranged core proteins. The C-terminal domain of the core protein is rich in basic residues and bears three conserved serine phosphorylation sites (5, 6). While dispensable for capsid assembly, this region is required for packaging of pregenomic RNA (7 to 11). Inside the capsid the viral polymerase converts pregenomic RNA into minus-strand DNA, which in turn is completed to a double-stranded, relaxed circular (rc) DNA molecule (12). Newly assembled, mature hepadnaviral capsids containing rcDNA have two possible fates: they can either be enveloped by surface proteins and enter the secretory pathway or be redirected to the nucleus where repair of the rcDNA molecule results in the formation of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA, the template for viral RNA synthesis. Nuclear translocation of viral rcDNA is also mediated by incoming capsids in newly infected cells. However, the precise mechanisms regulating capsid trafficking and uncoating in both settings are unknown..

Furthermore, binding of in vitro generated HBV capsids to the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized hepatoma cells was previously found to depend on the phosphorylation status of the core protein (15). Hepadnaviral capsid phosphorylation, therefore, represents a candidate mechanism for the regulated nuclear targeting and release of viral rcDNA during natural infection..

The duck model offers the advantage that primary duck hepatocytes (PDH) are readily available and that DHBV infection of PDH with supernatants from transfected cells is highly efficient and reproducible. Position 245 within the C terminus of DHBV core was selected for detailed analysis since this site serves as a phosphate acceptor in transfected cells (5) and an earlier study had revealed an apparent effect of phosphoserine 245 on plus-strand DNA elongation (16). Furthermore, we have previously shown that the phenotype of two C-terminal deletion mutants is compatible with a potential key role of this position in capsid stability (17). In addition to the effect of ionic charge at this position we also analyzed the potential effect of hydrogen bond formation. Our data suggest that hydrogen bonding is required for the stabilization of newly assembled mature capsids while a negative ionic charge at position 245 of the DHBV core protein plays an essential role in nuclear capsid transport and infectivity. Based on these results we propose a model for multiple capsid functions based on the coordinated core protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, hydrogen bond formation as well as DNA maturation..

Hepatocytes were maintained in Williams E medium supplemented with 1  microM dexamethasone, 15 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 1  microM insulin, and 2 mM glutamine. Supernatants from transfected LMH cells were collected on day 3 post-transfection and concentrated using UltraFree Biomax 100K centrifugal devices (Millipore). Viral particles were added to primary hepatocytes on day 1 post-seeding. Supernatant from one 10-cm dish was transferred to three wells of a 6-well plate with primary hepatocytes. 4-h postincubation, the culture medium was exchanged, followed by daily medium changes. To harvest the cells, culture medium was removed, and hepatocytes were dissolved in 0.4 ml of ATL lysis buffer.

The overall level of replication was reduced to different degrees, however.

In the case of S245A, however, a direct effect of the core protein must be assumed. Northern blot analysis of total and capsid-associated viral RNA showed that RNA encapsidation was not reduced (Fig. 2B) suggesting that a later step of replication and/or capsid stability was affected..

Prompted by this observation we tested the nuclease sensitivity of the respective S245 substitution mutants. Incubation of capsids with micrococcal nuclease for 5 h resulted in an up to 50% decrease of total viral DNA (Fig. 2A, right panel). Strikingly, however, capsid-associated rcDNA but not ssDNA was nuclease-sensitive in mutants S245D and S245A. By contrast, the relative abundance of the respective DNA species was unchanged for wild-type and S245N (compare right and left panel, Fig. 2A). Degradation of S245D-associated rcDNA was observed after prolonged nuclease treatment only, while S245A-associated rcDNA was degradable within one hour, suggesting that S245D capsids were more nuclease-resistant than S245A capsids. To address the question whether S245A capsids offer any protection of rcDNA a nuclease titration assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 2C, S245A-associated rcDNA was more nuclease-resistant than naked rcDNA but the difference was small.

To address this issue S245A capsids were further analyzed by immunoprecipitation and density gradient sedimentation. Fig. 3 shows that rcDNA specifically co-precipitated with wild-type as well as mutant core protein. When subjected to density gradient sedimentation, rcDNA co-localized with particulate core protein (Fig. 4). Furthermore, there was no evidence for an accumulation of monomeric/dimeric core protein relative to particulate core protein, as would have been expected in the case of complete capsid disintegration. Identical results were obtained for mutants S245D and S245N (data not illustrated).

Possible reasons accounting for this observation include differences in local protein structure preferred by alanine and aspartic acid compared with serine and asparagine and/or electrostatic repulsion of DNA by aspartic acid. Furthermore, hydrogen bonding mediated by non-phosphorylated serine as well as asparagine may contribute to the stabilization of the quarterny structure of mature DHBV capsids. The precise structural properties of mutant capsids that are associated with the nuclease-sensitivity of mature viral DNA remain to be further elucidated. We obtained no evidence for a complete disintegration of mature S245A capsids in immunoprecipitation experiments and the density gradient sedimentation assay. It should be noted, however that, partially dissociated S245A capsids may have reassembled after DNA release with rcDNA remaining attached to the outside of the capsid. Alternatively, the sensitivity of rcDNA may simply be based on an increased "breathing" of the capsid. This phenomenon involves the slow release of capsid subunits followed by a rapid reformation of the capsid integrity, as discussed previously for HBV capsids (25)..

The fact that nuclease treatment is commonly used to remove plasmid DNA prior to extraction of nucleocapsid associated hepadnaviral DNA explains why fully mature DNA forms have not been observed earlier.

The residual cccDNA formation by mutant S245N could be due to nuclear import of small amounts of core protein mediated by the remaining, unchanged phosphorylation sites. This may be difficult to detect by immunofluorescence since the polyclonal anti-DHBV core antibody may not react well with core protein dimers in fixed cells.

0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	63	Collectively, our observations suggest the following model: maturation of rcDNA within the nucleocapsid is an important trigger of capsid destabilization, which ultimately results in DNA release. During viral assembly hydrogen bonds formed by non-phosphorylated serine 245 contribute to the stabilization of nucleocapsids thus preventing DNA liberation in the cytoplasm. During infection, phosphorylation of serine 245 directs the capsid to the nucleus. At the same time nucleocapsids are destabilized thus facilitating rcDNA release in the nucleus. These mechanisms would also apply to progeny capsids that are redirected to the nucleus for cccDNA amplification. How newly formed DHBV capsids are directed to the secretory pathway remains to be elucidated, however, since Mabit and Schaller (13) have shown that dephosphorylation alone is not sufficient to confer membrane affinity. The suggested model is in line with the previous observation in the duck model that serum-derived nucleocapsids are non-phosphorylated whereas nucleocapsids from liver tissue are highly phosphorylated (14). It is tempting to speculate that incoming and recycling capsids are phosphorylated by a capsid-associated kinase activity of cellular origin, which has been described in the WHV and HBV system (27 to 33)..

During viral assembly hydrogen bonds formed by non-phosphorylated serine 245 contribute to the stabilization of nucleocapsids thus preventing DNA liberation in the cytoplasm. During infection, phosphorylation of serine 245 directs the capsid to the nucleus. At the same time nucleocapsids are destabilized thus facilitating rcDNA release in the nucleus.

Clearly, however, the remaining phosphorylation sites within DHBV core may play an important role as well, since earlier reports indicate that serine 259 also affects viral infectivity (10, 16). It remains to be elucidated which and how many residues of individual nucleocapsids are phosphorylated at a given time point and how core protein phosphorylation is orchestrated during capsid assembly and disassembly. Further studies in the HBV and WHV system will have to establish whether mammalian core protein phosphorylation is essential for infectivity as well. The recently described infection of primary tupaia hepatocytes (34) might represent a suitable model to address this question. Interestingly, phosphorylation of capsid protein by capsid-associated kinase activities has also been suggested to play a key role during the early steps of HIV infection (35). Thus, phosphorylation might represent a general mechanism regulating the targeted genome release from viral capsids..

When mutated, these genes cause either precocious or retarded developmental phenotypes, in which stage-specific patterns of cell division and differentiation are either skipped or reiterated, respectively. We identified a new heterochronic gene, lin-46, from mutations that suppress the precocious phenotypes caused by mutations in the heterochronic genes lin-14 and lin-28. lin-46 mutants on their own display retarded phenotypes in which cell division patterns are reiterated and differentiation is prevented in certain cell lineages. Our analysis indicates that lin-46 acts at a step immediately downstream of lin-28, affecting both the regulation of the heterochronic gene pathway and execution of stage-specific developmental events at two stages: the third larval stage and adult. We also show that lin-46 is required prior to the third stage for normal adult cell fates, suggesting that it acts once to control fates at both stages, and that it affects adult fates through the let-7 branch of the heterochronic pathway. Interestingly, lin-46 encodes a protein homologous to MoeA of bacteria and the C-terminal domain of mammalian gephyrin, a multifunctional scaffolding protein. Our findings suggest that the LIN-46 protein acts as a scaffold for a multiprotein assembly that controls developmental timing, and expand the known roles of gephyrin-related proteins to development..

A mutation in a heterochronic gene results in either precocious or retarded development in which stage-specific patterns of cell division and differentiation are either skipped or reiterated, respectively. For example, lin-14 and lin-28 are two heterochronic genes that act early in larval development: lin-14 loss-of-function (lf) mutant animals precociously execute events specific to the second larval stage (L2) and later, and lin-28(lf) animals precociously execute events specific to the third larval stage (L3) and later (Fig. 1) (Ambros and Horvitz, 1984).

For example, lin-28 is involved immediately in the L2 fate decision, but indirectly affects adult differentiation programs (Ambros, 1989). In particular, lin-28(lf) causes precocious execution of the larva-to-adult (L/A) switch, during which lateral hypodermal seam cells cease dividing, differentiate, and produce adult alae, a cuticle structure. However, molecular analysis has shown that lin-28 expression is repressed three stages before the L/A switch (Moss et al., 1997; Seggerson et al., 2002). lin-28 affects the L/A switch via the expression of other heterochronic genes, let-7, lin-41, lin-57 and lin-29 (see Fig. 5; Ambros; 1989; Rougvie and Ambros, 1995; Slack et al., 2000; Abrahante et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2003)..

The circled regulators x and y have not been identified and may in fact represent multiple factors. lin-14 is depicted in its role in the L2/L3 fate decision only (lin-14B activity). The position of daf-12 is based on previous studies (Antebi et al., 1998; Seggerson et al., 2002); its role does not appear to be analogous to that of lin-46. (Right) Interactions governing the L/A switch. The effect of lin-28 or lin-46 on let-7 expression or activity has not been determined, and may be indirect. The linear pathway from let-7 to adult fates is based on previous studies (Abrahante et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2003). (B) A molecular model for LIN-46 protein function. LIN-46 may scaffold a multiprotein assembly constituting a developmental timing complex that regulates the expression of downstream heterochronic genes and promotes L3- and adult-specific cell fates. Broken arrow indicates that the effects of the complex may be either positive or negative, and either direct or indirect. LIN-28 may act as a negative regulator of one or more components of that complex, probably at the level of gene expression..

Specifically, lin-14 apparently acts alone to govern L1 cell fates, then it interacts with lin-28 to choose cell fates that will occur in the L2 (Ambros, 2000). lin-14 and lin-28 are engaged in a complex genetic circuitry that involves both positive and negative regulatory interactions (see Fig. 5A) (Seggerson et al., 2002). This circuitry involves the microRNA lin-4 as well as other as yet unidentified components (Lee et al., 1993; Arasu et al., 1991; Moss et al., 1997; Seggerson et al., 2002).

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	39	Both mutant alleles of lin-46 completely suppressed the protruding vulva (Pvul) and egg-laying defective (Egl) phenotype of three different lin-28 null alleles (Table 1, lines 2 and 3, and data not shown) (Moss et al., 1997). The Pvul and Egl phenotypes of lin-28(lf) are due in part to precocious vulva precursor cell (VPC) divisions and vulva development (Euling and Ambros, 1996). We observed that lin-28(lf); lin-46(lf) animals had wild-type timing of vulva development, with VPC divisions occurring in the L3 stage (Fig. 1; data not shown). lin-28 also governs the choice between L2- and L3-specific fates in the lateral hypodermal seam cells (Ambros and Horvitz, 1984). Normally during the L1, L3 and L4 stages, most seam cells undergo a single asymmetric cell division, after which the anterior daughter joins the hypodermal syncytium and the posterior daughter remains a seam cell (Fig. 1, wild type, Vn). However, in the L2 of wild-type animals, the asymmetric division of certain seam cells (V1-4, V6) is preceded by a symmetric division, which increases the number of seam cells on each side of an animal by five; additional seam cells are also added at this stage by descendants of other hypodermal cells (H1 and T; Table 1, line 1; Fig. 1) (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977). lin-28(lf) animals have fewer seam cells than wild type, because they skip L2 lineage patterns that generate these additional seam cells; lin-28(lf) animals also cease the molting after only three cycles because of precocious execution of the L/A switch (Table 1, line 2; Fig. 1) (Ambros and Horvitz, 1984). We found that the lin-28(lf); lin-46(lf) animals had the normal number of seam cells at every stage, as well as the normal four molts, indicating suppression of the L2 lineage defects of lin-28(lf) by the lin-46 mutation (Table 1, line 3; Fig. 1). Furthermore, lin-46(lf) completely suppressed the precocious L/A switch, as indicated by synthesis of adult alae, caused by lin-28(lf) (Table 2, lines 3 and 4; Fig. 1). These data indicate that lin-46 affects all fate decisions governed by lin-28 and that the absence of lin-46 activity completely bypasses the requirement of the animal for lin-28..

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	42	  By contrast, we observed no suppression of any of the precocious heterochronic defects of a lin-14 null allele. For example, like lin-14(0) animals, lin-46(lf); lin-14(0) animals are completely egg-laying defective and execute the L/A switch precociously (Table 2, lines 5 and 6; data not shown). However, surprisingly, one of the lin-46 mutant alleles (ma174) was isolated as a suppressor of lin-14(n179ts) animals. lin-14(n179ts) is a loss-of-function and temperature-sensitive allele (Ambros and Horvitz, 1984; Ambros and Horvitz, 1987). As mentioned above, lin-14 acts twice during larval development: once to affect L1 cell fates (lin-14A activity), and again to affect L2 and later fates (lin-14B activity) (Ambros and Horvitz, 1987). When lin-14(n179ts) animals are raised at 25 degrees C they display both a loss of lin-14A activity, causing a precocious increase in seam cell number and a loss of lin-14B activity, which leads to precocious execution of the L/A switch (Table 1, line 5; Table 2, line7). We found that a mutation in lin-46(lf) suppressed lin-14B defects, but not the lin-14A defects, of the lin-14(n179ts) allele. Specifically, lin-46(lf); lin-14(n179ts) animals had an abnormal number of seam cells in the L1, but had the normal number of molts (Table 1, line 6). Furthermore, compared with lin-14(n179ts) animals, the lin-46(lf); lin-14(n179ts) animals were significantly less egg-laying defective and showed reduced amounts of precocious adult alae (Table 1, line 6; Table 2, line 8). Similarly, the precocious adult alae formation of lin-14(n360), a lin-14(lf) allele that displays only lin-14B defects, was suppressed by lin-46(lf) (Table 2, lines 9 and 10) (Ambros and Horvitz, 1987). In addition, we observed that intestinal nuclei of lin-46(lf); lin-14(n179ts) animals fail to divide in the L1 as they normally do, which is a lin-14A defect, but did not display precocious vulva development, a lin-14B defect (data not shown) (Ambros and Horvitz, 1987; Euling and Ambros, 1996). Thus, lin-46(lf) suppressed the defects that lin-14 hypomorphic alleles have in common with lin-28(lf), but not those unique to lin-14, although it suppressed none of the defects of a lin-14 null allele..

By contrast, the suppression of lin-14 hypomorphic alleles was substantial, albeit incomplete.

It has been previously shown that a lin-28(lf); lin-14(0) strain executes the L/A switch one stage earlier than a lin-14(0) strain; however, the effect of this mutant combination on seam cell number was not assessed (Ambros, 1989). We observed that the increase of 10 to 15 seam cells that occurs abnormally early during the L1 in lin-14(0) animals did not occur in the absence of lin-28, consistent with an L3 lineage pattern occurring two stages early (Table 3, lines 1 and 3). This observation indicates the hypodermal lineage patterns executed in the L1 in lin-14(0) animals are controlled by lin-28, and is evidence that lin-28 acts independently of lin-14 to govern these cell fate choices..

Animals bearing a transcriptional fusion (see Materials and methods) showed intense fluorescence in lateral hypodermal cells around the time of each molt, especially during the L2- and L4-lethargus (Fig. 4A,B). In L2 animals, not all seam cells fluoresced simultaneously, and often only a cluster of an even number of cells fluoresced in a given animal, suggesting the expression of the fusion is related to seam cell division, which occurs somewhat asynchronously during larval development (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977). A translational fusion reporter showed a similar expression pattern, although it was less intense (Fig. 4C). The translational fusion also showed strong constitutive expression in the cell bodies and axons of the bilateral motor interneurons AVB, but we do not know the significance of this expression. The LIN-46:GFP fusion protein localized to both cytoplasm and nucleus, but mostly in the non-nucleolar part of the nucleus (Fig. 4D). Thus, LIN-46 is present in cells whose fates it governs near the time they execute stage-specific fates.

These data indicate that the period that lin-46 mutant animals are cold sensitive for the adult alae defect is prior to the L3 stage.

Based on molecular analysis, the alleles of lin-28 and lin-46 used in these experiments are null (Fig. 3) (Moss et al., 1997). Thus, their mutual suppression implies that lin-28 and lin-46 affect a common process, but do not act in a simple linear pathway. If it were a simple pathway, then the lin-28(lf); lin-46(lf) animals would display the same degree of retarded development as lin-46(lf) animals. Furthermore, the difference in penetrance of the lin-28(lf) and lin-46(lf) phenotypes suggests they have different degrees of influence on cell fates. Specifically, whereas a lin-28(lf) is always fully precocious, the lin-46(lf) retarded phenotype is incomplete and conditional. For these reasons, we propose that lin-46 is not directly part of the lin-14/lin-28 positive feedback circuit, and therefore is not itself y, but rather acts to promote the activity of y (Fig. 5A)..

In other words, cell fates at the L2 stage in a lin-28(lf) are more sensitive to the loss of lin-46 than are fates at the L3 in wild type (Table 1; Fig. 1). Perhaps the decision to execute L3 fates is more robust at the third larval stage in wild type because of additional activities that are not present at the second larval stage in a lin-28 mutant. Furthermore, in no situation does the absence of lin-46 cause L2-specific cell fates to be reiterated indefinitely, further suggesting that additional factors come to influence the L2/L3 fate decision, ultimately in favor of L3 fates..

Two models have been proposed to explain the activities of lin-14, lin-14A and lin-14B that independently affect L1 and later developmental events (Ambros and Horvitz, 1987). One is that different isoforms of the LIN-14 protein possess these distinct activities (Wightman et al., 1991; Reinhart and Ruvkun, 2001). However, this model is not supported by the finding that a molecular clone of a single isoform of LIN-14 can fully rescue lin-14(lf) (Hong et al., 2000). A second model is that the LIN-14 protein forms a temporal gradient through larval development, analogous to morphogen gradients in the Drosophila embryo (Ruvkun and Giusto, 1989; Reinhart and Ruvkun, 2001). However, our findings indicate that lin-14 affects L2 developmental events only through lin-28, which requires a genetic circuit between these genes that engages late in the first larval stage (Table 3) (Seggerson et al., 2002). In other words, the lin-14B activity essentially reflects the participation of lin-14 in a positive feedback circuit with lin-28..

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	90	This model explains why lin-46(lf), which bypasses the requirement for lin-28, suppresses the L2 defects of lin-14(lf) but not its L1 defects. Hypomorphic alleles of lin-14, such as lin-14(n360) and lin-14(n179ts) used in these studies, reduce the activity of lin-14, but do not eliminate it. At the end of the first larval stage, when the positive feedback circuit between lin-14 and lin-28 is engaged, a mutation in lin-14 would lead to a reduction in lin-28 expression, and then a further reduction in lin-14. We have previously proposed that y in our model mediates the reduction of lin-14 in this circuit (Fig. 5A, left) (Seggerson et al., 2002). However, if lin-46 is absent, the activity of y would be attenuated and the reduction of lin-14 would not be further amplified. Therefore, lin-46(lf) suppresses a lin-14 hypomorph by essentially upregulating the existing lin-14 activity. As a corollary, we propose that part of the reduction of lin-14 activity of hypomorphic alleles is due to further downregulation via the positive feedback circuit..

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	92	Importantly, the reason a lin-46 mutation does not suppress a lin-14 null allele is twofold: first, lin-14 normally acts through the feedback circuit and lin-28 to control the L2/L3 fate choice, as we have shown (Table 3); and second, the lin-28-repressive component of the feedback circuit is not engaged early in the first larval stage of a lin-14 mutant, as has been shown previously (Seggerson et al., 2002). Therefore, the effects of lin-28 and lin-46 on the L2/L3 fate decision are independent of the feedback circuit because they occur in the early L1 when lin-14 is absent. Supporting this conclusion is our observation that lin-46(lf) causes a severe retarded phenotype in a lin-14(0) background at 15 degrees C (Table 4). Thus, the different genetic interactions lin-46 has with lin-14 and lin-28 reflect the underlying change in the relationship between lin-14 and lin-28 that occurs at the end of the L1 stage with the engagement of the lin-4-independent feedback circuit (Fig. 5A) (Seggerson et al., 2002)..
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	93	lin-46 affects L3 and adult fates independently Our data also indicate that the role of lin-46 in regulating the L/A switch appears to be independent of its role in the L2/L3 fate decision. Specifically, lin-46(lf) animals grown at 20 degrees C display normal cell lineage patterns early, but at the same temperature there is significant failure of the L/A switch at the L4 stage (Tables 1 and 4; Fig. 1). Thus, the failure of the L/A switch in lin-46(lf) animals can occur without a prior lineage defect. Because lin-46:GFP reporters are expressed in the L4 stage (Fig. 4B), this independence of early and late retarded defects may reflect that lin-46 acts twice, once to promote L3 fates and again later to promote adult-specific fates. However, we found that the cold-sensitive period of lin-46(lf) strain for the adult fates is prior to the L3 stage. This finding suggests that lin-46 normally acts only once at a branch-point in the heterochronic pathway where some of its targets influence L3 fates immediately, and other targets, which are more sensitive to its absence, govern adult fates (Fig. 5A). This latter possibility is consistent with lin-46 acting at a step immediately downstream of lin-28. In our model, therefore, y may represent multiple factors, some of which affect the L2/L3 fate decision and the regulation of lin-14, and others which affect the L/A switch through the other known heterochronic genes (Fig. 5A). One possibility is that lin-28 and lin-46 directly affect the microRNA let-7, which then regulates other genes that control the L/A switch (Fig. 5A). This is consistent with the failure of lin-46(lf) to suppress the precocious phenotypes of the later-acting genes lin-41 and lin-57 (Table 2). Further analysis will determine whether lin-46 and lin-28 indeed affect the expression or activity of let-7. Because let-7 or let-7-like microRNAs have been hypothesized to regulate lin-14, it is an intriguing possibility that some of factors that constitute y are microRNAs..

The crystal structure of MoeA shows it to exist as a homodimer, and it is likely that proteins with sequence similarity to MoeA do so as well (Schrag et al., 2001; Xiang et al., 2001). We have observed that the LIN-46 protein strongly interacts with itself in a yeast two hybrid assay, further suggesting LIN-46 forms multimers (L. Tang and E.G.M., unpublished). Gephyrin is believed to dimerize with itself via its C-terminal MoeA-like region, and trimerize with its N-terminal MogA-like region (see Fig. 3). The ability of gephyrin to multimerize and form a scaffold is the basis for its ability to cluster and aid the activity of interacting proteins (Schwarz et al., 2001). Although gephyrin is known to act both in synaptic transmission and in molybdenum co-factor biosynthesis, LIN-46 does not appear to have a role in either of these processes in C. elegans; possibly its paralog, MOC-1, has these roles. We speculate that a general feature of proteins related to gephyrin, therefore, may be their ability to form scaffolds that avail them to participating in diverse biological roles, including development..

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	97	Based on several lines of evidence, including the homology to gephyrin, we propose a molecular model for LIN-46 in which it acts as a scaffolding protein for a multiprotein complex that determines cell fates (Fig. 5B). Supporting this model is the striking cold sensitivity of lin-46 null alleles (Table 2). Cold sensitivity can be a feature of mutations affecting the dynamics of multiprotein structures, such as microtubules and bacteriophage capsids (Huffaker et al., 1988; Bazinet et al., 1990). LIN-46 may potentiate the activity of a complex that includes cell fate regulators or other developmental timing factors. LIN-46 is not essential for the activity of this complex, because development of a lin-46 null mutant is nearly normal at 20 degrees C, but the absence of LIN-46 protein may substantially reduce the activity of the complex at low temperature, possibly by causing the retention of a negative regulator of the complex. Because the LIN-28 protein appears to be a specific mRNA-binding protein (Moss et al., 1997), the expression of some of the components of the complex may be repressed when lin-28 is normally active (Fig. 5B). The suppression of the loss of lin-28 activity would therefore result from balance between the overexpression of components of the complex, and reduced efficiency of their function..

Virol., 73, 4972 to 4982). We, therefore, investigated whether papillomavirus (PV) wt L1 protein expression could be enhanced in eukaryotic cells following exogenous tRNA supplementation. Both Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and Cos1 cells, transfected with PV1 wt L1 genes, effectively transcribed the genes but did not translate them. However, L1 protein translation was demonstrated following co-transfection with the L1 gene and a gene expressing tRNASer(CGA). Cell lines, stably transfected with a bovine papillomavirus 1 (BPV1) wt L1 expression construct, produced L1 protein after the transfection of the tRNASer(CGA) gene, but not following the transfection with basal vectors, suggesting that tRNASer(CGA) gene enhanced wt L1 translation as a result of endogenous tRNA alterations and phosphorylation of translation initiation factors elF4E and elF2 in the tRNASer(CGA) transfected L1 cell lines. The tRNASer(CGA) gene expression significantly reduced translation of L1 proteins expressed from codon-modified (HB) PV L1 genes utilizing mammalian preferred codons, but had variable effects on translation of green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) expressed from six serine GFP variants. The changes of tRNA pools appear to match the codon composition of PV wt and HB L1 genes and serine GFP variants to regulate translation of their mRNAs. These findings demonstrate for the first time in eukaryotic cells that translation of the target genes can be differentially influenced by the provision of a single tRNA expression construct..

Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) play a central role in translation, acting as the carrier of the monomeric units of proteins, the amino acids and the growing polypeptide chains (2). Both tRNA and mRNA eventually pair on the ribosome to determine which amino acid is inserted at a particular point in the nascent polypeptide chain. To ensure protein synthesis, correct base pairing between the three bases of the codons on the mRNAs and those of the anticodons of the cognate aminoacyl (aa)-tRNAs dictates the sequence of the polypeptide chain. In addition, the cellular content of tRNA isoaccepting species is clearly a determinant of the rates and amounts of protein synthesis (3). In unicellular organisms, a correlation between tRNA content constraint and gene expression level has been demonstrated using the concept of optimal codons (4). A shortage of critical tRNAs could result in slowed elongation of the nascent peptide or premature termination of translation (5,6). The tRNAs from uninfected cells can rescue the translation of global proteins in Autographa california nucleopolyhedrovirus-infected Ld652Y cells (7). Stimulated expression of GTase with tRNAAGA and tRNAAGG resulted in a 5-fold increase in GTase production in Escherichia coli, in which codon usage is highly biased and the tRNAs specific to codons AGAarg and AGGarg are extremely rare (8). Expression of a single tRNA gene has enhanced the expression of heterologous genes, especially for genes containing rare codons in bacterial expression systems (9,10).

Recently, a human tRNASer(CGA) gene has been cloned and expressed in mammalian cells (15,16). The cloned human tRNASer(CGA) gene containing 400 bp has previously been verified for its integrity and functionality (15,16), via its ability to act in reverse transcription of a retroviral vector harboring a complementary primer binding site sequence (16). The human tRNASer(CGA) molecule was originally identified via a screening of the human BOSC23 retroviral packaging cell line (17) for tRNA molecules functionable as primers for murine leukemia virus (MLV) replication (16). But it is not clear whether this tRNASer(CGA) molecule could be functional for protein translation of MLV and other viruses. More recently, tRNA-like structure of turnip yellow mosaic virus has been reported to be a 3'-translational enhancer, which enhanced expression of a firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter gene up to 25-fold (18). Therefore, we are interested to investigate whether and how the expression of the human tRNASer(CGA) gene would affect the expression of wild-type (wt) and codon-modified (HB) papillomavirus (PV) L1 genes in cultured mammalian cells..

More recently, tRNA-like structure of turnip yellow mosaic virus has been reported to be a 3'-translational enhancer, which enhanced expression of a firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter gene up to 25-fold (18). Therefore, we are interested to investigate whether and how the expression of the human tRNASer(CGA) gene would affect the expression of wild-type (wt) and codon-modified (HB) papillomavirus (PV) L1 genes in cultured mammalian cells..
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	10	Both wt and HB PV L1 genes were chosen as the target genes throughout the experiments; we initially considered the choice for three reasons. First, PVs are exclusively epitheliotropic viruses. The PV life cycle is tightly linked to epithelial cell differentiation. Production of viral capsid proteins (L1 and L2) expressed from the late gene (L1 and L2) is restricted to the most terminally differentiated keratinocytes in the upper layers of the epithelium. Expression of L1 and L2 proteins from wt PV L1 and L2 genes has not been observed in proliferating transfected keratinocytes (19) and other replicating mammalian cells (20). However, mRNAs encoding the capsid proteins can be detected in less-differentiated keratinocytes and other replicating mammalian cells, suggesting that the expression of the late genes is post-transcriptionally regulated (21). When the L1 and L2 genes are cloned under cytomegalovirus (CMV) or simian virus 40 (SV40) promoters in continuously growing transformed cell lines in transient transfection assays, large amounts of PV L1 and L2 mRNAs are made, but no proteins can be detected (20). Second, blockage to the translation of PV L1 mRNAs has been overcome by two means: point mutation (19) and codon modification (20,22 to 24). Introduction of point mutations in the 5' end of the L1 gene which altered the RNA sequence without affecting the protein sequence resulted in the production of high levels of HPV 16 L1 mRNA and protein in HeLa cells (19). Codon modification of the PV L1 and L2 genes utilizing mammalian preferred codons without changing the protein sequence can express L1 and L2 proteins in large amounts in replicating mammalian cells (20,22 to 24). The argument proposed from the codon modification studies is that codon usage of the PV L1 and L2 genes may be a major determinant of PV capsid protein expression. The observation we made recently that bovine papillomavirus (BPV) 1 can undergo its life cycle in BPV1 virus-infected Saccharomyces cerevisiae (25,26) supports this argument because codon usage of BPV1 genes more closely resembles that of yeast genes than that of the mammalian consensus (20). The low expression efficiency of several viral proteins in HIV due to unfavorable codon usage has been reported by various groups (27 to 29). Third, provision of exogenous tRNAs either from bovine liver or from yeast could greatly assist the translation of the BPV1 L1 gene and human PV 16 (HPV16) E7 translation in different in vitro translation systems (20,30). These observations support the argument that codon usage of the mRNAs tends to be matched to the population of tRNAs in cells to regulate the translational efficiency. Previous studies have indicated that codon usage in highly expressed genes is biased toward  optimal  codons corresponding to the tRNAs in the tissue or cell environments (31). Varenne et al. (31) reported that synthesis of a number of colicins is linked to the difference in tRNA availability for the various codons. However, it is not clear whether and how the tRNA abundance in cells matches the corresponding codons in mRNAs of the target genes to regulate their expression at the translational levels in specific mammalian cell lines..

Briefly, both BPV1 and HPV6b wt L1 open-reading frames (ORFs) are 1.5 kb in length encoding 500 amino acids.

We artificially modified BPV1 and HPV6b L1 genes, in which the L1 ORFs are substituted with codons preferentially used in the mammalian genome. We made about 250 base substitutions in 250 codons rarely used in mammalian cells to produce unmodified L1 proteins encoded from the L1 ORFs with consensus codon usage using the strategy previously reported (20).

To study whether provision of a single tRNA species similarly affected L1 expression, we examined BPV1 L1 transcription and translation in CHO and Cos1 cells transfected with BPV1 L1 gene constructs, either unmodified or codon modified to match eukaryotic consensus codon usage, and co-transfected with a tRNASer(CGA) expression construct. Northern blot hybridization revealed that both cell lines effectively transcribed BPV1 L1 whether or not codon modified (Figure 1A), confirming previous results obtained in our laboratory (20). Co-transfection of the tRNASer(CGA) expression construct did not affect the transcription of the BPV1 L1 gene in the two cell lines (Figure 1A). We then examined whether the L1 protein was expressed (Figure 1B). Neither cell line produced detectable L1 protein when transfected with the BPV1 wt L1 gene (Figure 1B), though, as previously shown (20), the codon-modified L1 gene was expressed. The L1 protein was expressed from the BPV1 wt L1 gene in cells co-transfected with the tRNASer (CGA) expression construct (Figure 1B). Immunofluorescent labeling confirmed that the L1 protein was expressed in both CHO and Cos1 cells following co-transfection of the BPV1 wt L1 and the tRNASer(CGA) expression constructs (Figure 1C). We also tested whether the tRNASer(CGA) gene could affect expression of the L1 gene from HPV 6b in the two cell lines, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). Thus, the tRNASer(CGA) gene product appeared to assist expression of L1 protein encoded by PV wt L1 genes in replicating mammalian cells..

Consistent with the L1 protein detected only in both CHO L1 and Cos1 L1 cells transfected with the tRNASer (CGA) gene (Figure 7), the results suggest that the phosphorylation of the two translation initiation factors elF4E and elF2 induced by the tRNASer(CGA) gene product may be involved in enhancing the translation of the L1 protein in the two cell lines examined..

To test our hypothesis, we examined whether the tRNASer(CGA) gene could affect expression of L1 protein encoded by a codon-modified BPV1 L1 gene (BPV1 HB L1), which has been demonstrated to translate L1 protein in large amounts in replicating mammalian cells in previous studies (20,30) and in the current one (Figure 1B). Both CHO and Cos1 cells transfected solely with BPV1 HB L1 gene or co-transfected with BPV1 HB L1 and tRNASer(CGA) genes, were incubated for 42 h and collected for L1 mRNA and protein expression analysis (Figure 9). Northern blot hybridization confirmed that the BPV1 HB L1 gene is effectively transcribed (Figure 9A). No significant differences in the levels of L1 mRNA between transfection solely with BPV1 HB L1 gene and co-transfection with BPV1 HB L1 and tRNASer genes were observed (Figure 9A), which was confirmed by quantitative RT to PCR analysis using the L1 mRNAs (data not shown). However, western blot analysis shows that the tRNASer(CGA) gene resulted in a reduction in the levels of the L1 protein expressed from the BPV1 HB L1 gene by  > 50% (Figure 9B) in the two cell lines, whereas ss-tubulin expression remained unaffected (Figure 9B). To confirm these observations, we examined whether expression of another codon-modified PV L1 gene, HPV6b HB L1, was also affected by expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene (Figure 9B). The results (Figure 9) are in agreement with those obtained in the experiments using BPV1 HB L1 gene, supporting the idea that tRNAs may complement the codon composition of genes to regulate gene translation in mammalian cells..

To test this hypothesis, we studied transcription and translation of the hm gfp gene and the six serine GFP variants in both CHO and Cos1 cells either transfected solely with hm gfp and six serine GFP variants or co-transfected with the GFP expression constructs and the tRNASer(CGA) gene. The serine GFP variants express the same protein sequences, but the six additional serines at the N-terminal of their GFP molecules following the AUG codon were encoded by one of the six serine codons (AGC, AGU, UCA, UCC, UCG and UCU), respectively. Northern blot hybridization revealed that the hm gfp gene and the six serine GFP variants were transcribed effectively in the two cell lines and co-transfection of the tRNASer(CGA) gene did not affect significantly the levels of their transcripts (data not shown). Western blot analysis first shows that all six serine GFP variants exhibited levels of immunoreactive GFPs significantly higher than hm gfp gene (Figure 10A), confirming our previous study that addition of serine codons to hm gfp gene downstream from the AUG increased significantly steady-state levels of GFP (35). Then, western blot analysis shows that co-transfection of the tRNASer(CGA) gene barely affected the levels of immunoreactive GFPs produced by hm gfp gene and two serine (AGC and UCU) GFP variants (Figure 10B).

The results cannot confirm our and other previous observations that supplementation of exogenous tRNAs enhanced the translation of PV L1 and E7 genes in in vitro translation systems (20,30), but they are consistent with the studies carried out by the other researchers that exogenous tRNAs have no effect on protein synthesis in permeabilized cells (32,38). The major reason is different translation machinery used in the in vitro translation systems and cell culture systems. Using CHO cell system, previous work has provided strong evidence that the translation apparatus is highly organized in cultured cells (32). Exogenous tRNAs cannot enter the translation machinery in cultured cells despite the fact that exogenous tRNA can rapidly distribute throughout the cells and can be aminoacylated by minor portion of the cellular aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) in permeabilized cells (38). Moreover, exogenous aminoacyl-tRNA in permeable cells is not sequestered and protected against RNase treatment, in contrast to endogenous tRNA molecules (39), because during translation endogenous tRNAs are never in a state in which they can mix with and be competed against by exogenous tRNA molecules (38). All of the above observations may explain why exogenous tRNAs did not play a role in enhancing the translation of PV L1 mRNA in both CHO and Cos1 cells examined in the present study if they were efficiently taken up by the two cell lines. It is also possible that exogenous tRNAs were not taken up by the cells so no functional roles could be identified..

For example, ovariectomy resulted in alterations in the population of uterine serine tRNA (40). Due to carcinogenesis, cellular tRNA distribution was shifted in the tRNA population with an increased level of initiator tRNAMet in the malignant tissues (44). Selenium, an essential trace element that functions in proteins (selenocysteine, Sec) critical for a variety of cellular processes, influences the level of the Sec tRNA[ser]sec population and the distribution of the Sec tRNA[ser]sec isoacceptors in both mammalian cells grown in culture (45) and mammalian tissues (46) and the turnover of Sec tRNA[ser]sec in CHO cells (43). The present data indicate further that the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene increased not only the relative levels of the tRNASer(CGA) and the initiator tRNAMet but also probably resulted in new tRNA species produced in the two cell lines. Consequently, expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene altered the gel profiles of the total tRNAs in the two cell lines. Our results are in agreement with previous studies (47 to 52) in that genes for expressing tRNA species introduced into cells change tRNA contents in the targeted cells. Thus, all the observations suggest that mammalian cells may have a sensitive mechanism to sense and respond to both changes in physiological factors and introduction of foreign tRNA genes, by altering their tRNA populations..

The present data indicate further that the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene increased not only the relative levels of the tRNASer(CGA) and the initiator tRNAMet but also probably resulted in new tRNA species produced in the two cell lines. Consequently, expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene altered the gel profiles of the total tRNAs in the two cell lines. Our results are in agreement with previous studies (47 to 52) in that genes for expressing tRNA species introduced into cells change tRNA contents in the targeted cells. Thus, all the observations suggest that mammalian cells may have a sensitive mechanism to sense and respond to both changes in physiological factors and introduction of foreign tRNA genes, by altering their tRNA populations..

Previously, there have been examples in which synthesis of a specialized protein is associated with expression of a single tRNA gene due to modification of the tRNA population in different expression systems (9,10). Expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene was then found to increases the synthesis of some cellular proteins in the present study. As a result, expression of 5 to 10% of total cellular proteins was increased in the L1 cells following transfection of the tRNASer(CGA) gene when compared to the control L1 cells. Our results support previous studies that tRNAs, even a single tRNA, affect protein expression encoded by heterologous genes in different expression systems (9,10,20,30,40,41). For example, tRNAs from oviducts of estrogen-stimulated chicks or from oviducts of laying hens produced an enhanced stimulation of ovalbumin synthesis in vitro (40). The use of tRNA (AGA/AGG) increased human interferon HUIFN-a2 and HCV core protein expression (9,10), but barely affected the human IFN-8 expression in an E.coli expression system (9,10). However, expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene reduced expression of L1 proteins encoded by the PV HB L1 genes and of GFP encoded by UCA serine variant and of some cellular proteins. The result was consistent with a few other studies. A tRNASer(UCN) gene flanked with the deafness-associated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) T7445C mutation at the 3' end causes an average reduction of 70% in the levels of the tested proteins and a decrease of 45% in protein synthesis rate in the cell lines analyzed (53). Recently, Akama and Beier (54) reported that co-transfection of Arabidopsis hypocotyls with amber suppressor tRNASer(CGA) gene and the GUS reporter gene resulted in 10% of the GUS activity found in the same tissue transformed solely with the GUS gene. Therefore, we can speculate that contents and modifications of the endogenous tRNAs have effects on the expression of a large number of both foreign and host genes through tRNA function in translation in mammalian cells. Our findings are consistent with the conclusion that the host cell tRNAs can affect the synthesis of gene products quantitatively and qualitatively in translating heterologous genes (55,56)..

Previous studies have reported that the expression of the PV capsid genes (L1 and L2) is controlled by several means: the late viral promoters depend on the differentiation status of the cells, polyadenylation signals terminate transcription before reaching the late regions (57 to 60) and mRNAs encoding the capsid proteins contain inhibitory elements that prevent nuclear export or destabilize the message (19,61 to 66). However, none of these studies produced the PV L1 and L2 proteins expressed from the wt L1 and L2 genes in replicating mammalian cells. In contrast, previous findings in our laboratory have indicated that a strong bias in codon usage is apparent between the papillomavirus and its host, which blocks BPV1 capsid genes from expressing their proteins in non-differentiated mammalian cells (20,33). On the basis of the hypothesis that the match between codon usage and tRNA contents regulates the gene expression at the protein levels (20), the limitation of PV capsid protein expression has been overcome by modifying the codon usage of these genes toward mammalian  consensus  without changing the protein sequence, demonstrating that codon usage is one of the determinants of the rate of HPV gene expression in non-differentiated mammalian cells (20,22 to 24,67). In the present study, we take a different approach to test the hypothesis that the match between codon usage and tRNAs regulate PV L1 genes to express their proteins. We expressed a tRNASer(CGA) gene in the two non-differentiated cell lines. Expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene resulted in alterations in tRNA patterns in the two cell lines examined, which enhanced translation of two PV wt L1 mRNAs that contain large numbers of the codons rarely used by mammalian genes (20,33). Meanwhile, the enhanced expression of the serine UCG GFP variant was probably corresponding to the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene according to a previous statement that correct translation of the UCG codon depends on the tRNASer(CGA) molecule (68). Although it has been reported that tRNA1Ser(G34) with the anticodon GGA can recognize not only UCC and UCU codons but also UCA and UCG codons (69), but the enhanced expression of the serine AGU GFP variant by the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene is presently not understood. Moreover, we observed that expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene resulted in a dramatic reduction in the translation of PV HB L1 and UCA serine GFP variant mRNAs in the two cell lines. Thus, the phenomena observed in the present study may be well explained by two previous statements by Del Tito et al. (55) and Hatfield et al. (70). These statements have described how the tRNAs in cells are related to the gene expression at translation levels: (i) if the level of certain tRNAs was low, then one would predict translational difficulties in decoding mRNA species containing large numbers of the rare codons (55) and (ii) the cellular content of tRNA species often correlates positively with the codon bias of mRNAs for the major homologous protein products (70). Taken together with these statements (55) and our previous studies (20), current data strengthen support for the hypothesis that codon usage matches tRNAs to regulate expression of the target genes in both non-differentiated and differentiated epithelium..

However, tRNAs must associate with their cognate aaRSs that catalyze the attachment of a particular amino acid to the 3' end of an appropriate tRNAs containing the anticodon corresponding to that amino acid to generate aminoacyl-tRNAs necessary for protein synthesis. But, it is not clear whether the expression and activities of any aaRSs is affected by the tRNASer(CGA) gene. Detailed studies are therefore necessary to examine how expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene affects the other components of the protein-synthesizing machinery, including the aaRSs and the elongator factors in the two cell lines..

This process is thought to involve formation of a transient  kissing  complex over the self-complementary loop bases, which then refolds into a more stable extended interaction. We have developed a novel experimental system that allows us to clearly detect the extended duplex in vitro. Ribozyme sequences were incorporated into or adjacent to the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus DIS stem, leading to the formation of a functional ribozyme only in the extended duplex conformer. Here we show that extended duplex formation results in ribozyme cleavage, thus demonstrating the double-stranded nature of the extended complex and confirming that refolding occurs via melting of the DIS stems. Loop complementarity is essential for extended duplex formation but no sequence requirements for the loops were observed. Efficiency of extended duplex formation is dependent on the strength of the loop to loop interaction, temperature, the magnesium concentration and is strongly accelerated by the viral nucleocapsid protein NCp7. Our ribozyme-coupled approach should be applicable to the analyses of other refolding processes involving RNA loop to loop interactions..

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	7	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Mature retroviral particles contain two positive-strand genomic RNAs, which are non-covalently linked within a region close to their 5' ends termed the dimer linkage structure (DLS). Retroviral RNA dimerisation is considered to play an important role in such essential processes like encapsidation, maturation or reverse transcription (1,2). Within the DLS of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), a highly conserved stem to loop structure was shown to be specifically required for the initiation of genomic RNA dimerisation. Deletion of this sequence element called the dimerisation initiation site (DIS) prevents dimerisation and leads to reduced infectivity as well as drastically reduced replication rates (3 to 7). The DIS element is a 35 nt stem to loop structure with an internal bulge and a hexameric palindromic sequence within the loop, which is flanked by highly conserved purine nucleotides (Fig. 1a). The most common self-complementary sequences in the DIS loop are GCGCGC (subtype B or LAI variant as well as subtype D) and GUGCAC (subtype A or MAL variant as well as subtype G and C of group O). Two purine nucleotides are usually located 5' adjacent to the palindromic sequence and one purine nucleotide at the 3' side. The DIS stem to loops were shown to interact with each other through Watson to Crick base pairing of their palindromic loop sequences forming a structure called a kissing complex. In the current model of DIS-mediated dimerisation, this kissing complex is converted into a more stable extended structure. While the loop to loop base pairing is maintained, the intramolecular base pairs of the DIS stems are opened and become involved in intermolecular interactions, forming a double-stranded RNA (8,9)..

The crystal structures obtained from 23mer RNAs that contain the loop as well as the apical stem of the kissing complex of both viral subtypes (MAL and LAI) are virtually identical. In both cases, the two hairpins are in perfect coaxial alignment, thereby strongly resembling the structure of the extended duplex. In contrast, the solution structure obtained by NMR reveals a different picture, with the loop closing bases unpaired and the kissing loop helix not in A-form geometry, but distorted and kinked.

While the hammerhead system uses the complete DIS wild-type sequence including the G/AGG internal bulge and has partially single-stranded ribozyme sequences attached, the DIS stem to loop in the leadzyme system differs from the wild-type stem to loop in sequence but is structurally similar as the RNAs are fully closed stem to loops.

In vitro transcribed H1 and L1 RNAs, which should be cleaved upon formation of functional ribozymes, were radioactively labelled at their 5' ends. We regularly used a 20- (hammerhead system) to 100-fold (leadzyme system) excess of unlabelled H2 or L2 RNAs to compete out H1 or L1 homodimer formation. We observed the appearance of ribozyme-specific cleavage products for the hammerhead and leadzyme systems (Fig. 3). The observed products correspond to the predicted 54 nt shortened H1 RNA or 6 nt L1 fragment as confirmed by RNAse T1 analysis. The amount of cleavage product and therefore the efficiency of extended duplex formation are strongly increased when the reaction is carried out at 55 degrees C compared with 37 degrees C as shown for the hammerhead system in Figure 3a (right). This is in agreement with previous data that show induction of extended duplex formation of DIS stem to loop RNAs at 55 degrees C (10). Furthermore, specific ribozyme cleavage is dependent on the presence of both L1 and L2 (Fig. 3b) or H1 and H2 (data not shown) RNAs. Additionally, cleavage products are formed only when Pb2+ is added to the leadzyme system (Fig. 3b, compare lanes 13 and 14) thereby demonstrating that the observed cleavage products result from the formation of a functional ribozyme as a consequence of extended duplex formation..

The efficiency of extended duplex formation is comparable with that observed for L1 and L2 RNAs, although the activity of the MAL constructs was slightly, but reproducibly less, efficient than the L1 and L2 RNAs with LAI sequences (compare Fig. 5a with Fig. 4c)..

L1nsc and L2nsc RNAs contain the non-self complementary loop sequences 5'-AAGAGAGGA-3' and 5'-AACUCUCCA-3', respectively (Fig. 5a). These non-self-complementary sequences are unable to form homodimers, which might interfere with the dimerisation reaction. Additionally, these RNAs do not have a central GC pair within the complementary hexanucleotide sequence of the loop, which had previously been suggested to be essential for dimerisation (8,9,21). As shown in Figure 5a, extended duplex formation of the nsc constructs is slightly more efficient than that of the MAL constructs. Therefore, dimerisation can be promoted by kissing complexes formed by sequences other than the wild-type palindromes. Neither self-complementarity nor the central GC nucleotides are required for the refolding reaction..

Some of these RNAs with short stems form the extended dimer even at lower temperatures (22). This is not unexpected as extended duplex formation requires opening of all DIS stem base pairs (12 in the case of L1 RNA) so they can then undergo intermolecular base pairing. This refolding process represents a kinetic barrier that has to be overcome to establish the thermodynamically more stable extended duplex conformation. We wanted to test the effect of higher temperature and of a shortened stem on extended duplex formation as well as the influence of the Mg2+ concentration on duplex formation..

These shorter constructs, termed L1s and L2s, were tested at 37 and 55 degrees C for their ability to form the extended duplex. At 37 degrees C, both L1/L2 and L1s/L2s show similar behaviour. At 55 degrees C we observed a slight but reproducible increase in cleavage efficiency that lies within the error range of the experiments. Therefore, weakening of the upper stem by only 2 bp is not sufficient to significantly increase the efficiency of extended duplex formation (Fig. 5b)..

Since at any temperature the known rate constants for ribozyme cleavage far exceed the rates of cleavage observed in our systems, the limiting step appears to be refolding rather than catalysis.

Indeed, it has been shown that NCp7 is able to convert low stability retroviral RNA dimers into more stable dimers in vitro (24 to 27). NCp7 also catalyses conversion of small DIS-like RNAs ( < 25 nt) into the extended duplex form (14). However, the specificity of this interaction is uncertain since NCp7 also acts as a general nucleic acid chaperone. It has been shown to posses nucleic acid annealing and strand exchange activity in vitro (28,29), RNA chaperone activity in vivo (30) and it also accelerates cleavage of the hammerhead ribozyme (19)..

To discriminate between general RNA to RNA annealing activity and a more specific action we used L1 and L2 RNAs but also the combination L1A and L2, which completely lacks loop complementarity. As shown in Figure 6c, NCp7 strongly increases extended duplex formation between L1 and L2 RNAs. Sixty percent of the RNAs are refolded after only 5 min at 37 degrees C compared with 10% in the absence of NCp7 (Fig. 6c, compare triangles and squares). The reaction levels off to reach 70% completion after 30 min. L1A/L2 RNAs, which lack loop complementarity and do not show any extended duplex formation at 55 degrees C in the absence of NCp7, do react in the presence of NCp7. We conclude that NCp7 strongly enhances specific extended duplex formation in our system, but to some extent also of RNAs without loop complementarity via its general nucleic acid structure destabilising activity..

The system consists of two HIV-1-derived DIS hairpins, each fused to one half of a ribozyme. Refolding of the heterodimeric DIS kissing complex into a partially double-stranded extended RNA duplex leads to formation of an active ribozyme and a specific cleavage event. The advantage of this system over previous analysis methods using native gel electrophoresis is the clear discrimination between kissing complex and extended duplex due to the formation of a cleavage product. The reversibility of the folding process reduces the applicability of native gel electrophoresis. The ribozyme system results in an irreversible and easily detectable product allowing a wide range of external parameters and structural requirements to be tested.

Our results further confirm the current model of HIV-1 DIS dimerisation involving refolding of the kissing complex with melting of the stems into a partially double-stranded dimer and rule out a hypothetical mechanism for extended duplex formation involving symmetric cleavage of both chains and subsequent religation (13). From crystal structure data, it was found that the 2' OH group of the second purine residue 5' to the complementary sequence is in favourable position for an in line attack on the neighbouring 3' phosphate. A mechanism involving a nucleophilic attack leading to strand scission, followed by a dangling movement of this base and cross religation of both RNAs was proposed. Such a mechanism would join both DIS stem to loop RNAs within their loop regions keeping the initial stems intact. If this were true, both parts of the ribozyme would remain separated from each other and would be unable to form a functional ribozyme. Our observation that extended duplex formation leads indeed to ribozyme cleavage therefore strongly supports the refolding model with the melting of the stems..

In contrast to previous reports investigating viral RNA dimerisation in vitro, we found that neither self-complementarity nor the central GC pairs within the palindrome are essential for refolding. It has been suggested that the central GC pairs are essential for efficient dimerisation in vitro possibly through the involvement in non-canonical base pair interactions by forming a potential nucleation point of the dimer (8,9,21). Our results are in accordance with in vitro selection data that show that this dinucleotide favours dimerisation but is not essential (31,32). Self-complementarity of the loops is evidently required for viral RNA dimerisation of homologous strands, but apparently not for the refolding process per se. These observations are particularly interesting given the fact that only two different loop sequences have been found in HIV-1 isolates, raising the question on the nature of the selective pressure for these two sequences since they can be substituted by other sequences for extended duplex formation in vitro. It has been shown that the entire HIV 5' leader RNA can adopt two different conformations, suggesting that sequence conservation might reflect the need to preserve these two structures (33)..

This suggests that loop to loop interaction through partial base pairing itself is sufficient for extended duplex formation at 55 degrees C, although full complementarity, as is the case for wild-type loop sequences, strongly enhances the efficiency of the refolding process. Assuming that reduction of loop complementarity does not affect refolding itself but only reduces kissing complex stability, then the previous findings of Berkhout and van Wamel (5) might be explained. These authors reported strongly reduced infectivity when two GC pairs were deleted from the palindrome of HIV-1 LAI subtype; however, purified virions still contained stable dimeric RNA. Reduced stability of the kissing complex might lead to a strong impairment of the packaging efficiency, but any loose dimers that happened to be encapsidated were still able to refold, forming stable dimers..

Additionally, it could be shown that the presence of magnesium ions enhances extended duplex formation although it is not essential for this process. High magnesium concentrations accelerated the reaction in a way that very efficient extended duplex formation could already be observed at 37 degrees C. This could be explained by a more efficient stabilisation of the kissing complex than that of the stems.

This small basic 55 amino acid long highly conserved RNA binding protein was reported to have general RNA chaperone activity (19,28). In vivo experiments demonstrated that a viral protease-dependent maturation resulting in the cleavage of the gag precursor to generate nucleocapsid protein is accompanied by conversion of the dimeric RNA particles into a more heat stable dimer (24,34). Our data show that NCp7-induced extended duplex formation is extremely efficient compared with the temperature-induced refolding. The amount of extended duplex formed by constructs lacking loop complementarity can be explained by the general RNA to RNA annealing activity of NCp7 (19). This might propose a model for how extended duplex formation is promoted by NCp7. It is conceivable that NCp7 induces kissing complex formation by its RNA to RNA annealing activity and/or by its helix destabilising activity (29). The kissing interaction might provide a stable and specific interaction surface as a starting point for an efficient refolding. In contrast, it might be the temporal availability and spatial location of NCp7 during the viral maturation cycle that allows it to use its general nucleic acid refolding activity in a specific manner. However, it should be mentioned that it is currently unclear how the data on DIS-mediated dimerisation obtained in vitro translate to the in vivo situation, given that there is no direct evidence that the mature form of the dimer inside the viral particle is an extended duplex..

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	4	To conserve carbohydrate reserves, the reaction of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) must be down-regulated when the citric acid cycle is provided sufficient acetyl-CoA. PDC activity is reduced primarily through increased phosphorylation of its pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component due to E1 kinase activity being markedly enhanced by elevated intramitochondrial NADH:NAD and acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios. A mechanism is evaluated in which enhanced kinase activity is facilitated by the build-up of the reduced and acetylated forms of the lipoyl moieties of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component through using NADH and acetyl-CoA in the reverse of the downstream reactions of the complex. Using a peptide substrate, kinase activity was stimulated by these products, ruling out the possibility kinase activity is increased due to changes in the reaction state of its substrate, E1 (thiamin pyrophosphate). Each E2 subunit contains two lipoyl domains, an NH-terminal (L1) and the inward lipoyl domain (L2), which were individually produced in fully lipoylated forms by recombinant techniques. Although reduction and acetylation of the L1 domain or free lipoamide increased kinase activity, those modifications of the lipoate of the kinase-binding L2 domain gave much greater enhancements of kinase activity. The large stimulation of the kinase generated by acetyl-CoA only occurred upon addition of the transacetylase-catalyzing (lipoyl domain-free) inner core portion of E2 plus a reduced lipoate source, affirming that acetylation of this prosthetic group is an essential mechanistic step for acetyl-CoA enhancing kinase activity. Similarly, the lesser stimulation of kinase activity by just NADH required a lipoate source, supporting the need for lipoate reduction by E3 catalysis..

Retention of a small portion of PDC lipoates lowered kinase activity but allowed stimulation of this residual kinase activity by these products. Reintroduction of lipoyl moieties, using lipoyl protein ligase, restored the capacity of the E2 core to support high kinase activity along with stimulation of that activity up to 3-fold by NADH and acetyl-CoA. As suggested by those results, the enhancement of kinase activity is very responsive to reductive acetylation with a half-maximal stimulation achieved with 20% of free L2 acetylated and, from an analysis of previous results, with acetylation of only 3-6 of the 60 L2 domains in intact PDC. Based on these findings, we suggest that kinase stimulation results from modification of the lipoate of an L2 domain that becomes specifically engaged in binding the kinase. In conclusion, kinase activity is attenuated through a substantial range in response to modest changes in the proportion of oxidized, reduced, and acetylated lipoyl moieties of the L2 domain of E2 produced by fluctuations in the NADH:NAD and acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios as translated by the rapid and reversible E3 and E2 reactions..

Flux through this reaction results in a net depletion of body carbohydrate reserves. The activity of PDC must be reduced when fatty acids or ketone bodies are being preferentially used to provide 2-carbon units for oxidative energy production by citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation systems, a routine situation in many organs. Furthermore, under conditions of starvation or diabetes, the activity of PDC is reduced to a minimal level to conserve carbohydrates essential for the brain and other specialized tissues/organs. To achieve its critical role in cellular fuel conservation, the PDC reaction is controlled primarily by a highly regulated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle which is carried out by dedicated kinase and phosphatase components. Phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component inactivates the complex and dephosphorylation reactivates the complex..

Studies with purified complex (7, 8, 9) and isolated mitochondria (10, 11, 12) found that increases of the PDC reaction products promote an increase in the proportion of PDC in the phosphorylated (inactive) state.

Not only are NADH and acetyl-CoA produced during mitochondrial oxidation of all fuels, they are direct products of the PDC reaction. This laboratory presented evidence that this control of kinase activity initially involves these product to substrate ratios being translated by competitive utilization in the downstream reactions of the complex which, in turn, adjusts the fraction of the complex's lipoyl prosthetic groups in the oxidized versus reduced versus acetylated forms(13, 14, 15, 16, 17) . Specifically, our mechanism proposes that kinase down-regulates PDC activity due to NADH reacting in the reverse of the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) reaction and acetyl-CoA reacting in the reverse of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) reaction. Typically a 60-80% enhancement in kinase activity occurs upon lipoate reduction and up to a 3-fold enhancement following lipoate acetylation. The potential for understanding the molecular basis of this control has greatly improved with new insights into the structure of E2 subunits and the unusual nature of the association of the kinase with E2..

Sixty COOH-terminal inner domains (E2) associate to form a dodecahedral inner core which catalyzes the transacetylation reaction. Each inner domain is connected to 3 globular domains by linker or hinge regions. The globular domains consist of two 10-kDa lipoyl domains (E2 and E2, or L1 and L2) and an E1-binding domain (E2) located between the inner core and the lipoyl domain region..

PDC kinase binds to the lipoyl domain region of E2 through an association that requires the lipoyl prosthetic group(24, 25, 26) . Using lipoylated and delipoylated forms of recombinant L1 and L2 of human PDC-E2(27) , the kinase was shown to bind preferentially to the lipoylated L2 (Fig. 1)(26) . The E1a kinase was also shown to interchange rapidly between L2 structures(26) . To account for tight binding and rapid interchange, a dynamic ``hand over hand'' mechanism is proposed in which a dimeric kinase alternates between being bound to one and two L2 domains. This interchange and catalytic function of the kinase exert their combined effects in the limited space at the surface of the complex where the a kinase molecule and many E1 components are tightly bound to the mobile outer domains of E2. The capacity of continuously bound kinase to phosphorylate bound E1 components more rapidly than free kinase can phosphorylate free E1 is termed E2-activated kinase function..

Most assays were conducted in a final volume of 50  microl of buffer A: 50 mM MOPS-K, 20 mM potassium phosphate, 60 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, and 0.4 mM dithiothreitol(16, 17) . Unless otherwise indicated, assays used 25-30  microg of PDC or 25  microg of E1 and 1  microg of E3. Some resolved E1 preparations have more E1a kinase; here such a preparation was a source of stable, E2-free kinase. ()The specific activity of E1-kinase was 0.44 nmol/min/mg when assayed in 20 mM potassium phosphate in the absence of E2; this indicates kinase represents about 0.4% of the protein in this E1 fraction. Unless otherwise indicated, the levels for the following reactants were: NADH and NAD at 3:1 ratio with final concentrations of 0.6 mM NADH and 0.2 mM NAD and acetyl-CoA or pyruvate at 50  microM, L1 or L2 at 16  microM, dihydrolipoamide at 20 to 200  microM, and E2 at 2  microg. Dihydrolipoamide was dissolved in HO containing 0.2 mM EDTA by warming the solution to 60  degrees C; it was critical that the stock solutions (0.2-2.0 mM) be maintained at room temperature (i.e. not placed on ice) to retain this ligand in solution. The latter was monitored with the E3 cycling reaction below. ATP was added last except in one experiment in which a concentrated fraction of delipoylated E2XK1K2 subcomplex was treated with ATP and lipoyl protein ligase and the subsequent kinase assays were performed without removal of residual ATP. In the latter series of assays, including those with parallel samples of untreated and delipoylated subcomplex, E1-kinase was added last to initiate kinase activity. For effective reductive acetylation of E2 lipoyl domains by E1, E1 was preincubated with 50  microM TPP and diluted 10 or 20-fold into kinase assays lacking additional TPP. Kinase (and acetylation) assays conducted with CoA removal were performed using the conditions described under acetylation studies. All control assays were conducted in triplicate or quadruplicate and other assays at least in duplicate. In these and other assays the absolute deviations are shown. Reactions were terminated by spotting samples to dry trichloroacetic acid-containing Whatmann No. 3MM with E1 as the substrate or to Whatmann P81 phosphocellulose paper disks with the peptide substrate, followed by steps previously described(16, 25) ..

The incubation mixture contained 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 1 mM EGTA and ratios of lipoyl-bearing structure to lipoamidase (w/w) 345:1 for PDC; of 180:1 for E2XK1K2; and of 100:1 for the human L2 domain. The extent of delipoylation was monitored by measuring either residual PDC activity or reconstituted PDC activity (below). A steep decline occurred only as the final 40% of lipoyl groups were removed from E2 and protein X. Final products were evaluated for their content of lipoyl groups by measuring the extents of acetylation by the CoA removal approach (described above). Delipoylation of isolated lipoyl domains was estimated from the loss of activity in the E3 cyclic assay. Free lipoate caused only a minor interference with the latter assay since lipoyl domains are much more efficient substrates; ()full delipoylation was judged to have occurred when the rate had dropped to that produced by an equivalent concentration of free lipoate. Delipoylation of L1 and L2 was also evaluated by the characteristic shift (mobility decrease) observed for these delipoylated domains in native gel electrophoresis(27) . All delipoylated preparations were examined by SDS-PAGE to ensure that no subunit degradation had occurred. In experiments in which delipoylation was followed by ligase treatment (below), the delipoylated preparations were treated with 0.4 mM PMSF for 15 min at 30  degrees C to terminate lipoamidase activity, and residual PMSF quenched with 0.5 mM dithiothreitol..

As in assays below, NAD and NADH were used at a 1:3 ratio to prevent inhibition of E3 by its conversion to the 4 e-reduced state. At this ratio, kinase activity is near maximally stimulated by NADH and maximally stimulated by the combination of NADH and acetyl-CoA. We used an E1 preparation that gave  < 1% activity in a PDC reaction mixture lacking TPP. As shown in Table 1, kinase activity was stimulated 50% by NADH and nearly 2-fold by the combination of NADH and acetyl-CoA in the phosphorylation of E1 whether or not E1 contained TPP cofactor. As expected(37) , kinase activity was reduced by TPP. However, the stimulation has been due to reversing the inhibitory effect of TPP or activation via the formation of a reaction intermediate on E1 (e.g. hydroxyethylidenethiamin pyrophosphate formed from acetyl-lipoate by E2)..

Without NADH, exposure to submillimolar levels of dithiothreitol allows acetylation of a small portion of the lipoyl groups by acetyl-CoA. The low stimulation of kinase that occurs in conjunction with the low level of acetylation in the absence of NADH agrees with previous studies (15, 16, 17) (cf. ``Discussion'').

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	46	Pyruvate StimulationStimulation by pyruvate was first reported by Cooper et al.(41) . Support for this stimulation occurring via reductive-acetylation of lipoyl moieties stems from the findings that adding low levels of pyruvate to TPP-containing PDC generates an increased kinase activity equivalent to that with NADH plus acetyl-CoA and that pyruvate is principally used in the reductive acetylation of oxidized lipoyl groups(13, 14, 15) . This mechanism for kinase stimulation predicts some TPP bound to E1 and a lipoyl domain source are required. Using a resolved TPP-dependent E1 preparation, containing low levels of kinase activity but completely free of E2, the kinase activity was not significantly enhanced by pyruvate and/or lipoyl domain in the absence of TPP (Table 2). Even in the presence of TPP, pyruvate failed to stimulate kinase activity with E1 unless lipoyl domains were added. Furthermore, a fragment of bovine E2 that contains both lipoyl domains (designated E2) was effective. The results are thus consistent with the view that the enhancement of kinase activity is mediated by the E1(TPP)-catalyzed acetylation of the E2 fragment. Furthermore, a very low level of E2 fragment (1  microM) was effective. This is below the level that gave a small enhancement of the kinase (up to 40%)(25) , suggesting a specific and possibly a stronger interaction of the kinase with acetylated-E2..
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	47	Lipoamidase Treatment of PDCThe proposed mechanism of lipoyl-mediated enhancement of kinase activity predicts that complete removal of lipoyl groups would abolish kinase stimulation. Lipoyl groups were removed by treatment of PDC, E2XK1K2 subcomplex, or isolated lipoyl domains with E. faecalis lipoamidase. The enhancement in kinase activity by the E2 component (in the absence of effectors) declines rapidly as the last portion of lipoyl groups is removed and the kinase tends to dissociate from E2(24) . Treating PDC for 150 min with lipoamidase (1  microg/345  microg of complex) produced a preparation of complex, PDCD, lacking  > 96% of the lipoyl groups, based on the maximal acetylation assay (see ``Experimental Procedures''). Delipoylation reduced kinase activity from 6.0 to 2.4 nmol minmg PDC, i.e. it removed most of E2 enhancement of kinase function (Fig. 2, PDC series). Surprisingly, PDCD could still be stimulated nearly 2-fold by NADH plus acetyl-CoA but the activity remained well below the fully lipoylated PDC control (Fig. 2). The delipoylated PDCD incorporated  < 5 acetyl groups per molecule of complex (M 7.5 10) under the same conditions. The retention of only a few lipoyl groups allowing effector stimulation can be explained by the lipoyl prosthetic group being a critical part of the high affinity binding site of the kinase and the kinase moving between lipoyl domains(25, 26) . This would allow the kinase to relocate to E2 subunits retaining lipoyl groups with the residual activity of this localized kinase still being enhanced by reductive acetylation of the remaining lipoyl groups (cf. ``Discussion'')..

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	56	Lipoyl Domain Role and Requirement for Acetyltransferase ReactionTo investigate the relative effectiveness of E2's lipoyl domains, the capacity of recombinant human lipoyl domains (L1 and L2) in mediating kinase stimulation was evaluated with resolved E1 in the presence of E3 and in the presence or absence of lipoyl domain-free E2 (Fig. 4). Kinase activity was increased slightly by NADH with the L1 domain but to a much larger extent by the L2 domain. In the absence of E2, acetyl-CoA had no effect, alone, nor did it enhance the effect of NADH alone. In the presence of acetyltransferase-catalyzing E2, kinase activity was stimulated by the combination of NADH and acetyl-CoA with the L1 domain, but not to the extent achieved with just NADH with the L2 domain (Fig. 4). An even larger (nearly 3-fold) enhancement of kinase activity was observed when a combination of effectors was added with L2 in the presence of E2. Since there seems to be no possible role of E2 other than catalyzing the transacetylation reaction, the results provide definitive support for the view that the stimulating effects of acetyl-CoA are mediated by lipoate acetylation. In the L2 + E2 series (Fig. 4), the enhancement by acetyl-CoA, alone, occurred with acetylation of L2 (below). The results establish a preferential role for L2 in mediating kinase stimulation in keeping with the preferential binding of the kinase to the L2 domain (26) (cf. ``Discussion'')..

This relationship was evaluated studying kinase activity and acetylation, in parallel, under conditions of controlled acetylation by the acetyl-CoA being completely consumed (Fig. 5). Low concentrations of acetyl-CoA were incubated with the L2 domain in the presence of E2, E3, and a 1:1 ratio of NADH:NAD along with the -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex plus -ketoglutarate to convert CoA produced into succinyl-CoA. The measured extents of acetylation confirmed that, at all but the highest level (24  microM), all the [1-C]acetyl-CoA was consumed in acetylating the L2 domain (16  microM). The enhancement of kinase activity increased with the level of acetylation with a half-maximal stimulation observed when 20% of the L2 were acetylated (Fig. 5). Though a low proportion of free L2, this is higher proportion of L2 acetylated than is required in the intact complex as explained under ``Discussion.'' The decline in stimulation at high levels of acetylation is also consistent with the latter studies with intact complex(15, 16, 17) ..

We were unable to do experiments in the absence of E3 because of trace E3 in our E1 and resolved kinase preparations. (E3 is very active enzyme and only one round of turnover is needed to reduce the lipoate of L1 or L2.) With no lipoyl domain source present, E1-kinase was increased by dihydrolipoamide with a maximal stimulation at 50  microM of 40-55%. Previously Liu et al.(26) found L1 and L2 inhibited kinase activity at levels greater than 20  microM. For direct comparison, effects of lipoate sources (dihydrolipoamide, L1, and L2) at 20  microM, alone and in combination, were determined to evaluate the direct and supportive roles of dihydrolipoamide. Addition of 20  microM dihydrolipoamide to E1-kinase without a lipoyl domain source or with L1 or L2 gave small but reproducible enhancements (15-40%  plus or minus L1; 30-60% +L2) of kinase activity (Fig. 6, open bars). NADH did not stimulate in the absence of a lipoate source (first series, solid bar); indeed, the mixture of NADH + NAD at 3:1 ratio seemed to inhibit kinase activity. This strongly supports the conclusion that E3 catalyzed reduction of a lipoate source is required. Only with L2 did NADH increase kinase activity beyond that with just dihydrolipoamide. In the presence of L2 (Fig. 6, third series), larger effects were observed with NADH than with dihydrolipoamide and the combination had no effect beyond NADH alone. These results indicate that the higher stimulation by dihydrolipoamide in the presence of L2 results from reduction of the lipoyl group of L2..

Dihydrolipoamide replaced NADH in supporting the higher acetyl-CoA stimulation with L1 and particularly with L2 (diagonally cross-hatched bars).

For the marked stimulation by acetyl-CoA plus L2, dihydrolipoamide likely reduced enough L2 lipoates in the presence of E3 to allow L2-acetylation to an extent giving near maximal stimulation. Indeed, the 4.7-fold enhancement was greater than with NADH probably due to the extent of acetylation being somewhat lower, resulting in less diacetyl-L2. Although reduction and acetylation of the lipoate of L2 is clearly most effective, a direct stimulation of kinase activity is observable with dihydrolipoamide and acetyl-dihydrolipoamide and this limits mechanistic possibilities (cf. ``Discussion'')..

Introduction) that the products of PDC reaction influence the proportion of PDC in the active form, through diverse studies with purified complex isolated mitochondria, and intact tissues (1, 8, 9, 47) . In their studies with purified porcine heart PDC, no stimulation by acetyl-CoA beyond that of NADH was detected, and they speculated that enhanced kinase activity might be due to the removal of an inhibition of kinase activity caused by the absence of an interaction between oxidized lipoate and the E1 substrate (8, 9) .

Accumulation of this intermediate explains the similarly strong stimulation of kinase activity by low pyruvate via E1(TPP) catalysis. The direct stimulation by dihydrolipoamide, its capacity to replace NADH in potentiating acetyl-CoA stimulation, and the complete lack of an effect of NADH on kinase activity in the absence of a lipoate source strongly favor NADH boosting kinase activity through its use in the E3 reaction. We have established that this intervention is abolished by complete removal of lipoates from intact E2 subunits or lipoyl domains. Of particular importance for understanding the operation and regulation of the kinase is our finding that the kinase-binding L2 domain is much more effective than E2's L1 domain or lipoamide in mediating kinase stimulation.

This result forcefully suggests that the kinase has moved to the limited number of lipoylated L2 domains and, furthermore, that their acetylation (during a short-lived dissociation and reassociation of the kinase) facilitated kinase stimulation. Based on this continued stimulation when very few E2 subunits retain lipoate, we hypothesize that maximal effector stimulation is mediated by an allosteric effect induced by a reductively acetylated L2 domain that becomes engaged in binding of the kinase (i.e. not by interaction of an acetylated prosthetic group on a neighboring lipoyl domain that is not engaged in binding the kinase).

Even lower acetyl-CoA:CoA ( < 0.1) give half-maximal stimulation when a NADH:NAD ratio of 0.1 is provided to reduce lipoates (data not shown). At these low ratios, there is minimal product inhibition of the PDC reaction by NADH plus acetyl-CoA (cf. the 0.1 value on the curve, Fig. 8). Significant direct product inhibition occurs with low NADH:NAD ratio when the acetyl-CoA:CoA ratio was held at a relatively high level of 1 (Fig. 8, ). Acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios have been generated at and above this range with isolated mitochondria and are proposed to contribute to direct PDC inhibition (48) ; depletion of CoA may also inhibit PDC due to buildup of fatty acyl-CoAs(49) . While these probably contribute to a fine tuning role on a small portion of active PDC, enhanced phosphorylation should effectively throttle down PDC activity before onset of these extremes..

Studies with E2-bound kinase found that the kinase is sensitive to thiol reagents(13, 52) , effects probably due to changes in the oxidation-reduction state of the lipoate of L2 domains. Although there is a small increase in alkylation of cysteines of the K1 subunit following treatment of E2Xkinase-E3 with NADH, this was not rapidly reversed by excess NAD which opposes kinase stimulation. ()Thus, a mediator role for changes in the thiol-disulfide status of the kinase is not indicated. Furthermore, our finding that free dihydrolipoamide and to a greater extent acetylated dihydrolipoamide directly stimulated kinase activity in the absence of a lipoyl domain source, eliminating the prospect that stimulation results from removal of an inhibitory effect by the oxidized form of lipoate. As modeled in Fig. 9, we conclude that kinase activity is enhanced through direct positive allosteric interactions of the reduced or the acetylated form of an L2 lipoate and we further suggest that L2 specificity derives from the L2 domain engaged in binding the kinase..

Furthermore, our finding that free dihydrolipoamide and to a greater extent acetylated dihydrolipoamide directly stimulated kinase activity in the absence of a lipoyl domain source, eliminating the prospect that stimulation results from removal of an inhibitory effect by the oxidized form of lipoate. As modeled in Fig. 9, we conclude that kinase activity is enhanced through direct positive allosteric interactions of the reduced or the acetylated form of an L2 lipoate and we further suggest that L2 specificity derives from the L2 domain engaged in binding the kinase..

The proportion of L2 domains of the E core having oxidized, reduced, or acetylated lipoates responds to changes in the NADH:NAD ratio and acetyl-CoA:CoA ratio via the rapid and reversible reactions catalyzed by E3 and E2, respectively. Our model proposes that a change from the kinase binding to one or two L2 containing only oxidized lipoate (nonstimulated K state) to interacting with an L2 containing a reduced or an acetylated lipoate results in the modified lipoates allosterically inducing conformational changes that generate the progressively more active K* or K** states, respectively..

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	90	Consistent with stimulation occurring at low ratios of acetyl-CoA to CoA, half-maximal and near-maximal stimulation of kinase associated with the intact bovine kidney PDC are achieved with only 7-10 and 22-26 acetyl groups incorporated, respectively, per PDC(15, 16, 17) . With the recent knowledge that there are 3 lipoyl domains, two on E2 and one on the E3-binding protein giving a total of at least 126 lipoates per E2, ()it seems likely that no more than 12 and possibly as few as 7 acetyl groups are incorporated per PDC into the kinase-binding L2 domain for near-maximal stimulation, and as few as 3 and no more than 6 are incorporated for half-maximal stimulation. ()This constitutes a highly responsive regulatory mechanism in which the kinase must preferentially interact with acetylated L2 and suggests that full stimulation may result from only one subunit of a kinase dimer interacting with a reductively acetylated L2 domain. Consistent with this prospect, half-maximal stimulation occurred with free L2 when only 20% of the L2 are acetylated. Although a much higher portion was found than estimated (above) for the intact complex, very different conditions are operative at the outer surface of the complex where lipoyl domains are concentrated at 1 mM, making the localized L2 level at least 50-fold higher than the highest level of free L2 used in the present work. Interaction of the kinase with acetylated-L2 would be aided by steady state turnover in the overall PDC reaction rapidly changing the location of acetyl groups within the multienzyme cluster. Kinase shuffling between L2 domains may also contribute, but this is needed, regardless, since acetylation by acetyl-CoA requires an unhindered lipoate(50, 51) , and the kinase must interact after L2 acetylation. We conclude that increased reductive-acetylation is very effective in activating kinase due to this preferred interaction of acetylated L2 altering the structure of the kinase and thereby increasing kinase activity (Fig. 9)..

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	92	In being stimulated, kinase kinetic properties must fundamentally change since stimulation occurs over a wide range of rates (e.g. even with a peptide substrate that is slowly phosphorylated) and in the absence of kinase movement on the surface of the E2 core. Previous studies demonstrated that stimulation of the kinase requires physiological levels of potassium salts(7, 14, 53) . Increasing K from low (0-10 mM) to higher levels (90-120 mM) leads to a marked inhibition of kinase activity and a gain in the capacity for NADH and acetyl-CoA stimulation. Another property of the kinase that changes with increasing K ion is that ADP inhibition markedly increases(55) . A potential mechanism is that interaction of the kinase with an L2 domain containing an acetyl-dihydrolipoate leads to a conformational change in the kinase that speeds up ADP dissociation, which is probably the rate-limiting step in the kinase reaction at elevated (physiological) K levels. Consistent with that prospect are the observation that acetylation causes a greater stimulation of ADP-inhibited kinase (13) and the evidence that kinase-ADP is a prominent reaction intermediate, since pyruvate effectively inhibits by binding to the kinase-ADP in the absence of free ADP(56) . For this mechanism to be correct, it must operate in conjunction with the slow rate of phosphorylation of peptide substrate, a particularly useful system for testing this mechanism. Further studies will be needed to define the structural changes that attenuate the kinase through changes in L2's lipoyl group and to determine how the K1 and K2 subunits of the kinase vary in their regulatory control..

The effectiveness in intact PDC of acetylating a low proportion of L2 domains in enhancing the phosphorylation of many bound E1 by a single tightly bound kinase molecule is probably accomplished by inter-L2 domain movement of the kinase combined with a stronger interaction of the kinase with acetylated L2 domains. Several studies on kinase function and regulation are consistent with a change in a K-requiring process ultimately occurring in kinase stimulation. A candidate mechanism involves counteracting K-strengthened ADP binding to the kinase to speed up slow dissociation of this product from the active site of the kinase..

The RNA genome is encapsidated in a protein shell comprising 180 chemically identical coat protein (CP) subunits (20,000 Da) arranged in icosahedral symmetry. Depending on the bonding interactions, the subunits are designated as A, B, and C (2). The A-type subunits form pentamers at the 5-fold, and the B and C subunits form hexamers at the 3-fold icosahedral axes. The protein subunits are held by strong protein-protein interactions..

An interesting feature of tymoviruses is that empty capsids are also formed in vitro when the intact virus is subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle or when exposed to high temperatures, alkaline pH, or denaturants (3-6). The presence of empty shells in vivo and in vitro suggests that the information required for error-free assembly is contained within the primary structure of protein subunits in these viruses. It is difficult to isolate an assembly-competent PhMV CP subunit under non-denaturing conditions from isolated viral capsids that can be used for deciphering the assembly pathway. Hence, the CP gene of PhMV and a number of its deletion mutants were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Interestingly, the bacterially expressed rCP could self-assemble into stable virus-like particles (VLPs) (7). Furthermore, the deletion of 30 amino acid residues or the addition of 41 amino acid residues at the N terminus of rCP did not affect the assembly into T = 3 capsids. Several site-specific mutants were also studied. One of the mutations, His-69 to Ala, led to the formation of a 19.4 S subassembly intermediate (8). Recently, the crystal structures of native and recombinant capsids of PhMV have been elucidated (9, 10). To gain further insights into the assembly mechanism of this virus, a careful analysis of these crystal structures was made in the present study to identify residues involved only in inter-subunit interactions, and these residues were targeted for mutagenesis. Gln-37, Tyr-67, Arg-68, Asp-83, Ile-123 and Ser-145 were mutated to Glu, Ala, Gln, Ala, Ala, and Ala respectively, with a view to examine whether such mutations could lead to the formation of assembly intermediates or monomers. The mutant rCPs were expressed in E. coli and purified. The mutants were characterized by sucrose density gradient analysis, electron microscopy, high pressure liquid chromatography, circular dichroism (CD), and fluorescence spectroscopy. Our results imply that Gln-37, Tyr-67, Arg-68, Asp-83, and Ile-123 are not only important for assembly but also crucial for the proper folding of the subunits, whereas the interactions with Ser-145 are not important either for folding or assembly.

The mutant clones were sequenced by Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method to confirm the presence of the desired mutation (15). The mutants were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLys S (16). All of the mutants were expressed to high levels (25-30% of the total proteins) and were partially soluble. Approximately 60% of I123A and S145A were present in the soluble fraction. The solubility of the other mutant rCPs varied depending on the expression level in different batches. On average, ~10-15% of the expressed protein was present in a soluble fraction (data not shown). The mutant proteins present in the soluble fractions were purified by the procedure similar to that used for the purification of wild type rCP capsids (6). The rCP expressed in E. coli has 41 additional amino acid residues (including six histidines) at the N terminus and, as shown earlier (8), it assembled into capsids that sedimented as a single peak when subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation (fractions 12-16; Fig. 1a). The S145A mutant rCP co-sedimented with rCP capsids (Fig 1b). However, none of the other mutant proteins exhibited peaks corresponding to assembled particles (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, no assembled particles were seen when these mutant proteins were viewed under the electron microscope, whereas particles of 30 nm were observed for the mutant S145A capsids (Fig. 1b, inset). The mutant rCPs that failed to assemble into T = 3 capsids could not be purified by the procedures used for the purification of rCP capsids. Hence, these mutant proteins were purified by Ni-NTA chromatography, making use of the histidine tag at the N terminus. The purified proteins were analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and were authenticated by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The yields of the purified proteins were 10-15 mg/liter for Q37E, Y67A, R68Q, and D83A rCPs, whereas it was slightly higher (20-25 mg/liter) for the I123A rCP. These purified proteins were also observed under an electron microscope, which further confirmed that these mutant rCPs failed to assemble into virus-like particles. These purified mutants rCPs were retained in the loading wells when run on 1% agarose gel and 8% native polyacrylamide gels (data not shown), suggesting that these may represent proteins that are folding defective..

The far UV CD spectra of these mutants showed troughs in the 208-225 nm range, suggesting that all of them had a considerable amount of secondary structure (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the fluorescence emission spectra of these mutants showed an emission maxima at 332-336 nm and was similar to that observed with the rCP capsids (Fig. 4a). This indicated that the aromatic residues, especially the single tryptophan residue, was inaccessible to the solvent. Upon incubation with 8 M urea, the emission maximum shifted to 350-356 nm, suggesting that the tryptophan side chain was exposed to the solvent (Fig. 4b). The fluorescence intensity was measured at 324 nm, at which the maximum difference in intensity was observed between the native (0 M urea) and 8 M urea unfolded proteins. The fluorescence intensities at various concentrations of urea were calculated as a percent of the fluorescence intensity at 0 M urea. A discrete unfolding transition was found between 3 to 5 M urea in the case of rCP capsids (Fig. 5b), whereas no such transition was observed with the mutants rCPs (Fig. 5a). This observation corroborates earlier studies in which the rCP capsids were found to be stable up to 4 M urea at room temperature (7). Interestingly, the urea-induced denaturation of the rCP capsids, as measured by fluorescence, overlapped with the changes in light scattering as monitored by absorbance at 325 nm (Fig. 5b). This indicated that disassembly and denaturation could be concerted events in this virus. The lack of a discrete unfolding transition in the case of rCP mutants as monitored by fluorescence reflects conformational flexibility of these mutant proteins. Furthermore, the absorbance at 325 nm for the mutant rCPs (0.2 mg/ml) was negligible ( < 0.005), suggesting that the spectral changes observed are not due to aggregation..

Although rCP, I123A, and D83A had similar slopes, Q37E, Y67A, and R68Q showed increased slopes (Fig. 6b)..

Stern-Volmer plots for the wild type and mutant rCPs (Fig. 6a) showed a similar slope for Y67A, R68Q, and I123A mutant proteins, suggesting that the tryptophan in these proteins are protected from the quencher to a similar extent.

ANS binding to rCP capsids was less when compared with ANS binding to the rCP mutants (Fig. 7a). This is understandable, as the capsids are held by strong hydrophobic interactions and, hence, hydrophobic surfaces are unavailable for ANS to bind. The urea-induced unfolding of the rCP capsids and mutant rCPs was also monitored by measuring ANS fluorescence. As in other globular proteins, there was an initial increase (up to 3 M urea), followed by a decrease in ANS binding (up to 5 M urea) in the case of wild type rCP capsids (Fig. 7b). The unfolding transition observed here is in agreement with the results of urea-induced denaturation as monitored by intrinsic fluorescence (Fig. 5a). In contrast, the mutant rCPs showed only a continuous decrease in ANS fluorescence, suggesting that they were already in a partially unfolded state (Fig. 7b)..

Earlier studies by site-directed mutagenesis have shown the presence of a 19.4 S intermediate in the assembly/disassembly pathway (8). In this study, we have carried out a structure-based mutagenesis of six residues, namely Gln-37, Tyr-67, Arg-68, Asp-83, Ile-123, and Ser-145, which are predominantly involved in inter-subunit interactions. Except for S145A, all of the other mutant rCPs failed to assemble into T = 3 capsids, although they were found to be soluble (Fig. 1). Furthermore, these mutant proteins are partially folded, as evidenced by the following: (i) gel filtration elution behavior (Fig. 2); (ii) the presence of secondary structure as shown by far UV CD (Fig. 3); (iii) the lack of a sharp transition in thermal denaturation as shown by CD (Fig. 8); (iv) persistent high levels of innate fluorescence due to the single tryptophan present in the protein (Fig. 4); (v) lack of discrete unfolding transition upon denaturation with urea (Fig. 5); (vi) accessibility of tryptophan residue in the mutants as measured by fluorescence quenching with acrylamide and potassium iodide (Fig. 6); (vii) enhanced fluorescence of ANS in the presence of mutant proteins (Fig. 7); and (viii) the lack of a sharp structural transition in ANS binding experiments in the presence of urea (Fig. 7). Thus, the mutation of residues involved in extensive inter-subunit interactions affect both the subunit folding and particle assembly of PhMV. A detailed analysis of the position of the residues mutated and the probable consequence of the mutation on the folding and assembly is presented below..

Gln-37 also interacts with Gly-113 and Leu-109 at B5-C interface and with Asn-188 at C-C2 contacts (Fig. 9 and Fig. 10a). This residue does not seem to interact with any of the residues within the subunit. The mutation of Gln-37 to Glu should therefore have disrupted only the inter-subunit interactions. Replacement of Gln with Glu in the structure using the molecular modeling software program "O" showed that there are no short contacts and also that all the interactions of Gln-37 can be retained by Glu. However, it introduces a negative charge in the dense interface of subunits. The results presented here demonstrate that the mutation of Gln-37, which is involved in multiple inter-subunit interactions, also affects the proper folding of the subunit. Probably, the negative charge introduced somehow interferes in the folding..

This residue does not have any obvious intra-subunit interactions. The replacement of Arg with Gln can be done without short contact within the same subunit. However, its mutation to Gln led to the partially folded and assembly-incompetent protein. These results further support the observation that the mutation of residues involved in multiple inter-subunit interactions disrupts subunit folding and particle assembly. Even here, the uncompensated negative charge might interfere in the folding of the protein..

It is involved not only in inter-subunit interactions at C-C2 and B5-A, but also in intra-subunit hydrogen-bonding interactions. Its mutation to alanine disrupts the hydrogen-bonding interaction at the quasi-2-fold axis. This creates a cavity in the vicinity of residues Leu-34, Leu-63, Leu-180, and Ile-32. This may have a destabilizing effect on the same subunit, which could hinder proper folding of the subunit. Hence, its mutation to Ala led to the misfolding of the subunits and the consequent arrest of assembly..

0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	60	Interestingly, the tertiary structure of the partially folded mutant proteins is similar to that of the rCP capsids (Figs. 4 and 6). The single tryptophan residue, Trp-96, is located inside the -barrel, and its mutation led to soluble aggregates defective in folding and assembly (8). Furthermore, this Trp is not an interfacial residue. Therefore, it is possible that the partially folded mutant rCPs and the wild type rCP have similar accessibility to this tryptophan..
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	61	In contrast to the Q37E, Y67A, R68Q, D83A, and I123A mutant rCPs, the S145A mutant assembled into capsids that were indistinguishable from wild type rCP capsids. An analysis of the intact PhMV capsid structure shows that Ser-145 has hydrogen-bonding interactions with Thr-149 and Asp-150 in the A-B interface, Ser-19 and Thr-149 at the A-C interface, and Asp-150 and Asn-139 at the B-C interface (Fig. 10d). These interactions are presumably less important or are compensated by other interactions in the mutant rCP and thus do not affect the folding or assembly. Earlier studies on D144N, N1881, and N188A mutant rCPs have shown that they do assemble into capsids, although these residues occur at the inter-subunit interfaces (8). Thus, none of the mutant proteins studied thus far has resulted in a fully folded and assembly-competent monomeric subunit. It is, however, possible that the mutant rCPs are not correctly folded when synthesized in vivo and hence are assembly incompetent. To examine this, the wild type rCP capsids were incubated with 8 M urea for 4 h at room temperature and subjected to stepwise dialysis or immediate dilution (20-fold) to remove the denaturant. However, it was not possible to obtain assembled particles from such refolding mixtures. Invariably, the removal of denaturant led to the complete precipitation of the protein. Because it was not possible to refold and assemble the wild type rCP, similar experiments with mutant rCPs were not attempted. In vivo studies on the related turnip yellow mosaic virus has shown that the coat protein synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum accumulates in the cytoplasm overlying clustered vesicles in the chloroplast (17). These become inserted into the outer chloroplast membrane with the hydrophobic sides that are normally buried in the complete virus particle within the lipid bilayer. It is suggested that the nascent RNA strand emerges through the vesicle neck and that virus assembly takes place in the vesicular membrane (17). Thus, the partially folded CP attached to the membrane, upon interaction with RNA, could further fold and assemble into mature capsids. In the absence of RNA, these proteins might self-assemble to form empty capsids. The results presented in this communication clearly demonstrate that the mutation of residues crucial for interfacial interactions disrupts subunit folding and assembly in the PhMV. Furthermore, these mutants are partially folded and are probably locked in conformations that lack the signals/features that would allow them to assemble into T = 3 capsids. The unfolding transition, as monitored by fluorescence, overlapped with the changes in the light scattering when wild type rCP capsids were denatured with urea, suggesting that disassembly and unfolding are also concerted (Fig. 5b). Thus, there is a close connection between folding and assembly in PhMV. In the flock house virus also, the disassembly and unfolding of the mature capsids was shown to be concerted (18). Viral structural proteins, such as the herpes simplex virus triplex forming protein (VP23), when expressed in E. coli, are shown to exist predominantly in a molten globule state (19). The P22 coat protein has also been shown to be quite flexible in solution (20). Thus, concerted coat protein folding and capsid assembly may be a general phenomenon in viruses stabilized predominantly by inter-subunit interactions.     ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

The molecular mechanism of cytoplasmic envelopment is unclear, but evidence suggests that the viral glycoprotein tails play an important role in the recruitment of tegument and capsids at the final envelopment site. However, due to redundancy in protein to protein interactions among the viral glycoproteins, genetic analysis of the role of individual glycoproteins in assembly has been difficult. To overcome this problem, a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein-binding assay was used in this study to test the interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of one specific viral glycoprotein, gD, and tegument proteins. The study demonstrated that the 38 kDa tegument protein VP22 bound specifically to the gD tail. This association was dependent on arginine and lysine residues at positions 5 and 6 in the gD tail. In addition, HSV-1 capsids bound the gD tail and exhibited a similar sequence dependence. It is concluded that VP22 may serve as a linker protein, mediating the interaction of the HSV capsid with gD..

However, the molecular mechanism of HSV-1 envelopment in the cytoplasm is poorly characterized. During infection, viral membrane glycoproteins are expressed and traffic via cytoplasmic organelles to the cell surface. Several lines of evidence suggest that the cytosolic domains of these glycoproteins may provide a platform for tegument assembly and recruitment of capsids followed by envelopment (Mettenleiter, 2002). In a recent study, a double mutant of pseudorabies virus (PrV) lacking viral glycoproteins gM and gE (or gM and the cytoplasmic tail of gE) showed a failure in envelopment, instead accumulating cytoplasmic nucleocapsids immersed in a dense layer of tegument (Brack et al., 1999). Following single deletion of either glycoprotein, the production of infectious virions was not affected, suggesting that the cytoplasmic tails of gE and gM act in a redundant fashion during assembly, most likely interacting with the tegument proteins and, indirectly, with the surface of nucleocapsids. In HSV-1, simultaneous deletion of the same two glycoproteins did not dramatically affect production of infectious virions (Browne et al., 2004), although simultaneous deletion of gD and gE resulted in a striking defect in particle assembly (Farnsworth et al., 2003). This apparent redundancy makes analysis of specific glycoprotein to tegument interactions difficult to perform in vivo. To overcome this obstacle, we developed a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein-binding assay to investigate the interaction between envelope glycoprotein tails and tegument partners in vitro. This approach has previously been used to demonstrate the interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of glycoprotein H (gH) and the tegument component VP16 (Gross et al., 2003). In the current study, we focused on analysing the tail of the glycoprotein D (gD) because it is a highly abundant component of the envelope (Spear  and  Roizman, 1972) with a short cytoplasmic tail of 30 amino acid residues that can easily be manipulated in mutagenesis studies. Moreover, it has been shown to play a key, albeit redundant, role in assembly (Farnsworth et al., 2003). Additionally, Pomeranz  and  Blaho (1999) reported that gD co-localizes with at least one tegument protein, VP22, during infection..

The resulting lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 15 000 g and pre-cleared by incubation with Protein G to agarose beads (Sigma) for 20 min at 37  degrees C. After pelleting the beads, the supernatants were collected and mixed with fresh Protein G beads with either anti-gD (Virusys) or anti-HA (Roche Diagnostics) monoclonal antibody (mAb). After a 15 min incubation at 37  degrees C, beads were washed four times with a wash buffer and once in PBS. Bound material was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotted using anti-VP22 antibody..

0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	30	  Binding of the tegument protein VP22 to the gD fusion protein To prepare a source of tegument polypeptides for the binding assay, we followed the methodology previously described for isolating HSV-1-containing organelles and putative assembly intermediates from the cytoplasm of HSV-1-infected cells (Harley et al., 2001). PNS from HSV-infected COS cells was first treated with NP-40 and NaCl to solubilize the viral structural proteins, as we have previously found many tegument polypeptides to be insoluble in the PNS, perhaps due to their incorporation into assembling virions. The detergent-solubilized extract was then incubated with glutathione to Sepharose beads to which had previously been bound equivalent amounts of GST, gDc or gHc, a fusion protein of the viral gH tail with GST that has been well characterized by our laboratory (Gross et al., 2003). Bound and unbound material was then resolved by SDS-PAGE, Western blotted and analysed by probing with various antibodies. Fig. 1(c) shows binding of the tegument protein VP22 to the GST to gD fusion protein. VP22 remained mostly in the unbound fraction when incubated with GST alone, suggesting that the binding was tail specific. To test the specificity of binding further, we also examined the association of other abundant cellular and viral proteins with the gD tail. The cellular protein -tubulin and the abundant capsid scaffold proteins Pra and ICP35 failed to bind to the gD and gH tails, indicating that the glycoprotein tails do not bind these cellular and viral proteins non-specifically: VP22 bound to the gD tail but not to the gH tail. We also observed that gD bound the tegument protein VP16 in a manner similar to gH. This was consistent with a previous study by Zhu  and  Coutney (1994), which demonstrated that VP16 could be cross-linked to both gD and gH in purified virions..
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	31	Binding of VP22 to the gD tail is independent of other viral proteins The interaction between VP22 and gD may be direct or mediated by other viral proteins. To examine this question, we used a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro transcription/translation system to generate 35S-labelled VP22 and added it to our in vitro GST-binding assay. Autoradiography showed that in vitro-translated VP22 (running at a molecular mass of 45 kDa) bound to the gD tail (Fig. 2). Since the rabbit reticulocyte lysate contained only the in vitro-translated VP22 and no other viral proteins, we could conclude that VP22 binding did not require any other viral polypeptides. Although we could not discount the possibility that a cellular polypeptide in the reticulocyte lysate mediated the gD to VP22 interaction, no host protein with the abundance of VP22 has ever been described in the HSV particle..

0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	36	Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the gD cytoplasmic tail To simplify the identification of amino acids within the gD cytoplasmic tail that play an important role in VP22 binding, we generated a truncation mutant of the tail that retained only the most amino-terminal 17 residues (named T17) (Fig. 3a). When the GST to T17 fusion protein was tested for its ability to bind VP22 present in cytosolic extracts prepared from HSV-infected cells, it was found to bind VP22 in a similar manner to the full-length gD tail (Fig. 3b). Next, to identify residues that might be critical for binding VP22, we carried out alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Clusters of amino acids were mutated simultaneously to alanine and named according to the amino acid residues that were mutated (Fig. 3a). These mutants, along with gDc and GST, were expressed and incubated with infected-cell extracts and the relative amounts of VP22 binding were detected by Western blotting. Fig. 3(c) shows that mutations in the arginine and lysine residues at positions 5/6 or 9/10 diminished the binding of VP22, indicating that these amino acid residues are important. Although the HRR mutant showed a slightly decreased binding of VP22, this level of binding was variable, and most commonly the HRR mutant bound VP22 at a level similar to the wild-type gD tail. Next, we examined the role of the key lysine and arginine residues in the context of the full-length gD tail (Fig. 3d). Similar to the truncated mutant, mutation of R5/K6 showed a dramatic decrease in binding of VP22. Individual mutation of these residues had a less dramatic effect, indicating that these amino acid residues both contribute to VP22 binding but may play a somewhat redundant role..

Binding of the gD tail to VP22 in the bound (B) and unbound (U) fractions is shown. (c) Clusters of basic residues of T17 were changed to alanines as indicated in (a). The residues that were mutated to alanines are indicated above each lane. When these fusion proteins were examined for their ability to bind VP22, the R5K6 and K9R10 mutants showed diminished binding in comparison with the others. (d) The full-length gD tail containing substitutions of arginine and lysine residues at positions 5/6 and 9/10 to alanine showed diminished binding of VP22. Individual mutations containing alanine substitutions at either the lysine 5 or the arginine 6 residue showed some binding to VP22. The Western blots in (c) and (d) also revealed the quantity of GST fusion protein in each binding reaction, since the anti-VP22 antiserum is cross-reactive with GST..

Fig. 5(c) shows the result of an experiment in which increasing amounts of radiolabelled capsid-containing extract were incubated with GST- or gDc-coated glutathione to Sepharose beads and scored for capsid binding as described above. Under these conditions, binding of capsids to the gD tail appeared to be saturable at between 500 and 750  microg cytosolic protein (Fig. 5c). In contrast, binding to GST was at a much lower level and increased linearly in relation to the quantity of extract added, consistent with the lack of a saturable binding site. This indicated that capsids were binding specifically to the gD tail, most likely indirectly, via tegument proteins..

Fig. 6 shows representative images of capsids bound to gDc-coated beads. For gDc-coated beads, it was relatively easy to identify icosahedral capsids.

To test the possibility that VP22 might play a role in capsid to gD tail interactions, we made use of the GST to gDR5K6 fusion protein that had previously been shown to have diminished ability to bind VP22. Beads previously bound to either GST, gDc or gDR5K6 were incubated with cell extract containing capsids. Fig. 7 shows that the c.p.m. of capsids bound to the gDR5K6 fusion protein were similar to background levels.

So far, dissecting the molecular mechanism of assembly using a genetic approach has been complicated by redundancy among the viral glycoproteins: deletion of a single glycoprotein does not generally lead to apparent defects in cytoplasmic envelopment; instead, multiple simultaneous deletions are necessary. In this study we took a biochemical approach towards analysing protein to protein interactions that might be important during virus assembly..

In HSV-1, deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of gD had relatively little effect on normal virus production (Feenstra et al., 1990). However, simultaneous deletion of gD and gE showed elimination of cytoplasmic envelopment and accumulation of large numbers of unenveloped nucleocapsids within a dense layer of tegument in the cytoplasm (Farnsworth et al., 2003), indicating that gD and gE may share overlapping roles in cytoplasmic envelopment. Our data suggest that at least one of these roles may be in VP22 recruitment and predict that the cytoplasmic tail of gE may also bind VP22. Interestingly, Farnsworth et al. (2003) reported that the cytoplasmic tail of gE, when fused to GST, was indeed able to bind VP22. Thus, gD and gE may act in a redundant manner to incorporate VP22 into the newly forming virions.

ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The binding sites for xanthophylls in the CP29 antenna protein of higher plant Photosystem II have been investigated using recombinant proteins refolded in vitro. Despite the presence of three xanthophyll species CP29 binds two carotenoids per polypeptide. The localization of neoxanthin was studied producing a chimeric protein constructed by swapping the C-helix domain from CP29 to LHCII. The resulting holoprotein did not bind neoxanthin, confirming that the N1 site is not present in CP29. Neoxanthin in CP29 was, instead, bound to the L2 site, which is thus shown to have a wider specificity with respect to the homologous site L2 in LHCII. Lutein was found in the L1 site of CP29. For each site the selectivity for individual xanthophyll species was studied as well as its role in protein stabilization, energy transfer, and photoprotection. Putative xanthophyll binding sequences, identified by primary structure analysis as a stretch of hydrophobic residues including an acidic term, were analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis or, in one case, by deleting the entire sequence. The mutant proteins were unaffected in their xanthophyll composition, thus suggesting that the target motifs had little influence in determining xanthophyll binding, whereas hydrophobic sequences in the membrane-spanning helices are important..

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Carotenoids are involved in many aspects of higher plants photosynthesis. Reaction center complexes bind -carotene for light harvesting, chlorophyll a (Chl a)1 triplet quenching, and electron transport between cytochrome b559 and P680+ (1, 2). In the peripheral antenna, Lhc proteins bind a number of xanthophyll species, namely lutein, neoxanthin, and violaxanthin, acting in the harvesting of light and transfer of excitation energy to Chls (3, 4, 5, 6). The photoprotection function of xanthophylls is accomplished through multiple mechanisms including the quenching of Chl a triplet states, scavenging of singlet oxygen produced by the reaction of Chl triplets with O2, and participation to non-photochemical quenching, a mechanism in which violaxanthin is de-epoxidated to zeaxanthin and excess energy is dissipated into heat (7). In addition, xanthophylls are essential for Lhc protein folding (8), whereas their binding to a specific allosteric site controls the transition between dissipative and conservative protein conformations (9, 10)..

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	7	The reason why Lhc proteins require a number of xanthophyll species while reaction center proteins only require -carotene is not completely understood; these carotenoid species have very similar physico-chemical properties, enabling, in each case, efficient light harvesting, triplet quenching, and singlet oxygen scavenging (11). Nonetheless, the pigment composition is one of the most conserved traits in higher plants, suggesting a specific function for each carotenoid species. The best known xanthophyll binding protein is the major light harvesting complex of Photosystem II (LHCII) for which four distinct binding sites have been reported to be bound into distinct domains of the protein. Sites L1 and L2 intersect the helix A/helix B cross-domain in the center of the Lhc structure (12). L1 is selective for lutein, whereas L2 can also bind violaxanthin (13). Site N1 is highly selective for neoxanthin and is located within the C helix domain of LHCII (14). Finally, a low affinity binding site has been named V1 after its major ligand (violaxanthin) in low light conditions (15, 16). Each binding site was shown to play a distinct functional role; structure stabilization and Chl a triplet quenching are provided by lutein in site L1 only (10, 17). Site V1 is not involved in singlet nor in triplet energy transfer and was suggested to accommodate a pool of readily available substrate molecules for the violaxanthin deepoxydase enzyme (16), whose product, zeaxanthin, can then be bound to the allosteric site L2 (18). Site N1 is active in light harvesting and singlet oxygen scavenging (13) and stabilizes the long lifetime conformation of LHCII (19)..

Nevertheless, four short sequences, located in the hydrophilic domains and consisting into four hydrophobic amino acids and a charged residue, could be involved in the binding by forming a hydrophobic pocket hosting xanthophylls end-rings, whereas the charged side chain was supposed to interact with oxygenated ring substituents (20). Alternatively, binding might be performed by interactions between hydrophobic residues with the polyene chain located deeply in the membrane as observed in the bacterial LH2 complex (21). In this study, we report the results of a detailed analysis of the chlorophyll a/b/xanthophyll protein CP29 (Lhcb4) with respect to the xanthophyll stoichiometry, location, and function as well as of the sequence determinants involved in their interaction with the polypeptide chain..

To determine the energy transfer efficiency of individual Cars in the two sites, the absorption spectra of the complexes were described in terms of absorption of individual pigments using two Chl a forms, two Chl b forms, and two Cars forms. Once the best fit was chosen for the absorption spectrum, the same set of data was used to describe the correspondent fluorescence excitation spectrum (Fig. 3, A' to F'). The integrated areas of the pigment bands in the absorption and excitation spectra were used to calculate the efficiencies of the energy transfer in the complex.

The data presented above show that only two of these sites are conserved in CP29. Previous work showed that site L1 is conserved in CP29 (17). However, it is not clear if either site N1 or L2 is conserved. Alternatively, both sites could be present but only partially occupied. To discriminate between the above hypotheses, a chimeric complex was produced, including the central domain (helices A + B) of LHCII and the C helix domain of CP29. The helix A-helix C lumenal loop and part of the helix C-helix B stromal loop were also included in the swapped domain since the loops can affect Lhc protein folding (32) (Fig. 1). The apoprotein was overexpressed in E. coli, and the complex was reconstituted in vitro with pigments. A pigment-protein complex was obtained, which had the same mobility in a sucrose gradient of CP29 and LHCII monomeric complexes and a denaturation temperature of 66  degrees C, intermediate between that of CP29 (64  degrees C) and LHCII (73  degrees C). The absorption spectrum of the complex along with its second derivative is presented in Fig. 5. The maximum in the Qy region is at 676 nm, whereas a strong Chl a contribution was detected at 666 nm.

We have used LD to determine the orientation of xanthophyll transition moments, lying within a few degrees from the plane of the polyene chain (33) in CP29. To distinguish between the contribution of xanthophylls in sites L1 and L2 to the LD signal, we have used the CP29 mutants E166V and E174V previously shown to have either complete or partial emptiness of site L2 (17). The major contribution of xanthophylls to the CP29-WT LD spectrum (Fig. 6) appears as a positive signal at 495 nm, whose amplitude is reduced in the E174V mutant and becomes negative in the E166V mutant. This suggests that the xanthophyll bound to the site L1 has its dipole moment transition forming an angle smaller than 54.7 degrees  with the normal to the membrane plane..

Using an internal standard it is possible to determine the exact values for these angles. In CP29 the orientation of the Chls has been determined from the LD signal after normalization. We therefore analyzed the spectra previously presented in Simonetto et al. (26), and we calculated the orientation of the Cars transition moments. The orientation of the xanthophyll located in the L1 site was calculated from the spectrum of the E166V mutant in which the only xanthophyll present is located in site L1. The analysis of L2 was performed on the WT - E166V difference spectrum. The spectra were fitted with the absorption spectra of the Cars to calculate the carotenoid LD signal as reported in Croce et al. (14). Then, using the factor of normalization value obtained from the analysis of the Chls transition moments (26), the values for L1 and L2 were calculated.

These sequences are characterized by an hydrophobic stretch of four residues with a polar residue insertion, thus allowing the formation of a hydrophobic pocket for hosting end-rings of xanthophylls, whereas the interaction of the polar residue with the oxygenated ring substituents could have a stabilizing effect (20). To check the involvement of these consensus sequences in xanthophyll binding, mutation analysis was performed. In three cases the charged amino acids in the center of the hydrophobic sequence were either substituted by a non-charged one or by a residue with an opposite charge; in one case the putative binding sequence was deleted together with the whole N-terminal domain. In the case of the putative lumenal ligand for the carotenoid in L1 site, the mutation at the central AA (Gln-230, ligand for Chl A3) (17) has previously been performed with no effect on xanthophyll binding. Close inspection of the LHCII structure (Kuhlbrandt et al. (12)) indicates that the end ring of the xanthophyll in the L2 site appears to be closely spaced with respect to the carbonyl of proline 238. This residue could then interact with -OH xanthophyll ring substituents. This residue was mutated to arginine. In Fig. 7A a scheme representing the structure of CP29 with indication of the putative carotenoid binding sequences and of the mutations performed is shown. The mutant sequences were expressed in E. coli and the apoproteins were reconstituted into complexes using a pigment mixture in which all xanthophylls were available together with Chl a and Chl b. The mutant Lhc complexes were purified and characterized by biochemical and spectroscopic methods. All complexes showed a high yield of reconstitution, similar to WT complex. Heat denaturation experiments accordingly show that all mutant proteins have the same stability of the WT (64  plus or minus  1  degrees C). The only exception was the CP29-P238R mutant, which has a denaturation temperature of 57  degrees C (see "Discussion")..

Previous results show that the L1 site is present in CP29, where it accommodates mainly lutein (17). The second carotenoid binding site present in CP29 shows high affinity for neoxanthin, but it does not participate to the protein stability, and it can be either the L2 or N1 site.

As an example, we can calculate the stability of CP29-control (62.33  degrees C) and verify that it matches with the measured denaturation temperature (64  degrees C) of the CP29-control complex. The good match indicates the independence of all variables (e.g. lutein in L1 site stabilizes the complex in the same way independently from which xanthophyll is present in site L2). The results confirm that site L1 is the most important in Lhc protein stabilization, as previously assessed in Lhcb1 (10), and lutein in this site seems to confer the highest stability to the complex. Lutein in the L2 site has almost no effect on the stability, whereas the occupancy of this site by violaxanthin or, even better, by neoxanthin increases the temperature of denaturation..

For violaxanthin the corresponding values were respectively 42.9  degrees C (for L1) and 6.2  degrees C (for L2), whereas neoxanthin in site L2 contributes for 14.5  degrees C. As an example, we can calculate the stability of CP29-control (62.33  degrees C) and verify that it matches with the measured denaturation temperature (64  degrees C) of the CP29-control complex. The good match indicates the independence of all variables (e.g. lutein in L1 site stabilizes the complex in the same way independently from which xanthophyll is present in site L2). The results confirm that site L1 is the most important in Lhc protein stabilization, as previously assessed in Lhcb1 (10), and lutein in this site seems to confer the highest stability to the complex. Lutein in the L2 site has almost no effect on the stability, whereas the occupancy of this site by violaxanthin or, even better, by neoxanthin increases the temperature of denaturation..

The possibility of comparing samples, which differ only for the carotenoid composition, allowed quantitative information to be obtained from this analysis. It is worth mentioning that all samples were fully equilibrated with the only partial exception of CP29-Za and CP29-Zb, which showed a small emission contribution from Chl b fluorescence at 660 nm when the complex was excited at 475 nm..

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	78	Again, we applied the model used for the stability analysis (see "Stability"). It has been demonstrated that binding to either one or the other of the two sites yields into a different modulation of the S2 energy level of the xanthophylls (4). This indicates that the same xanthophyll in the two sites is spectroscopically different. In agreement, two distinct values for the red-most peak were found for both lutein and violaxanthin, corresponding to the absorption in the L1 and L2 sites. In contrast, a single neoxanthin spectral form was needed for the best fit of both absorption and fluorescence excitation spectra consisting with its exclusive binding to the L2 site. Considering that in the samples containing neoxanthin, violaxanthin and lutein can only be located in the L1 site, it is possible to associate the two absorptions at site L1 or L2 based on the pigment composition of the samples. Thus, lutein in the L1 site absorbs at 494 nm, whereas in the same site violaxanthin absorbs at 496 nm. The same description found for the absorption spectra was applied to the analysis of excitation spectra, thus allowing discrimination between the transfer from Car in L1 and L2. It is therefore possible to read the data of Table II with the understanding that notations "1" and "2" actually correspond to xanthophyll binding sites L1 and L2. We can conclude that lutein transfers with high efficiency (up to 91%) when in site L1, while its efficiency in exciting Chl a fluorescence is very low (down to 28%) when it is located in the L2 site. Violaxanthin transfers efficiently from the L1 site, and the efficiency is around 60% for both violaxanthin and neoxanthin from the L2 site. Both violaxanthin and lutein show high (80 to 90%) efficiency from the L1 site, while the decrease in the transfer efficiency from the L2 site is different; lutein decreases its efficiency by a factor of 3.2, whereas viola decreases its efficiency by a factor of 1.3. This suggests that the arrangement of the two xanthophylls in the L2 site is different. The case of zeaxanthin is even more extreme: its energy transfer efficiency from the L1 site is around 60%, whereas from the L2 site it is very low, if at all. These results suggest that the energy transfer from a single site is dependent from the site occupancy..

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	80	In general the L2 site seems to be less active in the energy transfer as compared with the L1 site. Moreover, the efficiency of excitation energy transfer to Chl is modulated by the xanthophyll species bound there in the following gradient: V = N  >  L  >  Z. The lower transfer efficiency from the L2 site, common to all xanthophyll species, indicates that in this site the distance/orientation between pigments is not optimal for excitation energy transfer. It has been recently observed that most of the transfer from Car to Chl occurs via the S2 Car state in less than 100 fs. Considering the short carotenoid S2 lifetime, a perfect geometry between donor and acceptor is required for highly efficient energy transfer (3, 4, 6), and small changes in this geometry can strongly influence the process. Moreover, the finding that the xanthophylls behave differently when bound to the L2 site suggests that this protein domain may change its folding in the presence of different xanthophylls, supporting the proposal that the L2 site has allosteric nature (10). It is thus possible to suggest that when, for example, lutein enters the site, which is usually occupied by neoxanthin and violaxanthin, a conformational change occurs, changing the relative chromophore orientation and, thus, decreasing the transfer efficiency. The picture in CP29 is thus different as compared with the case of LHCII, where both L1 and L2 sites showed high efficiency of excitation energy transfer to Chl a (4). This suggests the L2 site has a different function in the two proteins. In the case of CP29, a Ca2+ and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binding site in the loop between helix B and C was suggested to work as a sensor for pH changes in the lumen (37, 38). Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binding sites have been also found in CP26 (39). At low lumenal pH the substitution of the Ca2+ with an H+ would "open" the structure, allowing violaxanthin to exit and zeaxanthin to enter the site (18). The high flexibility, which is required for this process, can thus explain the low energy transfer efficiency from this site. In the case of LHCII, zeaxanthin never enters the central sites, and thus, the structure could be optimized for the function of excitation energy transfer..

Among the samples containing only one xanthophyll species, CP29-L and CP29-Z are the most sensitive to photo-oxidation. It has been proposed above that lutein in site L2 is organized differently compared with the other xanthophylls and in effect does not transfer energy efficiently. CP29-Z has only one xanthophyll molecule located in the L1 site. The results thus indicate that the L2 site in CP29 can play an important role in photoprotection and, again, that this role is modulated by the site occupancy. In this respect, CP29 differs strongly from LHCII for which it has been clearly shown that L1 is the only site active in preventing photooxidation (10)..

In the last part of this work, the putative binding sequences for the carotenoids in the L1 and L2 sites have been studied by mutation analysis. Comparison between the primary structures of Lhc multigenic family members has shown in the loops conserved sequences composed by one charged amino acid hydrophobic residues in between four. Considering that Lhc proteins cannot bind -carotene, it was argued that these sequences are involved in the xanthophyll binding by establishing an H-bond between the polar residue in the polypeptide stretch and the ring -OH substituent (20). However, our mutation of the four putative binding sequences not only did not decrease pigment-protein stability but also did not change the affinity of binding sites for the different xanthophyll species. The changes in Chl composition observed for the P238R mutant are probably due to changes in the D helix domain and loss of the Chl in A3 site, as suggested by the similar effects of mutation P238R (this work) and Q230L (17) detected by pigment analysis, CD spectroscopy (data not shown), and the heat denaturation kinetics. The two mutations, which affect the putative stromal binding sequences for xanthophylls in the L2 site (CP29-D50L and CP29-N-term), support the view that pigment-protein stabilization by xanthophyll binding is not provided by hydrophilic sequences. A small but reproducible decrease of violaxanthin and neoxanthin balanced by an increase of lutein was, however, consistently found. This result may indicate that the sequence encompassing the Asp-50 residue plays a minor role in determining the selectivity of the L2 site..

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	86	The pigment binding properties of chimeric LHCII-CP29 complex further support the conclusion that lumenal sequences have little effect on site selectivity: despite the presence of the CP29 sequence in the lumenal region between B and C helices, it still accommodates mostly lutein in the L2 site, as is the case in LHCII (13) rather than violaxanthin and neoxanthin, as in CP29. Nevertheless, the absence of a clear phenotype for this chimeric complex can be useful in the search of the structural determinants for the affinity of the Car binding sites for individual xanthophyll. In fact, no effect in xanthophyll composition was observed by either deleting the N-terminal domain down to residue 96 (CP29) or by substituting half of the B helix and the lumenal loop. We conclude that the structural determinant for the selectivity of the L2 site has to be located in between these two regions, namely within a 28-amino acid sequence (e.g. from residue 50 to residue 77 in the LHCII sequence). It has been recently demonstrated that CP26 has the same L2 occupancy as in CP29 (25); this means that the determinant has to be conserved in CP29 and CP26 and not in LHCII. The three sequences are reported in Fig. 8. The only candidate is the N-61 in LHCII. An aromatic amino acid in both CP29 and CP26 occupies this position. In the structure of LHCII this asparagine is within 5 A from the carotenoid in L2. The presence in this position of a Phe or Tyr may change the steric interaction between pigments, possibly favoring the binding of violaxanthin and neoxanthin with respect to lutein. This may be due to the difference in the ring orientation between lutein and violaxanthin and neoxanthin; lutein is in its low energy conformation when the -cycle is oriented parallel to the polyene chain, whereas the -cycles of violaxanthin and neoxanthin are oriented perpendicularly. This difference can play a role in the selectivity of the binding site; an aromatic group in this site has higher steric hindrance and can select against lutein. However, the stringency cannot be very high as lutein is able to enter the L2 site when the reconstitution is performed in the absence of violaxanthin and neoxanthin. Consistent with this hypothesis is the finding that the CP29-L sample is less stable than the control CP29, and lutein in site L2 is differently oriented in the complex, as proposed above..

Similar results have been obtained for the major light-harvesting complex, LHCII, where the deletion of the N-terminal domain, which contains the putative binding sequence for L1 site, does not influence the carotenoid composition of the complex. The dragging force for the carotenoid binding is most probably to be found in hydrophobic interaction in the portion of the complex inside the membrane in a similar way to that observed in bacteria (40). Aromatic residues present in A and B helices can be involved in this binding. The position of these residues is not conserved in different members of the Lhc family but maintained in the same gene products from different species. Mutation analysis on the Chl binding residues both in CP29 and LHCII have shown that the interactions between Chls and carotenoids can play a major role in the xanthophylls binding. In particular, the binding of neoxanthin in the N1 site of LHCII is stabilized by interaction with Chls (14). This is consistent with CP29 lacking the N1 site; if the number of Chls in the domain in between helices A and C is lower than in LHCII, then critical Chl-neoxanthin interactions might be lacking. The loop in between helix A and helix C of CP29 is shorter with respect to the corresponding domain in LHCII; this may bring helix C closer to helix A and, thus, prevent Chl A6, A7, and B1 binding in both CP29 and the chimeric LHCII-CP29 complex..

0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Cytoplasmic dynein is the major molecular motor involved in minus-end-directed cellular transport along microtubules. There is increasing evidence that the retrograde transport of herpes simplex virus type 1 along sensory axons is mediated by cytoplasmic dynein, but the viral and cellular proteins involved are not known. Here we report that the herpes simplex virus outer capsid protein VP26 interacts with dynein light chains RP3 and Tctex1 and is sufficient to mediate retrograde transport of viral capsids in a cellular model. A library of herpes simplex virus capsid and tegument structural genes was constructed and tested for interactions with dynein subunits in a yeast two-hybrid system. A strong interaction was detected between VP26 and the homologous 14-kDa dynein light chains RP3 and Tctex1. In vitro pull-down assays confirmed binding of VP26 to RP3, Tctex1, and intact cytoplasmic dynein complexes. Recombinant herpes simplex virus capsids were constructed either with or without VP26. In pull-down assays VP26+ capsids bound to RP3; VP26-capsids did not. To investigate intracellular transport, the recombinant viral capsids were microinjected into living cells and incubated at 37  degrees C. After 1 h VP26+ capsids were observed to co-localize with RP3, Tctex1, and microtubules. After 2 or 4 h VP26+ capsids had moved closer to the cell nucleus, whereas VP26-capsids remained in a random distribution. We propose that VP26 mediates binding of incoming herpes simplex virus capsids to cytoplasmic dynein during cellular infection, through interactions with dynein light chains..

After inoculation of the skin or mucous membrane, HSV-1 is transported along sensory axons in a retrograde direction to the neuronal cell body, where it establishes life-long latent infection.

The nucleocapsid-tegument complex is transported to the outer nuclear membrane where it docks and releases viral DNA into the nucleus, but the capsid itself does not enter the nucleus (6). There is evidence that the rapid "retrograde" transport of this complex to the cell nucleus involves microtubules and is mediated by the minus-end-directed molecular motor cytoplasmic dynein (7 to 9). Retrograde transport of the closely related alphaherpesvirus pseudorabies virus (PRV) has been observed in live cells to be saltatory, with brief, rapid transport events (10). The herpes viral proteins that mediate retrograde transport are unknown but are likely to involve outer capsid or inner tegument proteins. In support of this, HSV-1 capsids, stripped of envelope and much of the tegument protein by detergent lysis, move in a retrograde direction after injection into giant squid axons (11). The site of attachment for the dynein complex on the capsid has not been confirmed..

Regulation of dynein function is not well understood but is thought to involve the multisubunit complex dynactin, which is also involved in binding membranous cargo (13). Light chain LC8 has been reported to interact with proteins from rabies virus (14, 15), African swine fever virus (16), human adenovirus, vaccinia virus, and human papillomavirus (17), whereas Tctex1 interacts with the poliovirus receptor CD155 (18). Despite a recently reported interaction between dynein intermediate chain (DIC) and HSV-1 protein UL34 (19), its role in retrograde transport has yet to be confirmed. The protein product of UL34 is absent from mature virions in HSV-1 (20) and PRV (21). Furthermore, deletion of UL34 from HSV-1 does not prevent infection of cells (22)..

Similar observations have been made for PRV (26). Fast anterograde, microtubule-dependent transport is mediated by the kinesin family of molecular motors (27).

His6-VP26 formed insoluble inclusion bodies, which were solubilized by denaturing with 8 M urea and then slowly refolded by dilution to 1 M urea. VP26 expressed in bacteria, denatured, and then refolded has been shown previously to bind to HSV-1 capsids, in either CHAPS buffer or 1 M urea (47, 48). His6-VP11/12 was only expressed at low concentrations. In vitro pull-down assays were performed by incubating His6-tagged HSV-1 proteins with GST fusion constructs of dynein subunits DIC, LC8, RP3, and Tctex1, bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Expression and subsequent elution from glutathione-Sepharose beads were confirmed for each GST-dynein construct, with GST-DIC present at lower concentrations than the other constructs (Fig. 2A). Refolded His6-VP26 bound to GST-Tctex1 and GST-RP3, but not to GST-DIC, GST-LC8, or GST alone (Fig. 2, B and C). Binding was not mediated via the His6 tag, because a His6-tagged kinesin heavy chain fragment (His6-KIF5B residues 771 to 963) did not bind to RP3 or Tctex1 (Fig. 2B). There was no evidence of dynein binding to His6-VP11/12, but this may simply reflect low expression levels (data not shown)..

Over half the capsids were found to co-localize with dynein light chains Tctex1 (A and B), RP3 (A and B, insets), and microtubules (C and D). To look for co-localization, red and green images were initially overlaid (A and C), and co-localization was formally analyzed using the confocal software (B and D). The Boolean AND operator was used, and where a red and green pixel co-localized, a bright pixel was displayed; where there was no co-localization, a black pixel was displayed..

Cells were then fixed either immediately or after 2 or 4 h (replicate experiments), labeled with anti-VP5 antibody, and the distribution of capsids within each cell determined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 7, A to D). Immediately following injection, both VP26- and VP26+ capsids were diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 7, A and C). After 2 h at 37  degrees C, VP26-capsids remained in a similar distribution (Fig. 7B), whereas VP26+ capsids had congregated near the nuclear rim in many cells (Fig. 7D). Similar distributions were observed after 4 h (data not shown)..

Recombinant HSV-1 capsids (VP26- or VP26+) were microinjected into Hep2 cells grown on glass coverslips. The cells were incubated for 0 or 2 h at 37  degrees C and then fixed. Capsids were labeled using NC1 polyclonal anti-VP5 antibody (green) and microtubules with monoclonal anti--tubulin antibody (red). Fluorescent particles (arrows) were clearly visible in the cytoplasm of injected cells (A to D), which were not present in uninjected cells (E). After 2 h, a redistribution of VP26+ (D) but not VP26-(B) capsids toward the cell nucleus was observed in these typical images. Nonspecific labeling of cell nuclei was observed with NC1 antibody (E), so intra-nuclear fluorescence was not included in our analysis. To quantify movement of HSV-1 capsids over time, the distance of individual fluorescent particles was measured from both the cell periphery b and nuclear membrane a, with the aid of image analysis software (F). Relative nuclear migration for each particle was expressed as a Nuclear Migration Index, calculated as b/(a + b) (43). Nuc, nucleus. Thus particles near the cell periphery received values close to 0, and particles near the nucleus received values close to 1..
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	67	  To quantify the distribution of capsids at different time points, a Nuclear Migration Index was assigned to each visible fluorescent particle, such that particles near the plasma membrane received values close to 0, whereas particles near the cell nucleus received values close to 1 (Fig. 7F). Over a thousand fluorescent particles were analyzed in two separate experiments. Fluorescent particles observed "within" the nucleus of injected and uninjected cells (Fig. 7E) were because of background fluorescence and were not included (see "Experimental Procedures"). There was no nonspecific labeling of the nuclear membrane, and fluorescent particles adjacent to the nuclear membrane could be clearly distinguished. General linear models were used to formally investigate the data from both experiments. Within experiments involving VP26+ capsids, the Nuclear Migration Index increased on average by 0.099 (S.E. 0.026), p  <  0.001, over 2 or 4 h, confirming overall movement toward the nucleus (Fig. 8). In contrast, within experiments involving VP26-capsids the Nuclear Migration Index decreased on average by 0.067 (S.E. 0.024), p = 0.006..

We believe that this result most likely reflects a lower sensitivity for this particular assay, in light of the other in vitro binding results. The ability to bind either RP3 or Tctex1 would be expected to offer HSV-1 an evolutionary advantage, by allowing retrograde transport of HSV-1 capsids on any cytoplasmic dynein complex in all cell types. We cannot exclude that recombinant Tctex1 may only bind to soluble VP26 in vitro and not to VP26 incorporated into recombinant HSV-1 capsids.

Tegument proteins VP11/12, VP13/14, VP16, and VP22 are known to dissociate from the virus at early stages of infection, whereas the major tegument protein VP1/2 and the minor capsid protein UL25 probably remain attached to incoming capsids (4, 5, 8, 50, 51). VP1/2 appears to attach to capsids at the vertical pentons (52), whereas VP26 is found exclusively on hexons (39, 48, 53) and does not interfere with capsid-tegument interaction (54). This specific binding is probably due to differing orientations of the upper domain of VP5, the structure of which has recently been solved (55)..

The significance of these results is unclear, but any role is likely to be later in the viral replication cycle, rather than during retrograde transport. It seems unlikely that VP11/12 is involved in retrograde transport of the capsid-tegument complex, because it dissociates from incoming capsids during cell infection (50), although retention of some residual VP11/12 during retrograde transport will be difficult to exclude. An interaction of VP11/12 with dynein may play a role during tegument assembly, however, because newly synthesized VP11/12 has been observed in perinuclear particles undergoing rapid, microtubule-dependent movement (50)..

We cannot exclude that VP1/2, or one of the minor capsid proteins such as UL25, may also contribute to dynein binding in vivo, as suggested by others (8, 10). Any binding of these or other HSV-1 proteins to dynein would imply redundancy in viral proteins available for retrograde transport, and may explain why VP26 is not an essential protein for replication in vitro (56). Redundancy for such an important process may be advantageous for the virus, and there are precedents for functional redundancy in other HSV-1 proteins (57). In our yeast two-hybrid system there was no evidence of interaction between dynein and a large fragment of VP1/2 (N-terminal two-thirds), but it was not possible to clone the rest of the protein. Neither was it possible to test UL25 in our system for possible interaction with RP3 or Tctex1, due to autoactivation..

There has been one previous study, in a mouse eye model, dissecting the role of VP26 in retrograde transport of HSV-1 to, and replication in, trigeminal ganglia (56). Deletion of VP26 decreased the amount of infectious virus in trigeminal ganglia by 100-fold, whereas titers in cell culture (where retrograde transport is less critical) were decreased only 2-fold. Simultaneous deletion of thymidine kinase (and thus replication) ablated the effects of VP26 deletion at 72 h after ocular infection, suggesting the virus could still be transported in the absence of VP26. However, earlier time points may be needed to detect a decrease in transport velocity or efficiency, because wild-type virus can arrive as early as 19 h postinfection (58)..

0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   We report the cloning and functional characterization of human cyclin L2, a novel member of the cyclin family. Human cyclin L2 shares significant homology to cyclin L1, K, T1, T2, and C, which are involved in transcriptional regulation via phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. The cyclin L2 protein contains an N-terminal "cyclin box" and C-terminal dipeptide repeats of alternating arginines and serines, a hallmark of the SR family of splicing factors. A new isoform and the mouse homologue of human cyclin L2 have also been cloned in this study. Human cyclin L2 is expressed ubiquitously in normal human tissues and tumor cells. We show here that cyclin L2 co-localizes with splicing factors SC-35 and 9G8 within nuclear speckles and that it associates with hyperphosphorylated, but not hypophosphorylated, RNA polymerase II and CDK p110 PITSLRE kinase via its N-terminal cyclin domains. It can also associate with the SC-35 and 9G8 through its RS repeat region. Recombinant cyclin L2 protein can stimulate in vitro mRNA splicing. Overexpression of human cyclin L2 suppresses the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC 7721 cells both in vitro and in vivo, inducing cellular apoptosis. This process involves up-regulation of p53 and Bax and decreased expression of Bcl-2. The data suggest that cyclin L2 represents a new member of the cyclin family, which might regulate the transcription and RNA processing of certain apoptosis-related factors, resulting in tumor cell growth inhibition and apoptosis..

Cyclins may be currently classified into two major groups, seemingly reflecting their functions. The cell cycle regulator cyclins, composed primarily of cyclin A, B, D1, D2, D3, E, and F, function with their CDK partners including CDK1, -2, -3, and -4 to regulate promotion of the cell cycle. The transcription regulator cyclins, which include cyclin C, H, K, L1, T1, and T2, work together with CDK7, -8, and -9 and tend to play roles in transcriptional regulation (6). The proposed functions of cyclin G1 and G2 are seemingly distinct from either cell cycle or transcriptional regulation (7). Other cyclins have also been identified, but their roles in cell cycle control and RNA transcription, if any, are unclear and remain to be studied..

During this process cyclins interact with the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, phosphorylating the C-terminal domain (CTD) via their partner CDKs. It is widely accepted that transcription and RNA processing are closely related. Capping enzymes, polyadenylation factors, and splicing factors assemble at the CTD of RNA polymerase II. Hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNAPIIo) stimulates RNA splicing, and the CTD has been observed to target some splicing factors to RNA transcription sites in vivo (8). Although there is no direct evidence to support a critical role for transcription regulator cyclins in regulation of cell cycle progression or cellular apoptosis, some results have implied that one transcription regulator cyclin, cyclin C, may be important for the regulation of cell proliferation in cooperation with c-Myc. Cyclin C has been reported to regulate both cell cycling and cell adhesion, suggesting that this cyclin may play some part in regulating both the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (9). It thus appears that some transcription regulator cyclins may also be involved in cell cycle progression or apoptosis, RNA transcription, and DNA repair, although the precise role of the phenomena remains to be elucidated..

SR proteins have a characteristic C-terminal Arg/Ser-rich repeat of variable length (RS domain) and RNA-binding domains in the N terminus and constitute a family of highly conserved nuclear phosphoproteins that can function as both essential and alternative pre-mRNA splicing factors (10, 11). SR-related proteins, proteins that are structurally and functionally distinct from the SR family, have also been identified. These proteins generally contain RS domains but not RNA-binding domains, are associated with the transcriptional machinery or mRNA 3'-end formation, and have been implicated in export. Cyclin L1 (originally named cyclin L) is the first known example of a cyclin containing an RS domain in addition to a typical "cyclin box" (12)..

Human cyclin L2 is also a cyclin box and RS repeat region-containing protein and localizes within the nuclear speckles, co-localizing with splicing factors SC-35 and 9G8. We demonstrate that human cyclin L2 associates with RNAPIIo, CDK p110 PITSLRE kinase (CDK11), SC-35, and 9G8. In addition, recombinant cyclin L2 protein can stimulate in vitro mRNA splicing. Furthermore, overexpression of exogenous cyclin L2 can suppress the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC 7721 cells both in vitro and in vivo, inducing cellular apoptosis, possibly by up-regulating expression of p53 and Bax and down-regulating Bcl-2. These results suggest that cyclin L2 may be a functional cyclin that associates with transcriptional regulation and participates in regulating the pre-mRNA splicing process. The mechanism by which cyclin L2 suppresses the growth and induces apoptosis of tumor cells requires further investigation..

A BLAST search of the NCBI genome data base indicated that the mouse cyclin L2 gene is located in the low terminus of mouse chromosome 4. A previous report (20) identified a 224-amino acid protein, mouse ANIA-6B, that was the same as N terminus of mouse cyclin L2. Based on the protein and genome structural analysis of human and mouse cyclin L2, mouse ANIA-6B might be the alternatively spliced isoform of mouse cyclin L2. The sequence of mouse cyclin L2 is available in the GenBankTM data base under accession number AY337018 [GenBank] ..

As shown in Fig. 8A, transient expression of CCNL2-wt and CCNL2-RS induced an increase in p53 and Bax protein expression (3- and 4-fold, respectively) in SMMC 7721 cells 72 h post-transfection compared with pCCNL2-AS-, pCCNL2-CL-, mock vector-transfected, or parental SMMC 7721 cells. Significantly up-regulated p53 and Bax mRNA expression was also detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 8B). Conversely, Bcl-2 expression was down-regulated in SMMC 7721 cells overexpressing human cyclin L2. These results demonstrate that overexpression of human cyclin L2 modulates the expression of critical apoptotic factors, leading to cell apoptosis. It would be interesting to determine whether other apoptotic factors may also have a relationship with apoptosis induced by overexpression of human cyclin L2..

The first cyclins were identified and named due to their critical function in the regulation of the cell cycle, but some cyclins and their partner molecules, CDKs, are now recognized to have important functions beyond regulation of the cell cycle (23). These cyclins include cyclin C, H, T1, T2, K, and L1, which have proposed roles in transcriptional regulation, and cyclin G1, G2, and I, which appear to have distinct roles from either cell cycle or transcriptional regulation (24). In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel cyclin family member, cyclin L2. Human cyclin L2 is a novel cyclin box- and RS repeat region-containing protein that localizes within the nuclear speckles, co-localized with splicing factors SC-35 and 9G8. Among the known human cyclin proteins, cyclin L2 is most closely related to the C-type cyclins, such as cyclins L1, K, T1, T2, and C, particularly in the cyclin box region. C-type cyclins and their CDK partners are defined by their capacity to phosphorylate the CTD of RNA polymerase II, a step required for transcriptional elongation and RNA processing. It has been reported that cyclin H/CDK7 (25, 26), cyclin C/CDK8 (27), and cyclin K/CDK9 (28 to 30) promote transcriptional elongation and affect RNA processing indirectly through phosphorylation of the CTD. Phosphorylation of the CTD by cyclin T/CDK9 is shown to be essential for the transition from initiation of transcription to effective elongation of nascent mRNA transcripts (31). Based on sequence homology and the experimental observation that human cyclin L2 immunoprecipitates are associated with the hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II, it is very likely that CTD is also a target of cyclin L2/CDK in vivo..

0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	97	The various aspects of RNA elongation and processing, including capping, splicing, and polyadenylation of nascent transcripts, are tightly coupled by protein factors physically associating with the CTD of RNA polymerase II (32). Human cyclin L2 possesses RS-repeat domains, a characteristic feature of SR protein/spliceosome components, and associates and co-localizes with the known splicing factors SC-35 and 9G8. RS domains have been discovered in several factors associated with transcription components, including the SR-like CTD-associated factors (33) and in a 3'-end cleavage factor, cleavage factor-I 68-kDa subunit (34), suggesting that communication between splicing and both transcription and 3'-end processing might in some cases be mediated by interactions involving RS domain proteins (35, 36). We have confirmed the stimulatory effect of cyclin L2 in pre-mRNA splicing. This activity may be mediated by interaction through its cyclin domains with RNA polymerase II and CDK p110 PITSLRE, or direct or indirect interaction via cyclin domain/RS repeat region with SC-35 and 9G8, as an RNA elongation/processing unit, in the nuclear speckles. Of note, while this manuscript was in revision, de Graaf et al. (37) reported cyclin L1 and cyclin L2 as interaction partners and substrates of DYRK1A (dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A), a nuclear speckle-locating protein kinase with transcription factors and splicing factors as its substrates. Because human cyclin L2 and cyclin L1 are expressed differentially at different levels in different cells and tissues, it is possible that these two closely related cyclins contribute to tissue-specific regulation of splicing..

PITSLRE CDK also interacts selectively with RNAPIIo but not with RNAPIIa, and PITSLRE proteins also contain many serine/arginine dipeptide repeats, characteristic of spliceosome components. The p110 PITSLRE has been shown to participate in a signaling pathway that may regulate the processing of RNA transcription. It interacts with the RNA-binding protein RNPS1, an activator of mRNA splicing, RNA polymerase II, and multiple transcriptional elongation factors, regulating some aspects of RNA splicing and/or transcription in proliferating cells (38 to 40). Due to its identification as a partner for human cyclin L1 (12) and its mouse homologue cyclin ANIA-6A (20), it is referred to as CDK11. We show that human cyclin L2 can associate with p110 PITSLRE in a cyclin domain-dependent manner, suggesting that it is also likely to be a partner CDK for cyclin L2..

0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	101	Our work here also revealed that overexpression of human cyclin L2 suppressed the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC 7721 cells both in vitro and in vivo, and induced cellular apoptosis in vitro. Cyclin L2 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, and in a variety of human cell lines, including SMMC 7721 cells. Under normal conditions, tumor cells such as SMMC 7721 cells may have anti-apoptotic mechanisms in place which antagonize the apoptosis-inducing effects of cyclin L2. However, when cyclin L2 is overexpressed, the apoptosis-inducing effects of cyclin L2 may counterattack these anti-apoptotic mechanisms, resulting in an imbalance between apoptosis and cell survival and cell cycle regulation, if any. Previous studies have implicated other cyclins in apoptosis and growth inhibition of tumor cells. A potential p53-binding site is present in intron 1 of the cyclin K gene, and colony formation assays indicate that overexpression of cyclin K suppresses growth of the glioblastoma cell lines U373MG and T98G and colon carcinoma SW480 cells (41). At high levels, cyclin G1, a p53-responsive gene induced in alternative reading frame-arrested cells, also induces a G1-phase arrest in mammalian cells that coincides with p53 activation. Interestingly, growth inhibition by cyclin G1 does not require p53 but instead exhibits partial retinoblastoma protein dependence (42). A recent study by cDNA microarray and RT-PCR indicates that cyclin L1 is commonly overexpressed in well differentiated but not in poorly differentiated primary head and neck tumors, compared with corresponding correlative normal tissues (43). Other RS repeat-containing proteins such as Hs-BTF (44) can also act as apoptosis-promoting proteins that interact with Bcl-2-related proteins. To gain insight into the mechanism of cyclin L2-induced apoptosis in SMMC 7721 cells, we assessed the expression of the apoptosis-related proteins p53, Bax, and Bcl-2. In our study, following transient expression of cyclin L2 in SMMC 7721 cells, p53 and Bax expression was observed to increase significantly, and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression could also be observed. Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of p53 can transactivate Bax expression and inhibit Bcl-2 expression, resulting in apoptotic cell death (45). Combined with other observations, including its association with RNAPII, CDK p110 PITSLRE, and splicing factors, and its stimulatory effect in pre-mRNA splicing, our results suggest that overexpression of cyclin L2 might regulate the RNA transcription and processing of certain apoptosis-related factors, possibly through a p53-dependent increase in Bax and reduction in Bcl-2 pathway signaling, leading to tumor cell growth inhibition..

Here, we identify a 1.4 kb cis-acting enhancer element from the kni locus that faithfully directs gene expression in the L2 primordium. We find that three independent ri alleles have alterations mapping within the L2-enhancer element and show that two of these observed lesions eliminate the ability of the enhancer element to direct gene expression in the L2 primordium. The L2 enhancer can be subdivided into distinct activation and repression domains. The activation domain mediates the combined action of the general wing activator Scalloped and a putative locally provided factor, the activity of which is abrogated by a single nucleotide alteration in the ri53j mutant. We also find that misexpression of genes in L2 that are normally expressed in veins other than L2 results in abnormal L2 development. These experiments provide a mechanistic basis for understanding how kni and knrl link AP patterning to morphogenesis of the L2 vein by orchestrating the expression of a selective subset of vein-promoting genes in the L2 primordium..

The Drosophila wing is a system that is particularly well suited for studying the relationship between patterning and morphogenesis. For example, mechanisms for establishing positional information along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis have been analyzed in detail (reviewed by Lawrence and Struhl, 1996; Strigini and Cohen, 1999; Klein, 2001) and morphological structures such as the five major longitudinal veins (L1-L5) form at invariant positions along the AP axis of the adult wing (reviewed by Garcia-Bellido and de Celis, 1992; Bier, 2000). As described below, the five wing veins can be distinguished from one another by several criteria including: expression of specific combinations of genes during development; whether they are located primarily on the dorsal or ventral surfaces of the wing (odd versus even numbered veins respectively); and by the types or absence of sensory organs that form along them (e.g. sensory organs form on the L1 and L3 veins, but not on the L2, L4 or L5 veins). An interesting question then, is how vein-specific as well as more general vein developmental programs are initiated at various locations in response to different positional information..

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	10	Wing vein development in Drosophila can be subdivided into two temporally distinct stages: initiation and differentiation. Vein initiation begins during the mid-third larval instar (Waddington, 1940; Garcia-Bellido, 1977; Garcia-Bellido and de Celis, 1992; Sturtevant et al., 1993; Sturtevant and Bier, 1995; Bier, 2000) when the wing imaginal disc is a monolayer of cells. The wing blade proper derives from an oval region of the wing disc known as the wing pouch, while the remainder of the disc generates elements of the wing hinge and thoracic body wall. Vein differentiation, the second phase of vein development, occurs during metamorphosis as the wing disc buds out (or everts), folding along the future wing margin. Ultimately, this eversion leads to the apposition of the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the wing during pupal development, creating the bilayer of cells comprising the mature wing blade..

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	12	Genes involved in initiating wing vein development (vein genes) are expressed during the third larval instar in narrow stripes, corresponding to vein primordia, or in broader `provein' stripes, consisting of cells that are competent to become vein cells (Biehs et al., 1998). Some vein genes are expressed in all vein primordia, while others are expressed in subsets of veins or in single veins. For example rhomboid (rho), which encodes an integral membrane protein (Bier et al., 1990; Sturtevant et al., 1996), is expressed in all vein primordia and promotes vein formation throughout wing development by locally activating the Egfr signaling pathway (Sturtevant et al., 1993; Noll et al., 1994; Bier, 1998a; Bier, 1998b; Guichard et al., 1999). caupolican (caup) and the neighboring gene araucan (ara) encode related homeobox genes that promote expression of other vein genes such as rho in odd numbered veins. Proneural genes such as achaete (ac) and scute (sc) promote neural development in the L1 and L3 primordium (Gomez-Skarmata et al., 1996). Delta (Dl) encodes a ligand for the Notch (N) receptor, which mediates lateral inhibitory interactions among cells in vein-competent domains during pupal development (Shellenbarger and Mohler, 1978; Kooh et al., 1993; Parody and Muskavitch, 1993). Delta is also expressed earlier during larval stages of wing development in all longitudinal veins except L2, and is likely to play a role in limiting vein thickness at this stage as well, since loss of Notch function during larval development leads to greatly broadened expression of the vein marker rho (Sturtevant and Bier, 1995). kni and knrl, which encode related zinc finger transcription factors in the steroid hormone superfamily (Nauber et al., 1988; Oro et al., 1988; Rothe et al., 1989), are expressed in a single stripe corresponding to the L2 primordium beginning in the mid-third larval instar, and are required to initiate L2 development (Lunde et al., 1998). kni also functions as a gap gene in early embryonic development (Nusslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980; Nauber et al., 1988)..
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	13	The L2 stripe of kni/knrl-expressing cells forms along the anterior border of a broad domain of cells expressing high levels of the related and functionally overlapping spalt-major (salm) (Kuhnlein et al., 1994) and spalt-related (salr) (Barrio et al., 1996) zinc finger transcription factors. A variety of evidence indicates that central domain cells expressing the patterning genes salm and salr (together referred to as sal) induce their anterior neighbors, which express very low levels of sal, to become the L2 primordium (Sturtevant et al., 1997; Lunde et al., 1998). For example, in wings containing salm-mutant clones, ectopic branches of L2 are induced that track along and inside the salm- clone borders, mimicking the normal situation in which an L2 vein forms just outside the domain of high-level sal-expressing cells (Sturtevant et al., 1997). This ability of sal-expressing cells to induce their anterior low-level sal-expressing neighbors to initiate L2 development requires the activity of the kni locus (Lunde et al., 1998). The induction of kni/knrl expression in the L2 primordium therefore provides an excellent system for studying the transition from spatial patterning to tissue morphogenesis..

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	15	Once activated along the anterior sal border, kni and knrl organize development of the L2 vein, in part by activating expression of the key vein-promoting gene rho and by suppressing expression of the intervein gene blistered (bs) (Montagne et al., 1996; Lunde et al., 1998). The kni locus is highly selective in regulating downstream gene expression in the L2 primordium as revealed by the observation that several genes expressed in other veins, such as caup and ara, ac and sc, and Delta, are excluded from the L2 primordium. Thus, the kni locus links patterning to vein-specific morphogenesis by functioning downstream of sal and upstream of genes involved in vein versus intervein development..
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	16	The role of the kni locus in L2 formation has been clarified by analysis of likely regulatory alleles of the kni locus, previously known as radius incompletus (ri) (Arajarvi and Hannah-Alava, 1969; Lunde et al., 1998). Flies with this mutation lack large sections of the L2 vein. kniri mutants are homozygous viable, in contrast to kni null mutants, which die as embryos with a gap gene phenotype (Nusslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980; Nauber et al., 1988). In support of kniri mutations being wing-specific regulatory alleles of the kni/knrl locus, expression of kni and knrl in the L2 primordium is absent in kniri[1] mutants, and the L2 vein-loss phenotype can be partially rescued by ubiquitous expression of kni in the wing (Lunde et al., 1998)..
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	17	The findings summarized above suggest that kni and knrl organize the L2 vein developmental program by orchestrating expression of genes that execute distinct subsets of functions required for proper L2 development. Several important unanswered questions remain, including: what function(s) are disrupted in kniri[1] and other existing kniri mutants?; do these mutations eliminate the function of an L2-specific cis-regulatory element in the kni locus?; and finally, with respect to the definition of L2 versus other veins, is it important to exclude expression of genes expressed in veins other than the L2 primordium?.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	19	In this study we report the identification of an enhancer element upstream of the kni coding region that selectively directs gene expression in the L2 primordium in third instar larval wing discs. We show that three separate ri alleles have defects mapping within a minimal 1.4 kb L2 enhancer element. We demonstrate that two of these mutations eliminate activity of the L2 enhancer, kniri[1], which contains a 252 bp deletion, and kniri[53j], which harbors a single base-pair substitution. We find that truncation of the minimal L2 enhancer to a 0.69 kb fragment leads to ectopic reporter gene expression in the extreme anterior and posterior regions of the wing, indicating that repression contributes to restricting activation of the L2 enhancer. In addition, we show that the general wing promoting transcription factor Scalloped (Sd) binds with high affinity to several sites in the L2 enhancer and that sd is required for kni expression in the wing disc. We have also employed the L2 enhancer element as a tool to drive expression of various UAS transgenes in the L2 primordium. We find that the loss of the L2 vein in ri mutants can be rescued by L2-specific expression of either the kni or knrl genes, or the downstream target gene rho. In addition, we find that misexpression of genes in the L2 primordium that are normally expressed in veins other than L2 results in abnormal L2 development. These results provide a framework for understanding how positional information is converted into morphogenesis of the L2 wing vein by `vein organizing genes' such as kni and knrl..

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	37	   RESULTS TOP SUMMARY INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   An L2 enhancer element lies upstream of the knirps coding region In a previous study, we presented genetic evidence that the kniri[1] mutation, as well as an approximately 50 kb deletion of kni upstream sequences (Df(3L)kniri[XT2]), disrupt the function of a wing-specific regulatory element in the kni locus that is responsible for driving expression of the kni and knrl genes in the L2 primordium (Lunde et al., 1998). As a consequence of the loss of kni/knrl expression, kniri[1] (Fig. 1B) and Df(3L)kniri[XT2] (Fig. 1C) flies have severely truncated L2 veins (compare with the wild-type vein pattern in Fig. 1A). As a first step in extending these studies, we gathered and characterized four other putative independently generated viable ri alleles of the kni locus, which lack portions of the L2 vein, including kniri[53j] (Fig. 1D), kniri[M3], kniri[92f], and kniri[M*] (not shown). As in kniri[1] wing discs, we found that kni expression is eliminated in the L2 primordium of each of these kniri alleles (data not shown)..
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	38	The studies mentioned above suggested that there might be an L2-specific wing vein enhancer that controls expression of kni and knrl in the L2 primordium. We searched for such an enhancer element in two ways. First, we screened for the ability of genomic fragments upstream of the kni coding region to drive lacZ expression in the L2 primordium (summarized in Fig. 1E). Second, we used Southern blot analysis to identify deletions or rearrangement breakpoints in the genomic DNA of ri mutants in the kni upstream region uncovered by Df(3L)kniri[XT2] (Fig. 1E, see below). As a result of the former effort, we identified a single 4.8 kb EcoRI fragment (fragment E in Fig. 1E-G) that drives lacZ reporter gene expression in a sharp stripe (Fig. 2B) similar to that of endogenous kni expression in the L2 primordium (Fig. 2A). Double label experiments confirm that lacZ expression driven by the E-lacZ construct coincides with that of endogenous kni expression (Fig. 2C). Additionally, the E-lacZ expression pattern includes a weaker stripe in the posterior region of the wing (Fig. 2B, arrow). A faint endogenous kni stripe can also be observed in this location in overstained preparations of wildtype discs (data not shown). Consistent with previous studies (Lunde et al., 1998), the E-lacZ L2 stripe is located just anterior to the broad domain of strong salm expression (Fig. 2D). Notably, the weaker posterior E-lacZ stripe forms immediately adjacent to the posterior border of the salm domain (Fig. 2D)..

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	41	In order to delimit a minimal L2 enhancer element, we tested the ability of 5' truncated derivatives of the 4.8 kb fragment E (Fig. 1G) to drive reporter gene expression in larval wing imaginal discs. We observed that subfragments of 2.0 kb (EcoRI-SalI, data not shown) and 1.4 kb (the EcoRI-XhoI fragment EX, Fig. 1G) drive expression of lacZ (Fig. 2E) in patterns nearly indistinguishable from that of the 4.8 kb E-lacZ construct (Fig. 2B). Further truncation generating a 0.69 kb EcoRI-HincII fragment (EC, Fig. 1G), however, results in high levels of ectopic lacZ expression in broad anterior and posterior domains (Fig. 2F). This observation indicates that regulatory element(s) required to repress gene expression in the extreme anterior and posterior domains of the wing primordium reside between the distal 0.69 kb and 1.4 kb of fragment EX (repression domain, Fig. 3B), and that sequences sufficient for activation are contained within the proximal 0.69 kb fragment EC (activation domain, Fig. 3A). As discussed below, we have identified sequences necessary for L2 activity in the activation domain as well as potential repressor binding sites in the proposed repression domain (Fig. 3A,B, Fig. 7)..

These experimentally determined sites define a consensus [(A/T)(A/G)NAT(G/T)TNT], which matches well with the consensus [WRVWATKYR] derived for Sd binding to other wing enhancers that require vestigial and sd function such as bs=DSRF (Halder et al., 1998), cut, sal and the vg quadrant element (Guss et al., 2001).

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	43	  View larger version (29K):    Fig. 7. A model for L2 initiation: global activation, regional repression and local induction. (A) Activation of kni expression in the L2 primordium as a consequence of the action of patterning genes initiates morphogenesis of the L2 vein. Analysis of the kni/knrl locus L2 enhancer element reveals that this element is activated in a narrow stripe by a combination of global wing specific activation, regional repression, and localized signal mediated activation. Global wing-specific activation is provided at least in part by Sd/Vg (this study). Regional repression is mediated either directly or indirectly by Salm/Salr (Sal) in central wing cells (Lunde et al., 1998), and by a repressor(s) acting in peripheral wing cells (green domain)   possibly Brk (this study). In addition, a short range signal X (blue), which is produced by Sal-expressing cells (pink domain) is required to induce kni/knrl expression (blue line) in cells just anterior to sal-expressing cells. Since kni/knrl expression is activated in cells just anterior to the sal expression domain, but not in posterior cells adjacent to the sal domain (dashed blue line), there must be either a repressor (e.g. En?) acting in the posterior compartment (hatched) or an activator acting in the anterior compartment together with X' which provides this AP specificity in kni/knrl activation. The AP compartment border is indicated (solid black line). (B) The kni/knrl L2 enhancer can be subdivided into separate domains mediating at least certain components of activation (black region) and repression (red region). Global wing-specific activation, which requires Sd/Vg function (this study), is mediated by some combination of the empirically determined Sd binding sites (brown ovals) of which there are four single sites and one double site in the activation region. The action of the hypothetical signal X is presumably mediated by a transcription factor X', which binds to sequences in the activation domain. The binding site for factor X' (blue circle) may include sequences containing the single nucleotide mutated in the kniri[53j] mutant (C596A) since L2 enhancer activity is selectively lost in the L2 primordium of these flies. This site is also eliminated in the 252 bp deletion in the kniri[1] mutant (dark blue region), as are additional sequences required for activity of the enhancer throughout the wing (e.g. four single Sd sites). The repression domain contains five predicted binding sites for the repressor Brk (green diamonds), two sites for En (hatched yellow triangles), and one site for Salr (pink diamond). Since the reporter gene expression driven by the activation region alone is repressed in central cells, this fragment must also contain some yet unidentified binding sites for Salm, Salr, or some other factor mediating the repressive effect of Salm/Salr..

Accordingly, we PCR amplified and sequenced the 1.4 kb fragment (EX, Fig. 1G) corresponding to the minimal L2 enhancer from kniri[53j]. We found only a single nucleotide difference between the sequence of this mutant allele and the wild-type fragment EX (C596A, Fig. 3A), which lies within the same 252 bp region deleted in kniri[1]. Although it has been observed that single nucleotide mutations can eliminate endogenous enhancer function (Shimell et al., 1994), such cases are sufficiently rare that it was important, as in the case of kniri[1], to demonstrate whether this point mutation was responsible for the loss of enhancer function. We used the EX kniri[53j] PCR fragment to make a lacZ construct, confirmed the sequence of the mutant construct, generated four independent transformants, and tested these flies for lacZ expression in third instar wing discs. We found that EX(ri53j)-lacZ mutant wing discs fail to express lacZ in the L2 primordium (Fig. 2H), strongly suggesting that this single base pair mutation is responsible for the observed L2 vein loss phenotype observed in kniri[53j] flies. One notable difference between the EX(ri53j)-lacZ and Eri1-lacZ mutant wing discs is that in the point mutant construct (ri53j), lacZ expression is lost selectively in the L2 primordium and in the weaker posterior stripe (note the normal levels and pattern of expression in extreme anterior and posterior regions of the disc, Fig. 2H), while in the deletion mutant construct (Eri1), reporter gene expression is eliminated throughout the wing disc (Fig. 2G)..

We used the EX kniri[53j] PCR fragment to make a lacZ construct, confirmed the sequence of the mutant construct, generated four independent transformants, and tested these flies for lacZ expression in third instar wing discs. We found that EX(ri53j)-lacZ mutant wing discs fail to express lacZ in the L2 primordium (Fig. 2H), strongly suggesting that this single base pair mutation is responsible for the observed L2 vein loss phenotype observed in kniri[53j] flies. One notable difference between the EX(ri53j)-lacZ and Eri1-lacZ mutant wing discs is that in the point mutant construct (ri53j), lacZ expression is lost selectively in the L2 primordium and in the weaker posterior stripe (note the normal levels and pattern of expression in extreme anterior and posterior regions of the disc, Fig. 2H), while in the deletion mutant construct (Eri1), reporter gene expression is eliminated throughout the wing disc (Fig. 2G)..

As the ubiquitous expression of this transcription unit is not affected in kniri[53j] mutants (K. L., unpublished observations) and fusion of fragment R with lacZ does not result in gene expression in the L2 primordium, we have no evidence to suggest that this aberration has any relevance to the L2 vein loss phenotype of kniri[53j] mutants..

We tested whether Sd might similarly be required to activate endogenous kni expression by generating clones of cells homozygous for a strong hypomorphic allele of sd using FLP-FRT mediated mitotic recombination (Golic, 1991). In sd clones, ss-galactosidase expression driven by the E-lacZ element is reduced (Fig. 3D). In clones falling along the future wing margin, however, reporter gene expression is unaffected (not shown; see Discussion).

We searched for specific Sd DNA binding sites in the 0.69 kb EC activation domain using DNAse I footprinting and gel shift analysis (Fig. 3G and data not shown) and identified five sites bound by the Sd TEA domain, which conform well to the known Sd consensus binding site and consist of a tandem doublet of Sd binding sites and four single binding sites (Fig. 3A). The four single Sd sites are removed by the 252 bp deletion in the kniri[1] allele, however, none of them covers the kniri[53j] point mutation. To determine whether Sd plays a direct role in activating the L2 enhancer, we mutated a subset of these Sd binding sites in the context of the EC-lacZ construct, transformed these mutated constructs into flies and stained for lacZ expression in third instar wing discs. We found that mutation of the doublet at 271 in combination with the two single sites at 570 and 640 resulted in a complete loss of lacZ expression in the wing disc (Fig. 3H). These results indicate that Sd is required for activation of kni expression in the wing disc..

For example, the vein- and sensory organ-promoting gene ara is expressed in the odd numbered veins (L1, L3, and L5), the proneural genes ac and sc are expressed in L1 and L3, and the Notch ligand Delta is expressed in L1 and L3-L5, but not in L2. We were interested to know whether it is necessary to exclude expression of these genes from the L2 primordium for normal L2 development. To address this question, we misexpressed UAS-transgene copies of these genes in the L2 primordium with the L2-GAL4 driver and examined the L2 vein in adult wings. In each case, we observed defects in L2 development. Misexpression of the lateral inhibitory signal Delta in L2-GAL4 > UAS-Dl flies results in modest truncation of the L2 vein in females (Fig. 5A) and almost entirely eliminates the L2 vein in sibling males (Fig. 5B), which are the consistently more severely affected sex. The near elimination of L2 development in severely affected Dl-misexpressing males is accompanied by a loss of rho expression in the L2 primordium of third instar larval wing discs (Fig. 5D), compare with wild-type rho expression in Fig. 5C). Misexpression of the proneural gene sc in the L2 primordium of L2-GAL4 > UAS-sc flies results in L2 veins covered with ectopic bristles (Fig. 5E). The great majority of these ectopic bristles are strictly confined to the L2 primordium, consistent with the double label experiments (Fig. 2C) indicating that the L2-enhancer element drives gene expression precisely in the L2 primordium. In addition, ectopic bristles form sporadically in a broad posterior domain of the wing, which derives from a region of the wing disc in which the L2 enhancer element is also expressed in a weak diffuse pattern (Fig. 2B,D). Finally, misexpression of the ara gene in L2-GAL4 > UAS-ara flies causes a reproducible thinning of the L2 vein (Fig. 5F). Cumulatively, these results underscore the importance of excluding expression of non-L2 vein genes from the L2 primordium..

The ability to drive highly localized expression of genes in a non-essential tissue with L2-GAL4 suggests that this driver could be used as an effective tool to dissect the function and range of action of various genes. For example, since the eagle (eg) gene encodes a steroid hormone receptor closely related to Kni and Knrl (Rothe et al., 1989) we wondered whether this gene could substitute for kni or knrl in rescuing kniri[1] mutants. eg is involved in neuroblast specification during embryogenesis (Higashijima et al., 1996; Dittrich et al., 1997; Lundell and Hirsh, 1998), but is not expressed in the wing pouch (data not shown) and is not known to play a role in development of the wing proper.

As a test of this idea we compared the phenotypes resulting from driving expression of an activated form of the Egfr (top) in the L2 primordium versus expression of the secreted Egf-like ligands Vein (Schnepp et al., 1996) and sSpitz (Schweitzer et al., 1995; Schnepp et al., 1998). Consistent with top acting in a cell autonomous fashion to promote vein versus intervein development, expression of this gene in the L2 primordium of L2-GAL4 > UAS-top wings (Fig. 6B) had no effect on the development of the L2 vein or neighboring intervein cells. In contrast, when secreted Egf ligands were expressed in a similar fashion in L2-GAL4 > UAS-vn wings (Fig. 6C) or in L2-GAL4 > UAS-sspi wings (Fig. 6D), we observed ectopic veins that formed 2-3 cell diameters away from the L2 vein.

The ability of secreted ligands, but not the top construct, to induce ectopic vein formation at a distance cannot be attributed simply to the latter being a weaker activator of Egfr signaling since UAS-top is considerably more effective at generating ectopic veins than UAS-vn when other wing-GAL4 drivers are used (e.g. MS1096-GAL4 or CY2-GAL4, data not shown)..

As these two deletions have endpoints that break within the same 1.7 kb EcoRI fragment (indicated by the dashed vertical lines in Fig. 1E), one explanation for the failure of complementation could be that this 1.7 kb fragment contains the L2 enhancer. The alternative explanation for the ri phenotype of Df(3L)kniri[XT2]/Df(3L)kniFC82 is that transvection (Lewis, 1954; Geyer et al., 1990; Pirrotta, 1999), which normally occurs between regulatory and coding region alleles of the kni locus (Lunde et al., 1998), is interrupted by the large divergent deletions that have little if any overlap. Since the 4.8 EcoRI fragment containing the L2 enhancer maps nearly 10 kb upstream of the 1.7 kb EcoRI fragment, and a lacZ fusion construct (abd-lacZ, Fig. 1E) containing the 1.7 kb EcoRI fragment does not drive any gene expression in the wing disc (Lunde et al., 1998), the latter hypothesis that Df(3L)kniri[XT2] and Df(3L)kniFC82 are unable to engage in effective transvection is the most likely explanation for the failure of these two mutations to complement..

Previous genetic experiments have suggested a model in which sal-expressing cells produce a short-range L2 inducing signal (X) to which sal-expressing cells themselves cannot respond (Sturtevant et al., 1997; Lunde et al., 1998). According to this `for export only' signaling model, the signal X diffuses into adjacent anterior cells and activates expression of the kni/knrl genes in the L2 primordium, in much the same fashion as Hh, expressed from the refractory posterior compartment, activates expression of target genes such as dpp or ptc in the anterior compartment (reviewed by Bier, 2000). Based on the analysis of the L2 enhancer element described in this study, the 252 bp region deleted in kniri[1] mutants may contain response element(s) to this putative factor X. It is worth noting, however, that lacZ expression is lost in all cells of the wing disc (posterior and circumferential cells as well as the L2 primordium) when these sequences are deleted from the 4.8 kb fragment. This observation suggests that sequences mediating more general activation (e.g. Sd binding sites, see below) may also be contained within this 252 bp region. The sequence surrounding the single nucleotide alteration in kniri[53j] mutants (C596A), however, is a particularly intriguing candidate for mediating the L2-specific activation of kni since introducing this mutation in the context of the minimal 1.4 kb enhancer leads to selective loss of lacZ expression only in the stripe of cells adjacent to the sal domain..
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	77	The hypothetical transcription factor X' (Fig. 7B) that binds to the region surrounding the kniri[53j] point mutation and mediates the inductive signal X presumably collaborates with the more generally required wing selector Sd (Halder et al., 1998; Guss et al., 2001), since mutation of four of the Sd binding sites (the doublet and two single sites) in the L2 activation domain completely eliminates enhancer activity in the wing disc. Clonal analysis with a hypomorphic sd allele also indicates that sd is required for high-level expression of the full 4.8 kb L2 enhancer element in the wing disc. It is notable that the reduction in lacZ expression in these clones is not as dramatic as the complete loss of L2 activity observed when Sd binding sites in the activation domain are mutated. There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy. Firstly, the sd mutation used in these experiments is a hypomorphic allele and therefore has residual activity. Unfortunately, stronger sd alleles produce even smaller viable clones in the wing disc and thus were not used. Secondly, as only small clones can be generated, they must typically have been produced with only two or three intervening cycles of cell division. Consequently, the sd  cells may still contain functional levels of wild type Sd (protein perdurance). Another possibility is that other activators can partially substitute for Sd, at least in certain regions of the wing. Based on the absence of L2 activity when Sd binding sites are mutated and the reduction in L2 activity in sd  hypomorphic clones, we conclude that Sd plays an important role as an activator of the L2 enhancer. These results support the view that Sd functions as a general transcriptional activator of genes expressed in the wing field..

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	79	Repression also plays a key role in restricting L2 enhancer expression to a narrow stripe of wing disc cells. It has been shown previously that salm and salr, which are expressed strongly in the central region of the wing, repress expression of kni and knrl (Lunde et al., 1998), although low levels of sal may also be required to activate kni expression (de Celis and Barrio, 2000). In the current study we also find evidence for repression of L2-enhancer activity in peripheral wing disc cells abutting those expressing high levels of sal. Truncation of the minimal 1.4 kb (fragment EX) L2 enhancer element results in reporter gene expression expanding to fill the anterior and posterior regions of the wing pouch in a pattern complementary to that of sal. The region deleted from the EX fragment contains several consensus binding sites for Brinker (Fig. 3B, Fig. 7B) (Rushlow et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2001), which may mediate this repression since the pattern of brinker (brk) expression in the wing pouch (Campbell and Tomlinson, 1999; Jazwinska et al., 1999) is very similar to that of lacZ expression driven by the 0.69 kb fragment EC. One way to integrate the action of the localized inductive signal XX' pathway with that of abutting central and peripheral repressive factors is to propose that the signal-dependent activator X' can overcome the repressive action of the peripheral inhibitor but not repression by Salm/Salr (see legend to Fig. 7). One feature common to several prominent signaling pathways is that activation of the pathway converts a resting repressor into a transcriptional activator (Barolo and Posakony, 2002). In the kni L2 enhancer, activation of the hypothetical signal X pathway may relieve repression by a heterologous repressor since the putative activator (i.e. X') and repressor (e.g. Brk?) sequences in the L2 enhancer are separable. One example of a signaling pathway that functions by relieving inhibition by a heterologous repressor is the recent report of Egfr signaling inactivating repression by Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) (Tsuda et al., 2002). In addition to central and peripheral repression in the wing disc, there may also be a repressor in posterior compartment cells (e.g. En, Fig. 7A,B) to prevent activation of the L2 enhancer in cells posterior to the sal expression domain. Perhaps the 4.8 kb L2 enhancer element lacks some sites for this putative repressor since E-lacZ drives significantly higher levels of gene expression in the posterior stripe than that observed for endogenous kni or knrl expression..

The primordia of all longitudinal veins also express the rhomboid gene, which is required for activating the Egfr pathway in vein but not in intervein cells. In addition to these shared properties, each vein can be distinguished by expression of other vein genes (Biehs et al., 1998). For example, vein L2-specific characteristics include: expression of kni and knrl, lack of Delta expression, lack of cauplara expression, and lack of ac/sc expression. Given that all veins are ultimately quite similar morphologically, it is relevant to ask whether the differences in gene expression patterns observed in different veins are important..

These experiments strongly suggest that exclusion of non-L2 vein genes from the L2 primordium is indeed important since misexpression of each of these genes resulted in abnormal L2 development. The phenotypes resulting from misexpressing non-L2 vein genes in the L2 primordium can largely be reconciled with the normal functions of these genes. For example, forced expression of Dl leads to loss of L2, consistent with suppression of vein formation by Notch signaling. The ectopic bristles that form strictly along the L2 vein in wings misexpressing ac or sc are also consistent with the neural promoting function of proneural genes. It is less clear why misexpression of the ara gene causes thinning of the L2 primordium, since this gene normally activates expression of the vein-promoting gene rho in odd numbered veins and ac and sc in the L3 primordium. Perhaps expression of a gene normally involved in development of the odd numbered dorsal veins is somehow incompatible with development of the ventral L2 vein..

For example, in the case of the Egfr pathway, it is possible to distinguish components exerting cell-autonomous versus non cell-autonomous functions. In line with the fact that activation of the Egfr pathway in the wing leads to the formation of veins, L2-GAL4-driven expression of the secreted ligand sSpi generates ectopic veins in the neighborhood of L2 while expression of the equally potent constitutively active top form of the EGF receptor does not result in a non-autonomous phenotype. The L2 expression system may also be used to compare the functions of related genes such as the nuclear receptors Kni, Knrl, and Eg. Although these three transcription factors share nearly identical DNA binding domains and can all rescue the vein-loss phenotype of ri mutants, they differ in that misexpression of eg in the L2 primordium induces the formation of ectopic bristles along L2. This distinct activity of eg may relate to its normal embryonic function in directing cell fate choices in the CNS. Using the L2 expression system as an assay, it should be straightforward to map the domain in eg that is responsible for its neural inducing capacity by constructing chimeric molecules composed of different domains of Eg and Kni. Finally, the observation that L2-driven expression of Dl leads to a highly penetrant loss of L2 in males and a consistently weaker phenotype in females provides the basis for a modifier screen to identify mutations that either suppress the phenotype in males or enhance the phenotype in females. Some of the modifier loci identified in such a screen, which are not specifically involved in Notch signaling, may encode components of the hypothesized factor XX' pathway..

Screening of our corporate compound collection with an assay measuring the cooperative binding of E1 and E2 to the origin identified a class of small molecule inhibitors of the protein interaction between E1 and E2. Isothermal titration calorimetry and changes in protein fluorescence showed that the inhibitors bind to the transactivation domain of E2, the region that interacts with E1. These compounds inhibit E2 of the low risk HPV types 6 and 11 but not those of high risk HPV types or of cottontail rabbit papillomavirus. Functional evidence that the transactivation domain is the target of inhibition was obtained by swapping this domain between a sensitive (HPV11) and a resistant (cottontail rabbit papillomavirus) E2 type and by identifying an amino acid substitution, E100A, that increases inhibition by 10-fold. This class of inhibitors was found to antagonize specifically the E1-E2 interaction in vivo and to inhibit HPV DNA replication in transiently transfected cells. These results highlight the potential of the E1-E2 interaction as a small molecule antiviral target..

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Papillomaviruses are a family of small double-stranded DNA viruses that induce benign and malignant hyperproliferative lesions of the differentiating epithelium (reviewed in Refs. 1 to 4). Approximately 25 types of human papillomavirus (HPV)1 infect the anogenital region. These HPV types have been classified as low risk or high risk types depending on whether they cause benign warts or lesions that can progress to invasive cancer, respectively. Current therapies to remove HPV-induced lesions include a variety of ablative or cytodestructive procedures and the use of immunomodulatory molecules such as imiquimod (5, 6) to stimulate a host immune response. Small molecule antivirals for the treatment of HPV infections do not currently exist..

Maintenance of the viral genome in infected cells of the basal layer is essential for the viral life cycle and the ensuing pathology. Maintenance of the HPV episome in primary keratinocyte cultures depends on the function of E1 and E2, a 3'-5' helicase (8) and a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein (9), respectively, which are required for replication of the genome (10). HPV DNA replication is initiated by the co-operative binding of E1 and E2 to specific DNA sequences within the viral origin (11 to 14). Formation of this E1-E2-ori ternary complex is dependent on the interaction of both proteins with DNA but also on a critical interaction between the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of E2 and the C-terminal enzymatic domain of E1 (15 to 22). Assembly of this initial E1-E2-ori complex serves as a starting point for the recruitment of additional E1 molecules (23, 24) and their assembly into hexamers and double hexamers that have ATPase and helicase activity (25, 26)..

The plasmid to express CRPV E2 by in vitro transcription/translation was constructed by inserting a PCR fragment corresponding to nucleotides 3107 to 4287 of the CRPV genome in plasmid pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). The plasmid containing the CRPV origin of replication was constructed by inserting a PstI restriction fragment corresponding to nucleotides 192 to 7111 of CRPV into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene). Plasmids pOri-SEAP and pGAL4-SEAP encoding, respectively, the HPV11 origin and five GAL4-binding sites upstream of secreted alkaline phosphatase were constructed by inserting a PCR fragment spanning nucleotides 7884 to 61 of the HPV11 genome or the five GAL4-binding sites from pG5CAT (Clontech) into pSEAP2-Basic (Clontech). The plasmid encoding E1 fused to the transactivation domain of HSV VP16 (pE1-VP16) was constructed by inserting a PCR fragment encoding E1 into pVP16 (Clontech). HPV/CRPV E2 chimeras were constructed by PCR-mediated ligation as described previously (29) and cloned into pCR3.1. Site-directed mutagenesis of E2 was performed with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

To identify inhibitors of this process, a high throughput screening assay was developed that measures the binding of E1 and E2 to 33P-radiolabeled origin DNA. Binding of E1 to the origin probe was detected by immuno-capture of E1-DNA complexes using an anti-E1 antibody coupled to scintillation proximity assay (34) beads (Fig. 1A). Binding reactions were performed in the presence of an excess of unlabeled nonspecific competitor DNA to ensure that binding of E1 to the origin probe was dependent on its association with E2. Fig. 1B shows that a strong signal was detected only when E1 and E2 were added to the reaction. This signal was dependent on the association of E1 with E2 because it was reduced to background levels by the E39A amino acid substitution in E2 that abrogates E1 binding (36 to 38). In contrast the I73A substitution, which affects primarily the transactivation function of E2 and not its ability to bind to E1 (37, 38), had little effect..

Compound 1 was also inactive at inhibiting the helicase activity of E1 (IC50  >  100  microM). Hence this class of compounds does not affect the binding of either E1 or E2 to DNA. These results suggested that the E1-E2 protein interaction might be the target of inhibition. This hypothesis was tested using an ELISA. The E2 protein used in this assay was either purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells or obtained by in vitro translation; both sources yielded similar results. Binding of recombinant E1 to immobilized E2 was detected using an anti-E1 antiserum followed by a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. As seen in Fig. 3A, the signal was dependent on the interaction of E1 with E2 because it was reduced by the E39A substitution in E2. As anticipated, the I73A substitution had little effect. As can be seen in Fig. 3, B and C, all three compounds inhibited binding of E1 to E2 with potency comparable with that measured in the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay. The compounds inhibited the E1-E2 interaction regardless of whether the assay was performed with hexameric E1 purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells or with monomeric E1 made by in vitro translation (data not shown).

First, we investigated whether addition of compound 2 had any effect on the spectroscopic behavior of either E1 or E2. Fluorescent amino acids such as tryptophan are often found in or close to binding pockets, and the binding of ligands to such sites has been shown to perturb protein fluorescence in some cases (39). Compound 2 was titrated into solutions of 400 nM E1 or E2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Although a slight effect was observed on the fluorescence of E1, a much greater level of quenching was observed for E2, consistent with this compound binding to E2. The slight effect observed on E1 and the lack of saturation for E2 at high compound concentrations could be explained by weak nonspecific binding of compound 2 to other protein sites, reminiscent of the low level of activity observed in the SV40 T antigen DNA binding assay (Fig. 2)..

First, we investigated whether addition of compound 2 had any effect on the spectroscopic behavior of either E1 or E2. Fluorescent amino acids such as tryptophan are often found in or close to binding pockets, and the binding of ligands to such sites has been shown to perturb protein fluorescence in some cases (39). Compound 2 was titrated into solutions of 400 nM E1 or E2 (Fig. 4, A and B).

Because for HPV11 it is known that the TAD, but not the DBD, interacts with E1 (16, 40), we repeated the titration with a GST fusion protein encoding the E2 TAD, as well as with GST itself as a negative control (Fig. 4, C and D). The results clearly indicated saturable binding of 2 to the GST-TAD but not to GST, indicating that the compound binds to the TAD.

A dissociation constant of 230 nM was obtained by nonlinear regression, in good agreement with the IC50 obtained in the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay. The observed 2:1 stoichiometry is consistent with the formation of a 1:1 inhibitor-protein complex, because compound 2 is racemic, and it has been observed for other compounds in this series that only one of the two enantiomers is active (see below).3 Collectively, the results presented above provide strong evidence that this class of inhibitor antagonizes the E1-E2 protein interaction by binding to the E2 TAD..

CRPV E2, however, was found to be resistant to inhibition by compound 2 (Fig. 6), perhaps not surprisingly given the low level of amino acid identity between the TAD of HPV11 and that of CRPV. Similarly, we found that the inhibitors are inactive against the E2 protein of the high risk HPV types 16, 18, and 31 (data not shown), which at the amino acid level are only 41 to 50% identical to HPV11 E2. We made use of the observation that some E2 types are resistant to inhibition to substantiate the finding that the TAD is indeed the target of the inhibitors. Specifically, we constructed chimeric E2 proteins encoding the HPV11 TAD with the hinge and DNA-binding domain from CRPV, or the opposite combination. These chimeras were expressed in vitro and tested in the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay using HPV11 E1. Both chimeras could bind co-operatively with E1 on the origin, but only the one containing the TAD from HPV11 was sensitive to inhibition by compound 2 (Fig. 6).

To determine whether inhibition of E1-E2-ori complex formation was reversible, we performed the preincubation experiment shown in Fig. 7. In this experiment, E2, the target protein, was incubated with a high concentration of inhibitor and then diluted into the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay to a final compound concentration 10-fold below the IC50. We reasoned that if the inhibitor is acting by a reversible mechanism, the activity of E2 should be recovered upon dilution of the inhibitor. However, if the mechanism of inhibition is irreversible then significant inhibition should be observed even after dilution. As a control, we used the known reactive electrophile, 4-fluoro-7-nitro-(2,1,3)-benzoxadiazole. Preincubation with this compound resulted in significant inhibition even after dilution to a concentration well below the IC50. In contrast, preincubation of E2 with compound 2 did not lead to any significant inhibition upon dilution (compare 3rd bar to 1st and 2nd bars from the left in Fig. 7).

Specifically, this assay measures the expression of a SEAP reporter gene, placed under the control of the HPV11 minimal origin of replication, upon co-transfection of two plasmids encoding, respectively, E2 and the E1 protein fused to the strong transactivation domain of HSV VP16 (Fig. 9A). In this assay, neither E2 nor E1-VP16 could by itself activate expression of the reporter gene (Fig. 9B). The lack of transactivation by E2 is consistent with the previous observation that E2 of the low risk HPV types are weak transactivators (41). Maximal expression of the reporter gene was dependent on the expression of both E1-VP16 and E2 and on their interaction, because it was greatly reduced by the E39A substitution in E2 which affects E1 binding (Fig. 9B).

Compounds 2 and 3 inhibited SEAP synthesis induced by the HPV11 proteins with IC50 values of 14 and 2  microM, respectively (Fig. 10). The similar potency of compound 3 in the reporter and transient HPV DNA replication assays suggests that its inhibitory activity on viral DNA replication is indeed due to abrogation of the E1-E2 protein interaction. Inhibitors 2 and 3 were also found to be active against the HPV6 proteins, albeit with reduced potency, with IC50 values of 22 and 6  microM, respectively.

The exact reason for the smaller difference in potency against HPV6 and HPV11 proteins in vivo is currently unknown but could be related to slight alterations in the conformation of E2 in vivo compared with in vitro (see under "Discussion"). As a control for specificity, we verified that the inhibitors had little effect on the expression of an unrelated SEAP reporter transactivated by a GAL4-VP16 fusion protein (Fig. 10).

This difference in potency was observed both with purified proteins and with proteins produced by in vitro translation. Because we have found no evidence that HPV6 E1 and E2 interacts more strongly than the HPV11 proteins (data not shown), we surmise that the inhibitors must bind less tightly to HPV6 E2. The HPV6 and HPV11 TAD are 84% identical at the primary amino acid sequence levels, and any of the amino acid differences or combinations thereof could affect binding of the inhibitor. Surprisingly, we found that the difference in potency observed in cellular assays is less pronounced. Indeed, the difference in IC50 values is only 3-fold in the transient HPV DNA replication assay.3 This reduced difference between type 6 and 11 was also observed in the E1-E2 interaction reporter gene assay suggesting that this class of compound does indeed inhibit the E1-E2 interaction of both HPV types with comparable potency in cells. It is possible that a conformational change necessary for inhibitor binding has a more similar energetic cost for both HPV types in vivo than in vitro, perhaps because the conformation of E2 in vivo is slightly different as a result of interaction with cellular proteins.

Several studies have suggested an essential role for Glu-39 in interaction with E1. Specifically, changing this residue to alanine was shown to abrogate the ability of E2 to bind to E1 (36 to 38), as confirmed in this study, while having little effect on its transcriptional activity. These findings suggested that Glu-39 might form part of the E1-binding surface on E2. Two lines of evidence suggest that our inhibitors may bind near Glu-39 to antagonize the E1-E2 interaction. First, the Glu-100 residue, which when changed to alanine increases the sensitivity of HPV11 E2 to our inhibitors, is located on the same surface as Glu-39 in the crystal structure of the HPV16 E2 TAD (46). Second, we found that our inhibitors bind with reduced affinity to the E39A mutant E2 TAD in fluorescence studies similar to those presented in Fig. 4 (data not shown). The simplest interpretation of these results is that the surface of the E2 TAD onto which Glu-39 and Glu-100 are located is involved in binding both E1 and our inhibitors. Because these inhibitors are inactive against HPV16 E2, we did not attempt to model them into the published structure of the HPV16 E2 TAD. However, further studies are in progress to localize the inhibitor-binding pocket on the HPV11 E2 TAD..

With only a few exceptions most protein interaction inhibitors have been identified for cases in which the binding surface for one protein is known to be a small contiguous region, such as for receptor-ligand interactions (47, 48). Many of the small molecules reported to inhibit protein interactions are peptides identified either by screening procedures such as phage display, or from panels of overlapping peptides based on the protein sequence, or selected based on results of structural or mutational studies (49). Most of these peptides are relatively weak inhibitors, and although in principle these can serve as lead compounds for drug discovery, in practice transformation of such molecules into potent non-peptidic inhibitors is quite challenging..

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	81	A variety of reasons has been proposed for the relatively low number of small molecule inhibitors of protein interactions. One is that small molecules would have difficulty competing against the large surface area typically involved in protein-protein interface. However, it has been shown in a number of cases (e.g. 50) that substitution of a single critical residue at an interface, which is conceptually analogous to tight binding of a small molecule, is sufficient to greatly weaken an interaction. An example of this may be the E39A substitution in E2, which as argued above may abrogate E1 binding because it is located at the E1-E2 interface. A second reason why protein interactions are thought to be difficult targets for small molecules is because their interfaces can be fairly flat and devoid of concave pockets analogous to enzyme-active sites or receptor-binding sites (51). Although this is true for some complexes, others have been found to be "bumpy" such that small cavities are often present (52, 53). Perhaps relatively few protein interaction inhibitors have been identified to date only because more effort has been devoted to traditional targets, such as enzymes and receptors. We have in fact succeeded in identifying potent small molecule inhibitors of the E1-E2 interaction by high throughput screening. This strongly suggests that other investigations will also yield novel small molecule inhibitors of protein interactions as drug candidates..

Because they are involved in processes that are essential to PV propagation, the sequences of these proteins are well-conserved. However, sequencing of novel subtypes for human papillomaviruses (HPV) 54 (AE9) and 82 (AE2/IS39), coupled to analysis of four other closely related genital HPV pairs, indicated that E2 has a higher dN/dS ratio than E1, L1 or L2. The elevated ratio is not homogeneous across the length of the ORF, but instead varies with respect to E2's three domains. The E2 hinge region is of particular interest, because its hypervariability (dN/dS > 1) differs markedly from the two domains that it joins: the transcription-activation domain and the DNA-binding domain. Deciphering whether the hinge region's high rate of non-synonymous change is the result of positive Darwinian selection or relaxed constraint depends on the evolutionary behaviour of E4, an ORF that overlaps E2. The E2 hinge region is contained within E4 and non-synonymous changes in the hinge are associated with a disproportionate amount of synonymous change in E4, a case of simultaneous positive and purifying selection in overlapping reading frames. Modular rates of selection among E2 domains are a likely consequence of the presence of an embedded E4. E4 appears to be positioned in a part of the HPV genome that can tolerate non-synonymous change and purifying selection of E4 may be indicative of its functional importance..

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) include a group of closed-circular, double-stranded DNA viruses established as the aetiological agents of cervical neoplasia and invasive cervical cancer (Bosch  and  de Sanjose, 2003; Munoz et al., 2003). Over 100 putative HPVs have been described, more than 90 of which have been cloned and officially designated (de Villiers et al., 2004). Despite an array of types, the development of cervical carcinoma is restricted to a subset of high-risk viruses, of which HPV16 and HPV18 together account for nearly two-thirds of observed cases (Munoz et al., 2003). Classification of HPV types into categories, such as  cancer-causing  and  non-cancer-causing  or cutaneous and mucosal, is based on both epidemiological and phylogenetic studies (Chan et al., 1995; Pfister  and  Fuchs, 1994; Van Ranst et al., 1992, 1993). Most oncogenic types share a common ancestor and most common ancestors radiate within an ecological niche, such as the skin or mucosa..
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	6	The typical HPV genome contains six open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the structural proteins (L1 and L2), proteins that mediate the viral life cycle (E1 and E2) and proteins that regulate host-cell DNA replication and transformation (E6 and E7) (Knipe et al., 2001). E6 and E7 bind the cell-cycle regulators p53 and pRb, respectively. Among highly cancerous types, these oncogenes degrade p53 and pRb, resulting in host-cell immortalization and proliferation (reviewed by Fehrmann  and  Laimins, 2003). Some papillomaviruses (PVs) also encode the E4 and E5 genes, whose roles, although largely unknown, seem to involve functions in the later phases of the viral life cycle (Longworth  and  Laimins, 2004; Peh et al., 2004). The E5 ORF is situated between E2 and L2 in typical PV genomes. In most cases, E5 does not overlap with any of its neighbours; however, the E4 ORF is contained completely within E2..
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	7	A great deal of effort has been spent studying the evolutionary implications of overlapping reading frames in viruses (Hein  and  Stovlbaek, 1995; Krakauer, 2000; Miyata  and  Yasunaga, 1978). A fundamental question is how natural selection operates on two protein sequences encoded by the same stretch of DNA. We address this question in the context of HPV E2 and E4, highlighting rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution in overlapping reading frames. To this end, we utilized two recently cloned and sequenced viral isolates, HPV AE2/IS39 and HPV AE9. Although initially thought to be novel types (10 % variance in L1 nucleotide sequences) based on sequence analysis of the MY09/MY11 region of the L1 ORF, upon analysis of their complete genomes, HPV AE2/IS39 and HPV AE9 were found to be subtypes (2 to 10 % variance in L1 sequences) of HPV82 and HPV54, respectively. In this report, we examine rates of evolution of each ORF by using dN/dS ratios across these subtype pairs and other closely related mucosal types. Closely related genomes allow examination of evolutionary change prior to saturation of genetic changes. We focus specifically on the modular rates of selection exhibited by E2 and a possible explanation for this modularity, in the overlapping ORF, E4..

PCR products were separated by agarose-gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV illumination. After confirmation of appropriate product sizes, each PCR product was purified (Qiagen gel-extraction kit) and ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Initially, SP6 and T7 primers flanking each HPV DNA insert were used to determine the nucleotide sequence. Additional primers were designed by sequence walking.

Each pair contains the anticipated PV ORFs, including the E6 and E7 proteins, the replication proteins (E1 and E2) and components of the viral capsid (L1 and L2). The only major difference in genomic architecture across the two pairs is HPV54's lack of an E5 homologue. HPV82 contains an unambiguous E5 ORF, but lacks a proximal start codon, whereas the corresponding genomic region in HPV54 is as variable as some sections of its upstream regulatory region. Lack of evidence for E5 in HPV54 reinforces its status as a unique outlier, rooting members of the -PV species clades 1, 8 and 10 (Fig. 1), all of which contain an intact E5 ORF. The identification of an HPV54 subtype implies that this ancient part of the tree still appears to be evolving.

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	25	  The distribution of polymorphisms across each ORF within HPV54 and HPV82 is shown in Table 1, accompanied by four closely related genital HPV pairs. The subtypes HPV44 and HPV55 and the sister taxa HPV6 and HPV11, HPV7 and HPV40, and HPV2 and HPV27 were chosen because they all exhibit whole-genome divergence of  < 15 %. These closely related pairs allow unambiguous alignment and are less likely to be subject to saturation of genetic variation. To examine the possibility of directional selection, we calculated the ratio of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS). A dN/dS ratio equal to 1 indicates neutrality, a ratio  < 1 indicates purifying selection and a ratio  > 1 indicates positive Darwinian selection (Yang, 1998). Overall, the small ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous changes and dN/dS values indicate that E1, L1 and L2 are under strong purifying selection, forming a functional core essential to the viral life cycle. Previously, we had also included E2 in this group because of its presence in all known PVs and its role in viral-genome replication (Narechania et al., 2004). However, in the current analysis, a remarkably consistent pattern of elevated non-synonymous E2 variation was observed, a pattern more in line with the values seen for the E6/E7 ORFs than the stable core E1, L1 and L2 ORFs. The median E2 dN/dS value (0 31) was significantly different from that of the E1/L1/L2 group (0 09) (Mann to Whitney P < 0 0004) (Siegel, 1956)..

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	28	  Much of E2's variation is attributable to the hinge region connecting the transcription activation domain (TAD) to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) (Table 2; Fig. 2) (Eriksson et al., 1999; Gauthier et al., 1991; Ham et al., 1991). In all cases except for the HPV54 pair, the hinge region did not manifest the purifying selection that constrains the rest of the E2 ORF (dN/dS median, 1 11). HPV16 variant genomes also showed elevated dN/dS ratios in the E2 hinge region (Z. Chen  and  R. D. Burk, unpublished data). The TAD and DBD regions display intermediate median dN/dS values (0 18), lower than that for the hinge, but significantly higher than that observed for E1, L1 or L2 (Mann to Whitney P < 0 002). This pattern holds in all cases except for the HPV54 pair. Aside from a low hinge dN/dS and a high TAD dN/dS, the HPV54 pair also exhibits relatively high E1 and L1 dN/dS ratios, again highlighting its status as a unique outlier of species clades 1, 8 and 10. Although relatively elevated E2 dN/dS values are a trend that is consistent across all analysed pairs, there are many functional protein motifs that are conserved across all types. For example, the -1 recognition helix in the E2 DBD is well-conserved across all types used in the current study, as are the cognate DBD sites (ACCgNNNNcGGT) in the long control region (reviewed by Hegde, 2002)..

Positions of the three functional domains of E2 (TAD, the hinge and DBD) are delimited along the horizontal axis in white, black and grey, respectively. These positions were derived by alignment to HPV18 E2 (Hegde, 2002). Vertical lines above the horizontal axis indicate non-synonymous changes (i.e. amino acid changes), whereas those below the axis correspond to synonymous changes. The height of the vertical lines both above and below the horizontal axis represents the number of non-synonymous and synonymous changes per codon, respectively..
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	31	  The most compelling observations in the current analysis were the high overall dN/dS ratio of E2 and the concentration of non-synonymous changes in the hinge region of this ORF. E2 is unique in the PV genome in that it is the only ORF that completely contains another (in this case, E4). Moreover, E4 frames the hinge region completely in all pairs analysed (for two examples, see Fig. 3). In each sliding-window analysis, except for HPV54 where little time has apparently passed since subtype divergence, non-synonymous changes dominate the E2 reading frame, whereas E4 favours synonymous changes. This observation is at odds with the prevailing notion concerning overlapping genes  to  that severe evolutionary constraint should operate on nucleotide sequences encoding two layers of protein in the dense genetic environment of viruses (Mizokami et al., 1997; Pavesi, 2000; Pavesi et al., 1997; Walewski et al., 2001). For overlapping genes, codon changes at the third position in one reading frame are unusual, because they result in changes in the second position of the +1 reading frame. However, what we see here is a pattern of E4 purifying selection superimposed on the E2 hinge, the one domain that can physically accommodate high levels of non-synonymous change. The relaxed constraint observed for the hinge is therefore attributable to both its role as a flexible connector between the functionally conserved TAD and DBD domains and the existence of the overlapping E4 reading frame. In PVs with no evidence of an E4 ORF, we might expect this phenomenon to disappear. However, to our knowledge, all PVs contain an E4-like ORF except for the two avian PVs that have been characterized to date: Psittacus erithacus papillomavirus (PePV) and Fringilla coelebs papillomavirus (FPV) (Terai et al., 2002). An alignment of PePV and FPV E2 ORFs yielded only 52 % identity. At this level of divergence, saturation becomes a problem and a satisfactory dN/dS analysis could not be performed..

We suggest that the modularity displayed in the E2 dN/dS profile is a probable consequence of the presence of the E4 overlapping reading frame, and that the E2 hinge is the ideal genomic position in which to fix an overlapping gene. As E4 is subject to purifying selection relative to the E2 hinge in all tested cases and there is evidence of an E4 ORF in all mammalian PVs, this ORF may have greater functional importance than thought previously..

The mAb H6.J54 is cross-reactive with the closely related HPV types 6 and 11. By making HPV-6-like amino acid substitutions in the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) major capsid protein L1, we were able to transfer H6.J54 binding activity into a CRPV/HPV-6 hybrid L1 protein. Full binding activity was achieved with only nine amino acid changes and identified a region centred on the HPV-6 residues 49 to 54. This region has previously been shown to be a critical part of HPV-6 type-specific epitopes. Fine mapping of the region by scanning a series of alanine substitution mutations showed that in HPV-6 VLPs this type-common epitope overlaps HPV-6 type-specific epitopes..
0.25392318.12771418.html.plaintext.txt	5	   MAIN TEXT Top ABSTRACT MAIN TEXT REFERENCES   Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are among the most common sexually transmitted diseases (Bauer et al., 1991; Ho et al., 1998; Moscicki et al., 2001) and are implicated in both benign and malignant disease of the genital epithelia (Bosch et al., 1995; Galloway, 1994; Gissmann et al., 1983; Munoz, 2000; Pisani et al., 1993). To meet medical needs imposed by HPV infection, several experimental vaccines have been developed and are currently in human clinical trials (Brown et al., 2001; Evans et al., 2001; Harro et al., 2001), and one has been shown to be effective in preventing persistent viral infection (Koutsky et al., 2002). These vaccines are based on virus-like particles (VLPs), which assemble spontaneously when the papillomavirus major capsid protein, L1, is recombinantly expressed either alone or together with L2, the minor capsid protein (Hofmann et al., 1995; Kirnbauer et al., 1992, 1993; Neeper et al., 1996; Rose et al., 1993; Volpers et al., 1994; Zhou et al., 1991). VLPs are morphologically and immunologically similar to native virions (Christensen et al., 1994; Kirnbauer et al., 1992; Neeper et al., 1996; Rose et al., 1993), can induce neutralizing antibody responses (Bryan et al., 1997; Christensen et al., 1994, 1996b; Lowe et al., 1997; Ludmerer et al., 2000; Pastrana et al., 2001; Roden et al., 1997; Rose et al., 1994; Yeager et al., 2000) and in animal models, can protect against viral disease (Breitburd et al., 1995; Christensen et al., 1996c; Jansen et al., 1995; Kirnbauer et al., 1996; Suzich et al., 1995)..

Alignment of HPV L1 proteins reveals that within these well-conserved proteins there are localized regions of amino acid sequence divergence. These regions contain determinants of type-specificity (Ludmerer  and  McClements, 1999). We and others have shown that the epitopes recognized by HPV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are generally type-specific and conformation-dependent, map to these regions (Christensen et al., 2001; Ludmerer et al., 1996, 1997, 2000; McClements et al., 2001; Roden et al., 1997). Furthermore, structural studies of HPV capsomers and VLPs have shown that these divergent sequence regions are surface-exposed (Chen et al., 2000), and other studies have shown that substitution of these regions with non-L1 sequences results in the presentation of foreign epitopes on VLPs (Chackerian et al., 1999; Slupetzky et al., 2001)..

These studies mapped the HPV-11 immunodominant neutralizing epitope to a sequence of approximately 20 amino acids centred on residue Y132 and found that a second subdominant neutralizing epitope comprised residues 270 to 290 and 340 to 345. For HPV-6, neutralizing epitopes are bipartite and comprise two regions of sequence divergence, both of which are distinct from the regions identified in HPV-11. The principal region is centred on residues 49 to 54 (region I, Fig. 1a) and contains determinants for H6.B10.5, H6.N8 and H6.M48, the three HPV-6-specific conformation-dependent mAbs (Christensen et al., 1996b) that are neutralizing in an HPV-6 pseudovirion assay (Yeager et al., 2000). The second region is centred on residues 169 to 178 (region II, Fig. 1a) and modulates binding to region I. Monoclonals H6.M48 and H6.B10.5 require region II as well as region I to achieve full binding to VLPs (McClements et al., 2001). The physical association of regions I and II is consistent with the crystal structure of HPV-16 VLPs (Chen et al., 2000) where HPV-16 L1 sequences analogous to regions I and II map to loop B to C and segment G1, respectively, and are predicted to be in close proximity in capsomers and VLPs. Type-specific bipartite epitopes have also been described for HPV types 11 and 16 (Christensen et al., 2001; Ludmerer et al., 2000). Preliminary studies on H6.J54 (Christensen et al., 1996b), a conformation-dependent mAb that is cross-reactive with HPV types 6 and 11, suggested that it also recognizes a bipartite epitope, with one part mapping in the N-terminal region of L1 (N. D. Christensen, unpublished observations). This raised the possibility that, in HPV-6, type-common and type-specific epitopes may overlap and could interfere with precise serological characterization..

0.25392318.12771418.html.plaintext.txt	11	  To extend our mapping studies to address the question of epitope interference and to generate novel reagents for monitoring immune responses to HPV infection or immunization with experimental HPV vaccines, we attempted to transfer the HPV-6-specific epitopes to a less closely related papillomavirus VLP, i.e. one that should have fewer epitopes in common with HPV-6 (Fig. 1a). We chose cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) for the L1 scaffold. The CRPV and HPV-6 L1 molecules are nearly identical in length and CRPV VLPs are structurally similar to HPV VLPs, but the CRPV L1 amino acid sequence (SWISS-PROT accession no. P03102) is only about 50 % identical with that of HPV-6. Using PCR mutagenesis, we transferred the HPV-6-specific residues of regions I and II into the CRPV L1. The CRPV/HPV-6 hybrid L1, CR/H6:I, had nine HPV-6-like substitutions in region I making that sequence identical to HPV-6 over a 20-residue sequence (CRPV L1 aa 45 to 64). In addition to the region I changes, CR/H6:I-II was generated, which also had nine HPV-6-like substitutions in region II making that sequence identical to HPV-6 for the 22 residues (aa 166 to 187). The alignment of HPV-6 and CRPV L1 sequences in Fig. 1(a) highlights these changes and also shows the extended similarity between the two sequences. All constructions were confirmed by complete sequencing of the L1 genes. These hybrid proteins, as well as those from wild-type CPRV, HPV-6 and HPV-11, were expressed using the baculovirus vector pVL1393 (Stratagene). Extracts were prepared from transfected Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9; Invitrogen) and assayed by ELISA for binding activity to conformation-dependent mAbs as described previously (Benincasa et al., 1996; Ludmerer et al., 1996; McClements et al., 2001)..
0.25392318.12771418.html.plaintext.txt	12	Fig. 2 shows the results of the binding activity assay. With wild-type L1 proteins, type specificity of mAbs H6.B10.5, H6.N8 and H6.M48 was clearly evident. Also evident was the failure to transfer quantitatively HPV-6-specific binding activity to the CRPV backbone. Lack of binding was not due to the failure of the hybrid L1 proteins to form high-order structures including capsomers and VLPs; CRPV-5A, a conformation-dependent CRPV-specific mAb (Christensen  and  Kreider, 1991) bound both hybrid proteins well. Of the three type 6-specific mAbs, only H6.N8 showed any binding to a hybrid L1, and while the signal was well above background, binding was clearly impaired. The surprising result was that H6.J54, a neutralizing conformation-dependent HPV-6 and -11 cross-reactive mAb (Christensen et al., 1996b), bound CR/H6:I as well as it bound wild-type HPV-6 or -11 VLPs. This indicated that at least part of the J54 epitope was located in region I. However, when the second HPV-6-like substitution at region II was made, the resultant hybrid L1 protein was not recognized by H6.J54 or H6.N8. This result was in contrast to earlier data from HPV-6/11 hybrid VLPs where we found that sequences in region II could stabilize binding of the HPV-6 type-specific mAb interactions at region I (McClements et al., 2001). However, it was consistent with H6.J54 binding studies on HPV-11/16 chimeric VLPs, which suggested that part of the J54 epitope maps to HPV-11 residues 45 to 60 (N. D. Christensen, unpublished observations). H6.J54 binding is most likely independent of region II, and because regions that are well separated in the linear L1 sequence can affect the secondary and tertiary structure of assembled VLPs, introduction of HPV-6-like amino acids at this site may distort one or more components of the J54 epitope..

To map the region I portion of J54 more precisely, we next made a series of alanine substitution mutants that scanned a 22-residue stretch centred on the critical binding region I (Fig. 1b). Because H6.J54 is cross-reactive with HPV-11, we selected charged or hydrophilic residues that were common to both HPV types and likely to contribute to antibody binding. The mutant L1 proteins  to  R40A, S50A, K52A, N55A, T57A, P60A and K61A  to  were expressed and assayed for binding to H6.J54, the type-specific mAbs H6.B10.5 and H6.N8, and to H6.C6, which recognizes a distal linear epitope common to both type 6 and 11 (Ludmerer et al., 1996). Binding results are shown in Fig. 3. The signals with the conformation-dependent mAbs indicated that all mutants formed ordered structures and that region I was intact, although reduced binding of mAb H6.B10.5 to the R40A, K52A and K61A mutants was observed. While the relative binding of the four antibodies varied across the mutant set, the results from one mutation  to  N55A  to  stood out. Binding to H6.J54 was completely lost but with little impairment of H6.B10.5 or H6.N8 binding. To assess the assembly state of this critical mutant, partially purified material from the N55A extract was characterized by transmission electron microscopy and was found to be indistinguishable from preparations of either wild-type or the T57A mutant; each showed the presence of 55 nm particles with the characteristic appearance of VLPs (data not shown). We consider it likely that the N55A mutation has a direct effect and that residue 55 asparagine is critical for H6.J54 binding. We infer this because both H6.B10.5 and H6.N8 recognized this mutant VLP well, indicating that region I was not grossly distorted. The reduced binding of H6.B10.5 seen with the R40A, K52A and K61A mutants suggests that these residues contribute to the region I type-specific epitope. Taken together with the J54 epitope transfer to CRPV described above, these data confirm the overlap of the type-specific and type-common conformation-dependent epitopes..

0.25392318.12771418.html.plaintext.txt	17	  These observations extend an earlier study describing the theoretical overlap of a linear epitope with a conformation-dependent one (Ludmerer et al., 1997). The linear epitope, mapped to residues 108 to 127 of HPV-16 (Christensen et al., 1996a; Heino et al., 1995), was transferred into HPV-11 VLPs by making HPV-16-like substitutions (V123L, V126T) at the two residues in that region where the HPV-16 and -11 L1 proteins differed. In this hybrid VLP context, the linear HPV-16 epitope overlapped the HPV-11 major neutralizing epitope, which mapped to an approximately 20 amino acid sequence centred on residue 132. Residue 123 was critical for each epitope but because it differed between the two types (L in HPV-16, Y in HPV-11) simultaneous presentation of both epitopes could not occur. The present results are of greater significance because the epitopes exist simultaneously on the VLP and both are conformation-dependent, yet have distinguishable binding properties. H6.J54 binding can be eliminated from HPV-6 without affecting the binding of the type-specific mAbs and it can be transferred into CRPV VLPs without reconstituting the epitopes for the other antibodies. This suggests that alteration of epitope structure can be significant in impact, yet highly localized in effect. This has important implications for HPV serology. If cross-reactive responses between two closely related HPV types, for example types 16 and 31 or 18 and 45, hinder precise serological evaluation, hybrid VLPs can be made in which the cross-reactive responses are reduced or eliminated, thus creating serological typing reagents with improved sensitivity and selectivity..

Papillomaviruses are difficult to propagate in vitro, and thus the production of these pseudovirions offers a model to study human papillomavirus (HPV) cell entry. The pseudovirions obtained have the ability to transfer the plasmid DNA into cells where the reporter gene is then expressed. Entry of these artificial gene delivery vehicles into cells is dependent on the interaction between VLPs and the cell surface. Two putative cell receptors have been identified for HPVs. The first is -6 integrin (Evander et al., 1997; McMillan et al., 1999) and the second comprises the cell-surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (Joyce et al., 1999; Giroglou et al., 2001; Combita et al., 2001), which interact with the C-terminal portion of HPV L1 (Joyce et al., 1999)..

The prototype NLS is the SV40 large T antigen NLS (KKKRK). HPV-16 L1 contains two NLS. One has six basic amino acids (aa 499 to 504). The other is a bipartite NLS (aa 484 to 486, 499 to 500) (Zhou et al., 1991). The L2 protein contains two NLS corresponding to the arginine- and lysine-rich sequences located at the N and C termini of the protein (Sun et al., 1995). Two DNA-binding sequences have been identified in the L1 and L2 proteins of HPV-16. The first DNA-binding sequence was identified at the N-terminal end of L2 (Zhou et al., 1994). The second was identified at the C terminus of the L1 protein of HPV-11 and HPV-16 (Li et al., 1997; El Mehdaoui et al., 2000; Touze et al., 2000). In addition, the nine C-terminal amino acids of the L2 protein have been shown to be necessary for infection of bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) pseudovirions (Roden et al., 2001). The DNA-binding activity of these two domains is sequence-independent. However, it has recently been shown that DNA binding to BPV-1, HPV-6 and HPV-16 VLPs is enhanced by the presence of a 120 bp DNA sequence located in the BPV-1 E1 gene (Zhao et al., 1999; El Mehdaoui et al., 2000)..

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	10	We have previously demonstrated that HPV L1 VLPs obtained by self-assembly of L1 protein lacking the last nine C-terminal amino acids had lost their capacity to bind DNA and transfer genes into target cells (Touze et al., 2000). Moreover, addition of this sequence at the N terminus of the major capsid protein of an RNA virus, the rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), allowed the production of chimeric VLPs that could encapsidate DNA and transfer reporter genes into cells (El Mehdaoui et al., 2000). These experiments suggest a central role for this short sequence in DNA binding, interacting with the cell surface of target cells and facilitating the nuclear import of complexes owing to the presence of an NLS. In order to verify the role of this positively charged sequence, we investigated the possibility of using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 14 C-terminal amino acids of the HPV-16 L1 protein in DNA transfection experiments. The study was then extended to positively charged sequences of the HPV-16 L2 protein and the L1 protein of four other HPVs..

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	29	   Results and discussion Top ABSTRACT Introduction Methods Results and discussion REFERENCES   DNA binding and gene transfer with HPV-16 C-terminal synthetic peptide HPV-16 L1 Ctb synthetic peptide (SSTSTTAKRKKRKL, nt 492 to 505) was mixed with pCMV- DNA (7 2 kbp) and the DNA/peptide interaction was measured by determining the amount of peptide required to retard the migration of the plasmid DNA during agarose gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1(A), the electrophoretic mobility of DNA was reduced for charge ratios (-/+) of 1/3 to 1/5 and was completely abolished for a charge ratio of 1/10. Retardation was not observed when using the positively charged SV40 large T NLS peptide (PPKKKRKVA) at the same charge ratios. We further hypothesized that the formation of such complexes might prevent DNA degradation by nuclease. L1 peptide/pCMV- DNA complexes were therefore treated for 1 h at 37  degrees C with Benzonase. Two antigenic peptides, HPV-16 E4 Ag (KPSPWAPKKHRRLS) and HPV-16 L1 Ag (cVGENVPDDLYIKGSG), with a charge ratio of 1/10 corresponding to a mass ratio of DNA/peptide of 1/100, and SV40 large T NLS peptide were used as control peptides with varying proportions of positively charged amino acids. Seventy-two per cent DNA protection was observed with HPV-16 L1 Ctb peptide (Fig. 2) compared with 55 % with HPV-16 VLPs. No protection was observed with HPV-16 E4 Ag peptide (Fig. 2, lane 6) and only 23 % with the SV40 large T NLS peptide (not shown). The ability of the HPV-16 L1 Ctb peptide to deliver DNA into cells was then investigated with a -galactosidase reporter plasmid in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1B). Transfections were performed with 1  microg DNA per well. The highest level of -galactosidase expression was observed for a DNA/peptide charge ratio of 1/10. This peptide is one of the few examples of a natural peptide capable of interacting with plasmid DNA and carrying it across cellular barriers, as observed with the HIV-1 VpR C-terminal sequence (Kichler et al., 2000). Moreover, pre-incubation of COS-7 cells with HPV-16 L1 Ctb peptide induced 60 % inhibition of the gene transfer obtained with HPV-31 pseudovirions, compared with an absence of inhibition (0 %) observed after pre-incubation with the SV40 large T NLS peptide. This result suggests that the peptide binds to the HPV-31 cell-surface receptor. An alternative explanation could be that the excess of peptide binds to the DNA associated with the VLPs, resulting in a decrease in gene transfer due to the lower capacity of the peptide to transfer the gene compared with that obtained with the VLPs. In order to rule out this hypothesis, COS-7 cells were pre-incubated with HPV-16 L1 Ctb peptide followed by the addition of plasmid DNA to the cell culture medium. The absence of gene transfer (not shown) thus supports the hypothesis that the peptide binds to the cell receptor of HPV-31..

The cut-off value for gene transfer positivity was set up at 25 c.p.s. (mean value observed with DNA alone plus or minus 3 SD). No gene transfer was observed with the two control peptides (HPV-16 L1 Ag, HPV-16 E4 Ag), nor with the positively charged peptide corresponding to the SV40 large T NLS. Using an HPV-16 L1 Ctb scramble peptide (HPV-16 L1 CtbSc), a gene transfer of 118 c.p.s. was observed, compared with 413 c.p.s. with the reference peptide. The reduction in gene transfer with the scramble peptide suggested that gene transfer is a sequence-specific-dependent phenomenon. The residual capacity of this scramble peptide to transfer the gene could be attributed to a generic charge effect. This is in agreement with the fact that similarly charged peptides such as HPV-31 Ctb and HPV-58 Ctb peptides have no or low capacity to transfer genes..

The results showed that the N- and C-terminal L2 peptides bound to and protected DNA from Benzonase degradation (65 % and 88 %, respectively) (Fig. 2). COS-7 transfection was observed with both peptides with luciferase activity of 860 and 1115 c.p.s., respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 3). These findings indicate the presence of two DNA binding sequences on HPV-16 L2 protein, contrary to the findings of Zhou et al. (1994). Roden et al. (2001) recently observed that the nine C-terminal amino acids of L2 are necessary for BPV infection. Our findings suggest that this could be due to the presence of a strong DNA-binding sequence at the C terminus of the protein. This raises the question of which DNA-binding sequence detected within the L1 and L2 proteins interacts with the PES identified on the BPV-1 genome between nucleotides 1506 and 1625 (Zhao et al., 1999). This PES was also recognized by HPV-6b VLPs despite the phylogenic distance between these two papillomavirus types. Zhao et al. (1999) have therefore suggested that other papillomaviruses may use the same packaging sequence that we confirmed using HPV-16 VLPs (El Mehdaoui et al., 2000). It has been shown that the presence of L2 in HPV VLPs dramatically increase their gene transfer efficiency (Roden et al., 1996; Unckell et al., 1997; Kawana et al., 1998) and that packaging with BPV-1 L1+L2 VLPs is increased in the presence of a papillomavirus DNA sequence (Zhao et al., 1999), suggesting that specific DNA binding to L2 is necessary to obtain efficient packaging. We therefore investigated gene transfer into COS-7 cells, using L1 and L2 synthetic peptides complexed with a pCMV- plasmid and a pPES-CMV- plasmid (El Mehdaoui et al., 2000).No transfection was observed with HPV-16 L1 Cta and HPV-31 L1 Ctb peptides, whichever plasmid was used. However, when using the two HPV-16 L2 peptides or the HPV-16 L1 Ctb, HPV-31 L1 Cta and HPV-45 L1 Cta peptides, a two- to threefold significant increase in the level of gene transfer was observed (Table 2) when the plasmid contained the BPV PES, in comparison with the levels obtained with the pCMV- plasmid (P=10-5, 10-2,  < 10-5, 7x10-5and 2x10-4, respectively). No increase in gene transfer was observed when using Lipofectamine and pCMV-PES- (438 plus or minus 3 cells per well) compared with the use of pCMV- (470 plus or minus 2 cells per well). This suggested that the increase observed in gene transfer with L1 or L2 peptides is not due to differences in gene transfer efficiency of the two plasmids used, nor to a post-entry effect of PES on luciferase expression..

Gene transfer was inhibited by 67 to 90 % when heparin was added to the DNA/peptide complexes, depending on the peptide used (Fig. 4). Inhibition of gene transfer was not observed after pre-incubation of the complexes with BSA in place of heparin. The role of proteoglycans in binding of HPV to cells was also assessed by inhibition of their sulfation with sodium chlorate. For this purpose, COS-7 cells were grown in the presence of sodium chlorate for 12 h and then transfected with HPV-16 L1 Ctb, HPV-33 L1 Ctb, HPV-45 L1 Ctb and L2 N- and C-terminal peptides. Luciferase gene expression was inhibited by pretreatment with sodium chlorate in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). Gene transfer was dramatically decreased compared with untreated cells, with a decrease of 69 % for HPV-16 L1 Ctb peptide and 70 % for HPV-45 L1 Ctb (Fig. 4).

The results of heparin binding obtained with L2 positively charged peptides raise the possibility that these sequences could also be involved in VLP and virion binding to the cell GAGs. L1+L2 VLPs lacking either the N or C terminus of the L2 protein have been shown by immunoflurescence studies to bind to cells in the same way as wild-type VLPs (Roden et al., 2001), suggesting that these sequences do not play a central role in binding to cells. However, in the absence of data obtained with pseudovirions composed of L1 C-terminal mutants and L2 proteins (both wild-type and N-terminal mutants), it is difficult to conclude whether N-terminal positively charged sequences of the L2 protein are present on the virion surface and play a role in its binding to the cell or not..

We also confirmed the binding properties of N- and C-terminal amino acids of the HPV-16 L2 protein. In addition, we determined that a second positively charged sequence located upstream from the previous L1 sequence is able to bind DNA for some HPV types (HPV-33 and -45), but not, or not significantly, for other types (HPV-16, -31 and -58). The interaction between these DNA-binding peptides and DNA induced protection from DNase degradation and was sufficient to obtain gene transfer in COS-7 cells. However, the level of gene transfer with a peptide was around 150 times less efficient than that observed with the corresponding sequence within the VLPs. It was also shown that gene transfer is mediated by binding of DNA/peptide complexes to heparan sulfate receptors, as for VLPs, confirming that positively charged DNA complexes can enter cells after binding to membrane-associated sulfated proteoglycans (Mislick  and  Baldeschweiler, 1996; Mounkes et al., 1999; Kichler et al., 2000).

Using biochemical assays, immunofluorescence, and immunoelectron microscopy in the presence and absence of microtubule depolymerizing agents, it was shown that the cytosolic capsid transport in Vero cells was mediated by microtubules. Antibody labeling revealed the attachment of dynein, a minus end-directed, microtubule-dependent motor, to the viral capsids.

Transport over long distances is particularly critical for viruses that infect neurons in which the site of entry can be located far from the cell body and the nucleus..
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	6	Since movement of virus-sized particles through the cytosol is not likely to occur by free diffusion due to high viscosity and steric obstacles (Bray, 1992; Luby-Phelps, 1994), viruses most likely exploit the cell's motile functions for transport. The limited information available suggests that viruses can make use of both microtubules (MT)1 and actin filaments. EM analysis has shown MT binding of certain viral capsids, such as adenovirus and reovirus in vivo and in vitro (for review see Luftig, 1982) as well as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) in neurons (Lycke et al., 1984, 1988; Penfold et al., 1994). Way and co-workers have described actin filament-dependent intra- and intercellular transport of vaccinia virus during egress from cells (Cudmore et al., 1995). Moreover, many viruses take advantage of the retrograde movement of endocytic organelles during entry. They are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis and carried within coated vesicles and endosomes from the cell periphery toward the perinuclear area of the cell (see Greber et al., 1994; Marsh and Helenius, 1989)..

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	8	In this study we have focused on the intracytosolic transport of incoming HSV-1 capsids in Vero cells. HSV-1 has three structural components: capsid, tegument, and envelope. The capsid consists of the viral DNA of 152 kbp and a proteinaceous shell comprising six different proteins; it has a diameter of 125 nm, and the proteins are arranged in an icosahedron formed by 12 pentons and 150 hexons (Booy et al., 1991; Cohen et al., 1980; Heine et al., 1974; Spear and Roizman, 1972). VP5 constitutes the major protein component of both hexons and pentons (Newcomb et al., 1992; Trus et al., 1992). The tegument is a protein layer between the envelope and the capsid and contains ~12 different viral polypeptides (Roizman and Furlong, 1974; Roizman and Sears, 1996). While the functions of most of these remain to be identified, one is a protein kinase (LeMaster and Roizman, 1980), one induces shut off of host cell protein synthesis (Read and Frenkel, 1983), and some are known to be activators and modulators of viral gene expression (Batterson and Roizman, 1983; Campbell et al., 1984; McLean et al., 1990). The viral envelope contains at least 12 different membrane proteins, some of which are involved in receptor binding and fusion..

After release into the cytosol and dissociation from some of the tegument components, the capsids move through the cytosol to the nucleus and bind to nuclear pores (Batterson et al., 1983; Lycke et al., 1988), whereafter the genome is released into the nucleus. Transcription, replication of viral DNA, and assembly of progeny capsids take place within the host nucleus (for review see Roizman and Sears, 1996; Steven and Spear, 1996).

After 2 h, 25 ml per flask of normal medium was added to the cells, and after 3 d, the medium containing secreted extracellular virus was collected. All the following steps were performed at 4 degrees C. Cells and debris were removed by spinning at 2,000 rpm for 10 min, and the virus was collected by centrifugation from the medium using a JA-14 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc.. Palo Alto, CA) at 12,000 rpm for 90 min. The resulting pellets were resuspended by gentle shaking overnight in MNT buffer (30 mM MES, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4). After waterbath sonification (4 degrees C; three times for 30 s each), the suspension derived from 30 flasks was layered on top of one linear 10-40% (wt/vol) sucrose gradient in MNT buffer and centrifuged in a Beckman SW28 at 15,000 rpm for 45 min.

To analyze the efficiency of capsid transport to the nucleus (see Fig. 5), 25 EM negatives of infected, flat-embedded cells were taken at a magnification of 5,800 in a systematic random fashion for each time point (Griffiths, 1993b). The negatives were analyzed under a dissecting microscope, and the number and localization of cytosolic capsids was determined. Capsids within 100 nm of the plasma membrane were scored as being at the plasma membrane, and within 50 nm as being on MT and at the nuclear pore complex. The remaining capsids were scored as being apparently free in the cytosol. Virions present in endosomes were also counted. To quantify the effect of nocodazole (see Fig. 7), 50 negatives of conventionally embedded cells infected in the presence or absence of nocodazole (10  microM) were taken in a systematic random fashion. Cytosolic capsids were scored as being at the plasma membrane, in the cytosol, or at the nuclear pore complex. To quantify the dynein labeling, 25 micrographs of cryosections were taken at a magnification of 16,900. Since incoming herpes capsids were rare structures, the specimen was systematically translated in a defined direction, and a micrograph was taken every time a cytosolic capsid came into view. These were printed ( x  2.7) and the area of each structure was outlined (virions, capsids, mitochondria, nuclei, and cytoplasm). A lattice grid was placed over the prints, and the number of points and gold particles falling into each structure was counted. The formula G/P*d2 gives the labeling density (gold particles per  microm2), where G is the number of gold particles, P is the number of points of the lattice grid over the structure, and d is the distance between points (Griffiths, 1993b). Fig. 5. Time course of HSV-1 entry. Vero cells infected at an MOI of 500 in the presence of CH were fixed at various times postinfection with 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS and embedded in Epon for EM analysis. (a) Schematic cross-section perpendicular to the substrate through an adherent Vero cell. For quantitation, 25 random electron micrographs obtained from sections cut parallel to the substrate through the basal part of the cells were taken in a systematic fashion for each time point. "Basal" is defined as being within 2  microm distance from the substrate (30 sections of ~50-70 nm). (b) The total numbers of cytosolic capsids (full and empty), cytosolic empty capsids, and virions in endosomes were determined for each time point. The number of cytosolic capsids increased rapidly until 1 h postinfection. At later time points, less cytosolic capsids were detected, suggesting that they were ultimately disassembled. In addition, the subcellular localization of each capsid was determined and the numbers were expressed as a percentage of the total (c-g). (c) At the earliest time point of 15 min, the majority of cytosolic capsids was localized close to the plasma membrane, from where they disappeared rapidly later. (d) Several capsids could not be localized to a particular organelle. At 1 h postinfection, there was the highest amount of those capsids, which were apparently free in the cytosol. (e) A significant portion of all cytosolic capsids, namely 10% at 1 h postinfection, colocalized transiently with microtubules. (f) Capsids began to appear at the nuclear pores at 2 h postinfection, and at 4 h, 60% of all cytosolic capsid had reached the nucleus. (g) The appearance of empty cytosolic capsids coincided with the arrival at the nucleus. Only at 4 h postinfection, there was a very small portion of empty, cytosolic capsids.

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	29	We assayed for virus binding and internalization as described previously (Helenius et al., 1980). To quantify binding, 6-well dishes containing Vero cells grown for 2 d to just confluency were set on a metal plate on an ice box and washed three times with ice cold RPMI-BSA, and [3H]thymidinelabeled virus was added (1 ml per dish). After incubation on ice for various amounts of time and intensive washings, the cells were scraped into 1 ml RPMI-BSA and pelleted, and cell-associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. The data are expressed as mean values from duplicates. To assay for virus internalization, [3H]thymidine-labeled virus was bound to cells at 4 degrees C for 2 h. The cells were washed to remove unbound virus, and then shifted to normal medium at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2 for various lengths of time. The cells were transferred back to ice, washed, and stored at 4 degrees C until the last time point. All the following treatments were performed at 4 degrees C. The cells were washed with cold, protein-free PBS and incubated with 1 ml per well proteinase K (2 mg/ml in PBS; Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). After 1 h, 1 ml of PBS containing 1.25 mM PMSF and 3% (wt/vol) BSA was added to stop further proteolysis. The cells were collected, the wells were rinsed with wash buffer (PBS containing 0.2% BSA), and the cells along with the wash buffer were spun at 1,500 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended and pelleted again; scintillation liquid was added to the resuspended pellet (0.5 ml) and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The amount of internalized virus was expressed as cell-associated [3H]thymidine counts (mean value from triplicates). Control cells, which were not warmed up after virus binding, showed that the proteinase K treatment removed 90-95% of cell-bound virus..

In one protocol, cells were fixed with 3% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde for 20 min followed by quenching remaining fixative using 50 mM NH4Cl for 10 min and permeabilization with 0.1% TX-100 for 4 min. Here, all incubations were carried out in PBS, pH 7.4, at room temperature. In an alternative protocol, the cells were preextracted with 0.5% TX100 for 10 s at 37 degrees C in an MT stabilizing buffer (80 mM Pipes, 2 mM MgSO4, pH 6.8, 10  microM taxol), and then fixed in 100% methanol at 20 degrees C for 4 min. Before immunolabeling at room temperature, the cells from both protocols were washed again in PBS, transferred to 10% normal goat serum for 30 min, and then labeled with the primary antibody in 10% goat serum for 20 min. The coverslips were rinsed three times for 5 min and incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies in 10% goat serum for 20 min. For double-labeling experiments, the two primary and the two secondary antibodies were applied simultaneously. After extensive washing and one short wash in water, the coverslips were mounted in Mowiol containing 2.5% (wt/vol) 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane on glass slides and examined with an Axiophot fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) or a confocal fluorescence microscope (Bio Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).

At various time points, they were transferred to 4 degrees C, washed three times with ice cold PBS, scraped, pelleted, and resuspended in 0.3 ml per dish lysis buffer (MNT with 0.5% TX-100, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, and 10  microg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin). The nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. A 50- microl aliquot of the resulting supernatant was used for protein assays (bicinchoninic assay; Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL), and 0.2 ml were solubilized in 5  x  Laemmli sample buffer. Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto a 7.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis, and the separated proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry blotter. After blocking in 5% lowfat milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20, the membranes were incubated with either anti-NC-1 and calnexin or anti-ICP4 and calnexin, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (Pierce Chemical Co.). The secondary antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Corp. or Pierce Chemical Co.) and Kodak film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY).

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	36	Due to the large size of HSV-1 virions and capsids, early virus cell interactions can be readily visualized by EM (Campadelli-Fiume et al., 1988; Fuller et al., 1989; Lycke et al., 1988). We followed the incoming capsids at different stages of entry in Vero cells (Fig. 1). The extracellular, surface-bound virus particles had the familiar features of a herpes virus: a membrane envelope with spikes, a capsid with an electron-dense DNA core, and a tegument layer between the capsid and the envelope (Fig. 1, a and b). Images of fusion between the viral envelope and the plasma membrane were readily obtained (Fig. 1, c and d). After fusion, the capsids appeared to separate from the bulk of the tegument since an electron-dense mass remained associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, e and f, arrowheads; see also CampadelliFiume et al., 1988; Fuller et al., 1989). Fig. 1. Entry and uncoating of HSV-1. Ultrathin Epon sections of Vero cells infected with HSV-1 at an MOI of 500 in the presence of cycloheximide (CH). After 2 h of virus binding at 4 degrees C, the cells were either fixed immediately (a and b), or warmed up for 30 (c-f) or 60 min (g and h). (a and b) Binding. The main morphological features of the intact virus bound to the plasma membrane (PM) are the viral envelope (b, arrowhead) with the viral spikes (a, arrowhead), the viral capsid (arrow), and the electron-dense viral DNA genome within the capsid. (c and d) Fusion. Upon warming up, the viral envelope fuses with the plasma membrane, and the capsid (arrow) and the tegument proteins are released into the cytosol. (e and f) Release of the capsid. Preparations, which display a prominent contrast of the tegument, show that the tegument (arrowheads) stays behind at the PM. (g and h) Binding to the nuclear pore. At later time points, the capsids (arrows) have arrived at the nuclear envelope (NE), where they are exclusively located in close apposition to the nuclear pore complexes. Occasionally, fibers emanating from the pores (arrowheads) are visible, to which the capsids seem to bind. Almost all of the capsids at the nuclear pores appear empty and have lost the electron-dense DNA core. Bar, 100 nm. [View Larger Version of this Image (91K GIF file)].
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	37	After 1 h, the first capsids had reached the nucleus and attached themselves to the nuclear pore complexes (Fig. 1, g and h; see also Batterson et al., 1983; Lyke et al., 1988). They seemed to bind to cytsosolic fibers emerging from the pores (see arrowheads in Fig. 1 h). Since most of the capsids on the nuclear envelope lacked the electron-dense central mass, DNA release had apparently occurred. At later time points, some empty capsids were also seen free in the cytosol without connection to the nucleus. Occasionally, 1 h postinfection and later, intact and partially degraded virions were also seen in endosomes and lysosomes, indicating that a fraction of the inoculum was taken up by endocytosis..

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	39	The rate and efficiency of cell surface binding and subsequent internalization was assayed quantitatively using [3H]thymidine-labeled HSV-1. To monitor binding, cells were incubated with labeled virus at an MOI of 10, 50, or 100 at 4 degrees C, and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured at different times. As previously reported, a continuous increase in virus binding was observed up to 4 h with no signs of saturation (Fig. 2 a; McClain and Fuller, 1994; Shieh et al., 1992). At 2 hthe adsorption period used in all subsequent experiments ~40% of the added virus was bound. Fig. 2. Efficiency and kinetics of HSV-1 binding and internalization. (a) Using [3H]thymidine-labeled virus at different multiplicities of infection (MOI), the amount of virus bound to cells at 4 degrees C was quantified after various time points. There is no apparent saturation of virus binding to Vero cells. After 2 h, ~40% of the virus added bound. (b) Using [3H]thymidine-labeled virus at different MOIs, the amount of virus internalized into cells was quantified after various time points. At time 0 min (equals 2 h of virus binding at 4 degrees C), proteinase K treatment removes  > 95% of the virus bound to the plasma membrane. Upon warming up to 37 degrees C and viral fusion, the virus is protected within the cells from the protease treatment. After 30 min, the maximal amount of virus, ~70% of the bound virus, is internalized. The half-time (t1/2) of internalization is 8 min. Depolymerization of microtubules by nocodazole (ND) has no effect on the kinetics and the amount of internalization. [View Larger Version of this Image (17K GIF file)].

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	41	To follow internalization biochemically, a protease protection assay was used (Helenius et al., 1980). After a 2-h binding period in the cold, the cells were warmed up to 37 degrees C for different periods of time to initiate penetration. Thereafter, they were chilled to 4 degrees C and treated with proteinase K to detach remaining cell surface viruses. The fraction of virus protected from the protease increased rapidly after warming (Fig. 2 b) with a half-time of internalization of 8 min. The overall protease resistance reached a level of 70% within 30 min. The efficiency and rate of internalization was identical over a multiplicity range from 3  x  104-10 MOI. Treatment of the cells with nocodazole, a drug that depolymerizes MT (Fig. 2 b, ND), or with cytochalasin D, which depolymerizes actin filaments (not shown), had no effect, either on the efficiency of binding and internalization or on the kinetics of internalization. Consistent with previous reports using acid inactivation and plaque assays to assess virus internalization (Huang and Wagner, 1964), these results showed that HSV-1 penetration occurs rapidly and efficiently..

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	43	Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was next used to analyze the transport of individual capsids from the cell periphery to the nucleus. The antibodies used were either against VP-5 (anti-NC-1) or VP19c (anti-NC-2), the two major capsid proteins, or against purified whole capsids (anti-HC and anti-LC). All the antibodies gave similar results and had in common that they stained capsids that were in the cytosol (Fig. 3, 1 h) but not capsids present in surface-bound intact viruses (Fig. 3, 0 h). Presumably, this useful selectivity was caused by antigen accessibility; the relevant capsid epitopes in the intact virus particles were probably obscured by envelope and/or tegument components. In contrast, anti-capsid antibodies labeled viral capsids on thawed cryosections (Sodeik, B., M.W. Ebersold, and A. Helenius, unpublished observations). Fig. 3. Subcellular distribution of incoming HSV-1 capsids. Conventional immunofluorescence microscopy of Vero cells infected with HSV-1 at an MOI of 50 in the presence of CH. The cells were fixed in 3% PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% TX-100, and labeled with anti-HC, an antibody generated against purified capsids. After 2 h of virus binding at 4 degrees C (0 h), there is no signal. At 1 h PI, numerous cytoplasmic capsids (arrows) distributed within the entire cytoplasm are detectable. At 2 h PI, the capsids begin to accumulate at the nucleus. At 4 h PI, most of the capsids decorate the nuclei. Note that at 1 h, the focus was close to the coverslip, whereas at 2 and 4 h, it was at the nuclear membrane. [View Larger Version of this Image (74K GIF file)].

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	45	The capsids in the cytoplasm appeared as small, intensely labeled spots (Fig. 3, arrows, 1 h). Using immunoelectron microscopy on thawed ultrathin cryosections, we confirmed that these spots represented single capsids (not shown). All the structures labeled in the cytosol or at the nuclear membrane by antibodies directed against the capsid or against VP5 represented single viral capsids (not shown). The number of fluorescently labeled spots increased continuously during the first hour of warming. In addition, their distribution within the cell changed with increasing time: from the cell periphery toward the nucleus where they accumulated at the nuclear rim (Fig. 3, 2 h). After 4 h, virtually all the spots were localized at the nuclear membrane (Fig. 3, 4 h) where several hundred capsids could be seen. Thus, incoming cytosolic capsids were transported efficiently from the periphery to the host nucleus..
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	46	Double immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-capsid and anti-tubulin antibodies showed that most of the capsids that were not bound to the nucleus were associated with MT (Fig. 4, a and b). Moreover, in many cells, capsids were seen to concentrate around the MT organizing center (MTOC) (Fig. 4 b). The close association of capsids with MT was confirmed by EM (Fig. 4, c-e). Numerous cytoplasmic capsids were seen in close proximity to cytoplasmic filaments with the expected 24-nm width and MT-like morphology. Typically, the distance between the capsid surface and the tubules was ~50 nm, suggesting the presence of additional tethering components. The viral DNA inside the MT-associated capsids could be seen as a darkly stained material. Fig. 4. Incoming HSV-1 capsids colocalize with MTs. (a) Conventional immunofluorescence microscopy. Vero cells infected at an MOI of 50 in the presence of CH were fixed in methanol at 2 h PI, and double labeled with anti-VP5 (NC-1; FITC anti-rabbit) and antitubulin antibodies (IA2; rhodamine anti-mouse). The FITC and the rhodamine signals were documented simultaneously using the FITC filter set. Almost all capsids (arrows) not localized to the nucleus (N) colocalize with microtubules. (b) Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Vero cells infected at an MOI of 50 in the presence of CH were fixed in methanol 2 h PI, and double labeled with anti-capsid (HC, white) and anti-tubulin antibodies (IA2, gray). Almost all capsids not localized to the nucleus (N) colocalize with microtubules. Note that in some cells, the viral capsids accumulate at the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). (c-e) Conventional EM. At 1 h postinfection, Vero cells infected at an MOI of 500 in the presence of CH were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Epon sections were cut parallel to the substrate. Numerous incoming viral capsids are localized to microtubules (MT) as identified by their typical morphology, localization, and their 24-nm diameter. (f-h) Immunoelectron microscopy. Vero cells infected at an MOI of 500 in the presence of CH were extracted at 1 h (f) or 4 h PI (g and h) with 0.5% TX-100 in MT buffer before fixation. They were labeled with rabbit anti- tubulin followed by protein A-9 nm gold, and Epon sections were cut parallel to the substrate. The cytoskeleton, nucleus, and nuclear pore complexes (NPC), as well as cytoplasmic capsids, were preserved excellently, whereas all membranous organelles were extracted. The microtubules (MT) are easily identified, since they are heavily decorated with antibody and protein A-gold. In rather thick sections (f), the microtubules can be traced over long distances, and many capsids (filled arrows) are localized on them. These capsids still contain their electron-dense DNA core. At later time points (g and h), most of the capsids have lost their electron-dense core (h, open arrow) and are mostly located in close proximity to the nucleus. Very often the capsids are bound directly to the outer ring of the nuclear pore complex (g, NPC). Virions bound to the plasma membrane (h, curved arrowhead) have lost the trilaminar appearance of their membrane, but apparently a lot of glycoprotein and tegument remains attached to them, causing a distinct morphology easily distinguished from cytoplasmic capsids (g). Bar, 100 nm. [View Larger Version of this Image (135K GIF file)].
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	47	The tubules were unambiguously identified as MT by antitubulin labeling of specimen that had been preextracted with TX-100 before fixation. After such extraction, thicker sections could be viewed, allowing the analysis of MT over longer distances. The MT-associated capsids generally contained the viral DNA (Fig. 4 f, arrows). At later time points, most of the capsids were empty and typically located at the nuclear pores and not at the nuclear envelope membrane (Fig. 4 g). Most of these capsids did not contain DNA (Fig. 4, g and h). At 4 h postinfection, there were occasionally empty capsids localized on MT in close proximity to the nucleus (not shown). Whenever extracellular viruses were observed in these TX-100 extracted samples, they were surrounded by very-electron dense material, which probably represented the viral glycoproteins and tegument proteins that were apparently not removed during extraction (Fig. 4 h, curved arrow)..

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	50	To quantify the kinetics of the cytosolic capsid transport, we determined the subcellular localization of the incoming virus by EM at various time points postinfection at an MOI of 500 (Fig. 5). To compare this experiment with the immunofluorescence microscopy, ultrathin sections were cut parallel to the substrate through the basal region of the cells (see Fig. 5 a). For each time point, 25 electron micrographs were taken in a systematic random fashion, and the number and localization of cytosolic capsids was determined. Cytosolic capsids (Fig. 5 b) were localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 5 c), in the cytosol without obvious connection to any organelle (Fig. 5 d), at MT (Fig. 5 e), or at the nucleus (Fig. 5 f)..
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	51	After warming, the total number of cytosolic capsids increased rapidly, reaching a peak after 60 min (Fig. 5 b). At later times the number of cytosolic capsids declined, suggesting that the capsids were ultimately disassembled. We also scored whether the cytosolic capsids contained the electron-dense viral DNA core or whether they appeared empty (see Fig. 1). Up to 60 min after internalization, no empty capsids were detected, whereas after 2 h 20% and after 4 h 64% had lost their electron-dense DNA core (Fig. 5 b). Virions in endosomes peaked at 1 h and sharply declined thereafter. They may have been degraded or recycled back to the cell surface, or capsids could have been released by fusion into the cytosol..
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	52	At 15 min postinfection, almost 70% of all cytosolic capsids were localized within 100 nm of the plasma membrane (see Figs. 1, c-f, and 5 c). All of the capsids close to the plasma membrane contained the viral DNA core. At 1 h postinfection, most of the cytosolic capsids (almost 80%) had an intermediate location; they were neither close to the plasma membrane or to the nucleus (Fig. 5, d and e). A significant fraction (10% of all cytosolic capsids) colocalized with MT (see Figs. 4, c-e, and 5 e). Since the capsids (125 nm) are considerably larger than the section thickness (60-70 nm), the figure for colocalization with the MT was most likely an underestimation. Of the cytosolic capsids, only one capsid (0.9% of all capsids at 4 h postinfection) was seen to colocalize with intermediate filaments (not shown)..
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	53	Cytosolic capsids arrived at the nucleus at 2 h postinfection, and at 4 h, the majority of cytosolic capsids ( > 60%) was localized to the nucleus (Fig. 5 f). At the ealier time points (up to 1 h),  < 4% of the cytosolic capsids were located at the nucleus. Of the nuclear capsids, 68% at 2 h and 87% at 4 h were empty, suggesting that DNA release occurred after arrival at the nucleus. The vast majority of empty capsids were localized to the nucleus (Fig. 5 g). All capsids at the nucleus were localized to the nuclear pore complexes (see Fig. 1, g and h)..
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	54	In summary, the electron microscopic experiment confirmed the immunofluorescence microscopy data. Cytosolic capsids were efficiently transported from the plasma membrane via the cytosol to the nuclear pore complexes. During transit, a significant fraction attached to MT. Empty capsids appeared soon after their arrival at the nucleus, and some of these were released into the cytosol. Ultimately, the capsids seemed to disassemble and disappear because the overall number of cytosolic capsids decreased late in infection. Interestingly, the appearance of cytosolic capsids under the plasma membrane peaked before the transport of virions into endosomes, strongly suggesting that the early cytosolic capsids were indeed derived from fusion of the virus at the plasma membrane rather than by fusion from endosomes..

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	57	To determine whether efficient capsid transport via the cytosol depended on an intact cytoskeleton, cells were infected at an MOI of 50 for 2 h in the presence of drugs that affect MT or actin filaments. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that neither taxol, a drug that prevents the disassembly of MT (Wilson and Jordan, 1994), nor cytochalasin D, a drug that causes depolymerization of actin filaments (Cooper, 1987), affected capsid transport to the nucleus (Fig. 6 a, upper panels). In contrast, capsid accumulation at the nuclear membrane was significantly reduced by colchicine, vinblastine, and nocodazole (Fig. 6 a, lower panels). These drugs interact with tubulin by different molecular mechanisms (Wilson and Jordan, 1994). Labeling with anti-tubulin confirmed that colchicine and nocodazole depolymerized MT, whereas vinblastine caused tubulin paracrystal formation (not shown). In the presence of these drugs, the majority of capsids remained scattered throughout the cytosol. To test whether the effect of nocodazole was reversible, the cells were analyzed 2 h after drug removal. At this time, the MT had repolymerized, and the previously dispersed capsids were concentrated on the nuclear rim (Fig. 6 b). Fig. 6. Reduced transport of capsids to the nucleus in the absence of MTs. Immunofluorescence microscopy of Vero cells infected with HSV-1 for 2 h at an MOI of 50 in the presence of CH and drugs affecting the cytoskeleton. (a) Cytoskeletal drugs. Under control conditions, almost all capsids accumulate around the nucleus.

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	58	To determine whether efficient capsid transport via the cytosol depended on an intact cytoskeleton, cells were infected at an MOI of 50 for 2 h in the presence of drugs that affect MT or actin filaments. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that neither taxol, a drug that prevents the disassembly of MT (Wilson and Jordan, 1994), nor cytochalasin D, a drug that causes depolymerization of actin filaments (Cooper, 1987), affected capsid transport to the nucleus (Fig. 6 a, upper panels). In contrast, capsid accumulation at the nuclear membrane was significantly reduced by colchicine, vinblastine, and nocodazole (Fig. 6 a, lower panels). These drugs interact with tubulin by different molecular mechanisms (Wilson and Jordan, 1994). Labeling with anti-tubulin confirmed that colchicine and nocodazole depolymerized MT, whereas vinblastine caused tubulin paracrystal formation (not shown). In the presence of these drugs, the majority of capsids remained scattered throughout the cytosol. To test whether the effect of nocodazole was reversible, the cells were analyzed 2 h after drug removal. At this time, the MT had repolymerized, and the previously dispersed capsids were concentrated on the nuclear rim (Fig. 6 b). Fig. 6.

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	59	Since we were unable to quantify the localization of the fluorescent spots representing cytosolic capsids reliably, we infected Vero cells at an MOI of 150 in the presence or absence of nocodazole and analyzed the embedded cell pellets by quantitative EM. For each experimental condition, 50 electron negatives were taken in a systematic, random fashion and the localization of cytosolic capsids was determined (Fig. 7, a and b). After 2 h of infection, 31% of the cytosolic capsids had reached the nucleus, and only 25% were still in close proximity to the plasma membrane. In contrast in the absence of MT, none had reached the nucleus, and 58% were still in the region close to the plasma membrane. After 4 h postinfection, 75% of all cytosolic capsids had reached the nucleus, 14% were at the plasma membrane, and the remaining 11% were present in the cytosol. In the presence of nocodazole, only 47% of the cytosolic capsids had reached the nucleus, 18% were still at the plasma membrane, and 36% were in the cytosol distant from both the plasma membrane and the nucleus..

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	70	Our results strongly suggested that incoming herpes capsids move along MT toward the nucleus. Therefore, we ask whether they would use host MT-dependent motors for their transport. Since the antibody against tubulin often obscured the morphology of putative tethering factors located between the viral capsids and the MT (see Fig. 4), we repeated these experiments without immunolabeling. Electron-dense material was usually attached to the vertices of the capsids that were associated with MT (Fig. 8). The morphology of the appendages was variable, but, in some cases (Fig. 8 d, arrow), they had the dimensions and the shape of cytoplasmic dynein, a minus end-directed MT-dependent motor. Dynein is a Y-shaped protein complex with a length of ~50 nm. It is connected to its cargo via the stalk and to MT through two 14-nm globular domains (Gilbert and Sloboda, 1989; Vale, 1990; Vallee et al., 1988). Fig. 8. Incoming HSV-1 capsids display appendices at their vertices. At 1 h PI, Vero cells infected at an MOI of 500 in the presence of CH were extracted with 0.5% TX-100 in MT buffer for 2 min at 37 degrees C and fixed in 1% GA in MT buffer. They were labeled with anti-tubulin followed by protein A-9 nm gold (a) or embedded directly (b-d), and Epon sections were cut parallel to the substrate. All viral capsids display some appendages on their outside (arrowheads). The appendages are visible at three, four, five, or all six corners visible in a section, which represent the pentons of a viral capsid. Some of the appendices have a morphology very similar to purified cytoplasmic dynein (large arrow in d): a large globular stalk with two smaller globular head domains. The capsid size is ~100-110 nm; the dynein-like appendices are ~50 nm. In thick sections of golden color, the appendices are often buried in cytoskeletal material (b and d), whereas in very thin sections of grey color (a and c), they are very prominent. The appendices have all kinds of different morphology with varying sizes and electron density, but they are always located at the pentons. [View Larger Version of this Image (172K GIF file)].

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	72	To test whether cytoplasmic dynein was, indeed, associated with the capsids, we used an affinity-purified antibody directed against the heavy chain of cytoplasmic dynein (Vaisberg et al., 1993). Immunoelectron microscopy with the anti-dynein antibody was performed on ultrathin cryosections of in situ fixed cells 1 or 2 h after initiation of virus entry. In addition to a low level of labeling of the cytoplasm, dynein was found to be localized on the surface of endosomes (Fig. 9 h), mitochondria (Fig. 9 a), and the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 9 a). Very few gold particles were seen over the nucleus and the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 9, a, c, and d). The mitochondria, which do not contain dynein, served as a background control. Compared with the mitochondrial matrix, there was a slightly higher labeling in the nuclei, and the cytoplasm was labeled 2.3-fold higher than background (Table I). Fig. 9. Anti-dynein antibodies label incoming viral HSV-1 capsids. Thawed cryosections of Vero cells infected for 1 (c) or 2 h (a, b, and d-h) in the presence of CH at an MOI of 500 were labeled with rabbit antibodies followed by protein A-5 nm (a-d, and g) or 10 nm gold (e, g, and h). About 5% of the incoming viral capsids (a-f, and h) are labeled by anti-dynein (arrows), an affinity-purified antibody made against a recombinant fragment of dynein heavy. Labeled capsids are localized close to the plasma membrane (g, PM), at the nuclear envelope (c and d), or within the cytoplasm without obvious connection to either one (b). Note that the capsids within the extracellular virions (f) or within the endosomes (g and h, E) are not labeled. Anti-dynein also labels the membranes of mitochondria (a, M), endosomes (h, E), and the Golgi complex (a, G) and diffusely the entire cytoplasm, whereas the mitochondrial matrix (a, b, and d) or the nucleus (d, N) show no labeling for dynein.

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	74	In cells containing incoming HSV-1 capsids, dynein was, in addition, found associated with many of the capsids (Fig. 9, a-f). Capsids directly underneath the plasma membrane (Fig. 9 g) and within the cytoplasm (Fig. 9 b), as well as capsids in close proximity to the nucleus (Fig. 9, a, c, and d), were labeled with anti-dynein. On average, 13% of the cytoplasmic capsids were labeled (Table I). Capsids of intact virions, either extracellular (Fig. 9 f) or within endosomes (Fig. 9, g and h), were not labeled. Only 1.5% of all capsids present in virions had colloidal gold particles in close proximity (Table I). Thus, the labeling density was eightfold higher on cytosolic capsids compared with capsids within virions, ruling out the possibility that the antidynein antibody showed cross-reactivity to capsid proteins. Given that the labeling efficiency using this technique does not exceed 10%, e.g., only 10% of the primary antibody present on the sections is detected by protein A-gold (Griffiths, 1993a), these results showed that incoming cytosolic viral capsids associated with cytoplasmic dynein..

It is thought to enter neurons by fusion at the presynaptic membrane, after which the capsid is transported along the axon to the nucleus (Hill et al., 1972; Lycke et al., 1988; Roizman and Sears, 1989; Topp et al., 1994).

Over a broad range of multiplicities, we found that ~70% of bound virus penetrated with a half-time of ~8 min. More than 60% of the capsids delivered to the cytosol were transported to the nucleus within 4 h of uptake, and binding to fibers extending from the nuclear pore complexes seemed to occur. The ratio of particles to plaque-forming units for HSV-1 is between 10 and 50 (Frenkel et al., 1975; McLauchlan et al., 1992; Smith, 1964; Watson et al., 1963). Thus, if cells were infected at an MOI of 50, and 40% of these bound, the number of particles entering the cells was 140-700 according to the proteinase K assay. We determined that 60% of the internalized virus, namely 80-420 particles, uncoat their viral genome within 4 h postinfection as measured by a DNase protection assay (Ojala, P., B. Sodeik, M.W.

These drugs were also reported to reduce the amount of infectious HSV-1 recovered from rat dorsal root ganglia infected in vitro (Kristensson et al., 1986) and from the trigeminal ganglia after inoculation of the murine cornea (Topp et al., 1994). We think that it is very likely that capsids derived from virions bound to the "apical" plasma membrane in our system (see Fig. 5 a) reached the nucleus independent of MT, since the distance between the apical plasma membrane and the nuclear membrane is only ~200-300 nm. Thus, the larger the distance between the plasma membrane where the virion had bound and the nucleus, the more the transport to the nucleus depended on MT. In contrast with the results obtained in neurons (Kristensson et al., 1986), taxol, which stabilizes MT, did not reduce the efficiency of capsid transport, suggesting that the dynamic turnover or "treadmilling" of MT was not required for capsid transport in Vero cells. Depolymerization of actin filaments by cytochalasin D had no effect either on HSV-1 internalization or transport to the nucleus..

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	84	The presence of dynein heavy chains in the material attached to the cytosolic capsids indicated that the MT-mediated transport was powered by cytoplasmic dynein. Cytoplasmic dynein is a multisubunit protein complex of 1,270 kD consisting of two heavy chains, two to three intermediate chains, and a variable number of small subunits (Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994; Schroer, 1994). It has a length of ~40-50 nm and a shape reminiscent of the letter Y. The two head domains contain the MT binding and ATPase sites, while the base interacts with the cargo (Gilbert and Sloboda, 1989; Vale, 1990; Vallee et al., 1988). Dynein is responsible for minus end-directed movement of chromosomes and membrane organelles along MT (Cole and LippincottSchwartz, 1995; Mitchison, 1988). Since the plus ends of MT are localized in the periphery of Vero cells close to the plasma membrane and the minus ends are anchored at the perinuclear MTOC, dynein seems a logical choice as a motor for the transport of incoming viral capsids to the nucleus. The same applies to the axons of neurons, where the MT have their plus ends toward the synapse, and the minus end anchored at the MTOC in the cell body (Black and Baas, 1989). Although some kinesin-like MT minus end-directed motors have been implicated to play a role in mitosis and meiosis, none of them has been demonstrated to be involved in interphase transport processes (Barton and Goldstein, 1996; Hirokawa, 1996). Since the MT-mediated transport that is crucial for infection of neurons also operates in cultured fibroblasts, its analysis will be greatly facilitated..

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	86	It is believed that dynein attachment to vesicles and kinetochores requires another large multimeric complex, called dynactin, which contains 10 different proteins (Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994; Schroer, 1994; Vallee and Sheetz, 1996). So far, receptor molecules for dynein and dynactin have not been identified on any cargo structures, but several studies indicate that the activity of dynein and its binding to cargo may be regulated by phosphorylation (Allen, 1995; Dillman and Pfister, 1994; Lin et al., 1994; Niclas et al., 1996). Whether the binding of dynein to HSV-1 capsids involves dynactin or other cellular components and whether it is regulated by phosphorylation remains unclear at this point. The viral protein(s) that serve as dynein receptors also remain to be identified. Since the polypeptide composition of the capsids and tegument is known, some potential candidates can, however, be singled out. The capsid itself contains six different proteins. Of these, only VP5 is known to be located at the pentons (Trus et al., 1992), which were the sites of preferential attachment of proteinaceous material onto cytosolic capsids shown here. In addition to the bona fide capsid polypeptides, components derived from the tegument are also likely to be present. For example, VP1-2, a 270-kD protein, is particularly tightly associated with the capsids (Roizman and Furlong, 1974) and may constitute part of the material seen attached to the pentons in our electron micrographs. Taking advantage of the relative simplicity of the capsids, of existing virus mutants, and of the complete genomic sequence of the virus, work is in progress to identify and to characterize the dynein receptor in HSV-1 capsids..
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	87	It is believed that dynein attachment to vesicles and kinetochores requires another large multimeric complex, called dynactin, which contains 10 different proteins (Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994; Schroer, 1994; Vallee and Sheetz, 1996). So far, receptor molecules for dynein and dynactin have not been identified on any cargo structures, but several studies indicate that the activity of dynein and its binding to cargo may be regulated by phosphorylation (Allen, 1995; Dillman and Pfister, 1994; Lin et al., 1994; Niclas et al., 1996). Whether the binding of dynein to HSV-1 capsids involves dynactin or other cellular components and whether it is regulated by phosphorylation remains unclear at this point. The viral protein(s) that serve as dynein receptors also remain to be identified.

In addition to these conserved functions, we show that E2 proteins from high risk HPV types 16 and 18, which are associated with cervical cancer, can induce apoptosis. In contrast, E2 proteins from low risk HPV types 6 and 11, which are associated with benign lesions, do not cause cell death. We show that the ability to induce apoptosis is linked to the intracellular localization of the respective E2 proteins rather than to inherent properties of the proteins. Although low risk HPV E2 proteins remain strictly nuclear, high risk HPV E2 proteins are present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of expressing cells due to exportin-1 receptor (CRM1)-dependent nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. Induction of apoptosis is caused by accumulation of E2 in the cytoplasm and involves caspase 8 activation. We speculate that disruption of the E2 gene during viral genome integration in cervical carcinoma provides a means to avoid E2-induced apoptosis and allow initiation of carcinogenesis..

Viruses infecting the anogenital tract can be divided into two distinct classes that are associated either with benign lesions (such as HPV4 types 6 and 11) or with cancer (such as HPV types 16 and 18). The class of high risk HPVs associated with cervical carcinoma expresses two oncogenes, E6 and E7, which transform the cells by negatively interfering with the p53 and pRB pathways (1, 2). In contrast, the E6 and E7 proteins of low risk HPVs have been shown to be unable to induce cellular transformation in vitro (for review, see Ref. 3)..

E2 proteins are transcription factors that can repress transcription of the E6 and E7 genes of the genital papillomaviruses independently of their oncogenic potential (4 to 8). Transcriptional repression was shown to result from binding of E2 to sequences within the E6 and E7 early promoters of high risk as well as low risk HPVs (5, 9 to 12). Other properties of the E2 proteins are also conserved, such as their ability to activate transcription of heterologous promoters containing at least two E2 binding sites in a specific configuration and to activate viral DNA replication in concert with the E1 helicase (13). Comparative analyses of E2 proteins of high risk and low risk HPV viruses suggested a high degree of conservation in their three-dimensional structure, compatible with their conserved functions in viral DNA replication and transcription (14 to 17)..

In particular, proapoptotic activity has been demonstrated for the HPV18 E2 protein (18, 19) as well as the HPV16 E2 protein (20) and was shown to be an intrinsic property independent of transcription (18, 19). More recently, an interaction between E2 and mitotic chromosomes was described through direct interaction with Brd4, a bromodomain protein associated with acetylated chromatin (21). E2 is also associated with the mitotic spindles via tubulin interactions, which was proposed to take part in the segregation of viral genomes during cell division (22). Finally, we also recently described a novel interaction of high risk HPV E2 proteins with activators of the mitotic ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) which, by inhibiting the degradation of various APC/C substrates, results in a strong genomic instability (23). These additional functions of the E2 proteins are mediated by direct interactions with cellular proteins rather than through transcriptional control and were shown to be independent of other viral functions..

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	12	The E2 proteins are composed of three distinct domains that can be expressed separately and retain their function (24). The carboxyl-terminal domain forms a small -barrel dimer which binds to specific recognition sequences on the DNA (25). A hinge domain, with no specific structure, mainly serves as a flexible linker between the two functional domains. The amino-terminal domain is composed of two sub-domains separated by a fulcrum; one contains three -helices (at its amino-terminal end), and the other is composed of a succession of -sheets (at its carboxyl-terminal end) (15, 16). The amino-terminal domain retains functions of E2 involved in regulating transcription and replication. Above all, it has been shown to interact with cellular proteins involved in transactivation as well as with the E1 helicase that activates viral DNA replication (15, 26) and with Brd4 involved in episomal segregation during mitosis (21). Other characteristics, such as ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (24) as well as induction of apoptosis (19) involve this domain. The proapoptotic property of HPV18 E2 has been shown to depend on induction of the extrinsic pathway through activation of caspase 8 (19). The exact mechanism of this activation is not yet understood, but it appears that E2 activates caspase 8 through direct protein-protein interaction.5 Induction of apoptosis has also been shown to occur with the HPV16 E2 protein, although the mechanism is not fully understood (20)..

We examined whether the proapoptotic property of the HPV18 E2 protein is conserved among E2 proteins of other genital HPV subtypes. We fused GFP at the amino terminus of the HPV16, HPV11, and HPV6 E2 proteins and used recombinant adenoviruses to express them as previously described for HPV18 E2 (19). Subcellular localization of the E2 proteins appeared strikingly different; the E2 proteins from low risk viruses HPV6 and HPV11 were exclusively nuclear, whereas proteins from high risk viruses were located in both the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. We show that HPV18 E2 protein actively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the infected cells and that partial cytoplasmic localization of high risk E2 proteins correlates with induction of apoptosis through caspase 8 activation. In contrast E2 proteins of low risk HPVs do not induce apoptosis due to their exclusive nuclear localization. These experiments point to important differences in the biological functions of the E2 proteins from high and low risk papillomaviruses infecting the anogenital tract..

We infected HeLa cells at comparable m.o.i. to get GFP fluorescence in virtually all the cells present on the plates. As expected, GFP was observed in the nuclei of cells infected by the four recombinant adenoviruses expressing E2; however, cytoplasmic fluorescence was also clearly visible for the high risk HPV16 and HPV18 E2 (Fig. 1A). Western blots analysis indicated that differences in the subcellular localization did not depend on differences in the levels of expression. Notably, cytoplasmic localization of high risk HPV E2 proteins was not necessarily associated with higher levels of protein expression as shown with the HPV16 E2 protein (Fig. 1B). In contrast, even when expressed to high levels, low risk HPV11 and HPV6 E2 proteins remain strictly nuclear (Fig. 1A and not shown). Because HPV18 E2 has been shown to be particularly unstable (24), we compared the stability of the four E2 proteins in pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 1C). These experiments showed that the HPV16 and HPV18 E2 proteins exhibit a similar half-life of 50 min, which exactly matches the half-life reported previously for HPV18 E2 (24). In contrast the HPV6 and HPV11 E2 proteins appeared more stable, although their half-life times were only increased by 1.5-fold for HPV11 E2 (75 min) and by 2.5-fold for HPV6 E2 (125 min).

It has been shown that this transcriptional repression induces p53 stabilization in HeLa cells due to E6 repression, consequently inducing a strong G1 growth arrest (28, 31). The presence of p53 in cells expressing E2, but not in control cells, clearly indicated that the four proteins were equally able to stabilize nuclear p53 in infected cells (Fig. 1A) and to induce G1 growth arrest (Fig. 1D). We also checked the transactivation and DNA binding properties of the four proteins and detected no significant differences (data not shown).

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	43	High Risk HPV E2 Proteins Induce Apoptosis Because the four GFP-E2 fusion proteins appear to maintain their biological activity, we decided to compare their proapoptotic activities by infecting HeLa cells at increasing m.o.i. with the respective recombinant adenoviruses. We previously showed that induction of apoptosis requires a threshold expression level of the HPV18 E2 protein (19). Indeed, apoptosis was clearly detectable in cells infected at higher m.o.i. of HPV18 and HPV16 GFP E2-expressing recombinant adenoviruses, as shown by direct microscopic observation (black arrows, Fig. 2A). Under similar conditions, cells infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing HPV6 and HPV11 E2 proteins did not die, even at high m.o.i., correlating with accumulation of fluorescence in the nuclei of infected cells (Fig. 2A). The infected cells were subjected to flow cytometry, which detected the presence of sub-2N populations of up to 70% at the highest m.o.i. of HPV18 and HPV16 E2-expressing cells, in contrast to HPV6 and HPV11 E2-expressing cells, where this population remained under 10% (Fig. 2B). Accumulation of the E2 proteins in infected cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C). These experiments indicated that the full-length HPV18 and HPV16 E2 proteins did not accumulate to high levels, partly due to the emergence of specific cleavage products and degradation with increasing m.o.i. (Fig. 2C). The cleavage products were inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD in vivo (Fig. 2D) and result from caspase 3 cleavages of the HPV18 and HPV16 GFP fusion proteins at cryptic sites, as shown by in vitro cleavage experiments (Fig. 2D). These cleaved products are, thus, indicators of caspase activation and apoptosis in infected cells. In contrast, full-length HPV6 and HPV11 E2 proteins accumulated to levels that were higher than the two other E2 proteins due to the absence of caspase cleavage (Fig. 2D) and better stability..
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	44	We checked whether stabilization of the GFP-E2 proteins of HPV18 or HPV11 would change the levels of apoptosis (Fig. 2E). Inhibition of the proteasome by lactacystin induces an accumulation of the GFP-E2 proteins as shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2E but did not modulate apoptosis (upper panel, Fig. 2E). Thus, we can conclude from this experiment that the stabilization of E2 does not seem to change the apoptotic phenotype whether the E2 protein is proapoptotic, like high risk HPV18 E2, or not, like low risk HPV11 E2 protein..
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	45	High Risk HPV E2 Proteins Induce Apoptosis via a Common Mechanism Involving Caspase 8 Activation in Different Cell Lines Clear differences in the behavior of the E2 proteins from high risk HPVs compared with low risk HPVs in inducing apoptosis was also demonstrated in other cell lines such as breast cancer MCF7 cells, containing a wild-type p53, and osteosarcoma Saos cells, which lack p53 (Fig. 3A). We deduced from these experiments that the E2 proteins from low risk viruses are unable to induce high levels of apoptosis in conditions where E2 proteins from high risk viruses were efficient apoptotic inducers..
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	46	We tested whether the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD could inhibit HPV16 as well as HPV18 E2-induced apoptosis as demonstrated before (19). The addition of Z-VAD totally abolished the appearance of a sub-2N population (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that the two viral proteins induced apoptosis through caspase 8 activation, as previously shown for HPV18 E2 (19). In living cells, caspase 8 exists as a full-length "proform" protein of 50/55 kDa (doublet). This form of caspase is inactive and is activated by autocleavage to give rise to the active heterodimers, able to induce apoptosis. We examined cleaved products of caspase 8 in dead cells infected by recombinant adenoviruses expressing HPV18, HPV16, HPV11, and HPV6 GFP E2 proteins (Fig. 3C). As expected from our previous data, HPV18 E2-expressing dead cells lost almost all caspase 8 proform and exhibited an intermediate cleaved product (40/36 kDa doublet). Interestingly, exactly the same pattern was seen in HPV16 E2-expressing cells, indicating unambiguously that the two high risk HPV proteins induce apoptosis through the same pathway (Fig. 3C). In the same experiment, no cleaved product of caspase 8 could be detected in low risk viruses GFP-E2-expressing cells..

Our goal was to render the GFP HPV18 E2 exclusively nuclear and, in contrast, to make the GFP HPV11 E2 partly cytoplasmic. For this purpose, first we added a NLS in the hinge domain of the HPV18 E2 protein (18E2-insNLS2) by substituting two amino acids and inserting an arginine at position 250 to mimic the HPV11 E2 hinge NLS (Fig. 4B). Second, we mutated the putative NLS of the amino-terminal domain of the GFP HPV11 E2 protein (11E2-mutNLS1) by changing two basic amino acids with the corresponding amino acids present in the HPV18 E2 protein. A third mutant was generated by changing two amino acids in the NLS of the hinge of HPV11 E2 (11E2-mutNLS2) (Fig. 4B). These mutants were transfected in HeLa cells, and their localization was checked directly in living cells by the GFP fluorescence and by immunofluorescence with specific anti-E2 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4A, mutations in the amino-terminal NLS1 of the HPV11 protein did not modify its exclusive nuclear localization, whereas in striking contrast, mutation in the NLS2 of the hinge induced nuclear exclusion as previously shown (33). The reverse experiment of adding a strong NLS in the hinge of the HPV18 E2 protein rendered this protein more nuclear as expected (Fig. 4A). These experiments indicated that the presence or absence of a functional NLS in the hinge domain of the HPV18 E2 protein dictate the subcellular localization of the protein..

Our goal was to render the GFP HPV18 E2 exclusively nuclear and, in contrast, to make the GFP HPV11 E2 partly cytoplasmic. For this purpose, first we added a NLS in the hinge domain of the HPV18 E2 protein (18E2-insNLS2) by substituting two amino acids and inserting an arginine at position 250 to mimic the HPV11 E2 hinge NLS (Fig. 4B).

These observations suggested that the HPV18 E2 protein could possess a NES in its amino-terminal domain (34, 35). To address this, we generated deletions of the amino-terminal domain of the HPV18 E2 protein and fused the resultant polypeptides to GFP to study subcellular localization. The E2-del53, lacking the first 53 aminoacids corresponding to the two first -helices, according to the published crystal structure (15, 16), clearly localizes differently from the full-length E2 protein. E2-del53 accumulates to high levels in the nucleus, displaying localization similar to the low risk HPV E2 proteins or HPV18 E2 protein lacking the entire amino-terminal domain. Interestingly, deletion of only one -helix of the amino-terminal domain (E2-del26) had an extensive cytoplasmic localization similar to or even greater than the full-length protein (Fig. 5A).

Human Papillomavirus E2 proteins exhibit a transactivation function whose role is not yet understood in the course of the viral life cycle. In contrast, E2 function as a transcriptional repressor of the viral oncogenes and the specific disruption of the E2 gene during the establishment of HPV-induced cervical carcinogenesis have been well documented. E2 also activates viral DNA replication by interacting cooperatively with the viral helicase E1 at the origin of replication in the viral genome. Apart from its functions in regulating transcription and viral DNA replication, E2 proteins also appear to be able to interact physically with cellular proteins to directly influence host cell biology. One of these functions, not linked to transactivation, is the induction of apoptosis, which has been shown to occur through induction of the extrinsic death pathway and activation of caspase 8 (19). We have also shown that this apoptosis is independent of p53 and can occur in many different cell types provided that the viral protein is expressed above a certain threshold.

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	78	There are several other viral proteins that have been shown to activate apoptosis of infected cells through various mechanisms (for review, see Refs. 38 to 40), although the exact role of this specific function in the viral life cycle is generally not fully understood. Among these viral proteins, there are some that have been shown to induce apoptosis through caspase 8 activation, such as the lyssavirus matrix protein (41), the NS3 protein of hepatitis C (42), or HBx of hepatitis B. HBx, among various pleiotropic functions, is a transcription factor that is expressed both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The cytoplasmic HBx protein can activate caspase 8 by repressing c-FLIP through direct protein interaction, rendering the cells hypersensitive to tumor necrosis- apoptotic activation (43). Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of proteins is a frequent event accompanying induction of apoptosis. Many apoptotic proteins have to be expressed in a specific cellular compartment to be efficient and probably to allow direct protein-protein interactions. Examples of viral proapototic proteins, which are expressed both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of infected cells, are apoptin, the viral protein associated with chicken anemia and E4orf4 of adenovirus. Contrary to E2, apoptin has to be expressed in the nucleus to exert its proapoptotic function (44). In contrast, E4orf4 exerted its proapoptotic activity by two distinct pathways, one in the nucleus and the other in the cytoplasm (45). Caspase 8 activation occurs via the extrinsic death pathway as a consequence of the activation of the death-inducing signal complex through death receptors at the cytoplasmic membrane (46). Because E2 is an intracellular protein, caspase activation might occur within the cytoplasm by direct action on the proteins of the death-inducing signal complex or directly on caspase 8 itself. We do not yet know the exact mechanism by which E2 activates apoptosis, but it is clearly due to direct interactions of E2 with cytoplasmic substructures containing activated caspase 8 (results not shown)..

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	80	Why might viruses induce apoptosis of the infected cells? A plethora of viral proteins inducing apoptosis has been described indicating that the proapoptotic functions play a universal role during the viral life cycle (for review, see Refs. 38 to 40 and 47). One possibility is that apoptosis might help the newly created particles at the end of the viral life cycle to escape from the host cell and spread out. This hypothesis, however, raises the question of why this function is not conserved in low risk HPVs. There are at least two possibilities. First, the low risk E2 proteins could be more efficient in inducing apoptosis in a more physiological situation, in co-expression with other viral proteins, for instance, that could help E2 to shuttle to the cytoplasm. This is a particularly attractive hypothesis, since we have shown that the low risk HPV E2 proteins can induce apoptosis if they are artificially directed to the cytoplasm of infected cells. Another possibility is that this function is expressed by another viral protein, such as E4 for instance, which is a viral protein expressed at later time points in the viral cycle and which has been shown to induce apoptosis (48). An alternative hypothesis is that E6 and E7 proteins of high risk HPVs modify the cell cycle and block cellular differentiation. These modifications of the host cell biology might induce a greater resistance to apoptosis, specifically with the reduction of p53 expression (49). The proapoptotic activity of the high risk E2 proteins would be required to overcome these effects, contrary to the low risk infected cells, where many of the E6 and E7 functions are not conserved. The proapoptotic activity of high risk E2 proteins, however, could explain why the high risk viral genomes integrated into the cellular DNA preferentially with disruption of the E2 ORF, with this disruption leading to higher transcription of the E6 and E7 oncogenes and carcinogenic progression..

The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and viral load and proliferation rate in pre-, ongoing and post-treatment respiratory papillomatosis biopsies were examined retrospectively in 25 patients, 18 of whom were IFN- treated and seven of whom were IFN- non-treated. Using PCR, HPV was found to be present in 20/25 respiratory papillomatosis patients and HPV type was determined for 18/25 patients (12 HPV6 and six HPV11). Eighteen of the patients were treated with IFN-, 14 of whom were HPV positive (eight HPV6, five HPV11 and one undefined HPV). Response to IFN- therapy was observed in 12 patients (7/8 HPV6, 3/5 HPV11, 1/1 undefined HPV and 1/4 HPV negative), while six patients (1/8 HPV6, 2/5 HPV11 and 3/4 HPV negative) did not respond to therapy. Viral load, determined by quantitative real-time PCR (between 0 03 and 533 HPV copies per cell), and proliferation rate, determined as the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells (between 8 and 54 %), were similar in IFN--treated and non-treated patients and were generally unaffected by IFN- treatment. In summary, most (12/18) IFN--treated patients responded to therapy. Moreover, there was a tendency for patients with HPV6-positive (7/8) respiratory papillomatosis to respond more frequently to IFN- therapy than patients with HPV11 (3/5) or HPV-negative (1/4) respiratory papillomatosis. Finally, the presence of HPV and viral load and proliferation in respiratory papillomatosis biopsies was similar in patients treated or not with IFN- and were in general unaffected by IFN- treatment..

0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is an epithelial, exophytic, benign neoplastic growth, which rarely turns malignant (Aaltonen et al., 2002; Corbitt et al., 1988; Go et al., 2003; Pou et al., 1995; Rabah et al., 2001). It is most frequently ( > 90 %) located on the vocal cords (Kimberlin  and  Malis, 2000). The most common age of onset is early childhood (juvenile RRP with age of onset below 13 years of age), but the disease is also seen in adults (adult RRP) (Abramson et al., 1987). RRP is regarded as being induced by human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly HPV type 6 (HPV6) and HPV11, and shows a variable clinical course (Abramson et al., 1987; Bonagura et al., 2004; Pou et al., 1995; Rabah et al., 2001). The primary therapeutic method is endoscopic surgery, and approximately one-tenth of patients are cured after the first surgical intervention. Spontaneous remissions are also seen, but in the majority of patients the disease is recurrent and thereby demands other treatment methods. In addition to surgery, the only well-documented treatment for laryngeal papillomatosis is interferon (IFN)-, which has been widely used for more than 20 years and has been proposed to decrease the number of recurrences considerably (Deunas et al., 1997). Although IFN- has been used clinically for decades as a proven anti-tumour agent in a variety of malignant and non-malignant neoplastic disorders, the underlying mechanisms of its action remain to be elucidated. Furthermore, since IFN- treatment is burdened with side effects for most patients and the cost is considerable, markers to predict which patients may be responsive to such treatment remains a challenge for future studies. New substances for treatment of patients with respiratory papillomatosis such as cidofovir, acyclovir and ribavirin (Kimberlin, 2004) are currently being evaluated, but their role in controlling this disease is still uncertain..

DNA was extracted from 5x5  microm formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded archival tumour sections taken between 1 and 24 years prior to DNA extraction. Before and after each section, an additional section was taken for tumour tissue verification by haematoxylin/eosin staining. To check for HPV contamination between the tissue blocks, an empty block was cut, and the empty sections collected between every tumour block were subsequently treated as for the tissue sections. The paraffin was removed by xylene treatment, followed by ethanol washing. The pellet was air dried and incubated with proteinase K in 1x PCR buffer II (Applied Biosystems) at 60  degrees C, followed by inactivation of proteinase K at 98  degrees C for 8 min..

All tumour samples were run in an HLA and/or S14 PCR for verification of amplifiable DNA as described previously (Dahlgren et al., 2003; Mellin et al., 2000). Water was used as a negative control and DNA extracted from human fibroblasts was used as a positive control. PCR products were run on a 2 5 % agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. Samples showing a band of 250 bp for HLA and 127 bp for S14 were considered to have amplifiable DNA. Only HLA- or S14-positive samples were used in further assays in this study..

As positive controls, cloned plasmids of either HPV6 or -16 were used, with water as a negative control. The products were detected as above and samples with a band of 130 to 150 bp were considered to be positive and were run in an HPV type-specific PCR and/or sequenced as previously described (Mellin et al., 2002)..
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	19	Samples negative in the GP5+/6+ PCR were run in another general PCR with the CPI/CPIIG primer pair (Tieben et al., 1993) to exclude false negatives as a result of disrupted L1.

0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	21	HPV type-specific PCR. Samples considered to be HPV positive after the general HPV PCR were run in an HPV type-specific PCR with primers specific for HPV6, -11, -16, -18 and -33 (Karlsen et al., 1996) as described previously (Mellin et al., 2002). The positive controls consisted of plasmids containing cloned HPV6, -16, -18 or -33. The products were detected as above and samples with a band of 154 bp for HPV6, 89 bp for HPV11, 120 bp for HPV16, 172 bp for HPV18 and 211 bp for HPV33 were considered to be positive..
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	22	HPV quantification with real-time PCR specific for HPV6 and HPV11. Three nanograms of the HPV6-positive samples were run in triplicate in a type-specific quantitative PCR with a SybrGreen protocol in an iCycler iQ (iCycler iQ Real-time PCR Detection System; Bio-Rad) with the HPV6 type-specific primers used above. The reaction mixture, in a total volume of 25  microl, consisted of 12 5  microl iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and 1 25  microl (10 pmol  microl to 1) each of the HPV6 primers.

Immunostaining was performed according to the standard avidin to biotin to peroxidase complex (ABC) technique (Elite Standard ABC kit; Vector Laboratories). Paraffin sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and pre-treated with citrate buffer at pH 6 in a microwave oven for 20 min (700 W). After rinsing, the endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by 0 5 % hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. The sections were rinsed and incubated with blocking serum (1 % BSA) for 20 min and subsequently incubated overnight in a moist chamber at 8  degrees C with the primary antibody MIB-1 (diluted 1 : 160; Dakopatts AB) to detect the Ki-67 antigen specific to proliferating cells. A secondary biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dakopatts AB) was added to the slides and after 30 min incubation, followed by rinsing, the ABC complex was added for 30 min. The peroxidase reaction was developed using 3,3-diaminobenzidine for 6 min. Nuclear counterstaining was performed with Mayer's haematoxylin. Tris-buffered saline (pH 7 4) was used for rinsing between each step. Staining was checked with positive controls (intestinal mucosa and a lymph node). The Ki-67 labelling index was determined by light microscopy with a x40 objective by randomly counting cells with positive nuclear staining and expressing the results as the number of immunoreactive cells among the 200 nuclei of respiratory papilloma cells..

One possibility is enhancement of an immunological response against the HPV-infected cells, for example by increasing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression (Grander  and  Einhorn, 1998). An increase in MHC expression would consequently increase the ability of the immune system to respond to and combat HPV-positive respiratory papillomatosis, without directly influencing the viral load extensively in the remaining respiratory papillomatosis cells during treatment. This mechanism could also explain why cell proliferation was not affected during IFN- treatment as discussed below..

This could also lead to a decreased amount of papilloma cells, but with maintained levels of virus. IFN- has been shown to act pro-apoptotically in neoplastic cells and we have recently found that expression of the HPV16 E7 oncogene may sensitize tumour cells to IFN-induced apoptosis (Thyrell et al., 2005). Whether induction of apoptosis explains the clinical effects of IFN- in respiratory papillomatosis, however, remains to be investigated..

IFN- seems to act as an anti-proliferative agent through alterations impinging on the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase complexes, and the HPV-induced alteration in the cell-cycle machinery may be responsible for the lack of IFN--induced anti-proliferative effects (Sangfelt et al., 2000). IFN- may also exert its anti-tumour function by other means, such as inhibition of angiogenesis, as well as induction of differentiation (Grander  and  Einhorn, 1998), which could play a role in the papillomatosis setting, although this needs to be studied in detail..

One reason for the limited number of similar studies is that IFN- treatment is not used as a standard therapy for RRP. Nevertheless, even though the RRP patient group in this study was heterogeneous (age, clinical course, treatment strategy), most IFN--treated patients responded to therapy. Furthermore, there was a tendency for HPV6-positive cases to respond better than HPV-11-positive and HPV-negative cases to IFN- therapy. Interestingly, in this highly IFN--responsive disease, the prominent anti-tumour effects were not reflected as IFN--induced changes in fundamental disease-related parameters, such as viral load and the hyperproliferative state of the HPV-affected epithelium. Finally, although this study does not conclusively pinpoint the mechanism for successful IFN- treatment, it suggests that some of these analysed factors can be ruled out as possible markers for response prediction. The study also indicates areas for future investigation aimed at selecting patients who may benefit from IFN- treatment..

We recently described a series of small molecules that bind to the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of HPV type 11 E2 and inhibits its interaction with E1 in vitro and in cellular assays. Here we report the crystal structures of both the HPV11 TAD and of a complex between this domain and an inhibitor, at 2.5- and 2.4-A resolution, respectively. The HPV11 TAD structure is very similar to that of the analogous domain of HPV16. Inhibitor binding caused no significant alteration of the protein backbone, but movements of several amino acid side chains at the binding site, in particular those of Tyr-19, His-32, Leu-94, and Glu-100, resulted in the formation of a deep hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the indandione moiety of the inhibitor. Mutational analysis provides functional evidence for specific interactions between Tyr-19 and E1 and between His-32 and the inhibitor. A second inhibitor molecule is also present at the binding pocket. Although evidence is presented that this second molecule makes only weak interactions with the protein and is likely an artifact of crystallization, its presence defines additional regions of the binding pocket that could be exploited to design more potent inhibitors..

This process is dependent on replication of the viral genome by the viral E1 and E2 proteins, in conjunction with the host DNA replication machinery. E2 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that has a number of functions in the viral lifecycle. In addition to its role in the initiation of viral DNA replication, E2 is involved in regulating the transcription of viral genes (2-7), and in the segregation of the viral genome during cell division (8, 9). As a replication initiation factor, E2 binds with high affinity to specific sites located within the viral origin (ori) to help recruit it to the E1 helicase (10-13). Formation of a ternary complex between E1, E2, and the origin relies not only on the interaction of E1 and E2 with specific DNA sequences at the origin but is also critically dependent on a direct interaction between these two proteins (14-18)..

The purified protein eluted in a sharp peak when analyzed by analytical size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2A) and comparison of its elution time to those of molecular mass standards gave an estimated mass of 24.7 kDa, close to that expected for the monomer based on its sequence (23.8 kDa)..

A, analytical size-exclusion chromatography. 0.15 mg of HPV11 His-TAD was injected onto a SMART Superdex-75 column and the elution volume was 1.21 ml. The elution volumes for standards analyzed using the same buffer are indicated by diamonds: ovalbumin (44 kDa, 1.11 ml), myoglobin (17 kDa, 1.21 ml), and vitamin B-12 (1.35 kDa, 1.88 ml). The apparent TAD molecular weight was estimated from a plot of log (Mr) versus elution volume for these three molecular weight standards. B, equilibrium sedimentation data for HPV11 His-TAD. The data shown (absorbance at 280 nm versus radius (r2/2, cm2)) were obtained at 30,000 rpm, 20  degrees C. The initial TAD concentration was 4  microM. The line corresponds to the fit obtained from data at all runs in Table II using a model that assumes the presence of only monomeric TAD. The deviations between experimental data and the fit are also plotted. C, isothermal titration calorimetry. Top, raw data obtained at 20  degrees C for 16- microl injections of inhibitor 1 (120  microM) into the sample cell containing HPV11 E2 TAD (1.4 ml, 12  microM).

The all-C superposition of the HPV11 and -16 structures (187 residues) yielded an r.m.s. deviation of 1.54 A, and all secondary structural elements are conserved. The major differences are a slight twist ( < 1 degrees ) in the relative orientation of the -helical and -sheet subdomains and to variations in the position of loops, in particular those comprised of residues 140-143 and 160-165, which are involved in crystal packing in the HPV16 and HPV11 structures, respectively.

The space group of these crystals was also different from any of the previous TAD structures (Table I). The conformation of the HPV11 TAD within the complex (Fig. 5A) is very similar to that observed for the apoprotein; all backbone C could be superimposed with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.88 A (187 residues). The two inhibitor 1 molecules are both in the free carboxylate form (as drawn in Fig. 3), one of two distinct forms that this class of inhibitors adopts in solution (43). The presence in the crystal structure of the free carboxylate form confirms a prediction that this form is the one with inhibitory activity (43)..

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	67	  Because we had demonstrated that the TAD and inhibitor 1 form a 1:1 complex in solution, we were surprised to find two molecules of inhibitor bound per protein monomer (Fig. 5A). We believe that the molecule referred to below as inhibitor A is the one that binds tightly in biological assays (see below). In contrast, inhibitor B appears to interact only weakly with a secondary binding pocket, formed not only by the TAD protein alone, but also in part by one surface of inhibitor A, as well as by residues from an adjacent protein monomer in the crystal lattice. In fact, inhibitor B has approximately equal surface area in contact with each of the two TAD molecules, as well as with inhibitor A (data not shown). The close contact between the two inhibitor molecules may distort the observed interaction between the TAD and the dichlorophenyl ring of inhibitor A (see below). The TAD-TAD interface that incorporates inhibitor B is distinct from that in the apo structure, and in fact does not result in formation of a dimer, but rather an infinite array (along the 41 screw axis of the crystal), which is unlikely to exist in solution except at very high protein and inhibitor concentrations..
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	68	To further demonstrate that the region of the TAD near inhibitor A constitutes a better binding pocket than does the one near B, a computational analysis of the protein surface was performed using the Site Finder application within the MOE software package (see "Experimental Procedures"). This program uses an shape-based algorithm (44) to identify concave regions on the protein surface. Furthermore, it evaluates whether these cavities have an appropriate composition of hydrophobic and hydrophilic atoms, as hydrophilic cavities are likely to be highly solvated and thus interact only weakly with organic molecules in aqueous solution. The TAD surface was evaluated after removal of the two inhibitors, and residues that comprised the best small molecule-binding pocket are highlighted in Fig. 5B. Inhibitor A makes a number of close contacts with these highlighted residues, as described below. Inhibitor B is located on the periphery of this pocket and does not make any well defined hydrogen bonding or Van der Waals interactions. The dichlorophenyl ring of inhibitor B is 4 A from the nearest pocket atoms; other portions of the molecule are further from the protein surface (indandione moiety) or make closest contact with non-pocket atoms (thiadiazoylphenyl moiety)..

As expected, results significantly favored binding of inhibitor A relative to B, with predicted binding energies 2-fold higher for inhibitor A. Taken together, these different methods suggest that inhibitor A is solely responsible for inhibition at the low concentrations used in biological assays and that the presence of inhibitor B might be an artifact of crystallization. This suggestion is further supported by the mutational analysis of the inhibitor binding pocket, presented below. Although an artifact, it is possible that the fortuitous presence of this second molecule aided in crystallization of the complex..

However, binding of this inhibitor induces significant movement of several amino acid side chains. The indandione moiety of the inhibitor is buried in a pocket that is not present in the apo structure, but results from rotations of the side chains of Tyr-19 (1, 85 degrees ; 2, 40 degrees ) and His-32 (2, 90 degrees ) (Fig. 5C). In the apo structure, the aromatic rings of His-32 and Trp-33 form a T-shaped edge-to-face structure, with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-19 close enough to form a hydrogen bond with the -nitrogen of His-32. In the complex structure, this interaction is lost and the rings of His-32 and Trp-33 become parallel to each other. Two other side chains, Leu-94 and Glu-100, also adjust their conformations to accommodate the inhibitor (Fig. 5C). Together, these changes in side chain conformation result in the formation of the observed binding pocket (Fig. 6)..

Additional Van der Waals contacts from the Leu-94 side chain result in a highly complementary shape to the deepest part of the pocket. Two other important interactions are made with the backbone nitrogen atoms of Tyr-99 and Glu-100; the distance (2.73 and 2.77 A) and angle between these atoms and the inhibitor carboxylate oxygens suggests the formation of strong hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5C)..

The dichlorophenyl ring lies in a wider but shallower portion of the pocket without making obvious specific interactions. Although it has been found in previous studies (22) that both chlorine atoms contribute significantly to binding, neither atom is very close to the protein; the closest one being 4 A from the Tyr-19 side chain. The observed position of the dichlorophenyl ring may be due in part to distortions induced by crystal packing or the presence of the second inhibitor molecule, as discussed above. The thiadiazolylphenyl group lies along the protein surface outside of the pocket. Notably, the phenyl-thiadiazole bond is close to the side chain of Met-101. This finding is consistent with recent photoaffinity labeling experiments2 in which the carbon atom para to the amide bond of an analogue was found to be covalently linked to the terminal carbon of Met-101 (see Fig. 6)..

Most residues were mutated to Ala, but a few residues were replaced by amino acids found in other HPV types: His-32 was changed to Tyr as found in HPV16 E2, whereas Ile-30, Met-31, and Ile-36 were changed to Val, Leu, and Met, respectively, as found in HPV6 E2. These last three residues are the only ones in the vicinity of inhibitor A that are different between HPV11 and -6 E2. Also included in this study was the amino acid substitution I73A that is located on the opposite face of the protein and was previously shown to specifically affect the transactivation activity of E2 rather than its replication or E1 binding activity (25). Each mutant protein was produced by in vitro translation and tested in our previously described E1-E2-ori complex formation assay using radiolabeled origin DNA (Table IV). The ability of each protein to interact with E1 was scored qualitatively, because we did not control for variations in the level of protein produced in the in vitro transcription-translation reaction and, in any case, could not assess the proper folding or stability of the proteins.

However, three of these substitutions are at the periphery of the inhibitor-binding site (Gln-12, Leu-43, and Ser-65), and Ile-73 is on the opposite face of the protein.

The presence of a tyrosine instead of a histidine at position 32 of the E2 proteins of HPV16, -18, and -31, (Fig. 1) may contribute to the insensitivity of these proteins to the indandione class of inhibitors.

The Kd values for binding of 3 to WT and Y19A TADs were similar (Fig. 7A and Table V). Because the side chain of Tyr-19 undergoes a substantial change in position upon inhibitor binding, the lack of effect of the Y19A mutation on the affinity for inhibitor 3 may actually be due to a combination of two offsetting effects: a loss of Tyr-19-inhibitor interactions partially compensated for by a reduction in the conformational change (entropic cost) necessary to form the inhibitor binding pocket. Further mutagenesis of this residue would be necessary to address this possibility. The Kd value for 3 binding to E100A was roughly 10-fold lower, but could not be precisely determined in part because the value of Kd is well below the protein concentration used in the experiment (5 versus 50 nM).

For both panels, data points shown are for WT TAD (solid circles), or derivatives carrying the substitutions L15A (open squares), Y19A (black triangles), E39A (open triangles), I73A (open circles), and E100A (solid squares). A, dissociation constants for inhibitor 3 were determined by titrating the inhibitor (4-500 nM) into 96-well Ni-chelate Flashplates containing 50 nM TAD. Lines were determined by non-linear regression using a tight-binding equation and are based on triplicate measurements. B, E1 binding was evaluated by the ability of the different proteins to inhibit HPV11 E1 ATPase activity. ATPase activity was measured by a scintillation proximity assay as described previously (40, 41) using 3 nM E1 and 20  microM ATP. Inhibition was measured for each TAD protein at concentrations from 2 to 1000 nM and points are based on averages of three separate experiments. Lines connecting the points are for ease of visualization only..

TAD binding significantly increases the apparent Km of E1 for ATP. However, we observed that TAD-saturated E1 retained some ATPase activity. We also reported a corresponding weakening of E2 binding in the presence of high ATP concentrations, which might play a role in the dissociation of E2 and assembly of E1 hexamers at the origin (40)..

Titration of WT TAD into E1 ATPase assays inhibited activity to a maximum of 86% (Imax = 86%), with an IC50 of 4 nM (Fig. 7B and Table V). Similar results were obtained for I73A and E100A confirming that these mutations do not affect E1 binding substantially. It should be noted, however, that the IC50 values reported for I73A, E100A, and WT TAD are close to the E1 concentration used in these assays (3 nM), and hence that these IC50 values are likely to be an underestimate of the affinity of these proteins for E1..

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	106	The remaining three mutant E2 proteins (L15A, Y19A, and E39A) differed from their WT counterpart in two ways. First, the maximal degree of E1-ATPase inhibition obtained at saturating concentrations of TAD was lower for these mutants than for WT E2. This was more prominent for Y19A and E39A E2, which achieved a maximum inhibition of only 32 and 38%, respectively. Although we do not completely understand why these mutant E2 TADs achieve a lower maximum level of inhibition it suggests that the geometry of the TAD-E1 complexes that do form for these two proteins is such that the complexes retain greater residual ATPase activity. The second way in which these three mutant proteins differed from WT E2 is in their lower affinity for E1, as measured by the IC50 values required to reach their respective maximal level of ATPase inhibition. By this measure, L15A was found to reduce only slightly, if at all, the affinity of E2 for E1, whereas Y19A and E39A had a larger effect. Qualitatively, these results are in good agreement with those obtained in the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay (Table IV) in that the E1-E2 interaction is little affected by I73A and E100A, moderately affected by L15A, but more significantly reduced by Y19A and, as anticipated, by E39A. Notably, all mutant proteins retained some ability to interact with E1..

Further structural information would be required to fully understand the effects of these five substitutions, but all of these residues are located on helices in the three-helix bundle that defines the N-terminal subdomain of the TAD. The residues that form the deep pocket that binds tightly to the indandione moiety are also located within this three-helix bundle, and given the close fit between the inhibitor and this pocket it is possible that these substitutions subtly affect the packing of the three helices in a way that slightly alters the binding pocket. Perhaps similar subtle conformational changes explain why the indandione class of inhibitors binds to HPV6 E2 10-30-fold less tightly than to HPV11 E2, because the few amino acid differences in or near the binding pocket did not account for this type of differential activity. The effects of these non-binding site residue differences are conceptually similar to some HIV protease resistance mutations that occur well outside of the active site (47)..

Substitution of His-32 for tyrosine in HPV11 E2 abrogated inhibitor binding, although it did not significantly affect interaction with E1. Based on our structure of the inhibitor-TAD complex, this substitution is predicted to prevent formation of the deep end of the inhibitor binding pocket. Furthermore, the converse experiment of inserting His-32 into HPV31 E2 generated a mutant protein that could interact with compound 2, albeit not to the same extent as HPV11 or HPV6 E2..
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	119	A Role for Tyrosine 19 in Binding to E1 Tyr-19 is highly conserved among HPV types although it is an Ile in bovine papillomaviruses. Substitution of this residue by Ala resulted in an HPV11 E2 protein that was still capable of binding the inhibitor and whose melting temperature and CD spectrum were very similar to that of wild type E2, indicating that this mutation does not affect the overall structure of the TAD. However, the Y19A mutant protein was defective in binding to E1 both in an E1-E2-ori complex formation assay and in an E1-ATPase inhibition assay. Thus, this mutation appears to specifically affect E1 binding. The proximity on the TAD surface of Tyr-19 to Glu-39, the only other residue specifically implicated in binding to E1, suggests that this surface of E2 might form part of the E1-E2 protein-protein interface. If so, our results would imply that the interaction of Tyr-19 with E1 is energetically important for formation of this interface and that the indandione class of inhibitors antagonizes E1 binding by competing directly for the same or an overlapping binding surface on E2. In fact, the structure of an HPV18 E1-E2 TAD complex has recently been determined, and Tyr-19 does appear to make an important interaction with E1.4.

Comparison of these two structures revealed the induced fit mechanism by which the inhibitor binding pocket is formed and further illustrates that it is very difficult to accurately identify binding pockets or model protein-ligand interactions using only the structure of an unliganded protein (48). The binding pocket includes both a deep, narrow cavity filled by the indandione moiety, as well as a wider shallow region that makes only a few contacts with the inhibitor. The finding that a second inhibitor molecule can bind to this shallow region of the pocket raises the possibility that molecules could be found that would retain specific interactions with the deep cavity but gain additional binding energy by interaction with the larger shallow region. The characterization of a well defined small molecule binding pocket on the E2 TAD represents an important step toward the design of HPV antivirals..

We compared the uptake of HPV16 virus-like particles (VLPs) either with or without the minor capsid protein L2. Whereas VLPs containing only the major capsid protein L1 were diffusely distributed within the cytoplasm even 6 h post-infection, VLPs comprising both L1 and L2 exhibited a radial distribution in the cytoplasm and accumulated in the perinuclear region of BPHE-1 cells within 2 h.

A conserved domain comprising residues 25-45 of HPV16 L2 was sufficient for interaction with -actin. HPV16 L2 residues 25-45 fused to green fluorescent protein, but not green fluorescent protein alone, colocalized with actin and caused cell retraction and disruption of the microfilament network. Finally, wild-type L2, but not L2 with residues 25-45 deleted, facilitated HPV16 pseudovirion infection.

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	6	Passive diffusion of molecules within the cytoplasm is limited by molecular crowding and does not provide targeting to a particular subcellular domain (1). Thus, many intracellular pathogens subvert existing transport mechanisms and cytoskeletal components, both to efficiently reach their site of replication and also for the exit of their progeny (2). The cytoskeleton is highly dynamic, and its role in locomotion is regulated by a plethora of actin- and tubulin-binding proteins, kinases, and phosphatases of multiple signaling cascades. Changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of actin regulatory proteins induce the condensation of actin "comet" tails behind endosomes (3), as well as the bacteria Listeria, Shigella, and Rickettsia (4) and viruses including vaccinia, baculovirus, and SV40, for propulsion through the cytoplasm (5, 6). Other viruses employ cellular motors such as dyneins and kinesins for transport along microtubules. A single virus type can employ several intracellular transport mechanisms. Indeed, vaccinia particles are driven along microtubules by kinesin, whereupon actin tails take over propulsion (7, 8)..

In the absence of effective screening programs, cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women (10). Furthermore, oncogenic HPV infection is also strongly associated with vulval, anal, and penile cancers, some non-melanoma skin cancers, and esophageal and salivary cancers (11). An understanding of the infectious process is critical to rational development of approaches for prevention of HPV-related cancers. Although several cellular molecules, including heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (12), 6 integrin (13), and CD16 (14), have been implicated as cell-surface receptors for papillomavirus, little else is known about cellular proteins that mediate cytoplasmic transport of papillomavirus and delivery of the viral genome to the nucleus..

Overexpression of L1 alone is sufficient to form empty capsids, termed virus-like particles (VLPs) (19). L1 VLPs bind to cell surfaces and compete with bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV1) infection in vitro (20). However, both L1 and L2 are necessary for efficient production of papillomavirus and infection (21-23). Recent studies by Kawana et al. (24, 25) suggest that residues 108-120 of L2 are displayed upon the virion exterior and bind to the cell surface, resulting in internalization. Furthermore, anti-L2 antiserum neutralizes papillomavirus without preventing virion binding to the cell surface (26). We recently demonstrated that L2 plays a critical role in infection, but is not required for interaction of papillomavirus particles with the cell surface (23). Taken together, the data suggest that L1 mediates the initial binding of virions to the cell surface, whereas L2 provides later functions critical for infection.

HPV16 VLPs were incubated with BPHE-1 cells for 1 h at 4  degrees C and visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. As we previously demonstrated (20), VLPs comprising L1 and L2 or only L1 bound to cell surfaces with a similar pattern and degree (data not shown). Upon shifting to 37  degrees C for 15 min to initiate synchronized uptake, the cells were fixed, sectioned, and examined by transmission electron microscopy. No differences were noted in the cellular ultrastructure of plasma membrane-associated L1 VLPs (Fig. 1, A1 and A2) or L1/L2 VLPs (B1 and B2) or their engulfment by invagination of the plasma membrane (A2 and B2). At 30 min and 1, 2, and 6 h after shifting the BPHE-1 cells to 37  degrees C, the VLPs were localized (Fig. 2) by indirect immunofluorescence using the HPV16 L1-specific, conformationally dependent, neutralizing monoclonal antibody H16.V5 (30, 31). Interestingly, L1/L2 VLPs aligned along distinct radial tracks across the cytoplasm and within ~2 h at 37  degrees C arrived in the perinuclear region (Fig. 2, A1-A3). However, L1 VLPs were not aligned along such radial tracks. Rather, L1 VLPs remained widely distributed throughout the whole cell and showed a less clear-cut tropism toward the nucleus during this 6-h time course (Fig. 2, B1-B3). These differences in the uptake of L1/L2 and L1 VLPs suggest that L2 contributes to the transport of virions across the cytoplasm..

Thus, we examined the relative localization of HPV16 L1 VLPs and tubulin by immunofluorescent staining. However, limited overlap of L1 VLP and tubulin signals was noted 2 h after uptake (Fig. 2F).

At later time points, the radially distributed L1/L2 VLPs colocalized with actin filaments (Fig. 2A2), whereas little overlap was observed for L1 VLPs and actin (compare A and B panels).

Therefore, to address the biologic significance of the putative actin-binding domain in HPV16 L2, we compared the uptake of HPV16 VLPs comprising wild-type L1 alone, L1 and L2, and L1 and L2 with residues 25-45 deleted (L1/L225-45). Whereas wild-type HPV16 L1/L2 VLPs were rapidly transported to the perinuclear region along radial tracts (Fig. 2A1), L1/L2 VLPs lacking residues 25-45 failed to align along radial tracts in the cytoplasm and did not reach the perinuclear region during a 6-h time course (Fig. 2, C1-C3). Rather, L1/L225-45 VLPs remained widely distributed throughout the cell as described for L1 VLPs (Fig. 2, B1-B3)..

Therefore, to examine the significance of this interaction between L2 and -actin to the infectious process, we generated HPV16 pseudovirions lacking the conserved -actin-binding domain, viz. residues 25-45 (Fig. 6A), and tested their infectivity using a previously described system. Briefly, the hamster fibroblast cell line BPHE-1 harbors 50-200 episomal copies of the bovine papillomavirus genome/cell (29), but it produces no virus because the L1 and L2 genes are not expressed. However, ectopic expression of HPV16 L1 and L2 in BPHE-1 cells via infection with recombinant defective Semliki Forest viruses results in the generation of infectious HPV16 pseudovirions containing the BPV genome within capsids formed of HPV16 L1 and L2 (22). Like native BPV1 virions, the infectivity of HPV16 {BPV1} pseudovirions can readily be quantified using the in vitro focal transformation of mouse C127 cells (36). HPV16 pseudovirions lacking residues 25-45 of L2 showed dramatically reduced infectivity (Fig. 6), suggesting that interaction between L2 and -actin indeed plays a critical role in the infectious process of papillomavirus..

B, shown is the effect of the L225-45 deletion mutation on infection of C127 cells by HPV16 pseudovirions. HPV16 pseudovirions were generated in BPHE-1 cells, and their infectivity was assayed as described previously (22). The presence of infectious HPV16 pseudovirions in extracts of BPHE-1 cells expressing wild-type HPV16 L1 and L2 (L1+L2), L1 and L2 lacking residues 25-45 (L1+L2(25+45)), or L1 alone was assessed using the focus forming assay in monolayers of C127 cells and compared with untreated control (Contr.) C127 cells. Mouse C127 cells were maintained for 3 weeks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The plates were stained with 0.5% (w/v) methylene blue and 0.25% (w/v) carbol fuchsin in methanol to highlight transformed foci for counting. C, foci counted in four experiments are plotted..

Given the ability of L2 to bind to actin and the karyophilic nature of full-length L2, we hypothesized that an overabundance of L2 within the cytoplasm might induce changes in the cytoskeleton and cell morphology. To test this hypothesis, the fragment of HPV16 L2 encoding residues 25-45 was inserted 3' of the GFP gene in the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C2 to form pEGFP-L2-(25-45). COS-7 cells were transfected with either pEGFP-C2 or pEGFP-L2-(25-45). Three days after transfection, equivalent expression of GFP alone and fused to HPV16 L2 residues 25-45 was confirmed by Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to GFP (data not shown). The subcellular localization of actin (upon staining with rhodamine-phalloidin) and either GFP alone or fused to HPV16 L2 residues 25-45 was examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Transient expression of GFP fused to HPV16 L2 residues 25-45 within the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells induced a dramatic retraction of transfected cells from the culture surface (Fig. 7B1). In contrast, expression of GFP alone in the transfected cells did not noticeably influence cell morphology (Fig. 7A1) compared with the parental untransfected cells (data not shown). Interestingly, staining revealed apparent reorganization of filamentous actin into cytoplasmic bundles, which colocalized with the GFP fusion proteins containing HPV16 L2 residues 25-45 (Fig. 7, B1-B4). GFP did not significantly colocalize with actin staining even in dividing cells that had retracted from the culture dish (Fig. 7, A1-A4). Thus, cytoplasmic overexpression of the actin-binding domain of HPV16 L2 is sufficient to induce retraction of COS-7 cells and actin reorganization..

Fig. 1B3 shows surface-bound HPV16 L1/L2 VLPs, large groups of particles within vesicles, and individual particles free in the cytoplasm. The majority of 50 HPV16 L1/L2 VLPs present in the cytoplasm were associated with fine filamentous structures whose width is consistent with that of actin microfilaments. HPV16 L1/L2 VLPs occasionally formed "star-like" structures (Fig. 1B4) with fine filaments radiating from the capsid surface or a halo around the particle in the dense cortical actin (data not shown), suggestive of actin rearrangement. Fine filaments (Fig. 1B5, arrow 1) that seemed to link HPV16 L1/L2 particles to microtubules (arrow 2) were also found. However, we did not observe such structures in association with 50 L1 VLPs free in the cytoplasm of BPHE-1 cells (data not shown).

Thus, study of such infectious pathways can both enhance our understanding of normal cellular transport as well as identify targets for intervention. Although intracellular pathogens use diverse primary and secondary receptors to gain entry to the cell, the mechanisms employed for intracellular transport are more restricted. For example, microorganisms as diverse as Listeria, Shigella, Rickettsia, vaccinia, and SV40 employ different receptors to gain entry to a cell, but a similar mode of intracellular transport (6, 34). However, despite their structural similarity to SV40 (18), the papillomaviruses use a distinct cell-surface receptor and entry pathway, about which little is known. Indeed, three different surface molecules (12-14) have been proposed to bind to the major capsid protein L1 and to function as the primary receptor for papillomavirus. Papillomavirus L1 pseudovirions prepared in vitro are infectious, although significantly less so than those containing L2 (38-40). We have provided genetic evidence that L2 also plays a critical role during papillomavirus infection, but after the initial binding of the particle to the cell surface (23). By virtue of its ability to bind to and enter cells, L2 was recently proposed to bind to a secondary viral receptor and to facilitate uptake (24). The inability of L1 VLPs to enter the nucleus (41) and the importance of the DNA-binding and karyophilic domains of L2 to the infectious process suggest that interaction of L2 with the viral genome may play a key role in its delivery to the nucleus (23, 42)..

Indeed, antibody to L2 (but not L1) neutralizes diverse papillomavirus genotypes, suggesting that a conserved functional domain of L2 is displayed on the capsid surface (25, 43). Furthermore, L2-specific neutralizing antibodies predominantly recognize its N terminus and do not prevent virions from binding to the cell surface (26), suggesting that neutralization may occur by a blockade of virion uptake or intracellular transport..

These actin cables are transiently formed in association with the viral nucleocapsids prior to viral gene expression and concomitantly with nucleocapsid transport to the nucleus (45). Two virus-encoded capsid proteins, p39 and p78/83, in A. californica M nucleopolyhedrovirus were found to bind to actin directly and therefore could be involved in the observed acceleration of actin polymerization by viral actin-binding proteins (46). It is unclear how this effect relates to the changes in actin structure produced by overexpression of L2 residues 25-45 within the cytoplasm because neither papillomavirus L1/L2 VLPs nor L2 induces such actin cables..

Actin comet tails result from a depolymerization of filamentous actin and re-polymerization behind the particle (34). Interestingly, overexpression of the -actin-binding motif comprising residues 25-45 of HPV16 L2 in the cytoplasm was associated with the redistribution of actin in COS-7 cells and altered cell morphology.

Furthermore, interaction of the Black Creek Canal virus N protein with actin microfilaments is required for virion morphogenesis and release, but not infection (50).

Type-specific HPV serology is currently based on virus-like particles (VLPs) with intact conformation. Presence of incorrectly folded VLPs in VLP preparations is recognized as an important cause of cross-reactivity in HPV serology. Heparin-coated microtitre plates were evaluated for capturing conformationally correct VLPs and improving the type specificity of HPV serology. Hybrid VLPs between HPV16 and HPV11, which had been found to have significant reactivity with children's sera and a batch of HPV18 VLPs that had failed the quality control because of significant reactivity with sera from virginal women, were tested in parallel with heparin ELISA, ordinary ELISA and type-specific mAb capture ELISA. Control sera from children that had detectable reactivity with HPV16/11 hybrid VLPs in ordinary ELISA did not react in heparin-based ELISA, but some hybrid VLPs also had background reactivity in capture ELISAs. Control sera from virginal women that had some reactivity with a poor quality HPV18 VLP preparation in ordinary ELISA had no reactivity in heparin or capture ELISA, suggesting that certain VLP preparations expose cross-reactive epitopes that are not exposed on VLPs with heparin-binding ability. As the sensitivity was similar or only marginally affected by the use of heparin plates, use of heparin-coated plates may improve the type specificity of VLP-based ELISAs and reduce interassay variability attributable to variable quality of different VLP batches..

0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	7	   INTRODUCTION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are the most common viral sexually transmitted diseases worldwide and have been found to be the central aetiological risk factor for cervical cancer (Schiffman et al., 1993; Walboomers et al., 1999). The major capsid protein L1 of HPV can self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs), which are morphologically and immunologically similar to native virions (Kirnbauer et al., 1992; Rose et al., 1993). VLPs are useful tools to evaluate humoral responses to HPV and to investigate early events in infectivity such as cell binding and internalization (Galloway  and  McDougall, 1996; Muller et al., 1995; Roden et al., 1994; Volpers et al., 1995) and have been used to successfully vaccinate humans against HPV infection (Koutsky et al., 2002). Studies using papillomavirus neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (N-mAbs) have demonstrated that the predominant neutralizing epitopes are type-specific surface conformational epitopes on intact virions or VLPs (Christensen et al., 1990; Ludmerer et al., 1996; Roden et al., 1997). There is a need to define quality control methods, both for HPV serology and vaccinology, that will detect if the virus-like particle (VLP) batches produced have an intact conformation with appropriate exposure of type-specific neutralizing epitopes and minimal exposure of broadly cross-reactive, non-neutralizing epitopes..
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	8	As HPVs do not grow efficiently in cell culture, systems using HPV VLPs have been used to study viral infectivity (Roden et al., 1996; Rossi et al., 2000; Stauffer et al., 1998; Unckell et al., 1997). Cell surface heparan sulfates are essential for infection by HPV16 and HPV33 pseudovirions (Giroglou et al., 2001) as well as HPV11 virions (Shafti-Keramat et al., 2003) and for binding and uptake of VLPs of various HPV-types (Combita et al., 2001; Drobni et al., 2003; Joyce et al., 1999; Selinka  and  Sapp, 2003). Heparin, a highly sulfated form of heparan sulfate proteoglycan secreted by mast cells, interferes with pseudoinfection and has been shown to efficiently bind VLPs (Giroglou et al., 2001; Joyce et al., 1999). The interaction with heparin requires intact conformation of VLPs (Giroglou et al., 2001; Rommel et al., 2004)..

VLP ELISAs have been successfully used in epidemiological studies of HPV infections in different populations (Dillner, 1999). However, incorrectly folded VLPs expose cross-reactive epitopes that may compromise the type specificity of VLP-based HPV serological assays (Wang et al., 1997a), a problem recently highlighted in a study with HPV16/11 hybrid VLPs (Wang et al., 2003)..

0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	11	An alternative method to avoid background caused by incorrectly folded VLPs is to use type-specific mAbs against conformational epitopes as catching antibodies in the ELISAs (Carter et al., 1994). However, we have previously found that adequate isotype specificity of ELISAs is improved by using mAbs specific for different human Ig isotypes (Heino et al., 1995; Wang et al., 2000). Also, two-step detection of bound antibodies (with a mouse mAb and an anti-mouse reagent was important for sensitivity (Heino et al., 1995). Two-step methods cannot be used if ELISA plates have been coated with mouse mAbs. Finally, type-specific mAbs to HPV are only available for a limited number of HPV-types..

Study 1 investigated attack rates and seroprevalences of human papillomavirus types 11, 16 and 33 among a high-risk population for cervical cancer: in the Shanxi province, China. In total, 1196 high school students/teachers (570 men and 626 women, mean age 16 years, range 14 to 35 years) and 170 couples (mean age 24 years, range 20 to 35 years) attending the mandatory serological screening before marriage donated serum samples at enrolment and 12 months later. Study 2 investigated the human papillomavirus antibody response among 216 women (mean age 53 years, range 23 to 88 years) with untreated primary invasive cervical cancer admitted to the Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Study 2 also contained 243 age and sex-matched healthy control women (Wang et al., 1997b). Study 3 investigated sexual behaviour and the risk of HPV infection in 188 serum samples from 94 teenage girls (mean age 16 1 years) donated at enrolment and at a follow-up 2 years later. Forty-five samples were from virgins, whereas the other samples were from sexually experienced girls. None of the virgin girls had HPV DNA in the cervix (by PCR) or serum antibodies against HPV16 or HPV33 (Andersson-Ellstrom et al., 1996). HPV16+/HPV11 to  and HPV16 to /HPV11+ samples from these studies were re-tested with HPV16 and HPV11 in parallel with the hybrid VLPs. Besides these, children's serum samples were selected from a study that surveyed the seroprevalence of human papillomavirus types 16, 18 and 33 among 1031 children up to 13 years of age, whose serum samples had been submitted for serological analyses of non-HPV-related diseases and were obtained from the Department of Clinical Virology of the Karolinska Hospital and the Department of Pediatrics of the Huddinge Hospital, both in Stockholm, Sweden (af Geijersstam et al., 1999). Serum samples from children in the age group 2 to 10 years that had been found to be HPV16 seronegative were also tested with HPV11 and re-tested with HPV16 in parallel with the hybrid VLPs to ensure that they were both HPV16 and HPV11 seronegative. In total, 32 HPV16+/HPV11 to  serum samples, 64 HPV16 to /HPV11+ serum samples and 23 HPV16 to /HPV11 to  serum samples were included in this study. In the case of HPV18, serum samples from 13 women who had tested HPV18 DNA+ by PCR of cervical samples and seven serum samples from HPV18 DNA to  virginal women were analysed..

The reactivity of mAb H16.D9 to intact VLPs was also similar in heparin-based and direct ELISAs. In contrast, the reactivity of H16.D9 with disrupted virus was eliminated or strongly reduced on heparin-coated plates. Indeed, none of the mAbs that reacted with disrupted virus in direct ELISAs were reactive with the same disrupted viruses if heparin plates were used, with the exception of the reactivity of disrupted H11 : 16[FG+HI] hybrid virus with the H16.D9 mAb. The remaining H16.D9 reactivity in heparin-based ELISA suggested that some intact VLP might be present in the alkali-disrupted H11 : 16[FG+HI] hybrid VLPs. Therefore, we also examined more harsh methods for disruption of VLPs (alkali treatment and reducing agent treatment; boiling, alkali and reducing agent treatment). With the most harsh method (boil/alkali/reducing agent), there was no antigenic reactivity at all detectable on the heparin-coated plates, although antigenic reactivity with similarly disrupted VLPs was readily detectable on ordinary ELISA plates (Table 1)..

There were minor differences in correlation depending on whether heparin-based or direct ELISAs had been used. For example, H11 : 16[FG+HI] versus HPV11 had a correlation coefficient in direct ELISA of 0 58 (Wang et al., 2003), in heparin-based ELISA of 0 68. The correlation coefficient between hybrid H16 : 11[171-505] to HPV11 was 0 71 for direct ELISA (Wang et al., 2003) and 0 63 for heparin-based ELISA (Fig. 1)..

We suggested that this increased reactivity would be due to subtle differences in surface exposure of conformationally constrained epitopes on hybrid VLPs. It was therefore of interest to study whether this increased reactivity would also be present if heparin-based ELISAs was used. The antibody responses among HPV16 to /HPV11+ sera to the hybrid VLPs were quite similar in heparin-based and direct ELISAs (for H11 : 16[FG+HI], mean OD value 1 48 in direct ELISA and 1 41 in heparin-based ELISA). Hybrid H11 : 16[FG+HI] still gave more than two times higher reactivity than HPV11 VLP (Table 2)..

Because of the improved specificity of heparin-based ELISA, we also evaluated the reactivity of a batch of HPV18 VLPs that had previously failed in the quality control testing because of measurable reactivity with serum samples from unexposed women. In direct ELISAs, one negative control sample from a virginal woman had strong reactivity with this HPV18 batch and the other samples in the negative control panel also had some detectable reactivity in direct ELISA (Table 4). When this HPV18 VLP batch was tested with mAbs, the expected strong, type-specific reactivity with the HPV18 N-mAb R5 was detected (Table 5). However, weak reactivities with H16.V5, H11.F1 and H11.H3 (type-specific for HPV16 and 11) were also detectable (Table 5). However, no reactivity was detectable when the same negative control sera and mAbs against other HPV-types were tested with the same VLPs coated onto heparin-binding plates (Tables 4 and 5). Thirteen serum samples from HPV18 DNA+ women and seven samples from HPV18 DNA to  virginal women were also tested for reactivity with this low-quality HPV18 VLP with capture ELISA using the HPV18 type-specific mAb R5 as a capture molecule. The reactivities were quite similar to those in heparin-based ELISA (Table 4). Both methods had lower background with serum samples from unexposed women and essentially similar reactivity with the samples from infected women (Table 4)..

Also, this VLP was the only one from which the results of heparin-based and capture ELISAs where distinctly different.

We found that the mAbs that reacted with disrupted virus in direct ELISAs did not react with the same disrupted viruses if heparin-coated plates were used, suggesting that the use of heparin-coated microtitre plates could add a quality control component to the VLP-based ELISAs by preventing binding of denatured L1 antigen and contaminating protein. Numerous approaches towards decreasing non-specific binding to ELISA plates have been described, notably the use of blocking with vinyl polymers (Studentsov et al., 2002). The approach with heparin-coated plates has the advantage that a specific biological property of the virus is exploited to increase the specificity of binding. VLPs of all HPV-types tested so far bind to heparin with similar efficiency (Rommel et al., 2004), suggesting that heparin can be used as a universal capture molecule for HPV serology..
