The inner lipoyl domain (L2) of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) 60-mer forms a Ca2+-dependent complex with the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 (PDP1) or its catalytic subunit, PDP1c, in facilitating large enhancements of the activities of PDP1 (10-fold) or PDP1c (6-fold). L2 binding to PDP1 or PDP1c requires the lipoyl-lysine prosthetic group and specificity residues that distinguish L2 from the other lipoyl domains (L1 in E2 and L3 in the E3-binding component). The L2-surface structure contributing to binding was mapped by comparing the capacities of well folded mutant or lipoyl analog-substituted L2 domains to interfere with E2 activation by competitively binding to PDP1 or PDP1c. Our results reveal the critical importance of a regional set of residues near the lipoyl group and of the octanoyl but not the dithiolane ring structure of the lipoyl group. At the other end of the lipoyl domain, substitution of Glu182 by alanine or glutamine removed L2 binding to PDP1 or PDP1c, and these substitutions for the neighboring Glu179 also greatly hindered complex formation (E179A  >  E179Q). Among 11 substitutions in L2 at sites of major surface residue differences between the L1 and L2 domains, only the conversion of Val-Gln181 located between the critical Glu179 and Glu182 to the aligned Ser-Leu sequence of the L1 domain greatly reduced L2 binding. Certain modified L2 altered E2 activation of PDP1 differently than PDP1c, supporting significant impact of the regulatory PDP1r subunit on PDP1 binding to L2. Our results indicate hydrophobic binding via the extended aliphatic structure of the lipoyl group and required adjacent L2 structure anchor PDP1 by acting in concert with an acidic cluster at the other end of the domain.     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS AND DISCUSSION REFERENCES
The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC)1 catalyzes the irreversible conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and reduction of NAD+ via the sequential action of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) components. Mammalian PDC is organized around a central framework formed by assembly of 60 E2 subunits. E2 consists of four independently folded domains connected to each other by mobile linker regions 20-30 amino acids in length (1-4). Association of 20 trimer units of E2's C-terminal domain produces a central cavity in the shape of a dodecahedron. At its surface, this assembled inner core is connected by the first linker region to a 5-kDa domain that binds the E1 component (5, 6); 20-30 E1 tetramers (22) are anchored per E2 60-mer (7). Then, set off by two more linker regions in the E2 structure, are two ~10-kDa lipoyl domains: an interior one, L2, and an NH2-terminal one, L1. An E3-binding protein (E3BP) has a multidomain structure similar to E2 consisting of three linker region-connected globular domains (8, 9). The C-terminal domain of E3BP binds E2's inner domain followed with intervening linker regions first by the domain that binds E3 and then by a single lipoyl domain (designated L3) at the N terminus (5, 8-10, 12-14).
Mammalian PDC is tightly regulated by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, which determines the proportion of active (nonphosphorylated) E1 (2-4, 15). PDC inactivation of E1 is carried out by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and reactivation by pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP). PDC is regulated by at least four PDK isoforms and by two PDP isoforms, which are variably expressed in different tissues (16-20). In Ca2+-sensitive tissues, the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 (PDP1) is the dominant phosphatase isoform (20). PDP1 catalyzes a Mg2+-requiring, Ca2+-stimulated dephosphorylation and activation of E1 (15, 21, 22). PDP1 activity is enhanced manyfold when the phosphorylated E1 and PDP1 are bound by the E2 60-mer (23, 24). Indeed, Ca2+ stimulation requires E2 because PDP1 binds to E2 via an interaction that requires Ca2+ (23) at micromolar levels (22). The magnitude of this enhancement (typically 7-16-fold) primarily depends on the level of free phosphorylated E1 in the absence of E2 because kinetically it results in a near saturated activity in the presence of E2 being compared with an activity that varies greatly with the level of phosphorylated E1. Thus, there is a major decrease in the apparent Km of PDP1 for phosphorylated E1 upon concentrating PDP1 along with phosphorylated E1 at the surface of the E2 core (23). Ca2+ also causes an ~2-fold decrease in the Km of PDP1 for Mg2+ (25).
PDP1 is composed of two subunits (26, 27). Its catalytic subunit (PDP1c, mass = 52.6 kDa) is in the phosphatase 2C class but shares only ~20% sequence identity with rat cytosolic  and  isoforms of phosphatase 2C (28). The other subunit (PDP1r, mass = 96 kDa) serves a regulatory role by elevating the concentration of Mg2+ required for efficient PDP1c catalysis (29). The PDP1r subunit is a flavoprotein with a bound FAD; the sequence of PDP1r is distantly related to the mitochondrial flavoprotein, dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (30), which functions in choline degradation. Spermine and, to a lesser degree, other polyamines reduce the Km of PDP1 for Mg2+ (31), probably by binding to PDP1r to reverse the effect of this subunit in elevating the Mg2+ responsiveness (29). The PDP2 isoform has an even higher Km for Mg2+, which is reduced from  > 15 mM to 3 mM by direct interaction of spermine with recombinantly produced PDP2 that consists just of a catalytic subunit. Rat PDP2 shares 55% sequence identity with rat PDP1c, but PDP2 is not activated by Ca2+ (20). A similar diminution in the concentration dependence of PDP activity for Mg2+ is produced by insulin and sustained in permeabilized mitochondria prepared from insulin-treated adipose tissue (32). This probably involves a change in the activity of PDP2, which is located in adipose tissue (20).
The L2 domain of E2 selectively binds PDP1 by an association that specifically engages L2's lipoyl prosthetic group (33, 34). PDP1 does not interact productively with the L1 domain of E2 (33, 34) or with the lipoyl domain of E3BP (reported herein). PDP1c, alone, undergoes Ca2+-dependent binding and activation (28) via an association with the L2 domain (Ref. 35, and data herein). Using gel-anchored GST-L2, Ca2+-aided binding has been used to selectively purify PDP1 (33) and PDP1c (35). Ca2+ does not bind to either PDP1c or the L2, alone; binding requires the combination of the catalytic subunit and the free lipoyl domain.2 This suggests either a bridging role of Ca2+ between L2 and PDP1c or a stepwise interaction in which Ca2+ stabilizes the complex by binding at a site induced by a precursory (weaker) interaction between PDP1c and the L2 domain.
To understand and compare the lipoyl-domain specific, Ca2+-dependent binding of the L2 domain to PDP1 and PDP1c, we have mapped the effects of changes in the L2 structure both by site-specific changes in surface amino acid residues and by substitution of analogs of the lipoyl prosthetic group. Our results reveal the importance of residues near the lipoyl group and the hydrophobic character of the lipoyl group as well as the critical contribution of specific acidic residues at the opposite half of the folded domain that are separated by required, L2 domain-specific sequence. Some differences between interactions with PDP1 and PDP1c are also detected.     EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS AND DISCUSSION REFERENCES
Materials-- Bovine PDC and resolved E1 containing bovine PDK were isolated as previously described (36, 37). Human E1, E2, and E2-E3BP were prepared as will be described elsewhere.3 Bovine PDP1 and 32P-labeled phosphorylated PDC were prepared as previously described (27, 33). Because PDP1 purified only through the DEAE-column step (27) is more stable than the highly purified PDP1 prepared by affinity chromatography using GST-L2, most assays of PDP1 employed PDP1 from this less purified fraction (40-50% PDP1 based both on PDP1 specific activity and staining patterns after SDS-PAGE). Escherichia coli expressing PDP1c was provided by Lester J. Reed and PDP1c prepared by modification of the procedure described by Choi et al. (35). The primary modification was that extracts of PDP1c were allowed to interact with the GST-L2 anchored on GSH-Sepharose overnight at 4 degrees C prior to washing and then eluting by Ca2+ chelation using EGTA. From 10 g of cells, 25-30 mg of nearly homogeneous PDP1c was routinely obtained. L2, mutant L2, nonlipoylated L2, and L2 with lipoate analogs enzymatically attached to nonlipoylated L2 were prepared as previously described (38-40). The sequences of mutated cDNA for expressing new L2 mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Newly developed mutant L2 domains were evaluated as substrates in the E1 and E3 reactions and by differential scanning calorimetry as previously described (38, 39). Based on patterns in native gel and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, the lipoyl domains were 99% pure with the inclusion of very low levels of bands (native gel pattern) corresponding to nonlipoylated L2 (38, 39). Lipoyl domain concentrations were based on their calculated absorbance at 280 nm with appropriate adjustments when tyrosine residues were mutated as previously described (38). This approach gives more accurate protein concentrations that are ~1.5 times higher than the protein levels estimated using the BCA protein assay employed in earlier studies (33).
Phosphatase Activity-- Bovine PDP1 activity was determined using phosphorylated bovine PDC (PDCb) by measuring the rate of release of [32P]phosphate from PDCb (27, 33). The inhibition of PDP activity by various lipoyl domain constructs, added at the indicated levels, was determined as previously described for wild type L2 domain (33). Unless otherwise indicated, PDP1 or PDP1c was added to reaction mixtures equilibrated at 30  degrees C for 60 s and then PDP activity initiated by addition of Mg2+ to a final concentration of 10 mM. Final reaction mixtures also contained: 50 mM MOPS-K (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM EDTA. 1.2 mM Ca2+, 1.0 mM EGTA, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mg/ml Pluronic-F-68, 20  microg of phosphorylated PDC, and 0.02-0.03 units of PDP activity (27) in a final reaction volume of 25  microl. After 120 s, reactions were quenched with 200  microl of 10% trichloroacetic acid, vortexed immediately, and after a 30-min incubation on ice, 90  microl was withdrawn and the released [32P]phosphate determined (27, 33). Assays, in which either a phosphatase source or Mg2+ were not added, gave similar negligible backgrounds, which were subtracted from the above activities. Using this standard assay procedure and 10 mM Mg2+, PDP1 (DEAE-purified) had a specific activity in the range of 500-650 nmol min1 mg1 and PDP1c had specific activities in the range of 1300-1600 nmol min1 mg1. In the limited studies in which the free Ca2+ level was controlled by EGTA-Ca buffer, the level of free Ca2+ was calculated as previously described (36) with appropriate corrections for Mg2+ binding and for Ca2+ contamination in reagents.
All assays were conducted at least in duplicate with control assays (no lipoyl domain present) conducted in duplicate at the beginning and end of the series of assays. The deviations from the average values for the control, E2-activated PDP1 or PDP1c activities, were normally within  plus or minus 4% of the average value. Somewhat higher percentile, but usually lower absolute deviations (typical data shown in Figs. 8 and 9) were observed for the average values for the lower (well inhibited) rates. Given these deviations, the percentage of inhibition values shown in the tables (a difference of the average control rate and an average inhibited rate) could be as high as  plus or minus 7% so that 5% inhibition is within experimental error little or no inhibition. With a given PDCb substrate, the average percentage of inhibition values obtained for a specific L2 construct in different experiments fell within these deviations and the trends (strong to weak inhibition) were invariant with all PDCb substrates. However, the absolute percentage of inhibition by various L2 structures (including wild-type L2) varied somewhat more with different PDCb substrates. Tables I, II, and IV combine data from several experiments. The data are normalized as described in the legend to Table I for convenient comparison of the trends that were repeatedly observed.
When a full analysis of L2 inhibition of E2 activation of PDP activity was analyzed over a range of L2 concentrations, the data were fit assuming that the fraction of PDP bound to E2 operates at the maximum rate and the fraction of PDP bound to L2 operating at the minimum rate (Vmin) so v = Vmax[PDPt  L2 PDP]/[PDPt] + Vmin[L2 PDP]/[PDPt]. (The [PDPt] in the denominator of the first term on the right was not correctly entered previously (33).) For the series of L2 levels used, the L2 PDP concentrations were estimated from the best iterative fitting of a data set to the optimum ratio of dissociation constants for binding of PDP by L2 versus E2 (r = Kd(L2)/Kd(E2)) and the optimum Vmin (33) along with assuming that free phosphatase is negligible. All assays were conducted with saturating levels of phosphorylated PDC (i.e. higher rates were not observed at higher levels) and, therefore, maximal binding of PDP1 or PDP1c to E2 is supported.
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)-- Titrations were performed with an MSC titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.) at 30 degrees C. Protein samples were dialyzed against Chelex-100-treated 30 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.3, containing 30 mM NaCl. The Ca2+ concentrate, prepared in dialysis buffer, was injected at discrete intervals. The observed heat change was corrected for the heat of dilution of ligand determined by a titration in the absence of protein.

Modifications of the L2 Domain and Goals-- The L2 domain is an elongated  barrel structure (Fig. 1), with one of its narrow ends containing both an E1-specificity loop and a tight -turn that contains the lipoylated Lys173. One extended side of the domain (see Fig. 1B) presents primarily hydrophilic residues and is rich in acidic residues (red and orange); the opposite side (see Fig. 1C) has a prominent hydrophobic face (yellow residues) and a mixture of acidic and basic residues. A C-terminal lobe and N-terminal segment protrude from the domain at the opposite end from the lipoylation loop; these segments were not found to be stably folded in the structure determined by NMR (41). However, these terminal regions are distinct from their adherent Ala-Pro-rich linker regions; mutation of specific residues in these terminal regions affects the thermal unfolding of the domain (38). Previously, a set of single-residue substitutions in the L2 domain were made for prominent amino acids located at strategic positions on the surface of the L2 domain (38); we initially screened the effects of those characterized mutants on L2 binding to PDP1, and, based on that initial screening, additional L2 mutants were made to achieve the following goals. All residues undergoing single site mutations are labeled in Fig. 1 (B and C).
View larger version (28K):    Fig. 1.   Ribbon diagram and space-filled presentations of the human L2 domain. These models are based on the structure of Howard et al. (41), but the extra amino acids on the N terminus, which are not part of the L2 structure, were removed. Single-letter code is used for amino acid residues. The ribbon diagram (panel A) shows L2 is a flattened -barrel structure made up of two antiparallel  sheet regions. The position of Lys173 is marked with an arrow, and the specificity loop (loop 1) with a star. Panel B shows a space-filled model positioned in a similar orientation to the ribbon diagram in panel A, and panel C shows the opposite side of the lipoyl domain. The positions of all mutated amino acids and the location of the specificity loop in the L2 structure are indicated. Residues are numbered according to their sequence in mature E2, which is 123 higher than the numbering used in Ref. 41. Asp is red; Glu is orange; Lys and Arg are dark blue, except Lys173, which is magenta; Gln and Asn are cyan; Ser and Thr are green; Pro, Met, Gly, and the only histidine (His132) are white; Leu, Ile, and Val are yellow; and Phe and Tyr are gray. Ala residues are white in panel B, but are yellow in panel C. Cys and Trp do not have significant exposure at the surface of L2 and were left white.
Our objectives were to map the surface of the L2 domain and its prosthetic group to determine surface features that are important for binding of PDP1 and PDP1c. Because the lipoyl prosthetic group is required for binding (33), a large number of residues at the lipoylated end of the domain as well as structure within the prosthetic group were investigated. One goal was to detect acidic residues that may directly contribute to Ca2+-dependent binding. Another goal was to detect structural features of the L2 domain that contribute to the highly preferential binding of PDP1 to the L2 domain rather than the closely related L1 domain. The L3 domain, which is less closely related, is completely ineffective in inhibiting E2 activation or in binding PDP1 when gel-anchored GST-L3 was tested (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows the aligned sequence of these domains and places in bold putative residues that might contribute to distinguishing the L1 and L2 domains. Mutations have been investigated at all those sites. Finally, we have sought to determine whether there were differences in the profiles of mutant-induced changes in L2 binding to holo-PDP1 as compared with just the catalytic subunit, PDP1c. Differences suggest that the 96-kDa PDP1r either contributes to specific binding or alters the conformation of PDP1c to affect its binding to L2.

A star is placed over the lipoylated lysine in each of the lipoyl domain sequences. Residues shown as bold characters indicate positions at which the L2 domain differs significantly from the closely related L1 domain; those positions have been mutated. The C-terminal segments are underlined.
Comparison of Inhibition of PDP1 and PDP1c by Wild-type L2-- As indicated in the Introduction, PDP1 and PDP1c bind the L2 domain of E2 in a Ca2+-dependent association that greatly increases phosphatase activity. Competitive binding of the free L2 domain to PDP1 reduces phosphatase activity by preventing PDP1 binding to the L2 domain of the E2 component, which also anchors the phosphorylated E1 substrate (33). Fig. 3 compares the capacity of increasing concentrations of the wild-type L2 domain to prevent E2-activation of PDP1 and PDP1c activity. As was previously described (33), the data in Fig. 3 were fit by a curve developed by iterative fitting with variation in the relative ratio of binding dissociation constants for E2 subunits versus free L2 along with variation in Vmin = maximally inhibited rate when PDP is all bound to L2. Vmin was estimated as 9% Vmax, which indicates that the maximal inhibition of E2-activated PDP1 activity is projected to be 91%. Half of this maximal inhibition was realized at 4.5  plus or minus  0.2  microM L2 (Fig. 3). This value is higher than the value reported previously (33), in part, because the method for measuring the protein concentration of purified L2 (A280 nm rather than the BCA assay) gives 1.5-fold higher levels. However, we have observed nearly a 2-fold variation in the concentration giving half-maximal inhibition (3-6  microM) primarily caused by variation in the phosphorylated PDC substrate (the phosphorylated PDC used for the experiment shown in Fig. 4 gave a higher value). Half of the estimated maximal inhibition (85%, Vmin = 15% Vmax) of E2-activated PDP1c activity was reached at a somewhat higher L2 level of 8.4  plus or minus  0.3  microM. Again in separate experiments with different phosphorylated PDC, this value ranged from 6 to 11  microM. Although the concentrations giving half of the maximal inhibitions of PDP1 and PDP1c have varied with different phosphorylated PDC preparations, the trend comparing PDP1 and PDP1c of higher L2 being required to give half-maximal inhibition of PDP1c and a lesser maximal inhibition of PDP1c were repeatedly observed. The greater inhibition of PDP1 is consistent with competitively hindering a greater activation by E2-E3BP of ~10-fold with PDP1 activity (23, 33, 34) but only ~6-fold with PDP1c (28).2 Indeed, the extrapolated PDP1 or PDP1c Vmin rates appear to be nearly equivalent to activities that have been observed in assays of PDP1 (33) or PDP1c using the same level of phosphorylated E1 in the absence of E2.
View larger version (13K):    Fig. 3.   Decrease in E2 activation of PDP1 and PDP1c with increasing L2 concentration. PDP1 and PDP1c assays were conducted and data fit as described under "Experimental Procedures." Using the fitting procedure described under "Experimental Procedures," the data for PDP1 were fit (lines shown) best with r = 0.7 and Vmin = 9% Vmax and the best fit of the data with PDP1c was with r = 1.3 and Vmin = 15% Vmax. The 100% activity was 620 nmol min1 mg1 for PDP1 and 1500 nmol min1 mg1 for PDP1c.
View larger version (14K):    Fig. 4.   Inhibition of E2 activation by L2 and T143A-L2. PDP1 assays were conducted as described under "Experimental Procedures." For wild type L2, these data were fit best with r = 0.8 and Vmin = 9% and for T143A-L2 by r = 0.5 and Vmin = 7%.
Effects of Mutant and Modified L2 in the Region near the Lipoyl Group-- All the mutant L2 tested at the lipoylated end of the L2 domain were well behaved, and only L140A-L2 had a midpoint transition temperature for thermal melting (Tm value) below 63  degrees C (38). Even that construct was well lipoylated, gave a single band in native gel electrophoresis with a rate of migration that was the same as wild type L2, and gave a single reversible transition (Tm = 56  degrees C) under conditions of thermal unfolding (38).
Several of these substitutions located in L2 at or near the site of lipoylation led to substantial changes (mostly decreases) in the capacity of free L2 structures to compete with the L2 domains of the E2 60-mer to, thereby, hinder E2 activation of PDP1 or PDP1c activity. Table I presents data comparing this capacity for 6 or 12  microM wild-type or mutant L2 which have modifications introduced in the lipoylated end of L2. Not only did prevention of lipoylation by the K173A mutation greatly hinder PDP1 binding to L2 but substitution of both residues flanking the lipoylation site, D172N and A174S mutations, greatly reduced competitive binding to PDP1 or PDP1c by those well lipoylated L2 mutants (38). However, the A174S mutation was significantly more effective in blocking activation of PDP1 than PDP1c. Alanine substitution for Leu140, which is located in the E1-specificity loop, blocked binding to PDP1 and PDP1c. This exposed hydrophobic side chain probably makes a significant direct contribution to PDP1 binding. The large effect suggests that replacement of Leu140 with alanine might also alter the capacity of neighboring residues to productively interact with PDP. However, alanine substitution for the adjacent Ser141 in the center of the E1-specificity loop did not change L2 binding to PDP1. In the opposite direction to these findings, the S141A mutation had a marked effect on the rate of E1 catalyzed acetylation of L2 (96% reduction at 20 and 50  microM S141A-L2), whereas the L140A mutation had only a modest effect on E1 activity (38).
                              View this table:    Table I Percentage of inhibition of E2-activated PDP1 and PDP1c activity by native and mutated L2 for mutations introduced near the lipoylated end of L2 domain Assays were conducted and deviations of individual phosphatase activities were as described under "Experimental Procedures." The data for L2 construct effects on PDP1 or PDP1c are from a series of experiments; values are a ratio of the observed percentage of inhibition determined to the percentage of inhibition of wild type L2 in that experiment times the average value for wild type L2 shown here for PDP1 or PDP1c. For the data incorporated in this table, wild type L2 reduced E2-activation of PDP1 by 45-56% at 6  microM L2 from 65-71% at 12  microM L2. Similar variation occurred with the normalized data for PDP1c. Values were rounded to the nearest percentage except when the value shown was within 0.05% of a 0.5% increment.
Although most consequential substitutions in L2 reduced the level of inhibition of E2 activation of PDP1, two mutant L2, T143A and R196Q, repeatedly gave enhanced potencies relative to native L2 in reducing E2 activation, suggesting that these substitutions produced domains with an increased affinity for PDP1. Thr143 is located in the specificity loop in a forward position next to the tight  turn that is appended at its end with the lysyl-lipoyl prosthetic group. This mutant L2 was similarly effective in decreasing E2 enhancement of the activity of PDP1c (Table I). The concentration dependence shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that this reflects a stronger affinity of T143A-L2 than wild type L2 for PDP1 with little or no change in the maximal inhibition. Similar results were obtained with PDP1c (data not shown).
Equivalent effects with PDP1 and PDP1c were not found with the L2 construct in which glutamine was substituted for Arg196, a prominent residue extending forward on the hydrophobic side of the lipoyl domain. Repeated experiments (including an assay set that evaluated PDP1 and PDP1c simultaneously) supported a slightly enhanced capacity of R196Q-L2 to lessen E2 activation of PDP1 activity while exhibiting a somewhat reduced capacity for limiting activation of PDP1c by E2. Because both the A174S and R196Q mutants affected E2 activation of PDP1 and PDP1c differently, this suggests that PDP1r subunit influences PDP1 binding to L2; further support of this trend is provided below.
Substitution of alanine for Asp197, which is adjacent to Arg196, had little effect on PDP1 binding to L2, whereas this substitution had a marked effect in reducing L2 activation of PDK3.3 Conversion of Thr145, which is located between Thr143 and Arg196, to alanine modestly diminished the capacity for competitively lowering E2 activation of PDP1 and PDP1c activity. Thr145 is replaced by a glutamine in the L1 domain and by a glutamate in the L3 domain, but the limited effect of the T145A mutation indicates that Thr145 makes no more than a minor contribution to the high binding specificity of the L2 domain.
Overall, this analysis of the amino acid residues located at the surface of the lipoylated end of L2 indicate that the conserved lipoyl-bearing turn and Leu140 specificity loop are particularly important contributors to the association of PDP1 and PDP1c with L2. Although playing a pivotal role, none of the critical residues are likely candidates for directly liganding to Ca2+ nor can they provide an explanation for the high binding specificity for L2 over the L1 domain.
Substitutions within the Lipoyl Prosthetic Group-- To determine what features are important within the lipoyl-lysine side chain, Lys173 was additionally replaced by Gln, Met, and Leu and the lipoyl group was replaced by lipoate analogs. Like the alanine substitution, the other amino acid substitutions for Lys173 greatly reduced or eliminated the capacity of L2 to bind PDP1 (Fig. 5). These results establish that the lipoyl-lysine makes a major contribution to this interaction that cannot be met by amino acid side chains that can engage in hydrophobic interactions (Met or Leu) or form H-bonds (Gln). Similarly nonlipoylated wild type L2 was incapable of binding to PDP1.
View larger version (44K):    Fig. 5.   Inhibition of PDP1 activity by L2 modified by mutation or lipoyl-group substitution at Lys173. E. coli lipoyl protein ligase was used to introduce into nonlipoylated L2 (nonlip.): lipoate (lip), 8-thiol-octanoate (8-SH), octanoate (oct.), or heptanoate (hept.), and the modified domains were then prepared free of nonlipoylated L2 using hydrophobic interaction chromatography as previously described (38). PDP1 activity was analyzed as described under "Experimental Procedures" using the indicated levels of the nonlipoylated, cofactor-modified, or Lys173 mutated L2.
As shown in Fig. 5, effective binding was maintained by L2 in which lipoate was substituted by 8-thiol-octanoate, octanoate, or heptanoate. Indeed, octanoyl-L2 appears to be as effective as L2 in which the lipoyl group was introduced by lipoyl protein ligase treatment. Octanoyl-L2 was similarly effective with PDP1c (data not shown). Apparently, the dithiolane ring of the lipoyl group is not particularly important, but the hydrocarbon character of the lipoate is crucial for maintaining binding, probably by directly interacting at a hydrophobic region of PDP1c structure. In contrast to this outcome, none of these modifications supported significant binding to E1 (38), and, whereas 8-thiol-octanoyl-L2 directly activates PDK3 very effectively, the octanoyl-L2 gives only a very small enhancement of PDK3 activity and heptanoyl-L2 gives no activation.3
Initial Screening of Mutations in the Opposite End of the L2 Domain-- We have also evaluated several prominent surface residues located in the end of the domain opposite from the site of lipoylation. These encompass not only residues in the folded portion of the domain but also residues in the extended terminal regions. The latter primarily involve the examination of residues in the larger C-terminal lobe but also include Tyr129 in the N-terminal segment. Biophysical studies and use in the E1 and E3 reactions of all the mutant L2 employed were previously described (38). Only two substitutions reduced Tm values for thermal unfolding below 61  degrees C. These included alanine substitution for Leu190, which has a well exposed side chain centered in the middle of the cluster of hydrophobic amino acids, and for Phe217 in the C-terminal tail. Both were well lipoylated and effectively used in the E1 reaction. Although those results support considerable retention of native structure, the L190A and F217A constructs, besides having reduced Tm values, had a tendency to form dimer aggregates in native gel electrophoresis. Based on these findings, it was suggested that reversible interaction of the C-terminal region and the hydrophobic face involve Phe217 interacting with Leu190 (38).
Among the mutated surface residues at this end of the domain, competitive binding was not significantly changed from that of wild type L2 with the Q134A, V156A, K188A, L190A, D219N, R221Q, and E224Q mutants (data not shown). Significant differences were observed for the mutations shown in Table II. A marked reduction in inhibiting PDP1 and PDP1c activation was observed with the E179A mutation. Reductions in PDP1 activation were also observed with the Y129A, Q181A, and D213N mutants and to a smaller extent with E162A and Y220A mutations. The reproducible effects of the C-terminal D213N and Y220A and N-terminal Y129A mutants on PDP1 were not detected with PDP1c. This adds further support to differences in the binding of PDP1 and PDP1c. Given the tendency of F217A-L2 to aggregate, the modest reduction with this modification in the C terminus cannot be considered conclusive, even though it was observed with PDP1 and PDP1c. However, the L190A mutation, which had a tendency to form dimer aggregates (38) similar to that of the F217A mutant, retained native L2 capacity to bind PDP1. Overall, these data suggest that the C- and N-terminal lobes make a greater contribution to the Ca2+-aided binding when PDP1r is associated with PDP1c. The data also indicate that Glu179 makes a significant contribution in L2 binding to PDP1 or PDP1c.
                              View this table:    Table II Percentage of inhibition of E2-activated PDP1 and PDP1c activity by native and mutated L2 for mutants introduced into L2 at the back half of the domain from lipoylated Lys173 Assays were conducted as described under "Experimental Procedures." The deviations and normalization adjustments in combining data from different experiments for PDP1 and for PDP1c in this table were made as described in Table I.
Selection and Properties of Additional L2 Mutants-- The above screening did not detect a set of residues, most likely acidic residues, that are candidates for making an essential contribution to binding Ca2+, nor did it clarify the definitive preference of PDP1 to bind to L2 rather than to the L1 domain of E2. Glu179 is located in a cluster of acidic residues that includes not only Glu162 but also glutamate residues at positions 182, 183, 209, and 211. All these Glu residues except Glu183, which has the least exposed side chain in the NMR structure (41), were converted to alanine. Glu209 and Glu211 were of particular interest both because they are near Asp213 for which alanine substitution caused some reduction in inhibitory binding (Table II) but also because the aligned sequence of the L1 domain does not have acidic residues at these positions (Fig. 2). To further assess the importance of Glu179, it was converted to Gln and Glu182 was also converted to Gln based on results below. Because alanine substitution of Tyr129 in the N terminus reduced E2 activation of PDP1 and a leucine residue is located at this position in the L1 domain, a Y129L mutant was made. Finally, with a greater focus on this area around Glu179-Glu182 and to sort what distinguishes the structure of the L2 domain from the L1 domain, Val180-Gln181 was replaced by Ser-Leu, which is found at the aligned positions also located between two glutamates in the L1 domain. This double substitution results in a reversal from a hydrophobic residue followed by a hydrophilic one to the opposite order. Amino acid residues 179-181 are in a -strand in L2, with the hydrophobic Val180 side chain facing into the interior of the domain and Gln181 projecting out from the surface (Fig. 1). With the change in polarity with the introduction of the Ser-Leu sequence, it is unlikely that there is a reversal in the positioning of those side chains in the -strand because of the need to maintain exposure of Glu179 in L2 or the aligned Glu52 in L1; each was shown to be an important specificity residue for the E1 reaction (38).
All these mutant L2 were used in the E3 reaction at the same rate as fully lipoylated wild-type L2, establishing full lipoylation. The E1 reaction was evaluated in the near-Km range of E1 for wild type L2. As expected, the conversion of Glu179 to glutamine greatly reduced the use of L2 as a substrate in the E1 reaction (Fig. 6). With the Glu182 mutants, the E1 reaction was slowed on average by 58% with E182A-L2 and by 63% with E182Q-L2 (Fig. 6). Surprisingly, the V180S/Q181L mutant was a somewhat improved E1 substrate, giving 22% higher rates at both concentrations. This indicates that the key specificity residue Glu179 (38) is still interacting well with E1. Also supporting that conclusion, each of these mutant L2 gave a single tight band in native gel electrophoresis with an expected (small) decreases in mobilities (38) for those mutants in which a negative charge was removed (data not shown). Only trace levels of nonlipoylated (slower moving) bands (38, 39) were detected in native gel electrophoresis.
View larger version (21K):    Fig. 6.   Use of new mutants in the E1 reaction. The initial rates of the E1 reaction were measured using 0.05  microg of human E1 and the indicated level of L2 construct with the reaction initiated with 120  microM [2-C14]pyruvate under conditions previously described (38, 39). The assay mixture also contained 0.2 mM thiamine pyrophosphate, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Average values and standard deviations are shown.
The base line-corrected DSC profiles for thermal unfolding of all these mutants gave single (bell-shaped) melting transitions that were reversible in repeated folding and unfolding cycles (data not shown). Table III shows the Tm and the H and S differences between the folded and unfolded states for these mutants. Like the E162A-L2 mutant (38), the conversion of the neighboring Glu182 to either alanine or glutamine raised the Tm and additionally caused a significant increase in H. This higher stability of the E182A and E182Q mutants can be largely explained by the resulting reduction of electrostatic repulsion with neighboring acidic residues (particularly to Glu162 and Glu183, but also with Glu179), which would be expected to stabilize folding. The decrease in the entropy difference between the folded and unfolded E179Q mutant domain versus that observed with native L2 is consistent with greater freedom of movement in the cluster of acidic side chains in the folded domain as was also observed with the E179A mutant (38). However, this was not observed with the Glu182 mutations (Table III); indeed, with E182Q, a significant increase in entropy is indicated. Glu182 is closely surrounded by Glu162, Gln181, and Glu183 based on the NMR-derived L2 structure (41), and the neutralization resulting from the E182Q mutation may introduce greater local order with the removal of electrostatic repulsion. Even with the double mutation (V180S/Q181L), there was only a 2.8  degrees C decrease in Tm to 64.6  degrees C and an insignificant change from wild type L2 in the entropy difference between the folded and unfolded states. Finally, the Y129A mutation produced a less stable domain with a gain in entropy in the folded domain, suggesting increased flexibility of the N-terminal segment (38). In contrast, the Y129L mutant has thermal melting properties very close to native L2, the hydrophobic character of the Tyr129 is apparently important for local interactions that limit movement of the N-terminal segment.
                              View this table:    Table III Tm and H values for the thermal unfolding of mutant L2 domain structures Values were determined from the DSC scans of the mutant domains. Tm values are the transition mid-point temperatures. H values were determined by fitting the data from the first scan of each mutant L2 domain into the two-state model using the Origin software. Base-line corrections were made using a smooth transition between the pre- and post-melting transition base lines.
Capacity of the Additional Mutant L2 to Inhibit PDP1 and PDP1c Activation by E2-- Table IV shows the effects of these new mutant L2. Conversion of Glu179 to glutamine still reduced competitive binding of PDP1 and PDP1c but did not appear to be as potent as the E179A modification (Table II). That was confirmed by a direct comparison of these two substitutions in the same assay set with PDP1 and PDP1c that evaluated higher levels of lipoyl domains. The increase in inhibition of PDP1 for a change from 6 to 18  microM lipoyl domain was from 10 to 33% for E179A but from 26 to 53% for E179Q (from 51 to 73% for wild type L2). The corresponding increase in inhibition of activation of PDP1c was from 6 to 19% for E179A but from 18 to 41% for E179Q (from 40 to 67% for wild type L2). Thus, the polarized amide group with glutamine substituted yields a mutant L2 that binds with ~3-fold weaker affinity than wild type L2 and the alanine substitution effects nearly another 3-fold decrease in affinity. These results are consistent with the possibility that the amide oxygen of the glutamine side chain via its negative dipole could contribute to a weaker interaction than the native glutamate with a positively charged region of PDP1c.
                              View this table:    Table IV Percentage of inhibition of E2-activated PDP1 and PDP1c activity by native and additional mutated L2 structures Assays were conducted as described under "Experimental Procedures."
Conversion of Glu182 to alanine almost completely prevented competitive binding of this mutant L2 to PDP1 or PDP1c (Table IV), with little or no inhibition gained even at concentrations of E182A-L2 as high as 42  microM (Fig. 7). This was the strongest effect of any mutation outside the tight -turn holding the lipoyl group. Unlike the situation with Glu179, conversion of Glu182 to a glutamine did not restore discernible binding to PDP1 or PDP1c (Table IV) even with levels as high as 42  microM E182Q-L2 (Fig. 7). Thus, Glu182 appears to be a particularly critical residue and is a candidate residue for participating in a PDP1c-Ca2+-L2 bridge by directly liganding to Ca2+.
View larger version (22K):    Fig. 7.   Comparison of effects of E182A and E182Q L2 mutants on E2 activated activity of PDP1 (panel A) and PDP1c (panel B). PDP1 and PDP1c assays were conducted as described under "Experimental Procedures."
Although of Glu209 is located nearby in a region behind Glu182 and is not found in L1, conversion of Glu209 to alanine did not decrease competitive binding to PDP1 and may have slightly enhanced binding to PDP1c at 12  microM (Table IV). Conversion of Glu211 to alanine, like the mutation of the neighboring Asp213 (Table II), caused some reduction in binding to PDP1. Again, this position differs in L1 (Glu211 aligns with Gly82; Fig. 2). Although the combination of Glu211 and the conserved Asp213 might contribute to specific PDP1 binding to L2, the selective substitution of these residues had modest impacts; furthermore, the D213N mutant was not very effective in inhibiting E2 activation of PDP1c. Conversion of Tyr129 to leucine as found in L1 gave results significantly different from the Y129A mutation in retaining excellent competitive binding to PDP1 and PDP1c (Table IV). With the Y129A mutant, increased flexibility of the N-terminal segment (see DSC consideration above) may somehow interfere with lipoyl domain binding to PDP1.
Although glutamate is maintained in the L1 domain at the aligned positions for residues 179 and 182 of L2, the intervening residues are quite distinct as emphasized above. The V180S/Q181L mutation to make L2 more like L1 substantially reduced competitive binding of L2 to PDP1, and this change was extremely potent in preventing binding to PDP1c (Table IV). We would note that the single site Q181A mutation had a significant but substantially smaller effect (Table II) in reducing competitive binding so that removal of critical H-bonding is insufficient for explaining the large effect of the double mutation. The dual mutation had only a favorable effect on the E1 reaction for which Glu179; the aligned residue (Glu52) in L1 is also critically important for the E1 reaction (38). Because Glu182 is clearly very important for PDP1 and PDP1c binding by L2, the combination of results suggests that the preceding Val-Gln provides structure that helps to properly position Glu182 to participate effectively in the binding of PDP1c.
Limiting Ca2+-- The above studies were conducted at saturating Ca2+. The effects of wild type L2 and two mutant L2 (E179A and A174S) that gave strong but only partial inhibition of PDP1c4 were compared at saturating and limiting Ca2+. E2-activated PDP1c activity was 64% of that at saturating Ca2+ with 3.8  microM Ca2+. The fractional inhibition at both 3.8  microM Ca2+ and saturating Ca2+ levels was ~60% by 18  microM wild type L2. 18  microM E179A-L2 caused ~18% inhibition at saturating and 14% inhibition at 3.8  microM Ca2+, respectively. Thus, the effectiveness relative to wild type L2 of competition by E179A-L2 in reducing E2 activation of PDP1c was not significantly reduced at the lower level of Ca2+. At the lipoylated end of the domain, the same relative decrease in PDP1c activation by 18  microM A174S-L2 mutation (30%) versus wild type (60%) was observed with saturating or limiting Ca2+. Overall these data indicate that, once formed, the complexes of PDP1c with E179A-L2 or A174S-L2 retain a high affinity for Ca2+. Thus, these mutations at consequential but secondary sites in the regions of L2 that play decisive roles in complex formation do not directly affect Ca2+ binding. Nonetheless, these data do not eliminate the possibility that Glu182 contributes directly or indirectly to the high affinity of the L2-PDP1c complex for Ca2+, an interest that could not be similarly investigated because high levels of L2 mutants substituted at Glu182 gave little, if any, inhibition. The results below indicate that this was because of complete removal or extraordinarily weak binding to PDP1c.
Requirement for Two Binding Regions in L2-- As described elsewhere,2 analytical ultracentrifuge studies detected binding of L2 to PDP1c at high concentrations only in the presence of free Ca2+ and a signal for Ca2+ binding was detected only for the combination of L2 and PDP1c in ITC experiments. These findings suggested the possibility that weaker Ca2+-dependent binding by nonlipoylated or Glu182-modified L2 might be observed by ITC. That would allow the interactions of the two regions of L2 to be independently analyzed and the importance of Glu182 in Ca2+-dependent binding to be evaluated. However, using much higher levels of PDP1c (20  microM) with 40  microM either K173A-L2 or E182A-L2, no detectable Ca2+ binding was observed in ITC studies. These data further support the critical contribution of the combination of the two binding regions for Ca2+-dependent L2-PDP1c complex formation; however, these findings limit approaches that can be used for independently dissecting the roles of the two regions of L2 in binding PDP1 or PDP1c.
Overview-- Fig. 8 shows the location of the residues whose modification significantly altered binding of the L2 domain with PDP1. Our results indicate that there are two major regions of interaction within the L2 domain. The first region includes the lipoyl prosthetic group and neighboring residues. Substitution of the adjacent residues, D172N and A174A, greatly hindered binding as does the L140A substitution in the E1-specificity loop. T143A substitution in the E1-specificity loop enhanced L2 binding to PDP1 and PDP1c. Based on effective binding by octanoyl-L2 but not by several Lys173-substituted or nonlipoylated L2, the lipoyl cofactor probably interacts at an extended hydrophobic pocket in the surface structure of PDP1c. In contrast, the dithiolane ring character of the lipoyl prosthetic group is decisive for L2 binding to E1 (38) and 8-thiol is crucial for L2 activation of PDK3.3 We suggest that the interactions of PDP1 at the lipoylated end of the L2 domain make a significant contribution to binding affinity but do not contribute to lipoyl domain specificity.
View larger version (74K):    Fig. 8.   Key residues of L2 for Ca2+-dependent binding to PDP1 and PDP1c. Most of the C-terminal lobe of the L2 structure has been deleted. The red label indicates a gain rather than a loss in binding affinity upon mutation.
The second region involves interactions at the other end of the L2 domain. The large effect of mutations of Glu182 in hindering binding of PDP1 and PDP1c to the L2 domain suggests that this acidic residue performs a key role in binding. As can be seen in Fig. 8, a distinct pocket exists in the center of the fully protruding Glu182, Gln181, Glu179, and Glu162 side chains; binding interactions that remove the mutual repulsion by the three acidic residues should be favored. Because mutation of all these residues hindered L2 binding to PDP1, an appealing prospect is that these form a strong electrostatic interaction with a positively charged regions of PDP1c. An aspect of this might directly involve Ca2+ binding particularly to Glu182. However, the finding that the E179A mutation fails to have a greater impact in restricting competitive binding in the presence of limiting Ca2+ makes this possibility less likely. Although our results support the critical importance of Glu182, only a complete three-dimensional structure can establish how these proteins interact. Further, isolation of binding regions by indirect approaches will be difficult to obtain because weak binding to PDP1c was not detected in biophysical studies performed on either nonlipoylated or Glu182 mutated L2 even in the presence of Ca2+.
Toward understanding the high specificity of PDP1 for the L2 domain, we expressly eliminated or found minimal contributions of several residues that differ in the L2 domain from the aligned residues in the L1 domain. However, the conversion of the residues preceding Glu182 from Val-Gln sequence to the Ser-Leu sequence found in L1 substantially reduced binding of PDP1 to L2. A logical explanation is that the native Ser-Leu residues of L1 do not allow the corresponding Glu55 side chain to be properly positioned for abetting binding of L1 to PDP1. The positioning of Glu179 may also be slightly altered by the Ser-Leu substitution, but there was no unfavorable impact on the E1 reaction resulting from any change in positioning of this key residue for the E1 reaction and for PDK3 activation, which was also well maintained.3
For the most part, PDP1 and PDP1c binding to the L2 domain were altered in a similar manner by the same modifications of the L2 structure, but five single site mutants (A174S and R196Q at the lipoylated end of L2, D213N and Y220A in the C-terminal lobe, and Y129A in the N-terminal segment) had greater effects with PDP1 than PDP1c in removing their influence on E2-activated phosphatase activity. Among these, the most pronounced differences between PDP1 and PDP1c binding were observed with A174S. The A174S mutation rendered binding to PDP1 almost undetectable while only reducing inhibition of PDP1c to roughly half that of wild type L2. This mutant L2 is well lipoylated and a fairly good E1 substrate (60% of wild type L2). Upon substitution of the buried Ala174 side chain, which faces the E1-specificity loop, the hydroxyl group of serine may amend allowed conformations of that somewhat flexible outer structure (41). Whatever the change, the interaction with PDP1 is much more sensitive than PDP1c, indicating that the presence of the PDP1r subunit of PDP1 places a demand for a more precise interaction. In the opposite direction to the above single site mutations, the V180S/Q181L mutant had a potent effect in eliminating detectable binding with PDP1c but not as strong a reduction with PDP1. This indicates either that, without PDP1r, PDP1c requires more structural precision at this end of the domain or that additional binding interactions resulting from the presence of PDP1r in PDP1 compensate to some extent for the loss of interactions because of the small but pivotal conformational adjustments elicited by the double mutation.
A sequence firmly supporting a Ca2+-binding EF-hand is not apparent in either PDP1c or L2. One distantly related acidic region mutated in PDP1c interfered with Ca2+-dependent binding (42). However, the local sequence, including the mutated residue, is conserved in the PDP2 isoform, although the activity of PDP2 is not influenced by Ca2+ (20). Thus, PDP1c-L2 complex formation creates a tight site for binding Ca2+ that probably does not involve an EF-hand. Because binding to PDP1 engages and requires domain-aided hydrophobic binding by the exterior lipoyl group at one end of L2 and electrostatic binding by the opposite end of the L2 domain, it seems likely that these essential regions of L2 act with a coordinated purpose. An appealing prospect is that these two interactions foster and stabilize a conformational change in PDP1c that produces a Ca2+ binding site. Expending binding energy by inducing such a change would explain why such an extensive interaction surface of the L2 domain is needed to effect a net affinity that is only at the micromolar level. Further insight into the constitution of the Ca2+-dependent complexes formed between L2 and PDP1 or PDP1c will require detailed structures that will probably depend on crystallizing these complexes.

2 ITC studies indicate that neither PDP1c nor L2, alone, directly interact with  < 100  microM Ca2+ and ITC, analytical ultracentrifugation, and other studies indicate L2 and PDP1c bind each in forming a tight Ca2+ binding site (Kd  <  3  microM); similar complex formation by PDP1 is enhanced by Mg2+ (A. Turkan, Y. Hiromasa, and T. E. Roche, manuscript in preparation). Portions of these studies have been described elsewhere (11).

4 The equivalent comparison could not be performed with PDP1 because the A174S mutation had much larger effects in removing competitive binding to PDP1 (Table I). Other mutations at the lipoylated end of L2 either had too great an effect on binding (various Lys173, D172A, and L140A mutants) or too small an effect to make similar comparisons.
