   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   The nuclear receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4 is involved in a transcriptional network and plays an important role in pancreatic ss-cells. Mutations in the HNF4 gene are correlated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young 1. HNF4 isoforms result from both alternative splicing and alternate usage of promoters P1 and P2. It has recently been reported that HNF4 transcription is driven almost exclusively by the P2 promoter in pancreatic islets. We observed that transcripts from both P1 and P2 promoters were expressed in human pancreatic ss-cells and in the pancreatic ss-cell lines RIN m5F and HIT-T15. Expression of HNF4 proteins originating from the P1 promoter was confirmed by immunodetection. Due to the presence of the activation function module AF-1, HNF4 isoforms originating from the P1 promoter exhibit stronger transcriptional activities and recruit coactivators more efficiently than isoforms driven by the P2 promoter. Conversely, activities of isoforms produced by both promoters were similarly repressed by the corepressor small heterodimer partner. These behaviors were observed on the promoter of HNF1 that is required for ss-cell function. Our results highlight that expression of P1 promoter-driven isoforms is important in the control of pancreatic ss-cell function.
   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   HEPATOCYTE NUCLEAR FACTOR (HNF) 4 is an orphan nuclear receptor (nuclear receptor 2A1, NR2A1) that activates the expression of genes involved in the transport and metabolism of many nutrients including lipids and glucose (1, 2). HNF4 is required for normal hepatic function (3). It also plays an important role in pancreatic ss-cells: HNF4 directly activates the insulin gene promoter (4) and is required for glucose-induced insulin secretion (5). Mutations in HNF4 gene are correlated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young 1, characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, early onset (usually before the age of 25 yr), and impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion due to dysfunction of pancreatic ss-cells (6). HNF4 is involved, together with other transcription factors including HNF1, in a complex transcription factor network that is thought to be crucial for the function of pancreatic ss-cells (7, 8, 9).
In mammals, HNF4 is encoded by two different genes: HNF4 and HNF4 (10). The HNF4 gene potentially encodes nine distinct isoforms. Their structure and nomenclature are presented in Ref. 1 . HNF4 isoforms result from both alternate promoter usage and alternative splicing. As shown in Fig. 1A, promoter P1 initiates transcripts that contain exon 1A (isoforms 1 to 6), whereas promoter P2 initiates transcripts that contain exon 1D (isoforms 7 to 9; Refs. 11 and 12). Isoforms 2 and 8 are the alternatively spliced variants of isoforms 1 and 7, respectively. They contain a 30-bp insert in their 3' sequence (Fig. 1, A and B). Compared with these four isoforms, isoforms 3 and 9, which have a completely different 3' sequence, are much less expressed, whereas isoforms 4 to 6 are very poorly expressed or have not yet been identified in vivo (1, 13). The expression of HNF4 isoforms varies with development, differentiation, and tissue origin (1, 14, 15, 16). The expression of HNF4 mainly initiates at the P1 promoter in adult liver and kidney (15). Recently, two different groups documented the expression of transcripts of the P2 promoter in insulinoma INS-1 cells, as well as in mouse and human pancreatic islets, but did not detect transcripts of the P1 promoter, leading to the conclusion that HNF4 transcription is driven almost exclusively by the P2 promoter in the endocrine pancreas (11, 12, 17). Strongly contrasting with these data, we observed that HNF4 transcripts initiated at the P1 promoter are substantially expressed, alongside P2 promoter transcripts, in human pancreatic ss-cells and in the rodent pancreatic ss-cell lines RIN m5F and HIT-T15. Only HNF4 isoforms initiated at the P1 promoter contain the activation function module AF-1, which is encoded by exon 1A. The AF-1 plays a key role in HNF4 transcriptional potential and in the recruitment of coactivators that are essential for HNF4 function (18, 19, 20). We show that lack of the AF-1 in HNF4 isoforms initiated at the P2 promoter markedly decreases both the transcriptional potential and interaction with several coactivators. Conversely, lack of the AF-1 does not affect the repression of HNF4 activity by small heterodimer partner (SHP). This finding highlights the functional consequences of expression of the HNF4 P1 promoter transcripts in pancreatic ss-cells.

     Materials and Methods Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   Insulinoma cell lines Cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). RIN m5F cells of rat origin (ATCC CRL-2058) were grown as described in Ref. 21 . HIT-T15 cells of hamster origin (ATCC CRL-1777) were grown as described in Ref. 22 .
Human pancreas processing Human pancreases (n = 5) were harvested from adult brain-dead donors in accord with French Regulations and with the local Institutional Ethical Committee. Pancreatic islets were isolated after ductal distension of the pancreas and digestion of the tissue with liberase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) as described in Ref. 23 . Exocrine fraction was obtained as described in Ref. 24 .
Islet enrichment and single ss-cell preparation Pancreatic islet-enriched fractions (purity 90  plus or minus  5%) were obtained from semipurified preparations by "handpicking" the dithizone-stained islets under a binocular microscope. Single ss-cell suspensions were obtained by gentle pipetting of islets for 4 to 6 min in an enzymatic dissociation buffer containing 3.6 g/liter papain (Splittix, Bio Media, Boussens, France). The reaction was stopped by 0.2 vol of the enzyme-inhibiting solution consisting of Splitstop (Bio Media) plus fetal calf serum (3/1 vol/vol, respectively), when about 80% of islet cells appeared as single cells. Cell sorting was then achieved as described in Ref. 25 .
Semiquantitative RT-PCR Total RNA was prepared using the Macherey Nagel (Duren, Germany) RNA extraction kit according to manufacturer s protocol. Reverse transcription and PCR were performed as described in Ref. 21 in conditions that were adjusted to maintain the amplification within the exponential range. Primers used for HNF4 transcripts are shown in Table 1, and primers for the coactivator peroxisome proliferator activated receptor coactivator (PGC)-1 transcripts have the following sequences: sense, 5'-gtggatgaagacggattgcc-3'; antisense, 5'-ttctagttgtctagagtcttgg-3'. PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gel, and band intensity was analyzed on a Kaiser camera equipped with the Gel Analyst 3.01 software (both provided by Vasse SARL, Templemars, France).

  Plasmid constructs Plasmid pcDNA3 human HNF42 was described in Ref. 26 . Plasmid pcDNA3 human HNF42 Y6D/F19D was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis from pcDNA3 human HNF42 F19D (20). The human HNF48 cDNA was obtained by PCR using human HNF42 cDNA as PCR matrix. The sense primer encompassed the sequence +1/+49 of exon 1D (11) and a sequence hybridizing to the first 23 nucleotides of exon 2, which is common to both 2 and 8 HNF4 isoforms. The antisense primer hybridized to sequence 1412 to 1433 of HNF42 cDNA, taking adenosine of the ATG codon of initiation methionine as position 1 (27). This cDNA was introduced in the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 to generate the expression plasmid pcDNA3 human HNF48. Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The human HNF1 promoter cloned in pGL3 was a gift from Dr. G. Bell (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chicago, IL). Plasmids expressing the fusion proteins glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-PGC-1 (36 to 797), GST-p300 (340 to 528), GST-glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein (GRIP)-1(1122 to 1462), and GST-full-length SHP were gifts from Drs. Spiegelman (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), Grossman (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), Stallcup (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA), and Gustafsson (Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden), respectively. The expression plasmids pCMVss-NHA p300, its pCMVss control vector, and pSG5 SHP were gifts from Drs. Grossman and Gustafsson, respectively.
EMSAs When used for control of specificity, HNF42 and -8 were synthesized in vitro as described in Ref. 26 . EMSAs were performed as described in Ref. 28 using the 32P-labeled HNF4 response element of the HNF1 promoter and either in vitro-synthesized proteins or nuclear extracts of HIT-T15 and HepG2 cells prepared as described in Ref. 28 . Supershifts were performed by incubating proteins with either the 455 antiserum (1) or the H4/55 monoclonal antibody (15) before addition of the labeled probe.
Transient transfections RIN m5F cells were transiently transfected with the LipofectAmine reagent (3  microl/ microg of DNA) according to Invitrogen (SARL, Cergy Pontoise, France) recommendations. HIT-T15 and HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the polyethylenimine reagent (4  microl/ microg of DNA) according to Euromedex (Souffelweyersheim, France) recommendations. Normalization for differences in transfection efficiencies was performed as previously described using either the Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid in RIN m5F and HeLa cells (29) or the ss-galactosidase reporter plasmid in HIT-T15 cells (30). Luciferase assays were performed with the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) for RIN m5F and HeLa cells and as described in Ref. 20 for HIT-T15 cells. Statistical analysis was performed using Student s t test for unpaired data using the Prism software (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA).
Western blot analysis Western assays were performed as described in Ref. 26 and revealed with the 455 antiserum (1).
In vitro protein-protein interaction assays GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (26) using 35S-methionine-labeled in vitro-synthesized HNF4 and bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins. Interactions were quantified using the ImageQuant software on a PhosphorImager apparatus (both from Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).
   Results Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   Transcripts initiated at the P1 HNF4 promoter are readily expressed in human pancreatic ss-cells Figure 1A depicts a schematic representation of HNF4 gene with P1 and P2 promoters. Expression of P1 and P2 promoter transcripts was analyzed by RT-PCR. Promoter P2 transcripts were selectively amplified with a sense primer hybridizing to exon 1D and an antisense primer hybridizing to exon 5 (primers d and b in Fig. 1, A and B, and Table 1). Transcripts from promoter P1 were selectively amplified with the sense primer a hybridizing with exon 1A and primer b (Fig. 1, A and B, and Table 1). As expected from data obtained with pancreatic islets and INS-1 cells (11, 12, 17), we detected transcripts from promoter P2 in human islets, isolated human pancreatic ss-cells, and RIN m5F and HIT-T15 insulinoma cells (Fig. 1C). In exocrine pancreas, the band corresponding to promoter P2 transcripts was barely detectable (Fig. 1C, lane 4), although the band of ss-actin had an intensity similar to that obtained from endocrine cells (Fig. 1G). Interestingly, promoter P1 transcripts from human islets and isolated human pancreatic ss-cells yielded highly visible bands, indicating that HNF4 promoter P1 transcripts are substantially expressed in human endocrine pancreas (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Reproducible data were obtained from five different donors. Similar results were obtained with RIN m5F and HIT-T15 RNA (Fig. 1D, lanes 5 and 6). Again, in human exocrine pancreas, promoter P1 transcripts were expressed at very low levels (Fig. 1D, lane 4). Two other groups did not detect P1 promoter transcripts in pancreatic islets and INS-1 cells (11, 12, 17), but the following controls confirmed the accuracy of our results showing expression of the P1 promoter transcripts. First, we checked the specificity of amplification of P1 promoter transcripts with the a+b primer set: cloned HNF42 yielded a highly visible band, but no band could be detected with cloned HNF48 (Fig. 1H, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). Second, using cloned HNF42 and HNF48, we verified that primer sets a+b and d+b exhibited similar amplification efficiency (data not shown). Third, using human pancreatic islets, we made sure that the band obtained for P1 transcripts did not result from a genomic or plasmidic contamination during RNA isolation or reverse transcription: no amplicon could be detected when the step of reverse transcription of RNAs was performed in the absence of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Fig. 1I). Conversely, use of another set of primers (h and g), designed to specifically amplify exon 1A and 2, yielded with RNAs from human islets a band that was not obtained when reverse transcription was omitted (Fig. 1J), thus confirming that transcripts of the HNF4 P1 promoter are readily expressed in endocrine pancreas.
Human pancreatic ss-cells express HNF4 isoforms 1, 2, 7, 8, and HNF4 HNF4 transcripts from promoter P1 mainly represent isoforms 1 and 2, and transcripts from promoter P2 mainly represent isoforms 7 and 8, because we determined that very low levels of isoforms 3 to 6 and 9 were expressed in the cells tested. Indeed, when using primers that specifically amplify isoforms 3 + 6 + 9 or isoforms 4 + 5 + 6 (couples of primers P6 + P7 and P9 + P10, respectively, described in Ref. 14), only very faint bands could be detected (data not shown). In addition, when analyzing transcripts from the P1 promoter, we failed to detect a band of 612 bp, the expected size of amplicons of transcripts containing exon 1B (Fig. 1D). This result confirms the very low, if any, expression of isoforms 4 to 6.
Because the insertion of 10 amino acid residues in the carboxy-terminal sequence of HNF42 was shown to facilitate recruitment of coactivators (31), we analyzed the expression of isoforms containing the 30-bp insert in ss-cells. Primers e and f, hybridizing to exons 9 and 10, respectively, were designed to amplify two fragments, the larger one containing the 30-bp insert of isoforms 2 and 8 (Fig. 1, A and B). The levels of expression of isoforms 2 and/or 8 were equivalent to those of isoforms 1 and/or 7 in human pancreatic islets and isolated human pancreatic ss-cells (Fig. 1E, lanes 2 and 3). Similar results were obtained with RIN m5F and HIT-T15 RNA (Fig. 1E, lanes 5 and 6).
Next we analyzed HNF4 expression using primers that specifically amplify the carboxy-terminal domain of this isoform (Table 1). Results presented in Fig. 1F show that HNF4 is well expressed in human pancreatic islets, isolated human pancreatic ss-cells, and RIN m5F and HIT-T15 cells but is poorly expressed in human exocrine pancreas.
Immunodetection of HNF4 proteins originated from the P1 promoter in pancreatic ss-cells To ascertain the expression of HNF4 proteins encoded by the P1 promoter transcripts containing exon 1A, we used the monoclonal antibody H4/55, which specifically recognizes the amino-terminal sequence of isoforms 1 and 2 but not isoforms 7 and 8 (15). Because this antibody is not suitable in Western blot assays (Ryffel, G. U., personal communication), HNF4 expression was studied in EMSA performed with the HNF4 response element of the HNF1 promoter (HNF1 probe). The specificity of the H4/55 monoclonal antibody was confirmed using in vitro-synthesized HNF42 and HNF48: it supershifted the complex formed with HNF42 but not that formed with HNF48 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 6). Conversely, complexes formed with both HNF4 isoforms could be supershifted by the 455 antiserum raised against their identical carboxy-terminal sequence (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 5). Nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells, which predominantly express HNF41 and 2, yielded a complex that could be supershifted by both the 455 antiserum and the H4/55 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 to 7). Pancreatic ss-cells express much lower amounts of HNF4 than HepG2 cells (32), which compelled us to use 4-fold higher amounts of HIT-T15 nuclear proteins than HepG2 nuclear proteins. This accounts for the unspecific background observed when analyzing the former material (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 to 4). Nevertheless, with HIT-T15 nuclear extracts, we could easily detect a retarded band (Fig. 2B, lane 1) corresponding to a complex mainly formed with HNF4: this complex exhibited the same electrophoretic mobility as that yielded by HNF4 proteins from HepG2 cells; it could be supershifted by the 455 antiserum (Fig. 2B, lane 2) but could not be obtained using a mutated HNF1 probe that is unable to bind HNF4 (data not shown). Addition of the H4/55 monoclonal antibody resulted in a concomitant decrease in the retarded band and formation of a strong supershifted band that could not be obtained by an antibody raised against an irrelevant peptide sequence, the Xpress tag (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). This result unambiguously shows endogenous expression of HNF41 and/or -2 proteins and confirms that HNF4 P1 promoter transcripts are readily expressed in the pancreatic ss-cell line HIT-T15. This cell line also expresses HNF4, which, when complexed with DNA, comigrates with complexes formed between DNA and HNF41 and -2 (33). HNF4 is not recognized by the 455 and H4/55 antibodies; this could account for the partial supershift observed in lanes 2 and 3, as previously observed with nuclear extracts of intestinal villi and crypts (33).

EMSAs were performed with the HNF4 response element of the HNF1 promoter and either in vitro-synthesized HNF42 and HNF48 (A) or nuclear extracts of HIT-T15 (20  microg) and HepG2 (5  microg) cells (B). DNA-protein complexes were incubated with either the 455 antiserum, which recognizes the common C-terminal end of isoforms 1, 2, 7, and 8, or the monoclonal H4/55 antibody, which recognizes the N-terminal sequence of isoforms 1 and 2, or the unrelated Xpress antibody. Arrow and arrowhead denote DNA-HNF4 shifted complexes and supershifted complexes, respectively.
  Weak transcriptional potentials of HNF48 produced from the P2 promoter in pancreatic ss-cells HNF41 and -2, whose transcripts include exon 1A, contain the activation function AF-1 module at their amino-terminal end (Fig. 3A). This module includes structural motifs characteristic of acidic activators and plays a key role in the transcriptional potential of HNF4 isoforms 1 and 2 (18;19). The amino-terminal sequence of HNF47 and -8, encoded by exon 1D, does not contain these motifs and seems to lack an activation function AF-1 module. We addressed the consequences of this sequence difference on the HNF4 transcriptional potential in pancreatic ss-cell lines, by comparing the transcriptional activities of HNF4 isoforms 2 and 8 in RIN m5F and HIT-T15 insulinoma cells. To better define the effect of lack of the AF-1 on the HNF4 transcriptional potential in these cells, we also analyzed the activity of HNF42 Y6D/F19D, which has a mutated AF-1 module (Fig. 3A). The mutated residues are crucial for the AF-1 function in hepatoma HepG2 cells (18) and in embryonal kidney HEK 293T cells (Eeckhoute, J., unpublished results). In RIN m5F cells, the HNF1 promoter was activated 6.3-fold by HNF42 but only 4.8-fold by HNF48 and 4.2-fold by HNF42 Y6D/F19D (Fig. 3B). In HIT-T15 cells, only HNF42 activated the HNF1 promoter (Fig. 3C). The differences in transactivation were not due to low expression of HNF48 or HNF42 Y6D/F19D (Fig. 3D). These results support the hypothesis that the lower transcriptional activity of HNF48 is due to lack of a AF-1 module.

A, Schematic representation of HNF42 with its AF-1 module (black box), HNF42 Y6D/F19D with the mutated AF-1 (black box with white diamonds), and HNF48 lacking the AF-1. The sequence 1 to 16 of isoform 8 (hatched box) does not share any homology with sequence 1 to 29 of isoform 2 (11 ). RIN m5F and HIT-T15 cells (B and C, respectively) were transiently transfected with 300 ng of human HNF1 promoter-Firefly luciferase-reporter plasmid, 25 ng of the indicated HNF4 expression plasmids, and 10 ng of either pGL3-Renilla luciferase (in RIN m5F) or pCMV-ss-galactosidase (in HIT-T15).

  HNF48 driven from the P2 promoter exhibits reduced interaction and cooperation with several coactivators As for other nuclear hormone receptors, the HNF4 transcriptional potential is modulated by coactivators or corepressors. The HNF4 AF-1 interacts with the coactivator p300 (18, 19, 20), as do the AF-1 of other nuclear receptors with p300 and GRIP-1 (34). We therefore investigated the effects of lack of the AF-1 in HNF48 and mutation of this module in HNF42 Y6D/F19D on the interaction with coregulators. In this study, we included p300, GRIP-1, and PGC-1, which are HNF4 coactivators (31, 35, 36, 37), and SHP, a HNF4 corepressor (38). GRIP-1, p300, and SHP were reported to be expressed in the endocrine pancreas (7, 39, 40), and PGC-1 expression in human pancreatic ss-cells and in insulinoma cell lines was evidenced by RT-PCR (Fig. 4A). HNF48 interacted much less efficiently than HNF42 with p300 and GRIP-1 (Fig. 4B). Conversely, no difference between both isoforms was observed when studying physical interaction with PGC-1 and SHP (Fig. 4B). Results obtained with HNF42 Y6D/F19D support that the lower interaction of isoform 8 with p300 and GRIP-1 is due to the lack of AF-1 in this isoform.

B, Physical interactions with coregulators. In vitro-synthesized 35S-methionine-labeled HNF42, HNF48, or HNF42 Y6D/F19D were incubated with immobilized GST-PGC-1 (36 to 797), GST-p300 (340 to 528), GST-GRIP-1 (1122 to 1462), or GST-full-length SHP. After extensive washing, proteins were eluted with sodium dodecyl sulfate loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Values under photographs indicate binding of HNF42 Y6D/F19D and HNF48, relative to that of HNF42 from three independent experiments. Inputs, corresponding to 10% of amounts of labeled proteins used in the assays, were taken into account for binding quantifications.
  Next we studied the effect of lack of the AF-1 on the cooperation between HNF4 and p300 that is required for activation of transcription (35). To circumvent technical difficulties due to cotransfection of multiple expression plasmids in pancreatic cells and to avoid interference with endogenous HNF4 and HNF4, this study was carried out in HeLa cells. When p300 was not overexpressed, the HNF1 promoter was activated 5.3-fold by HNF42 but only 2.6-fold by HNF48 and HNF42 Y6D/F19D (Fig. 5A). The marked difference in transactivation potentials of HNF4 isoforms 2 and 8 was not due to a difference in expression of the proteins (Fig. 5C). The coactivator p300 had no effect on the activity of the HNF1 promoter in the absence of HNF4 but enhanced the transcriptional potential of HNF42 2-fold vs. only 1.4-fold and 1.2-fold for HNF48 and HNF42 Y6D/F19D, respectively (Fig. 5A). Therefore, when the AF-1 module was either lacking or mutated, both the physical interaction and the functional cooperation between p300 and HNF4 were decreased. As expected from results obtained in pull-down assays, the transcriptional activities of isoforms 2 and 8 were repressed to similar extents by SHP (Fig. 5B).
View larger version (16K):    Figure 5. The transcriptional potentials of HNF42 and -8 are differently enhanced by the coactivator p300 but similarly repressed by the corepressor SHP.

     Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   In recent studies, having failed to detect transcripts from the P1 promoter in pancreatic islets and in insulinoma INS-1 cells, the authors concluded that HNF4 transcription is driven almost exclusively by the P2 promoter in pancreatic islets (11, 12, 17). But until now, HNF4 expression was not documented in human pancreatic ss-cells. In our study on human islets and isolated pancreatic ss-cells, we observed that transcripts of the P1 promoter were significantly expressed, as were those of the P2 promoter. This indicates that HNF4 expression does not exclusively initiate at the P2 promoter in human pancreatic ss-cells. Similar results were observed in the rat RIN m5F and hamster HIT-T15 pancreatic ss-cell lines. Several controls confirmed the accuracy of our results. Importantly, we confirmed expression of P1 transcripts in the pancreatic ss-cell line HIT-T15 by immunodetecting HNF4 proteins containing the amino-terminal sequence encoded by exon 1A. Lack of detection of promoter P1 transcripts in islets by Ferrer s group (12, 17) may be explained by a low amplification efficiency of the P1 promoter transcripts. This may account for the weak intensity they obtained for the exon 1A+2 band in liver, relative to that of exon 1D+2 band in islets (Fig. 2b in Ref. 17), although isoforms 1 and 2 are by far more abundant in liver than isoforms 7 and 8 in islets. In concordance with the considerable difference in expression (32), primers amplifying exons 8 to 10 contained in the four isoforms 1, 2, 7 and 8 yielded bands of much stronger intensity for isoforms 1 + 2 in liver than for isoforms 7 + 8 in islets (Fig. 1c in Ref. 17).
A mutation in the HNF4 P1 promoter significantly decreasing the promoter s activity is associated with diabetes (41). This suggests that promoter P1 transcription may be important for normal pancreatic ss-cell function. In addition, a HNF42 clone was isolated from a human pancreatic islet cDNA library, also arguing for the expression of HNF4 P1 promoter transcripts in endocrine pancreas (Furuta, H., and G. Bell, personal communication).
Controversial results were obtained concerning HNF4 expression in exocrine pancreas (12, 32). We confirmed results described in Ref. 32 stating that HNF4 was poorly expressed in the exocrine pancreas.
Compared with isoform 7, isoform 1 is a stronger transcriptional activator in nonpancreatic ss-cells except on promoters of genes that are expressed early in liver (15, 16, 42). Our functional studies showed that the transcriptional potential of HNF42 was significantly stronger than that of isoform 8 in models of pancreatic ss-cells. Interestingly, these results were obtained on the promoter of HNF1, which plays a crucial role in these cells (7, 9, 43, 44). Because HNF1 expression is regulated by HNF4 in pancreatic ss-cells (5, 45), we suggest that expression of the HNF4 P1 promoter producing isoforms 1 and 2 is most probably of major importance in pancreatic ss-cells. From our data obtained with HNF42 containing a mutated AF-1, we can infer that the difference in transcriptional potential between isoforms 2 and 8 was due to the lack of the AF-1 module in the latter isoform.
Furthermore, lack of AF-1 in HNF4 resulted in a decreased interaction with p300 and GRIP-1 coactivators. Interaction with p300 was studied using a fragment (amino acids 340 to 528) that interacts with both the HNF4 AF-1 and AF-2 (20). Despite interaction through the AF-2, we observed a marked decrease in binding of HNF4 lacking the AF-1, thus highlighting the substantial contribution of AF-1 to the interaction with p300. Consistent with this result, we observed that p300 enhanced the transcriptional potential of isoform 2 more efficiently than that of isoform 8 and HNF42 with a mutated AF-1. Interestingly, the AF-1 module is also required for the synergistic action of p300 and GRIP-1 to enhance the HNF4 transcriptional activity (42).
In contrast to these coactivators, the corepressor SHP interacted similarly with HNF42 and 8 and repressed their transcriptional activity to similar extents. This strongly suggests that SHP-mediated recruitment of transcriptional inhibitor(s) is not AF-1 dependent. Silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), another HNF4 corepressor (46), was shown to interact similarly with HNF41 and HNF47 (42). It appears therefore that the HNF4 AF-1 interacts only with coactivators whereas the AF-2 interacts with both coactivators and corepressors in a mutually exclusive fashion. Because the balance between coactivators and corepressors is crucial for HNF4 transcriptional activity (38, 46), lack of the AF-1 in isoforms 7 and 8 most probably results in a shift toward a lower ability to recruit coactivators and a subsequent lower coactivator-mediated enhancement of HNF4 transcriptional potential. SHP is highly expressed in human pancreatic islets (Moerman, E., unpublished results) and may serve as an important checkpoint to balance the activity of the transcriptional network of pancreatic ss-cells (7, 8). In these cells in which the HNF4 AF-2 has a high probability to be occupied by SHP, the transcriptional activity of isoforms containing the AF-1 may be more efficiently enhanced by coactivators. Thus, even if the AF-1-dependent cofactor-mediated modulations of HNF4 transcriptional activity observed in this study and in Ref. 42 remain to be shown in pancreatic ss-cells, our results strongly argue for an essential role of the promoter P1-driven HNF4 isoforms in these cells.
A cross-regulatory loop between HNF1 and HNF4 has been evidenced in pancreatic ss-cells, as reviewed in Refs. 8 and 9 . In the model proposed by Ferrer (9), activation of the HNF1 promoter by HNF4 is crucial to maintain HNF1 expression above the threshold level required to hold the HNF1/HNF4 circuit in the switch-ON state and, consequently, to avoid ss-cell dysfunction and development of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (9). Expression of the HNF4 P1 promoter transcripts in pancreatic ss-cells is probably crucial to maintain this circuit in the switch-ON state. Indeed, HNF4 is expressed at a limiting amount in ss-cells, and, among isoforms 1, 2, 7, 8, and , only the first two contain the AF-1 module, which confers a stronger transcriptional potential and leads to a more efficient recruitment of coactivators. Thus, expression of isoforms 1 and 2 is likely of crucial importance in the transcriptional network controlling pancreatic islet function.
