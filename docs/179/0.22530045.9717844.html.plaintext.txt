   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Nuclear receptors regulate transcription by binding to specific DNA response elements as homodimers or heterodimers. Herein, the yeast and mammalian two-hybrid tests as well as glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays were exploited to demonstrate that estrogen receptor (ER) directly binds to a subset of nuclear receptors through protein-protein interactions between ligand-binding domains. These receptors include hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, thyroid hormone receptor (TR), retinoic acid receptor (RAR), ERss, and retinoid X receptor (RXR). In yeast cells, a LexA fusion protein to the human ER ligand-binding domain (LexA/ER-LBD) was an inert transactivator of a LacZ reporter gene controlled by upstream LexA-binding sites. However, LexA/ER-LBD differentially modulated the LacZ reporter gene expression when coexpressed with native TRs, RARs, or RXRs. Similarly, cotransfection of these receptors in CV1 cells up- or down-regulated transactivations by ER. From these results, we propose that ER is a common interaction partner for a subset of receptors, and these interactions should mediate novel signaling pathways in vivo.
   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The nuclear receptor superfamily is a group of transcriptional regulatory proteins linked by conserved structure and function (1). The superfamily includes receptors for a variety of small hydrophobic ligands such as steroids, T3, and retinoids, as well as a large number of related proteins that do not have known ligands, referred to as orphan nuclear receptors (2). The receptor proteins are direct regulators of transcription that function by binding to specific DNA sequences named hormone response elements (HREs) in promoters of target genes. Nearly all the superfamily members bind as dimers to HREs. A dimerization interface has previously been identified within the DNA-binding domains (DBDs) of retinoid X receptors (RXRs), retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, and thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) that selectively promotes DNA binding to cognate HREs (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). An additional dimerization interface that mediates cooperative binding to DNA, referred to as the I-box, has recently been mapped to a 40-amino acid region within the C-terminal ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of RAR, TR, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter (COUP-TF), RXR, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) (9, 10). The two dimerization domains appear to work in tandem and led to a two-step hypothesis for binding of dimers to DNA (2, 9). According to this hypothesis, the LBD dimerization interface initiates the formation of solution dimers that, in turn, acquire the capacity to bind to a number of differently organized HREs. However, formation of a second dimer interface within the DBD restricts receptors to bind to only cognate HREs (2, 9).
While some nuclear receptors apparently bind HREs only as homodimers, TRs, vitamin D receptor, RARs, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), and several orphan nuclear receptors bind their specific response elements with high affinity as heterodimers with RXRs (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16). Based on this high-affinity binding, such heterodimers have been considered to be the functionally active forms of these receptors in vivo. However, RXR is not the only receptor capable of forming heterodimers with other nuclear receptors. TR (17, 18), COUP-TF (19, 20, 21), PPAR (22), and small heterodimer partner (SHP) (23) have been reported to form heterodimers with other receptors. Interestingly, although heterodimerization with RXR usually results in enhanced transactivation, COUP-TF and SHP seem to function primarily as transcriptional repressors (23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28). Heterodimer formation can generate many different combinations of receptors, particularly in the light of the fact that multiple genes and multiple isoforms exist for RAR, RXR, TR, COUP-TF, and PPAR. As the expression of each isoform depends on cell type and the stage of growth and development, heterodimerization among all these receptors results in the formation of an extremely diverse group of receptors. In principle, the enormous number of heterodimer combinations could cover a wide range of transcriptional activities, thus generating significant diversity in gene regulation.
Herein, we show that estrogen receptor (ER) directly binds, through protein-protein interactions between ligand-binding domains, to HNF4, TR, RAR, and RXR, adding a complexity to the already complicated list of the heteromeric interactions. We have also confirmed the results (29, 30) that newly cloned ER named ERss interacts with ER. In parallel, COUP-TF (31), estrogen-related receptor 1 (ERR1) (32), and SHP (D. D. Moore, personal communications) were shown to interact with ER, while this manuscript was in preparation. We further show that coexpression of native TR, RAR, or RXR differentially regulates transactivations by ER in yeast and CV1 cells. These results suggest that ER is a common interaction partner for a subset of receptors, and these interactions mediate novel signaling pathways in vivo.
   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   ER Interacts with a Subset of Nuclear Receptors in Yeast We found that coexpression of a previously described B42/RXR-LBD hybrid (33) stimulates the LexA/ER-LBD (a LexA fusion protein with the LBD of ER)-mediated LacZ reporter gene expression in the yeast two-hybrid tests, suggesting that ER-LBD interacts with RXR-LBD (Fig. 1A). This LacZ expression was further stimulated approximately 1.5-fold in the presence of 1  microM 9-cis-RA. We further found that the LexA/ER-LBD-mediated LacZ expression was stimulated when coexpressed with analogous B42 fusions to several receptors, including RAR, TR, HNF4, and ERss, suggesting that ER also interacts with these receptors (Fig. 1A). The expression was slightly enhanced by 1  microM T3 with the B42/TR coexpression, whereas it was significantly stimulated by 1  microM E2 with the B42/ERss coexpression (3-fold) (Fig. 1A). In addition, we showed that an inert transactivator LexA/ERss stimulated the LacZ reporter gene expression approximately 6.5-fold when coexpressed with B42/ERss, confirming the recently reported ERss homodimerization (29, 30) in this yeast system (Fig. 1A). In contrast, coexpression of B42 alone or B42 fusions to the LBDs of TRss, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), or the orphan receptor CAR (34) did not stimulate the LexA/ER-LBD-mediated LacZ expression, attesting to the specificity of these interactions. Similarly, expressions of all the B42 fusions alone, with no LexA fusion coexpressed, were transcriptionally inert with the LacZ reporter (data not shown). However, the B42/TR-LBD coexpression stimulated the LexA/ER-LBD-mediated LacZ expression approximately 2.5-fold in the presence of 1  microM T3, raising the possibility that TR-LBD may contain a T3-inducible interaction domain with ER. From these results, we concluded that ER-LBD may interact with RAR, RXR-LBD, TR, TRss-LBD (only in the presence of T3), HNF4-LBD, and ERssL, in which LBDs are likely to be sufficient. It is noteworthy that the LacZ expression strength by coexpression of these ER heterocomplexes was generally comparable to that of the previously described TR/RXR heterodimer (33) (Fig. 1B, compare with the results of LexA/TR-LBD and B42/RXR-LBD). Overall, the similarities in the pattern of interactions observed with LexA/ER-LBD and LexA/RXR-LBD (33, 35, 36) strongly suggest that ER, like the RXRs, is a common interaction partner for members of the receptor superfamily.

EGY48 cells, in which ss-galactosidase expression is dependent on the presence of a transcriptional activator with a LexA DNA-binding domain, were transformed with plasmids expressing the indicated LexA and B42 chimeras. These cells were grown in liquid culture containing galactose, since expression of the B42 chimeras is under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter (33 ). ss-Galactosidase readings were determined and corrected for cell density and for time of development (A415/A600) x 1000/min. The result is the average of at least three different experiments, and the SDs are less than 5%. A, Open bars indicate no hormone added. Light-hatched bars indicate the presence of 1  microM E2. Thick-hatched bars indicate the presence of 1  microM 9-cis-RA (B42/RAR and B42/RXR-LBD) or T3 (B42/TR and B42/TR-LBD). Black bars indicate the presence of 1  microM E2 plus 1  microM T3 (B42/TR and B42/TR-LBD) or 1  microM E2 plus 1  microM 9-cis-RA (B42/RAR and B42/RXR-LBD). B, Open bars indicate no hormone added. Light-hatched bars indicate the presence of 1  microM T3. Thick-hatched bars indicate the presence of 1  microM 9-cis-RA. Black bars indicate the presence of 1  microM E2 plus 1  microM 9-cis-RA.
  To confirm whether various ligand-dependent stimulations of the LacZ expressions observed reflect genuine ligand-dependent protein-protein interactions or simply ligand-dependent transactivations mediated by the AF2 domains (1), we reexamined the LacZ expressions with two previously defined AF2 mutant receptors, LexA/TR-LBD459 (33) and B42/RXR-LBDAF2 (36). As shown in Fig. 1B, the 9-cis-RA-dependent induction of the LacZ expression observed with coexpression of B42/RXR-LBD and LexA/TR-LBD was lost when B42/RXR-LBDAF2 was coexpressed instead, whereas the T3-dependent induction was specifically lost when LexA/TR-LBD459 was used. When LexA/TR-LBD459 and B42/RXR-LBDAF2 were coexpressed, neither T3 nor 9-cis-RA-depedent induction of the LacZ expression was observed. These results, along with our previous finding (33) in which the interactions of LexA/TR and B42/RXR were not affected by mutations into the AF2 domain of TR, clearly demonstrate that protein-protein interaction of TR and RXR are ligand independent. Therefore, results of the yeast two-hybrid tests should be taken with caution that they may not represent true ligand-dependent interactions. Thus, we further characterized these interactions using two additional methods (i.e. mammalian two-hybrid tests and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-pull downs).
ER Interacts with TR, RAR, and RXR in Mammalian Cells To examine whether ER binds to these receptors in mammalian cells, we employed a mammalian two-hybrid system that reproduces the heteromeric receptor-receptor interactions (37). As shown in Fig. 2, cotransfection of CV1 cells with expression vectors for VP16/TR, VP16/RAR, and VP16/RXR significantly increased the Gal4/ER-LBD-mediated induction of the Gal4-TK-Luc reporter gene activity (4-, 7.5-, and 9.5-fold induction, respectively). Similar results were obtained in the presence of 0.1  microM cognate ligand, suggesting that they interact with each other in a ligand-independent manner. As expected, VP16 alone was ineffective. Thus, we concluded that ER is capable of constitutively binding to TR, RAR, and RXR in mammalian cells. These results suggest that the various ligand-dependent stimulations of the LacZ expression in yeast (Fig. 1A) may have reflected ligand-dependent transactivations of the AF2 domains, as suggested by the results shown in Fig. 1B.

CV1 cells were transfected with ss-galactosidase expression vector and VP16 alone, VP16/TR, VP16/RAR, or VP16/RXR-expression vectors along with a reporter gene Gal4-TK-Luc (37 ). Open bars indicate no hormone added, whereas hatched and black bars indicate addition of 0.1  microM T3 and 9-cis-RA, respectively. Normalized luciferase expressions from triplicate samples are presented relative to the ss-galactosidase expressions, and the SDs are less than 5%.
  ER Binds to TR, RAR, and RXR in Vitro To further characterize these interactions in vitro, GST-fusions to full-length rat TRss, human RAR, and RXR were expressed, purified, and tested for interaction with an in vitro-translated full-length human ER or luciferase labeled with [35S]methionine. As expected, luciferase was not able to interact with any of the GST proteins (data not shown). However, ER readily interacted with GST/TR, GST/RAR, and GST/RXR either in the presence or absence of ligand (Fig. 3, A, B and C). ER didn t interact with GST alone or GST/GR, as expected. In contrast, ER bound to GST fusion to the receptor-binding domain of SRC-1 (GST/SRC-R) (38) in an E2-stimulated manner (Fig. 3D). The percentage of total [35S]ER bound by the fusion proteins were approximately 15 to 30% of the inputs (data not shown), and the E2-dependent fold-increase in the pull-down of [35S]ER by GST/SRC-R was approximately 4- to 5-fold. From these results, we concluded that ER constitutively binds to TR, RAR, and RXR through direct protein-protein interactions. In particular, these results, along with the mammalian two- hybrid tests (Fig. 2), suggest that at least some of the ligand-dependent stimulation of the LacZ expression observed in the yeast two-hybrid tests (Fig. 1) should have resulted from ligand-induced transactivations rather than ligand-induced protein-protein interactions.

Luciferase and ER-LBD labeled with [35S]methionine by in vitro translation were incubated with glutathione beads containing GST alone, GST fusions to TRss (A), RAR (B), RXR (C), SRC-R and GR (D). Beads were washed, and specifically bound material was eluted with reduced glutathione and resolved by SDS-PAGE. (-) denotes no hormone added; 0.1  microM of each ligand was added as indicated.
  Function of the ER Heterocomplexes We have previously shown that LexA/TR-LBD requires coexpression of native RXR for an efficient T3-dependent transactivation in yeast (33). Similar to LexA/TR-LBD, LexA/ER-LBD alone was an inert transactivator, either in the presence or absence of E2, of the previously described LacZ reporter gene controlled by upstream LexA-binding sites in yeast (33). To gain insights into the functional consequences of these interactions in vivo, we coexpressed holo-proteins of these ER-interacting receptors in the LexA/ER-LBD-expressing yeast cells. Interestingly, RAR, RARss, RXRss, TR, or TRss dramatically enhanced the basal transcriptional activities of LexA/ER-LBD (Fig. 4). Coexpression of RAR led to approximately 2-fold induction in the basal transcriptional activities, which was further enhanced approximately 2-fold by addition of 1  microM 9-cis-RA. Interestingly, coexpression of RXR or RXR induced the LexA/ER-LBD-mediated LacZ expression only in the presence of 1  microM 9-cis-RA; i.e. the basal level of expression was not affected by coexpression of these two receptors (Fig. 4). These results indicate that coexpression of these native receptors can differentially regulate transactivations by ER in yeast, attesting to the possible functional significance of these interactions in vivo.

EGY48 cells, in which ss-galactosidase expression is dependent on the presence of a transcriptional activator with a LexA DBD, were transformed with plasmids expressing LexA/ER-LBD and the indicated holo-nuclear receptors. Open bars indicate no hormone added. Light-hatched bars indicate the presence of 1  microM E2. Thick-hatched bars indicate the presence of 1  microM 9-cis-RA (RARs and RXRs) or T3 (TRs). Black bars indicate the presence of 1  microM E2 plus 1  microM T3 (TRs) or 1  microM E2 plus 1  microM 9-cis-RA (RARs and RXRs). ss-Galactosidase readings were determined and corrected for cell density and for time of development (A415/A600) x 1000/min. The result is the average of at least three different experiments, and the SDs are less than 5%.
  To assess the functional consequences of these interactions in mammalian cells, TR, RAR, or RXR was cotransfected into CV1 cells along with an ER expression vector and a reporter construct controlled by ERE (ERE-TK-CAT or ERE-TK-Luc). Addition of 0.1  microM E2 stimulated the ER-mediated reporter gene expression approximately 5- to 7-fold in the absence of cotransfected receptors. Coexpression of TR, however, significantly stimulated both the basal and E2-induced transactivations by ER (4- and 2-fold, respectively). Interestingly, a weak additive effect was observed with the TR coexpression; i.e. E2 plus T3 resulted in approximately 1.5-fold higher activities than E2 alone (Fig. 5A; see the results with 50 ng TR cotransfected). Coexpression of RAR did not affect the basal level of transactivations by ER. However, it repressed the E2-induced transactivation almost to the basal level (Fig. 5B). In contrast, coexpression of RXR modestly stimulated the E2-induced transactivations by ER. The basal level of transactivations by ER, however, was not affected by the RXR coexpression. Similarly, coexpression of ER inhibited the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of a reporter construct controlled by ss-retinoic acid response element (data not shown). In addition, cotransfection results varied depending on cell types and receptor isotypes, suggesting that other factors contribute to the final phenotype of each ER heterocomplex (M.-O. Lee, unpublished results). These results, along with the yeast coexpression results (Fig. 4), suggest that these ER heterocomplexes can differentially modulate the ER-mediated transcriptional activites in vivo.

Normalized luciferase expressions from triplicate samples are presented relative to the ss-galactosidase expressions and the SDs are less than 5%.
     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   It has been demonstrated that control of E2-responsive gene regulation can be quite complex (reviewed in Ref. 39). Several lines of evidence indicated that gene regulation by E2 and ERE involves not only ER but also other transcription factors. For example, other nuclear receptors such as TR, RXR, COUP-TF, ERR1, and RAR have been shown to interact with EREs in addition to their cognate response elements (40, 41, 42). In this report, we have clearly shown that ER, along with RXR, is a common interaction partner for a subset of receptors, suggesting that E2-responsive gene regulation may also involve direct protein-protein interactions with other nuclear receptors. In particular, it is an interesting possibility that these different ER heterocomplexes may mediate novel signaling pathways through their own DNA-binding sites that are distinct from the conventional EREs. In contrast to the broad positive effects of RXR, these ER heterointeractions led to differential regulation of the transactivations by ER (Figs. 4 and 5). In addition, cotransfection results dramatically varied depending on cell types (CV1 vs. MCF7 cells, for instance) and receptor isotypes (M.-O. Lee, unpublished results). These differential regulations may result from direct bindings of ER heterodimers to ERE, which either positively or negatively regulates E2-induced gene expression. Alternatively, formation of a non ERE-binding heterodimer may simply inhibit E2-induced gene expression or allow other positive- or negative-acting proteins to occupy EREs instead. Despite our extensive efforts, however, we were not able to find any intermediate heterodimer bindings or inhibitions of ER bindings to ERE by these ER-interacting receptors in electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) (data not shown). Similarly, heterodimers of COUP-TF/ER (31), ERR1/ER (32), and SHP/ER (D. D. Moore, personal communications) readily detected in solution were not observed to bind EREs in EMSA. In parallel, two recent reports showed interaction of COUP-TF with orphan receptors nurr77 (20) and HNF4 (21) only in solution but not when bound to DNA. These results are consistent with the possibility that these ER/receptors may bind EREs as a heterodimer or a higher-order complex not stable enough to sustain in EMSA. These weak complexes may show distinct phenotypes by differentially interacting with other proteins such as recently defined transcription cofactors, which are often receptor- and cell type-specific (reviewed in Ref. 43). Consistent with this possibility, xSRC-3, an SRC-1 homolog we recently isolated from Xenopus, was found to show unexpected specificity in tissue distribution and receptor interactions (44).
Even though the oligomeric status of the ER heterocomplexes are not currently known, two lines of evidence attest to the specificity of the protein-protein interactions between ER and these receptors. First, a series of chimeric HNF4s we recently constructed to define the HNF4 homodimeric interactions and RXR heterodimeric interactions (10) differentially interacted with ER (our unpublished results). Second, we isolated a few mutant RXRs that show specifically impaired interactions with ER while maintaining wild-type interactions with other receptors (our unpublished results). Similar to the chimeric HNF4s, these mutations also reside within the I-box of the RXR, which was recently found to be essential for homo- and heterodimer formations (9, 10), suggesting that HNF4 and RXR exploit the conventional dimerization domains (the I-box) to interact with ER. Recently, the DNA-binding pattern of the RXR was shown to be regulated by ligand-dependent modulation of its oligomeric state (dimer vs. tetramer), and the tetramerization domain was defined to be distinct from the dimerization domain I-box (45). Thus, further mutational studies within this newly defined tetramerization domain of RXR, as well as mapping the regions of ER essential for these interactions, will be required to clearly decode the oligomeric status of these ER heterocomplexes.
The LexA-based yeast two-hybrid system presents two possible complications to study protein-protein interactions. First, the full-length LexA used in this system contains its own dimerization domain, which could complicate interpretation of the interaction results, particularly where dimerization is a prerequisite for two target proteins to interact with each other. Second, this system cannot distinguish between genuine ligand-dependent protein-protein interactions and ligand-dependent transactivations. For instance, the ligand-induced stimulations of the LacZ expressions when LexA/TR and B42/RXR-LBD were coexpressed were shown to reflect ligand-dependent transactivations mediated by the AF2 domains of TR and RXR (Fig. 1B). With these complications, other methods such as the GST pull-downs should be employed to probe protein-protein interactions. The interactions of ER with TR, RAR, and RXR were hormone-independent in both mammalian two-hybrid tests and GST pull-downs, suggesting that the seemingly hormone-dependent interactions in yeast (Fig. 1) may have been the hormone-dependent transactivations of the AF2 domains. The T3-dependent stimulation of the LacZ expression with TR-LBD and ER-LBD coexpressed (Fig. 1A) may have also reflected the T3-dependent transactivations of the AF2 domain of TR. The basal interactions between these proteins might have been too low to detect in the yeast system, which, however, became detectable with an aid from the activated transactivations of the AF2 domain upon T3 addition (Fig. 1A; see the results with LexA/ER-LBD and B42/TR-LBD).
The physiological implications for these interactions have been accumulating. For instance, manipulations of T3 and E2in vitro were shown to potentiate or mutually inhibit effects of gene expression (40, 46, 47). Environmental conditions that alter levels of circulating T3, such as cold temperature, were also shown to alter E2-dependent female reproductive behavior (48, 49, 50, 51). TR was recently shown to attenuate ER-mediated transactivations from the vit A2 consensus ERE, which is not necessarily dependent on DNA binding, as the TR DNA-binding mutant was still able to inhibit E2-dependent transactivation (52, 53). However, under similar conditions, we observed a modest enhancement of the ERE-mediated transactivations by either liganded or unliganded ER when cotransfected with TR (Fig. 5). The reasons for this discrepancy are not currently known. In addition, retinoids have been shown to inhibit the growth of hormone-dependent breast cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro (54, 55, 56). Nonadditive inhibition has been demonstrated between retinoids and antiestrogens, suggesting that each agent may produce common antiestrogenic effects. Recently, synergistic interactions between HNF3 and HNF4 mediating apolipoprotein AI gene expression were shown to be further potentiated by cotransfected ER (57), in which the physical association of ER and HNF4, as described in this report, may play a role. However, the physiological implications for the ER/SHP (D. D. Moore, personal communications), ER/COUP-TF (31), and ER/ERR1 (32) interactions are not currently known.
In conclusion, we found that ER directly binds to a subset of nuclear receptors through protein-protein interactions between ligand-binding domains, and these ER heterocomplexes led to differential regulation of transactivations by ER. From these results, we propose that ER is a common interaction partner for a subset of receptors, and these different ER heterocomplexes should mediate novel signaling pathways in vivo.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Hormones, Yeast Cells, and Plasmids E2, T3, and 9-cis-RA were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). EGY48 cells, the lexA-ss-galactosidase reporter construct, and the LexA- and B42-parental vectors were as reported (33, 58). LexA or B42 fusions to the LBDs of GR, CAR, HNF4, RXR and TRss as well as a B42 fusion to full-length RAR were as previously described (10, 33, 35, 36). The entire hinge and ligand-binding domains (D, E, and F; amino acids 245 to 595) of the human ER were subcloned into EcoRI and SalI sites of the LexA-vector by PCR using EcoRI and XhoI-site bearing primers to construct LexA/ER-LBD. LexA or B42 fusions to full-length mouse ERss (a gift from Dr. Vincent Giguere) or human TR were similarly constructed. Yeast expression vectors, YEP-RXR, YEP-RXRss, YEP-RXR, YEP-RAR, YEP-RARss, YEP-RAR, YEP-TR, and YEP-TRss were as described (33, 59). Expressions of all of these holo- or chimeric receptor constructs were confirmed by Western analyses (33, 58, 59). T7 vector to express full-length hER and expression vector for GST-fusions to full-length TRss, RXR and RAR were gifts from Dr. David Moore at Baylor College of Medicine (36). A PCR fragment encoding GR-LBD (human GR amino acids 484 to 777) was cloned into EcoRI and SalI restriction sites of pGEM4T (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) to construct GST/GR-LBD. Mammalian expression vectors for ER, TR, RXR, and RAR, the reporter constructs ERE-TK-CAT and ERE-TK-Luc, and the transfection indicator construct pRSV-ss-gal are as described (34, 52, 53, 58). Vectors for the mammalian two-hybrid tests were gifts from Dr. Ron Evans at Salk Institute (37). All the PCR-based constructs were sequenced against any mutation that might have been erroneously introduced during amplification.
Yeast ss-Galactosidase Assays The cotransformation and transactivation assays in yeast as well as quantitative liquid ss-galactosidase assays were performed with the following changes as described previously (33). The yeast culture were initially diluted to an A600 of 0.05, and plated into 96-well culture dishes with the various concentrations of hormone. The cultures were then incubated in the dark at 30 C for 16 h. The A600 was determined, and then cells were lysed and substrate was added and A415 was read after 10 to 30 min. The normalized galactosidase values were determined as follows: (A415/A600) x 1000/min developed. For each experiment, at least six independently derived colonies expressing chimeric receptors were tested.
Pull-Down Assays GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography essentially as described (36). GST proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) in binding buffer (50 mM KPO4, pH 6.0, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mg/ml E. coli extract and 0.1% Tween 20). Beads were washed once with binding buffer and incubated for 60 min at 4 C in the same buffer with equivalent amounts of various proteins labeled with [35S]methionine by in vitro translation. Nonbound proteins were removed by three washes with binding buffer without E. coli extract, and specifically bound proteins were eluted with 50 mM reduced glutathione in 0.5 M Tris, pH 8.0. Eluted proteins were resolved by PAGE and visualized by fluorography.
Cell Culture and Transfections CV1 cells were grown in 24-well plates with medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped serum. After 24 h incubation, cells were transfected with 150 ng of ss-galactosidase expression vector pRSV-ss-gal and 100 ng of a reporter gene ERE-TK-CAT or ERE-TK-Luc, along with 10 ng ER- and increasing amounts (50 to 100 ng) of TR, RAR, or RXR expression vector. Total amount of expression vectors were kept constant by adding decreasing amounts of the CDM8 expression vector to transfections containing increasing amounts of the TR, RAR, or RXR vector. For the mammalian two-hybrid tests, a reporter gene Gal4-TK-Luc, vectors expressing VP16/-, VP16/TR, VP16/RAR, or VP16/RXR, and Gal4DBD/ER-LBD expression vector were used as described (37). After 12 h, cells were washed and refed with DMEM containing 10% charcoal-stripped FBS. After 12 h, cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with 0.1  microM ligand. Cells were harvested 24 h later, and CAT or luciferase activity was assayed as described (58), and the results were normalized to the ss-galactosidase expression. Similar results were obtained in more than two similar experiments.
