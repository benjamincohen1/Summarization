    ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION REFERENCES
HNF4 is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor family with prominent functions in liver, gut, kidney and pancreatic  cells. We have solved the x-ray crystal structure of the HNF4 ligand binding domain, which adopts a canonical fold. Two conformational states are present within each homodimer: an open form with  helix 12 (12) extended and collinear with 10 and a closed form with 12 folded against the body of the domain. Although the protein was crystallized without added ligands, the ligand binding pockets of both closed and open forms contain fatty acids. The carboxylic acid headgroup of the fatty acid ion pairs with the guanidinium group of Arg226 at one end of the ligand binding pocket, while the aliphatic chain fills a long, narrow channel that is lined with hydrophobic residues. These findings suggest that fatty acids are endogenous ligands for HNF4 and establish a framework for understanding how HNF4 activity is enhanced by ligand binding and diminished by MODY1 mutations.     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION REFERENCES
Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate such diverse physiological processes as reproduction, development, and metabolism. Ligand binding induces conformational changes that coordinately dissociates corepressors and recruits coactivators to enhance transcriptional activity (1, 2). Physiologically relevant ligands, which are known for less than half of the 48 nuclear receptors encoded by the human genome, include the steroid hormones, retinoids, thyroid hormone, vitamin D3, and fatty acids. HNF4 is considered to be an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily because its endogenous ligand is not known (3). Originally identified in liver, HNF4 is also present in kidney, gut, and pancreatic islets. It functions in transcriptional cascades, downstream of TGF--activated SMAD signaling and GATA and HNF3/forkhead family transcription factors and upstream of the HNF1/POU homeodomain transcription factor. In addition to HNF1, the many target genes for HNF4 in liver include coagulation factors and proteins involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and transport. Selective targets present in kidney and intestine include erythropoietin and intestinal fatty acid binding protein, respectively. Targeted disruption of Hnf4 in mice leads to defective gastrulation, underscoring an important role for HNF4 in the developing gut (4). In humans, the clinically apparent phenotype associated with Hnf4 mutations is a Mendelian form of diabetes mellitus associated with abnormalities in lipoprotein and lipid concentrations (5, 6).
Positional cloning methods revealed the relationship between HNF4 and an atypical form of diabetes referred to as maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY1) (5). Mutations in at least six distinct genes have been linked to MODY (7). Although MODY1 is rare ( < 20 families have been identified) (5, 8, 9), the associated phenotype is instructive. Like other forms of MODY, MODY1 is characterized by autosomal-dominant inheritance, early onset ( < 25 years of age), and abnormal pancreatic  cell function. Because reduced  cell function leads to insulin deficiency, it is reasonable to conclude that HNF4 activity is tightly coupled with insulin synthesis and secretion. Since nuclear receptors are an established and valuable class of drug targets, it follows that selective agonists for HNF4 might be useful as new therapeutic strategies for improving insulin secretion in MODY patients and potentially others with more prevalent forms of type 2 diabetes. To learn more about how HNF4 functions in health and disease, and as an important step in drug discovery, we have crystallized the ligand binding domain (LBD)1 of HNF4 and solved its three-dimensional structure. HNF4 forms an antiparallel, three-layered  helical sandwich akin to other nuclear receptor LBDs. The serendipitous presence of a tightly associated fatty acid in the binding pocket reveals potential mechanisms for ligand binding.     MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION REFERENCES
Protein Production and Crystallization-- DNA encoding the LBD of rat HNF4 (residues 133-382) was subcloned into the pET 28a vector (Novagen) by PCR. Protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen), grown either in LB or synthetic medium containing L-selenomethionine (SeMet), and isolated from bacterial lysates using Talon cobalt affinity resin (Clontech). The His6 affinity tag was removed with bovine thrombin (10 units/ml), and the protein was further purified by ion exchange chromatography (Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography). Crystals were obtained at room temperature by the vapor diffusion method in 10  microl of sitting drops containing equal volumes of protein (25 mg/ml) and crystallization buffer (0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 8.0), 0.7 M ammonium acetate, 16% MPD (2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol), and 10 mM dithiothreitol).
Data Collection and Structure Determination-- Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the National Synchotron Light Source, Brookhaven, NY (beamline X12C). Oscillation images were collected every 1 degrees , and the data were integrated and scaled using the DENZO HKL software package (10). The structure was determined using MAD phasing of SeMet-substituted protein. The expected bijvoet and dispersive differences (11) based on six bound seleniums in a monomer (250 residues) were 5.90 and 3.64%, respectively. The program SOLVE (12) found 20 of 24 possible selenium sites. The phases were improved by 4-fold averaging and solvent flattening utilizing the programs MLPHARE and DM in the CCP4 suite (13). The model was built using O (14) and refined with CNS (15), applying restrained 4-fold non-crystallographic symmetry, overall B-factor corrections, and bulk solvent corrections (Table I).
Fatty Acid Analyses-- HNF4 samples (200 mg) were combined with a 10-fold excess (v:v) of 15% NaOH in 50% methanol and heated for 30 min at 100  degrees C. Esterification was accomplished by combining the cooled solutions with 20 volumes of 46% methanol in 6 N HCl and heating for 10 min at 80  degrees C. The fatty acid methyl esters were extracted into 50% methyl t-butyl ether in hexane and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) (Sherlock MIS; 170-270  degrees C) at the Bacterial Identification and Fatty Acid Laboratory, University of Florida (plantpath.ifas.ufl. edu/fame).     RESULTS AND DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION REFERENCES
Domain Architecture and Structural Homology-- The amino- and carboxyl-terminal boundaries of the LBD of HNF4 were delineated from sequence comparisons with other members of the nuclear receptor family. Although we attempted to express longer versions, including the entire LBD plus F-domain (133-455), these degraded to shorter fragments. Since susceptibility to proteolysis suggested that the F-domain is at least partially disordered, we expressed and crystallized the LBD domain (133-382) by itself. Crystals belonging to the tetragonal space group P41212 (unit cell: a = b = 102.3, c = 227.7 A) reached maximal dimensions of 0.3  x  0.2  x  0.2 mm in sitting drops within 5 days. The structure was solved using MAD phasing of selenomethionine-substituted protein (Table I).

Four protein molecules are assembled in the asymmetric unit as a pair of identical homodimers. Each LBD of HNF4 contains 9-10  helices and two  strands that adopt the helical sandwich motif common to the LBDs of nuclear receptors (Fig. 1). 194 core  carbons of the ligand binding domains from HNF4 and RXR (Protein Data Bank number 1FBY) (16), a close structural relative, superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 1.26 A. Following conventional nomenclature,  helix 2 (2), which is variably present in nuclear receptor LBDs, is absent in HNF4, 6 consists of a single  helical turn, and 10 and 11 are contiguous. Pro333 forces a break in 10. Acidic residues Glu261 and Asp262 create a bulge in 5 that may be important for dimerization (17). Electron density is apparent for all residues except those at the amino (133-140) and carboxyl (368-382) termini of the domain and within the loop between  helices 1 and 3 (the 1/3 loop, residues 157-165).

Fatty Acids in the Ligand Binding Pocket of HNF4-- Although we did not add potential ligands to our crystallization trials, the initial electron density maps showed density in the ligand binding pocket of the domain that was not accounted for by the protein. The excess electron density, present in all molecules of the asymmetric unit, resembled a small molecule associated with the guanidinium group of Arg226. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and time of flight mass spectrometric analyses of HNF4 revealed, in addition to the expected parent ion for the expressed protein, the presence of non-covalently associated saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (data not shown). To confirm the identities of the lipids and quantify relative amounts, purified HNF4 solutions were submitted for fatty acid analysis by GC. Recombinant rat HNF4-(133-382) contained a mixture of fatty acids, including 16:0, 17:0 cyclo, 18:17c, and 14:0 (Fig. 2). Similar sets of fatty acids bound a longer form of rat HNF4 containing the entire carboxyl-terminal F domain (residues 133-455, data not shown) and the LBD of human HNF4 (residues 140-382), which differs from the rat domain at seven positions (Fig. 2). These findings demonstrate that both human and rat proteins associate spontaneously with endogenous fatty acids and that the F domain does not influence binding.
View larger version (19K):    Fig. 2.   Fatty acids bound to the HNF4 LBD. Fatty acids were extracted from rat HNF4-(133-385), human HNF4-(140-385), and E. coli BL21 cells, converted to the corresponding methyl esters, and analyzed by GC. The results are plotted as percentages of total and sorted according to relative abundance in bacteria. 12:0, 14:0, and 16:0 are saturated lauric, myristic, and palmitic acids, respectively; 16:17c is monounsaturated palmitoleic acid, cyclo refers to a cyclopropyl group, 2OH and 3OH have hydroxyl groups at the 2 or 3 positions, respectively, and iso has an extra methyl group on the penultimate carbon. Both fatty acids are listed when mixtures could not be resolved.
To determine whether the LBDs select specific fatty acids from the larger pool, we subjected E. coli BL21 cells to similar GC analyses (Fig. 2). The bacterial fatty acids present in greatest abundance also bound HNF4, although there appears to be a degree of selectivity. For example, the fatty acids 16:0, 18:17c, 16:1 iso/14:0 3OH, and 19:0 cyclo 8c are present in greater relative abundance in the bacteria than associated with human or rat HNF4 (Fig. 2) (16:1 iso and 14:0 3OH are not distinguished by GC). In contrast, fatty acids 17:0 cyclo, 16:1 7c/15 iso 2OH, 15 iso 3OH, and 10:0 were bound to the protein in higher relative abundance than their presence in E. coli. Other fatty acids such as 18:17c and 14:0 were neither selected for nor against (Fig. 2). Therefore, although a wide range of fatty acids were found within its ligand binding pocket, HNF4 appears to exhibit selectivity toward a subset of those found in bacteria. Future experiments with mammalian tissues are required to determine which fatty acids bind under relevant conditions and whether the capacity of HNF4 to serve as a fatty acid sensor has physiological or pathological ramifications.
The fact that the fatty acids were persistently bound even after a multistep purification indicated that they were tightly associated. This was borne out by additional attempts to strip the lipids from the protein, as the fatty acids remained associated after dialysis and gel-filtration chromatography (data not shown).
The serendipitous presence of fatty acids provided an opportunity to analyze how ligands bind to HNF4. The lipid carboxyl group was readily identified next to the side chain of Arg226 and the methylene chain could be built to C12. Density beyond that point was weak, indicating that the remainder of the chain is either flexible or occupies multiple conformations. The cavity has an internal volume of 370 A3, calculated by the program Voidoo (18), which is almost entirely occupied by fatty acid. While this volume is within the normal range for nuclear receptor LBDs, the elongated, relatively linear shape of the pocket is atypical. Both oxygens of the fatty acid head group are ion-paired with the guanidinium group of Arg226, and one oxygen forms additional hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH of Gly237 and side chain OH of Ser181 (Fig. 3, A and B). Residues that line the internal surface of the ligand binding pocket are largely hydrophobic, including those arising from 3 (Ile175, Val178, Cys179, Met182), 5 (Leu219, Leu220, Ala223), 1 (Leu234, Leu236), 2 (Val242), loop 2/7 (Leu249), 7 (Met252, Val255, Ser256, Ile259), and 10 (Met342, Gln345, Ile346, Ile349) (Fig. 3B). In the "closed" conformation 12 of HNF4 does not contact the ligand, in contrast with other nuclear receptors where 12 in the canonical agonist-bound conformation often does contact the agonist.

C, interactions at the homodimer interface.
Although HNF4 and RXR are similar in terms of amino acid sequence, their ligand binding specificities are distinct. This is due in part to Phe313 in RXR, which points inward and directs bound 9-cis-retinoic acid upward toward 5 (19). The corresponding residue in HNF4 is Ala223, which, presumably because of the decreased bulk of the side chain, allows the fatty acid ligand to curl downwards toward 7. It is thus particularly interesting to note that F313A substitution in RXR leads to constitutive activation, due to the spontaneous binding of an endogenous fatty acid as we have seen for wild-type HNF4 (19). The fatty acid in the binding pocket of RXR F313A adopts a U shape, and density is interpretable out to the C18 position. In contrast, the side chains from residues Met182 and Met342 fill the upper portion of the HNF4 ligand binding pocket to prevent the fatty acid from looping around to form a U, and we don't see density past the C12 position. These two methionine residues of HNF4 are unique among nuclear receptors.
Helix 12 Adopts Two Conformations-- The two molecules within each dimer adopt distinct conformations. In the first, referred to as the open state, 12 is fully extended and contiguous and collinear with 10 (Fig. 1). The second molecule of each homodimer adopts a closed conformation, with 12 situated against the body of the LBD. The conformation of the "open" state is fixed by crystal packing between two open forms at an axis of symmetry. In the closed state, residues Leu360, Leu361, Met364, and Leu365 form a hydrophobic face on 12 that interacts with a corresponding hydrophobic surface on the body of the domain created by residues from 3 (Met182, Lys183, Leu186, Leu187, Leu189, and Val190) and 4 (Leu211, Ala215, Gly216, and Leu219). Residues Gln362 and Glu363 help to anchor 12 through hydrogen bonds with Lys350 in 10 and Arg212 in 4, respectively. Since fatty acid ligands similarly occupy the ligand binding pockets of molecules in open and closed conformations, the structural rearrangement does not appear to be required for ligand-mediated activation as has been proposed for other nuclear receptors (17, 20, 21). It is possible that to lock the domain in its closed and active state, both ligand and coactivator must be bound, but since our structure lacks coactivator, it does not test this hypothesis.
The Dimer Interface-- As opposed to many nuclear receptors that form heterodimers, HNF4 functions primarily as a homodimer (22). Consistent with this, the LBD of HNF4 crystallizes as a canonical homodimer with near-perfect 2-fold symmetry about the interface (Fig. 3C). A 1156-A2 surface of each monomer is buried at the dimer interface. A coiled coil interaction between 10 from each molecule dominates the interface, with hydrophobic side chain-side chain interactions (Phe325:Phe325, Leu329:Leu329, Leu330:Ile283, Leu332:Leu330, Pro333:Pro333 and Trp340:Trp340) along its length (Fig. 3C). Intermolecular salt bridges (Glu269:Lys300, Arg303:Glu327, and Arg322:Asp312) and hydrogen bonds (Gln307:Glu327, Glu311:Gly323, and Gln336:Gln336) appear to contribute to the stability of the interface.
MODY1 Mutations-- Of 14 mutations in HNF4 that have been found in patients with the MODY1 form of diabetes (5, 8, 9, 23), three encode substitutions within the LBD (V255M, E276Q, R324H). The side chain of Val255 (in 7) points into the ligand binding cavity where it participates in ligand recognition. While questions have been raised about functional consequences of the V255M substitution (24), the structure suggests that a methionine side chain at this position would partially occlude the ligand binding cavity and potentially alter binding affinity or specificity. Contact between Val255 and backbone atoms of 10 in the vicinity of Met342 is also predicted to stabilize the protein fold. Therefore, the V255M substitution might also decrease protein stability and reduce its concentration in cells or ability to homodimerize. Side chains from the other two MODY1-associated residues, Glu276 (amino terminus of 8) and Arg324 (9/10 loop), form an ionic interaction, and Glu276 forms a second ionic interaction with Arg317 (also in the 9/10 loop). Neither of these residues is involved directly in ligand binding, but mutations in them may influence dimerization. While the residues themselves are not at the dimer interface, the 9/10 loops of two molecules interact with each other. Since the residues help tether the 9/10 loops, it is likely that loss of interactions between Glu276 and Arg324 would destabilize dimerization.
Conclusions-- The LBD of HNF4 is structurally similar to the LBDs of other nuclear receptors. The presence of a fatty acid in its ligand binding pocket is especially noteworthy and should help resolve the controversy surrounding putative ligands for HNF4. From a structural point of view, the fatty acid appears to be an ideally suited ligand for HNF4. The carboxylic acid headgroup of the fatty acid ion pairs with the guanidinium group of Arg226 of the protein to fix the orientation, while the aliphatic portion of the fatty acid occupies a long narrow pocket that is lined with hydrophobic side chains. Considering this mode of binding, it is not obvious how more complex ligands might bind HNF4. It is thus reasonable to presume that fatty acids or related molecules might be the endogenous ligands for HNF4. The high apparent affinity of recombinant HNF4 for fatty acids suggests a similar situation for the native protein in mammalian cells, providing a mechanism for HNF4 to function as a biosensor for fatty acids within the cell. The structural features of fatty acid binding to HNF4 provide a useful starting point for identifying potential pharmacophores, but the search may prove all the more challenging due to the kinetics of ligand binding.
