0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, February 15, 2002, and in revised form, May 1, 2002.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	4	In adult mammals, the insulin gene is expressed exclusively in the beta cells of the endocrine pancreas (1-3).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	5	 This selectivity is controlled primarily at the transcriptional level through well defined promoter elements (4-6).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Although a number of transcription factors have been defined that interact with the insulin promoter and activate it in synergistic fashion (7-10), the action of these factors alone is not sufficient to explain the remarkable degree of cell specificity observed in vivo (9).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Most likely, additional transcription factors participate in achieving specificity.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	8	MODY1 is a monogenic form of diabetes characterized by impaired glucose-dependent insulin secretion in the absence of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues (11, 12).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	9	 This indicates that a beta cell defect is the primary cause of MODY and implies that MODY genes have a role in insulin production and/or secretion.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Consistent with this is the fact that four of the five known MODY subtypes are caused by mutations in distinct transcription factors expressed in pancreatic beta cells (13).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The striking MODY phenotype caused by such single gene disorders provides clear evidence of the important role of each of these transcription factors in beta cell function.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	12	MODY1 is caused by mutation in HNF4, a transcription factor of the nuclear receptor subfamily (14).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	13	 At least eight different mutations have been identified in MODY1 patients (15).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Four mutations result in truncated HNF4 proteins, of which two are nonsense mutations (14, 16), and two are frameshift mutations (17, 18).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The other four mutations are missense mutations that affect various domains of the HNF4 protein (19-22).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	16	MODY3 is caused by mutation in the HNF1 gene encoding a transcription factor of the homeodomain family (23).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Like HNF4, HNF1 is expressed in liver and beta cells.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In fact, HNF1 was shown to be a direct transcriptional target of HNF4 in liver (24).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Furthermore, a mutation in the HNF4-binding site in the HNF1 gene promoter produces a MODY phenotype (25).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Consistent with these observations, MODY1 and MODY3 show a similar clinical phenotype.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Recent studies (26) have shown that induction of dominant negative (DN) HNF1 in beta cells leads to alterations in expression of a number of beta cell genes including the insulin gene.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Because DN-HNF4 led to reduced activity of the Hnf1 promoter and reduced insulin mRNA levels (27), it was hypothesized that HNF4 increases insulin mRNA levels indirectly by increasing HNF1 levels, which in turn activate the promoter through binding to an HNF1 consensus sequence (28).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	23	Recently, however, strong evidence has been obtained indicating that this hypothesis may be an over-simplification and that the actual relationship between HNF4 and HNF1 may be more complex; it has been shown (29, 30) that P2, the major promoter of the Hnf4 gene in beta cells, is regulated by HNF1.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Therefore, activation of beta cell genes by HNF4 may involve more than a simple transcriptional regulatory cascade mediated through HNF1, as previously envisaged.

0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	148	Mechanism of Action of HNF4 in Beta Cells-- Expression of dominant negative HNF1 in the beta cell line INS-1 reduced the expression of several beta cell genes, including the insulin gene (26), and has similar effects to that of dominant negative HNF4 (27).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Furthermore, HNF4 is a transcription activator of HNF1 (24, 27), and mutations in HNF1 are responsible for MODY3 (23).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	150	 This raises the possibility that HNF4 may activate the insulin gene indirectly, through Hnf1 gene function.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	151	 In non-beta cells, the HNF4-dependent activation we observed (Fig.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	152	 1) may be mediated in part through HNF1, but the substantial reduction in the activation of promoter mutated in the HNF4-binding site (Fig.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	153	 3) indicates that a significant portion of the effect is mediated directly.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	154	To assess the significance of the HNF4 site in the insulin gene promoter in beta cells, and to test whether in beta cells HNF4 activates the insulin gene promoter directly or indirectly through HNF1, we used INS-1 DN-HNF4 26 cells, a derivative of INS-1 cells that contains a plasmid encoding doxycycline-inducible dominant negative HNF4 (27).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	155	 This dominant negative protein possesses a functional dimerization domain but lacks a DNA binding domain and therefore suppresses activity of the endogenous wild type HNF4.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Luciferase reporter plasmids controlled by wild type rat insulin I gene promoter or by promoter mutated either in HNF1- or HNF4-binding sites were electroporated into these cells.

0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	170	Identification of HNF1 and HNF4 as the mutated genes responsible for MODY3 and MODY1, respectively, has prompted efforts to establish the precise role of these factors in health and disease.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Because the MODY phenotype involves a primary defect in beta cells, the defective function of these transcription factors must be manifested in these cells.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Indeed, expression of DN-HNF1 and DN-HNF4 leads to clear alterations in expression of key beta cell genes, including the insulin gene (26, 27).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Because previous studies have shown that HNF4 is an activator of HNF1 (24) and that MODY3 can be caused by mutation in an HNF4-binding site in the HNF1 promoter (25), it was proposed that the effect of HNF4 on the insulin gene promoter is indirect, mediated through activation of HNF1 (27).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	174	In this report, we have examined the above hypothesis.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Expression of DN-HNF4 in beta cells led to reduced activity of both wild type insulin gene promoter and promoter mutated in the HNF1-binding site, strongly suggesting the presence of an HNF4-binding site elsewhere in the promoter region.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Indeed, we identified such a sequence between nucleotides 57 and 69 of the promoter, and we were able to show that it is capable of binding HNF4 in vitro.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	177	 We further showed that this site is essential for full activation of the promoter in beta cells and for efficient HNF4-dependent activation in non-beta cells.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Expression of DN-HNF4 in beta cells also led to reduced activity of a promoter construct bearing mutations in the HNF4 site.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The data therefore indicate that in addition to the previously recognized indirect action of HNF4 on insulin gene expression mediated through HNF1, there is also a direct action mediated through binding to the novel HNF4 consensus sequence in the promoter.

0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	5	Activation of PEPCK gene transcription by RA occurs through a multicomponent retinoic acid-response unit (RARU) that consists of two separate retinoic acid-response elements, RARE1 and RARE2, each of which binds an RAR/RXR heterodimer (4, 7).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Activation of PEPCK gene transcription by Dex also requires a multicomponent glucocorticoid-response unit (GRU), which consists of two nonconsensus glucocorticoid receptor-binding sites (GR1 and GR2) (8), and four accessory factor-binding sites (gAF1, gAF2, gAF3, and the cAMP-response element (CRE)), which bind COUP-TF/HNF4, HNF3, COUP-TF, and C/EBP, respectively (9 to 12).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	7	 A mutation of any one of the accessory elements results in a 50 to 60% reduction of Dex-induced PEPCK gene transcription in H4IIE hepatoma cells (11).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Any combination of the mutation of two elements nearly abolishes this response (11).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	9	Most interesting, RARE1 and RARE2 in the RARU are coincident with gAF1 and gAF3 in the GRU (4, 7, 9, 13).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The respective transcription factors are present in about the same abundance in the H4IIE cell nucleus, and each binds with approximately the same affinity to these elements.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Thus, it is of interest to understand how a cell responds to either of these inducers, whether different constellations of accessory factors and coregulators are used for each response and whether there is any functional interaction between the two units in the presence of both ligands.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	12	In this study, we demonstrate that the Dex/RA combination has a synergistic effect on endogenous PEPCK gene expression in both primary hepatocytes and H4IIE hepatoma cells.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This response is most dependent on the gAF3 and GR1 elements.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Upon treatment with Dex/RA, ligand-activated RAR/RXR heterodimers, GR, HNF3, HNF4, p/CIP, SRC-1, CBP, p300, and RNA polymerase II (pol II) are present on the PEPCK gene promoter.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Notably, the recruitment of p300 and pol II on the PEPCK promoter is increased upon Dex/RA treatment.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The important role of p300 is illustrated by the fact that its reduction results in a selective loss of the synergistic effect of Dex/RA, whereas a similar reduction of CBP has no effect.

0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	191	 There is a significant association of RAR and RXR to the PEPCK gene promoter in the absence of ligand, but there is a substantial increase of binding of both (2-fold increase) when RA is added to the cells (Fig.

0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	245	 By using PEPCK-LUC reporter gene expression with Dex/RA treatment as 100%, the induction by RA or Dex is 10 and 65%, respectively (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	246	 This is quantitatively similar to the pattern of endogenous PEPCK gene expression.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The Dex-induced response was reduced to 35% of the maximal response in p300 siRNA-transfected H4IIE cells.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	248	 By contrast, the RA-induced response was not changed.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	249	 The Dex/RA-induced response is, however, reduced to 37%, which is similar to the reduction of the Dex-induced response.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	250	 This result indicates that the synergy achieved with Dex/RA is abolished when p300 expression is reduced.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	251	 The Dex-induced response was also reduced to 29% in CBP siRNA-transfected H4IIE cells, and the RA-induced response was not affected.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	252	 The Dex/RA-induced response was only reduced to 53%, which is mainly because of the decreased response to Dex; however, the synergistic effect of Dex/RA on PEPCK gene expression still remained (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	253	 These results indicate that p300, but not CBP, is involved in the synergistic effect of Dex/RA on PEPCK gene expression.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	254	The Dex response was reduced by 50 to 60% in the experiment in which a cRARE was substituted for gAF3, which normally binds COUP-TF as an accessory factor in the Dex response (11, 13).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Thus, unliganded RAR/RXR, if bound to the cRARE, cannot serve as an accessory factor for the Dex response.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	256	 However, when RA is added, a robust synergistic effect is obtained, as noted above (and Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Although indirect, this suggests that ligand-bound RAR/RXR can serve as an accessory factor in the Dex response.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	258	The role of the accessory factors at gAF1, gAF2, and gAF3 (HNF4/COUP-TF, HNF3, and COUP-TF, respectively) is to increase the affinity of binding of GR to the GR1 element (21).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Thus, when GR1 is converted to a high affinity site, gAF1 and gAF3 have no additional effect on GR binding (21).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Likewise, when GR1 is converted to a palindromic GRE, PEPCK gene expression is at the maximal rate, and there is no additional or synergistic effect of RA (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	261	It is reasonable to presume that Dex and RA each induce the formation of unique transcription complexes and that the combination of Dex/RA results in yet another complex.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	262	 We began an exploration of this topic by using the ChIP assay.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	263	 As noted previously (18), GR is absent from the PEPCK gene promoter in the absence of ligand.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	264	 The addition of Dex results in a 13-fold increase in GR occupancy on the promoter (Table I).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Small amounts of RAR and RXR appear on the promoter in the absence of ligand; a 2 to 2.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	266	5-fold increase in the binding of both occurs after the addition of RA.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Interestingly, the Dex/RA combination has no effect on RAR and RXR occupancy, but GR binding increases from 13- to 21-fold.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	268	 This is in concert with the observation that RAR/RXR acts as an accessory factor to increase the affinity of GR binding and to enhance transcription (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	269	 The occupancy of the accessory factors HNF4 and HNF3 is not affected by any treatment, as noted previously (18).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	270	The promoter occupancy of PCAF, SRC-1, p/CIP, p300, and CBP was analyzed under the various hormone treatments.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	271	 There was no binding of PCAF under any of the treatment conditions (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	272	 This was somewhat surprising in view of the observations that RA-activated RAR/RXR heterodimers recruit PCAF to DNA segments that contain the typical DR5 RARE in vitro (26).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	273	 RA and Dex each recruit p/CIP and SRC-1; however, there is no additional binding when the Dex/RA combination is employed.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Indeed, the binding of these p160 family members is the same in Dex/RA as in Dex-only treated cells (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	275	 A different pattern was noted with CBP.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	276	 RA treatment resulted in more recruitment of CBP than did Dex treatment, and the Dex/RA level was equivalent to that of RA alone.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	277	 The most interesting observation concerns the binding of p300 to the PEPCK gene promoter.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	278	 RA and Dex each increase the binding of p300 by 2-fold; however, the combination results in about a 5-fold increase (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	279	 A similar quantitative change occurs with the binding of pol II to the promoter (Table I).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	280	 In concert with this observation, McGrane and co-workers (27) recently showed that pol II association with the PEPCK gene promoter is reduced in vitamin A-deficient mice.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	281	A key role for p300 in the synergistic action of Dex/RA was established by selectively reducing the cellular levels of p300 and CBP by siRNA.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Elimination of either had no effect on the RA response, whereas both reduced the Dex effect by about 50%.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	283	 The absence of CBP had no effect on the synergistic effect of the Dex/RA combination, but removal of p300 abolished the response (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	284	 CBP and p300 are closely related proteins.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Although encoded by different genes, they have several functional domains in common.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	286	 The designation CBP/p300 implies a common overall function; however, recent reports (28) suggest each may govern unique cellular events.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Mice with inactivation of a single allele of CBP develop a variety of hematological abnormalities that were not seen in mice that had a similar inactivating mutation in one of the p300 alleles.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	288	 By contrast, the selective reduction of p300 makes F9 cells resistant to RA-induced differentiation, whereas a similar reduction of CBP has no effect (29).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	289	The linear increase of the recruitment of p300 and pol II in conjunction with a nonlinear increase of the transcription response is not unexpected.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Veitia (30) has explained this in the context of a series of cooperative interactions between promoter elements/enhancers and transcription factors with a succession of coregulator proteins and ultimately the basal transcription apparatus.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	291	 The activation of the interferon- gene in response to viral infection is a case in point.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	292	 The synergistic transcription response of this gene is thought to be the result of the formation of a unique activating surface composed of a domain in the p65 subunit of NFB and the activation domains of IRF1 and ATF-2/c-Jun with the architectural protein HMGI(Y).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	293	 This enhanceosome recruits CBP/p300 to the basal transcription complex (31).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	294	 The likely participation of other components unique to the complex assembled on the PEPCK gene promoter in response to Dex/RA awaits further investigation.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	295	In addition to the PEPCK gene, a number of other genes that encode enzymes involved in metabolic processes have promoters that allow for a range of gene expression.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Examples include the tyrosine aminotransferase, fatty-acid synthase, L-type pyruvate kinase, insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins, and the glucose 6-phosphate catalytic subunit genes (32 to 37).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	297	 We have used the phrase "metabolic control domain" (MCD) to describe an array of DNA elements and associated transcription factors that provide an integrated response to a variety of signals (2, 15).

0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	300	 The proteins known to bind to gAF3 include COUP-TF and RAR/RXR.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	301	 It remains to be seen whether these proteins account for all of the roles played by this interesting element in the MCD.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	302	Insulin and glucose, by inhibiting basal and hormone-induced transcription (3, 6, 25), set the lower end of expression of the PEPCK gene.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	303	 The synergistic effect of Dex/RA sets the upper end and expands the repertoire of responses available from this MCD.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	304	 In this regard, it is interesting that RA affords no additional response in the presence of a high affinity GR-binding element (cGRE, Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	305	 6), which elicits an exaggerated response from this otherwise wild type promoter.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	306	 When considered in the context of the MCD, the PEPCK gene promoter may have evolved to have a weak GRE (GR1) which, when combined with the variety of other elements and cognate transcription factors described above, allows for a graduated response between off and fully on and therefore a very flexible means of adjusting the rate of gluconeogenesis.

0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Laboratory of Metabolism, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, October 7, 2003 , and in revised form, October 24, 2003.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	3	Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor hormone superfamily that is mainly expressed in liver, intestine, kidney, and pancreas and regulates expression of target genes including several serum proteins such as apolipoproteins, blood coagulation factors, P450s, and enzymes involved in glucose, lipid, ammonia, steroid, and fatty acid metabolism by binding to direct repeat-1 elements in their promoter or enhancer regions (8, 9).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Indeed, the expression of hepatic apolipoproteins, including A-II, A-IV, C-II, and C-III, ornithine transcarbamylase involved in ureagenesis, and CYP3A associated with xenobiotic metabolism, was significantly reduced in livers of liver-specific HNF4-null mice (10 to 12).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	5	 A second line of liver-specific HNF4-null mice was established where Cre recombinase was placed under the control of the albumin promoter and the -fetoprotein enhancer (13).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	6	 These mice exhibited a marked reduction in the expression of hepatic glycogen synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase, involved in gluconeogenesis, and reduced levels of E-cadherin, ZO-1, and CEACAM1 proteins that are critical for normal liver morphology (13).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	7	Liver-specific HNF4-null mice in the adult exhibited increased serum BAs, and expression of the BA transporters, NTCP and OATP1, was also reduced in these mice (10).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Whereas BA biosynthesis and transport are controlled to some degree by HNF4, it remains unknown whether HNF4 regulates the BA conjugation pathway.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Nuclear receptors are involved in the control of the BA biosynthesis and transport system (6, 14, 15), but the mechanism regulating BA conjugation pathways have not been analyzed.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	10	 BA conjugation reactions are catalyzed by two liver-enriched enzymes, bile acid-CoA ligase (BAL) and bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT) (1, 14).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	11	 BAL activities are associated with rat BAL protein (16) and human very long chain acyl-CoA synthase homolog 2 (VLACSR-H2) protein (17), but enzymatic analysis of BAL protein has not been performed in the mouse.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Because the mouse very long chain acyl-CoA synthase-related (VLACSR) gene, which is highly expressed only in liver (18) as well as rat BAL and human VLACSR-H2 genes, has a high homology to these proteins (16), it was reasonable to assume that the VLACSR gene might be the mouse homolog for the BAL gene.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	13	 On the other hand, BAT genes have been cloned from mouse (19), rat (20), and human (21).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The human BAT protein has conjugation activity with both taurine and glycine as substrates (21), but the mouse BAT protein only uses taurine as a substrate (19).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	15	In the present study, the biological function of HNF4 was investigated in vivo and in vitro using liver-specific HNF4-null mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These mice exhibit increased unconjugated and glycine-conjugated BAs in gallbladder bile and decreased expression of VLACSR and BAT.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Expression of the VLACSR and BAT was shown to be regulated directly by HNF4 via HNF4-binding sites in their promoter regions.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	18	 These results indicate that HNF4 has an important role in the maintenance of BA homeostasis by regulating BA conjugation pathways.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	19	Northern Blot Analysis Total liver RNA (10  microg), extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), was fractionated by electrophoresis through a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes (DuPont).

0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	123	  Free BAs and Glycine-conjugated BAs Are Increased in Gallbladder Bile of Liver-specific HNF4-null Mice Because the expression of VLACSR and BAT was decreased in H4LivKO mice, it was expected that free BAs are increased and conjugation patterns are altered in H4LivKO mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Most BAs in the H4Flox mice are also found as conjugated derivatives in gallbladder bile because only small amounts of free BAs were detected (Table I).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	125	 However, free BAs were significantly increased in the gallbladders of H4LivKO mice (Table I), indicating that the conjugation enzymatic machinery of the BAs might be impaired by decreased expression of VLACSR in the livers of H4LivKO mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	126	The conjugation pattern of BA in gallbladder bile was further determined by LC-MS/MS (Table II).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	127	 In male H4Flox mice, taurocholic acid (TCA) and tauro--muricholic acid (T--MCA) were the predominant BAs.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	128	 The concentrations of these BAs (Table II, upper) were decreased in H4LivKO mice, but the total amounts (Table II, lower) were almost unchanged (TCA) or increased (T--MCA).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Most mammals secrete BAs conjugated with taurine and/or glycine, but mouse gallbladder bile contains only the taurine-conjugated forms (18).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	130	 However, small amounts of glycine-conjugated BAs including glycocholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were detected in the H4Flox mice, and their levels were much lower as compared with their taurine-conjugated derivatives.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	131	 In contrast to the results with control mice, taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), GDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were increased in H4LivKO mice with GDCA and GCDCA being markedly elevated.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	132	 These results indicate that the conjugation pattern of BAs in H4LivKO mice is significantly different from H4Flox mice because of decreased expression of BAT.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Because glycine-conjugated BAs are increased and taurine-conjugated BAs are maintained in H4LivKO mice, an unidentified BAT that can use both glycine and taurine as substrates might play an important role in H4LivKO mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	134	Expression of the Mouse VLACSR Gene Is Directly Regulated by HNF4 To investigate why expression of VLACSR was reduced in H4LivKO mice, the promoter region of the mouse VLACSR gene was cloned (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	135	 A transcription start site was determined by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and five major sites were identified between  to 143 and  to 85 from translation start site (+1).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	136	 A putative HNF4-binding site and a GC box were found between  to 162 and  to 150 and  to 238 and  to 229, respectively (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	137	 To determine whether HNF4 has the potential to activate the mouse VLACSR promoter, several VLACSR promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	138	 When HepG2 cells, which express HNF4, were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the  to 194-bp fragment containing a putative HNF4-binding site was higher than that of the promoterless construct (pGL3/basic) and the  to 146-bp fragment (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	139	 The promoter activities of the  to 220-bp fragment was higher than  to 194-bp fragment, indicating that the nucleotide sequence between  to 220 and  to 195 bp, which are GC-rich regions similar to the GC box between  to 238 and  to 229 bp, might be important for promoter activity.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Furthermore, the promoter activities of the  to 256-,  to 1014-,  to 1435-, and  to 2219-bp fragments, which contain an HNF4-binding site and GC-rich sequences, were much higher than that of  to 194- and  to 220-bp fragments.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	141	 To determine whether HNF4 positively regulates the promoter activity, CV-1 cells, which do not express HNF4, were used.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	142	 The promoter activity of the  to 146-bp fragment was unchanged by cotransfection of the HNF4 expression vector, consistent with the absence of an HNF4-binding site (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	143	 However, the promoter activity of the  to 194-bp fragment was increased by cotransfection with an HNF4 expression vector.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	144	 The same results were obtained using the longer fragments, indicating that HNF4 positively regulates expression of the VLACSR gene.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Interestingly, the basal promoter activity of  to 220-bp fragment was increased in the absence of HNF4 expression, and the activity of  to 256-bp fragment was much higher.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Because a GC-rich sequence was observed in the region between  to 256 and  to 195 bp, the Sp1 family proteins might be important in activating maximal promoter activity in the presence of HNF4.

0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	153	  To determine whether HNF4 can bind to the HNF4-binding site in the mouse VLACSR promoter, gel shift analysis was performed (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Liver nuclear extracts from H4Flox mice contained proteins that bound to the HNF4-binding site (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Binding was diminished by the addition of excess amounts of unlabeled VLACSR probe (wild-type) but not by the mutated probe, indicating that a protein specifically bound to this site (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	156	 3C, lanes 2 and 3, the lower arrow).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Furthermore, these bands were supershifted by the addition of anti-HNF4 antibody, indicating that the protein bound to this HNF4-binding site was indeed HNF4 (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	158	 However, supershifted bands were not detected using liver nuclear extracts from H4LivKO mice (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	159	 3C, lane 9) and no specific complex, indicated by the lower arrow, was detected using the labeled mutated probe (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	160	 These results indicate that the HNF4-binding site in the mouse VLACSR promoter is capable of binding HNF4.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	161	To determine whether disruption of the HNF4-binding site and GC box decreases the promoter activity, mutations were introduced into the HNF4-binding site and GC box in the mouse VLACSR ( to 1014/ to 47)-luciferase construct (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	162	 4B, when HepG2 cells were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the HNF4 mutant ( to 1014/HNF4 Mut) was decreased as compared with the wild-type construct ( to 1024/WT).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	163	 The promoter activity of the GC box mutant ( to 1014/GC box Mut) was further decreased, and the double mutants for both the HNF4-binding site and GC box ( to 1014/HNF4/GC box Mut) had almost no promoter activity.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	164	 When CV-1 cells were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the HNF4 mutant ( to 1014/HNF4 Mut) was decreased to 40% as compared with the wild-type fragment ( to 1014/WT) in the presence of HNF4 (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The basal activity of the GC box mutant ( to 1014/GC box Mut) was decreased to the same level as the promoterless vector, but the activity was still increased by HNF4.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Furthermore, introduction of mutations into the binding sites of both factors ( to 1014/HNF4/GC box Mut) caused a marked reduction of promoter activities even in the presence of HNF4.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	167	 These results indicate that the HNF4 and a GC box-binding protein can activate expression of the VLACSR gene, but both are needed for the maximal activation.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	168	Expression of the Mouse BAT Gene Is Directly Regulated by HNF4 In order to investigate why the expression of BAT was reduced in H4LivKO mice, the promoter region of the mouse BAT gene was cloned (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	169	 An HNF4-binding site was found between  to 68 and  to 56 from the transcription start site (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	170	 However, the promoter activity of the 3078-bp fragment between the beginning of intron 1 and translation start site was not induced in HepG2 and CV-1 cells by cotransfection with HNF4 (data not shown).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	171	 To determine whether HNF4 has the potential to activate the mouse BAT promoter, several BAT promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	172	 When HepG2 cells were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the  to 136-bp fragment containing a putative HNF4-binding site was higher than that of the promoterless construct (pGL3/basic) and the  to 52-bp fragment (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	173	 The promoter activities of the longer fragments were much higher than that of the  to 136-bp fragment.

0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	191	 These results indicate that the HNF4-binding site in the mouse BAT promoter is capable of binding HNF4.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	192	To determine whether disruption of the HNF4-binding site decreases the promoter activity, the same mutations used in Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	193	 6C were introduced into the HNF4-binding site in the mouse BAT ( to 602/+178)-luciferase construct (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	194	 7B, when HepG2 cells were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the mutated  to 602-bp fragment ( to 602/Mut) was decreased to 25% as compared with the wild-type fragment ( to 602/WT).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	195	 When CV-1 cells were used, the promoter activity of the mutated fragment was decreased to 15% by cotransfection of HNF4 as compared with the wild-type fragment (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	196	 7C), indicating that the HNF4-binding site is important for activation of the mouse BAT promoter.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	197	Because the levels of unconjugated (free) BAs are very low in gallbladder bile (22), increased levels of unconjugated BAs in liver-specific HNF4-null mice appear to be due to decreased expression of VLACSR and BAT.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Because VLACSR and BAT are preferentially expressed in liver (18, 19) as well as HNF4, HNF4 is a central factor in the regulation of VLACSR and BAT in vivo.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	199	 An HNF4-binding site and a GC-rich region were identified in the promoter region of the mouse VLACSR gene.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Indeed, HNF4 binds to this HNF4-binding site, and the promoter activities were dependent on this site and expression of HNF4.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Furthermore, a GC-rich sequence was also important for maximal activation of the VLACSR gene because the mutated GC-rich sequence reduced its basal promoter activity.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	202	 It was reported that HNF4 and Sp1, a prototypical GC box-binding protein, binds to promoter regions of genes, including apolipoprotein C-III and CYP27, and increases their expression (23, 24).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	203	 In the mouse VLACSR promoter, HNF4 can still activate promoter activity when mutations were introduced into the GC box, but the resultant activity was much lower when compared with that of the wild-type promoter.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	204	 This result indicates that cooperative binding of HNF4 and Sp1 to the promoter might be required for maximal induction of VLACSR expression in the liver.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Furthermore, the expression of sterol carrier protein x, which is involved in the side chain -oxidation of BA, was also reduced in liver-specific HNF4-null mice, and Sp1 was identified as a critical factor regulating the sterol carrier protein x gene in an HNF4-independent manner (data not shown).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Because expression of Sp1 and Sp3, typical GC box-binding proteins, was unchanged and VLACSR expression is markedly reduced in liver-specific HNF4-null mice (data not shown), post-transcriptional modification of Sp1 and/or Sp3 could reduce the expression of VLACSR in these null mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	207	In addition to increased unconjugated BAs in serum, glycine-conjugated BAs such as GDCA and GCDCA were significantly increased in the gallbladder of liver-specific HNF4-null mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Because mouse BAT has no glycine conjugation activity (19), expression of an unidentified BAT gene might be activated in H4LivKO mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Actually a few mouse genes that exhibit similarity to mouse BAT were cloned, but their function is still unknown.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Expression of one of these genes (GenBankTM accession number NM_145368 [GenBank] ) was found to be increased in the livers of H4LivKO mice (data not shown).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	211	 However, it remains unclear whether this gene encodes an enzyme with glycine conjugation activity.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Furthermore, the physiological role of increased GDCA and GCDCA in H4LivKO mice also remains unclear, but these BAs in the intestinal lumen might change many aspects of intestinal and whole body cholesterol homeostasis.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	213	Recently it was reported (25) that a mutation of the BAT coding sequence causes human familial hypercholanemia that is characterized by elevated serum BA, and serum of homozygous individuals for this mutation contains only unconjugated BAs.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Because serum unconjugated BAs are increased, but most BAs in the gallbladder are conjugated forms in liver-specific HNF4-null mice, protein and enzyme activity of VLACSR and BAT might still be active in these mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	215	 In human disease, mutations in the HNF4-binding sites were reported in HNF1, blood coagulation factor VII, and IX (9).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Because HNF4 regulates many liver-enriched genes, human diseases might be found to be caused by mutations of the HNF4-binding sites in the VLACSR and BAT genes.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	217	It was reported that the expression of BAL and BAT is induced by treatment with ligands for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in rat, and this induction was due to the binding of FXR to FXR-binding sites in their promoter regions (26).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Because this phenomenon was not observed in mouse, regulation of both genes by FXR exhibits a species difference between rat and mouse (26).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Actually, neither VLACSR nor BAT gene was induced in wild-type mice treated with cholic acid, a ligand for FXR (data not shown).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Unlike other nuclear receptors including FXR, HNF4 is constitutively activated in vivo and in vitro without exogenous compounds (9).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Thus, HNF4 positively regulates the basal levels of expression of the VLACSR and BAT genes.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	222	 It may also be involved in the regulation of transporters such as OATP1 and NTCP that are required for hepatocyte uptake of conjugated BAs from the portal circulation (Fig.

0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Bile acids, conjugated by VLACSR and BAT, are exported from hepatocytes by transporters such as bile salt export pump located at the canalicular membrane.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Most bile acids are recycled and transported from the portal circulation back into hepatocytes by transporters including NTCP and OATP1 located at the basolateral membrane.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Expression of OATP1, NTCP, VLACSR, and BAT is reduced in liver-specific HNF4-null mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Note that HNF4 directly regulates the expression of VLACSR and BAT via HNF4-binding sites in their promoters.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	229	  Many nuclear receptors including FXR are involved in regulating the BA biosynthesis pathway and transport system (6, 14, 15).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Thus, these nuclear receptors also might have important roles in inducing or repressing the expression of VLACSR and BAT to regulate the BA conjugation pathway.

0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	7	This crucial step of intramitochondrial cholesterol transfer is performed by the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein (4, 5).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The ultimate demonstration of the indispensable role of the StAR protein came from congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, an inherited disease that leads to a dramatic deficiency in all steroid hormones and in which loss of function mutations have been discovered in the StAR gene (6).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	9	Because the StAR protein mediates the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis, its expression must be finely regulated.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Indeed, in human NCI-H295R adrenocortical carcinoma cells, hormone-stimulated StAR protein synthesis and steroid production are prevented by inhibition of RNA synthesis (7).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells in primary culture, mimicking the calcium signal gener ated by AngII leads to increased expression of StAR mRNA and protein (8).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Similarly, treatment of human NCI-H295R cells with AngII results in an increase in StAR mRNA levels within 30 min, with maximal levels being reached within 6 h (7, 9).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These results clearly indicate a transcriptional regulation of AngII on StAR gene expression.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Various consensus response elements have been identified in the StAR gene promoter (10).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Although promoter mapping studies have provided extensive information on activators of the StAR gene, the role of transcription factors that repress StAR protein expression has received less attention.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The best characterized repressor of the StAR gene is DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1), a member of the orphan nuclear receptor family (11, 12, 13).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that AngII powerfully represses DAX-1 expression in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells, thus leading to increased StAR expression and aldosterone production (14).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	18	Another potential candidate for a negative regulation of the StAR gene is chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF), which is usually present as two isoforms, COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII (15, 16).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	19	 These orphan members of the steroid receptor superfamily play distinct and crucial roles in fetal development of the nervous (17) and cardiovascular (18) systems.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In addition to these well-established developmental effects in fetal life, the following pieces of evidence suggest a direct or indirect interaction between COUP-TF and the promoter of the StAR gene and thus an involvement of COUP-TF in adult steroidogenic cell function.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	21	 First, COUP-TF colocalizes in the nuclei of the adrenal cells with DAX-1 and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), two transcription factors involved in steroidogenesis and in StAR regulation, and its expression is modulated in adrenocortical adenomas, COUP-TFI being lower in aldosterone-producing tumors than in normal tissue (19, 20) and COUP-TFII appearing to be increased in aldosteronoma cells (21).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In normal adrenocortical tissue, COUP-TFI and -II expression levels appear to be qualitatively equivalent (20).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Second, it has been recently shown that SF-1 and COUP-TF can activate and repress, respectively, bovine CYP17 gene transcription in Y-1 mouse adrenocortical cells (22, 23).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Third, a similar competition between SF-1 and COUP-TF for a composite binding site has been demonstrated for other genes involved in steroidogenesis, including human aldosterone synthase, aromatase, and murine DAX-1 genes (23, 24, 25).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Taken together, these data raise the question of a possible negative role of COUP-TF in the regulation of StAR gene expression.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	26	In the present work, we have therefore examined whether COUP-TFs are involved in the regulation of basal and AngII- or ACTH-induced aldosterone biosynthesis in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells in primary culture.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Our results show clearly that COUP-TF is a negative regulator of mineralocorticoid biosynthesis.

0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	127	 7C, lanes 2 and 3, nuclear extracts of bovine glomerulosa cells shifted the labeled probe, generating at least two bands.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	128	 When the nuclear extracts were preincubated with a purified antibody directed against COUP-TFI, the intensity of the shifted bands was dramatically reduced, thus suggesting that COUP-TFI binds to the proximal StAR promoter in vitro (lanes 4 and 5).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	129	 No significant differences in the intensity of the shifted bands were observed with nuclear extracts from AngII-treated cells (lanes 3 and 5) in this qualitative assay.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	130	Finally, this interaction was confirmed by in vivo analysis of the physical interaction between COUP-TFI and the StAR promoter, using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	131	 7, D and E, immunoprecipitation with a COUP-TFI antibody of nuclear extracts of glomerulosa cells, followed by real-time PCR of the StAR promoter, yielded a band of the expected size on agarose gel, indicating that the StAR promoter was immunoprecipitated with COUP-TFI and thus strongly suggesting an interaction between COUP-TFI and the proximal StAR promoter.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Furthermore, when ChIP was performed on chromatin extracted from AngII-treated cells, a marked and significant decrease in the intensity of the StAR promoter band was observed (61.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	133	Four main conclusions can be drawn from the present work: 1) COUP-TF proteins are abundantly present in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells in primary culture and are repressed by AngII and forskolin; 2) COUP-TFI and -II repress AngII-induced StAR mRNA and protein expression; 3) COUP-TFI and -II overexpression prevents AngII-induced mineralocorticoid biosynthesis; 4) COUP-TFI interacts directly with the proximal StAR promoter.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	134	First, in agreement with previous immunohistochemical studies performed in mice (18), we detected high basal COUP-TF protein levels in resting bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	135	 In man, recent studies have shown that COUP-TF expression is inversely correlated with steroid production in adrenocortical tumors (20).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	136	 These data suggested that this transcription factor could function as a repressor of steroidogenesis and that the mechanism of action of physiological activators of steroid production, such as AngII or ACTH (mimicked by forskolin), could operate, in part, through a reduction of COUP-TF protein levels.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Indeed, as shown in the present study, both AngII and forskolin strongly diminished COUP-TF mRNA and protein expression, over a range of concentrations similar to those used to induce aldosterone production.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	138	Second, we observed that COUP-TFI and -II repressed StAR mRNA and protein expression.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Because the StAR protein controls the rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis, we hypothesized that COUP-TF might act at this level.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	140	 COUP-TF is known to negatively regulate the transcriptional activity of SF-1 and to repress various actors in the steroidogenic cascade (23, 34), such as the gene encoding cytochrome P450 steroid 17-hydroxylase, by competing with SF-1 for the binding to repeated cAMP-responsive sequences spaced by six nucleotides (repCRS2) (35).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Furthermore, COUP-TF and SF-1 have also been shown to bind to overlapping binding sites involved in the regulation of the oxytocin gene in the bovine ovary (36).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Although multiple SF-1 binding elements required for hormonal induction have been identified in the StAR protein gene 5'-flanking promoter region (10, 37, 38), COUP-TF has not been reported, so far, to bind to the StAR promoter or to affect its activity.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Interestingly, our laboratory has demonstrated recently that the levels of another orphan nuclear receptor, DAX-1, which is known to repress StAR protein expression also by interacting negatively with SF-1 either directly or indirectly (12), are down-regulated by AngII and forskolin in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells and that this effect is correlated inversely with StAR protein expression and aldosterone biosynthesis (14).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	144	We therefore examined whether COUP-TF could repress StAR expression levels by overexpressing the transcription factor in bovine glomerulosa cells.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	145	 To overcome the usually low rates of efficiency observed in these cells when utilizing classical transfection reagents, we have used an HIV-derived lentiviral system yielding high levels of gene delivery in primary cells (27, 28).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Indeed, infected bovine glomerulosa cells expressed high amounts of exogenous, murine COUP-TFI and -II mRNA that could be distinguished from endogenous COUP-TF mRNAs by using species-specific primers for the RT-PCR amplification.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Moreover, we show here that overexpression of either isoform of COUP-TF resulted in a complete suppression of AngII-induced StAR mRNA and protein induction, a finding strongly suggesting a direct or indirect repressor role for COUP-TF on StAR promoter activity.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	148	 These results were indeed confirmed by luciferase reporter gene assay of the StAR promoter in cells overexpressing COUP-TF, which showed a dramatic reduction in AngII-induced StAR promoter activity.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	149	 COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII were equally effective in repressing StAR mRNA expression, although only the latter has been shown to be expressed in the cortex of the adrenal gland during organogenesis in mice (18).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	150	 However, both COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII have been shown to be present in normal and tumoral human adrenocortical tissue in immunohistological studies (19, 21), and we observed a similar expression pattern of the mRNA of both isoforms in bovine glomerulosa cells (data not shown).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	151	Third, at the functional level, we observed an inverse relationship between mRNA COUP-TF levels and AngII-induced aldosterone output, a finding that corroborates our hypothesis that the hormone acts by lifting the repression exerted by COUP-TF on StAR gene expression.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Interestingly, overexpression of COUP-TFs did not affect either basal StAR expression or basal aldosterone production.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	153	 This result was actually expected, in view of the robust expression of endogenous COUP-TFs in bovine glomerulosa cells, which presumably already exert a maximal repressor effect on these parameters in the resting state.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Only under conditions of stimulation with AngII, when endogenous COUP-TFs are repressed, is the effect of overexpressing exogenous COUP-TF visible, preventing the normal StAR induction and steroid production elicited by the hormone.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In addition, COUP-TF is certainly not the sole regulator of StAR expression, and other factors, such as DAX-1 and SF-1 (14), most probably also contribute to basal StAR gene expression.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	156	 This finding is also in agreement with clinical observations showing that COUP-TFI and -II protein levels are markedly reduced in steroid-producing human adrenal tumors, as assessed by Western blot analysis (19), but contrasts with immunohistological observations indicating that COUP-TFII is highly expressed in nuclei of aldosteronoma cells (21).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	157	 One possible explanation for this discrepancy could be found in the different methodologies used in these studies, as immunoblotting yields more quantitative measures than immunocytochemistry.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	158	Fourth, we have shown a direct physical interaction of COUP-TF with the proximal StAR promoter both in vitro and in vivo.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	159	 In EMSAs performed with a probe corresponding to a region of the proximal StAR promoter known to be critical in the control by SF-1 of StAR gene expression, the intensity of two bands was dramatically reduced by preincubation of the nuclear extracts with the anti-COUP-TF antibody.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	160	 This finding indicated that COUP-TF can interact either directly or indirectly with the StAR promoter.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Whether the two shifted bands represent complexes of COUP-TF with other proteins remains to be elucidated.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	162	Finally, ChIP assays allowed us to clearly demonstrate and quantify a direct binding of COUP-TF with the proximal StAR promoter.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	163	 The decrease in StAR promoter yield in the ChIP assay observed after AngII treatment matches exactly the repression of COUP-TF that we have observed, thus confirming that AngII lifts a direct repression exerted by COUP-TF on the StAR promoter.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	164	In summary, the data we have presented in this work indicates that the transcription factor COUP-TF, which is essentially known to play a developmental role in the adrenal cortex, is also implicated in modulating the differentiated function of adrenal glomerulosa cells, namely aldosterone biosynthesis.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Under basal conditions, COUP-TF exerts a tonic inhibition on steroidogenesis by repressing StAR protein expression, thus preventing cholesterol substrate supply to the mitochondria.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Challenge of glomerulosa cells with physiological activators of mineralocorticoid production lifts this inhibition by reducing COUP-TF protein levels and COUP-TF binding to the StAR promoter, thus allowing the StAR protein to be expressed in higher amounts, intramitochondrial cholesterol transfer to occur and, eventually, aldosterone synthesis to proceed.

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received September 4, 1998; Revised and Accepted October 27, 1998.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	4	The tissue-specific transcription factor HNF1[alpha] is expressed in kidney, liver, intestine and stomach of Xenopus.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We show that the HNF1[alpha] gene is transcriptionally activated at the onset of zygotic gene transcription and that this transcription is maintained throughout development.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Ectodermal explants of blastulae (animal caps) express HNF1[alpha] mRNA upon stimulation with the mesoderm inducers activin A and BMP4 as well as on overexpression of Smad2 and Smad1, the corresponding members of the intracellular TGF-[beta] signal transducers, respectively.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Beside these factors that mediate their response through serine/threonine kinase receptors, bFGF, which acts via tyrosine kinase receptors, leads to HNF1[alpha] expression, too.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These embryonic inducers result in a delayed appearance of HNF1[alpha] mRNA, excluding a direct activation of HNF1[alpha].
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In contrast, the maternally expressed nuclear receptors HNF4[alpha] and HNF4[beta] activate the initial HNF1[alpha] transcription, since overexpression of HNF4 leads to a rapid expression of HNF1[alpha] mRNA in animal caps.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Similarly, in entire neurulae HNF4 overexpression results in increased HNF1[alpha] transcription.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Therefore, we assume that the initial activation is dependent on maternal HNF4[alpha] and HNF4[beta] transcription factors whereas HNF1[alpha] induction by growth factors reflects the property of these factors to induce the differentiation of mesodermal and entodermal cell types expressing HNF1[alpha].
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	12	The differentiation of tissue-specific cell types during development of a multicellular organism is initiated in the fertilized egg by maternal components laid down during oogenesis.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Some of the most important maternal determinants regulating these early events include cell surface signalling molecules and their receptors as well as transcription factors.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The interplay of growth factors and transcription factors, which is best analyzed in Drosophila (1), is assumed to define the spatial activation of specific genes in development.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	15	In Xenopus, it is well established that maternal inductive signals emanating from the vegetal region of the cleaving embryo lead to a distinct pattern of gene expression in the equatorial region and thereby determine the prospective mesodermal tissues of the embryo (2).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These inductive factors are fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and members of the transforming growth factor [beta] (TGF-[beta]) family, with bFGF and activin A or Vg1 as the most significant members (2-6).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Whereas the FGF signal is received by membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptors, TGF-[beta]s act exclusively through serine/threonine kinases on the cell surface (7).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Intracellular TGF-[beta] signalling involves a class of proteins referred to as Smad proteins (7-10).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In Xenopus embryos, Smad1 and Smad2 overexpression in the animal cap mimics the effect of the TGF-[beta] family members BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein) and activin A, respectively (11,12).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In general, the Smad proteins seem to be phosphorylated at C-terminal serine residues by the activated type I receptor (13,14), form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 (15) and migrate into the nucleus, where they regulate the expression of TGF-[beta]-responsive genes by direct interaction with specific transcription factors (16).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Based on all these data Smad proteins are considered as essential intracellular components in TGF-[beta] signalling.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	22	In an approach to link maternal components with the transcriptional activation of a tissue-specific transcription factor we have investigated the expression of HNF1[alpha] in Xenopus (17-19).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This tissue-specific transcription factor found in all vertebrates is expressed in endodermal tissues such as liver, gut and stomach but also in the kidney, a mesodermal derivative (17,20).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	24	 As binding sites for HNF1[alpha] are present in several genes specifically expressed in these tissues, it is assumed that HNF1[alpha] participates in the establishment of the differentiated state.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Previously, we showed by RNase protection analysis that the first HNF1[alpha] transcripts appear at the gastrula stage and therefore HNF1[alpha] gene transcription is zygotically activated (17).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	26	 To reveal the regulatory elements involved in HNF1[alpha] gene activation we injected promoter constructs into fertilized eggs.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	27	 We identified a minimal promoter fragment of the Xenopus gene sufficient for proper activation of the reporter gene in swimming larvae (18,19).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The promoter elements mediating gene activation appear to be conserved in vertebrate evolution as the injected rat HNF1[alpha] promoter is also regulated in Xenopus.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	29	 By mutational analysis of the minimal regulatory unit of the Xenopus HNF1[alpha] promoter, an OZ element, two HNF1 binding sites and one binding site for HNF4 were characterized as regulatory elements (18,19).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The HNF4 binding site seems to play a predominant role, as it is not only sufficient but also essential for activation of the reporter gene (18).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	31	 HNF4 is encoded in a small gene family, with HNF4[alpha] and HNF4[beta] identified in Xenopus (21,22).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Both HNF4 proteins are expressed maternally and are present in a gradient from the animal to the vegetal pole (22).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Overexpression of rat HNF4[alpha] in Xenopus leads to the ectopic appearance of HNF1[alpha] protein in the head and tail of swimming larvae (18).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	34	 These data support the assumption that HNF4 resides on the top of a transcriptional cascade leading to activation of the HNF1[alpha] gene during embryogenesis.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Since ectopic HNF1[alpha] expression was analyzed only in swimming larvae, when organogenesis is already established, it is not known whether HNF4 is able to activate initial HNF1[alpha] transcription in embryogenesis.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	36	We have recently shown that activin A induces HNF1[alpha] protein expression in animal caps that differentiate into mesodermal and endodermal cell types (23).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	37	 By injecting various HNF1[alpha] promoter constructs, we could define the HNF4 binding site as an apparent activin A-responsive element in the HNF1[alpha] promoter (23).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, since HNF1[alpha] induction in animal caps was measured at the protein level after 3 days of culture (23), it is an open question whether activin A or its related factor Vg1, both reported to be maternal components (24-26), trigger the initial HNF1[alpha] gene activation in the developing embryo.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	39	In this report we investigate the effects of embryonic mesoderm inducers known to be present as maternal components in the egg on expression of the HNF1[alpha] gene and compare their inducing potential with the transcription factors of the HNF4 family.

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	69	RESULTS HNF1[alpha] expression starts with the onset of zygotic gene transcription at the mid blastula transition (MBT).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	70	To identify the factors involved in embryonic activation of the HNF1[alpha] gene in the developing Xenopus embryo it was a prerequisite to determine the temporal expression pattern of HNF1[alpha] mRNA by a more sensitive technique than previously used (17).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	71	 1) we revealed that HNF1[alpha] transcripts are absent in the early cleaving embryo between the fertilized egg (stage 1) and the mid blastula (stage 8) stages, whereas the first transcripts are detectable at the late blastula (stage 9) stage corresponding to the initiation of zygotic gene transcription in Xenopus (31).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The amount of transcript remains constant up to the late gastrula (stage 12) stage and increases by ~100-fold during further development up to the swimming larva (stage 42) stage.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The amount of ODC mRNA, known to remain constant in Xenopus development (32), was similar in all RNA samples.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Temporal expression pattern of the HNF1[alpha] gene in Xenopus embryogenesis.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	75	 At the indicated developmental stages as defined (46) total RNA from five embryos was isolated and analyzed by RT-PCR for the presence of HNF1[alpha] and ODC transcripts.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The time point of the mid blastula transition (MBT) when zygotic gene transcription starts is indicated and hours after fertilization are given.

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	78	), no RNA (H2O) or HeLa cell RNA are shown on the left.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	79	Therefore, HNF1[alpha] is zygotically expressed in Xenopus and transcription of this gene is maintained during all developmental stages.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Obviously, initial HNF1[alpha] transcription at the onset of zygotic gene transcription is initiated by regulatory components of maternal origin.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	81	The activin A signalling pathway leads to HNF1[alpha] induction.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	82	To analyze whether the maternal inducer activin A might initiate HNF1[alpha] expression we investigated at what time point activin A treatment leads to HNF1[alpha] gene transcription in explants of the animal pole of the balstula (animal caps).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Using RT-PCR we detected HNF1[alpha] mRNA in animal pole explants at 72 h after treatment with activin A (data not shown).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	84	 This late appearance of HNF1[alpha] mRNA is very similar to the induction we have seen previously when analyzing the effect at the protein level (23).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	85	 As treatment of animal pole explants with activin A in conjunction with retinoic acid enhances activin A-dependent HNF1[alpha] protein induction (23), we determined the time point of HNF1[alpha] gene activation by activin A in the presence of retinoic acid.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	86	 As indicated in Figure 2 the first HNF1[alpha] transcripts are detectable after 24 h of incubation (lane 4).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Since under these conditions both goosecoid and brachyury transcripts are visible already after 3 h of treatment (lane 2), HNF1[alpha] expression cannot be an immediate response to activin A signalling.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	88	 As Smad2 is known to be an intracellular mediator of activin A signalling (7,33), we analyzed whether the introduction of this downstream effector might also activate HNF1[alpha] gene transcription.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Using an mRNA encoding a Flag tagged Smad2 protein we could verify in a western blot using a Flag tag-specific monoclonal antibody that Smad2 protein was present in the injected embryos at the time of animal cap explantation (Fig.

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	167	 This establishes that HNF1[alpha] expression depends entirely on zygotic transcription and thus on activation by maternal components.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	168	Transcription of HNF1[alpha] is initiated prior to organogenesis but as the low amounts of transcripts do not yield significant protein levels (17), we doubt that HNF1[alpha] has a regulatory role in these early stages.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	169	 This is reminiscent of the early expression pattern of Xenopus MyoD, where the initial weak and unrestricted expression in the mid blastula stage is without significance for muscle differentiation (42).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	170	HNF1[alpha] is a late response gene to the mesoderm inducers.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	171	The present data show that HNF1[alpha] induction by activin A, BMP4 or bFGF is a late response and thus differs from the early responses seen for the goosecoid and brachyury genes under the same conditions.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The much delayed response of HNF1[alpha] expression upon addition of the mesoderm inducers implies that the appearance of HNF1[alpha] mRNA reflects the differentiation of mesodermal and endodermal cells that express HNF1[alpha].
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	173	 This interpretation is also valid for preloading of the animal caps with Smad2 or Smad1, essential intermediate components of TGF-[beta] signalling, that fails to produce an early response of the HNF1[alpha] gene, too (Fig.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	174	Since we have shown previously that in animal caps the activin A signal is received by the HNF4 binding site of injected HNF1[alpha] promoter constructs (23), we assume that HNF4 is the major factor acting in the mesodermal and endodermal cells differentiated upon activin A treatment.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Further evidence that activin A signalling and HNF4-induced activation of the HNF1[alpha] gene are separate events in the early embryo is provided by our observation that in gel retardation experiments using protein extracts from Xenopus gastrulae with combined overexpression of Smad2 and HNF4 proteins, no Smad2/HNF4 interaction could be identified (data not shown).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	176	 In contrast, such complexes have been found between the transcription factor FAST1 and the TGF-[beta] signalling molecule Smad2 that were bound to the activin response element of the Mix.

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	181	 We revealed that HNF4 is able to initiate HNF1[alpha] expression at the onset of zygotic gene transcription in blastula embryos whereas the mesoderm inducers activin A, BMP4 and bFGF fail to activate HNF1[alpha] gene expression in these early embryonic stages.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	182	Clearly, the HNF4[alpha] and HNF4[beta] transcription factors are good candidates for initial activators, since they are present as maternal components (18,22) and the HNF1[alpha] promoter contains a functional HNF4 binding site (18,19).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	183	 This potential link can be verified by overexpression of rat HNF4[alpha] or endogenously expressed Xenopus HNF4[beta]: in both cases we found an increase in HNF1[alpha] gene transcription at the early neurula stage (Fig.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	184	 This induction is very rapid, as animal caps injected with HNF4[alpha] mRNA contained induced HNF1[alpha] mRNA already at the blastula stage, when they were explanted (Fig.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	185	 This implies that HNF4 translated on the injected mRNA during early cleavage stages prior to the MBT had accumulated and activated HNF1[alpha] transcription rapidly at the MBT.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	186	 From this observation we conclude that the cells of the animal caps are competent for efficient HNF1[alpha] gene transcription if triggered with the appropriate signal.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The induction of HNF1[alpha] by HNF4 is a specific effect and independent of mesoderm induction, as other mesoderm markers are not expressed in HNF4-injected animal caps (data not shown).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	188	All these findings support the idea that maternal HNF4 is the initial activator of the HNF1[alpha] gene in Xenopus.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	189	 A loss-of-function study to test this assumption is difficult to perform, since HNF4 protein is already present in the egg and thus RNA depletion experiments are not possible.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Therefore, we introduced a fusion protein containing the HNF4 DNA binding domain and the putative ligand binding domain linked to the repressor domain of even-skipped of Drosophila into fertilized eggs.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Although this HNF4 repressor acted efficiently in hepatoma cells and was expressed at high levels in the injected embryos, we could not detect a significant reduction in endogenous HNF1[alpha] mRNA accumulation (data not shown).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	192	 We assume that the level of HNF4 repressor translated prior to the MBT is not sufficient to compete with the amount of maternal HNF4[alpha] and [beta] proteins (18,22) that had accumulated during several months of oocyte maturation.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In contrast, in all experiments where dominant negative variants of transcription factors have been successfully used to repress endogenous factors, e.

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In these cases inhibition is probably facilitated as the embryo is preloaded with the repressors prior to expression of the zygotic factor to be inhibited.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	196	Overexpression of either rat or Xenopus HNF4 leads to increased transcription of the HNF1[alpha] gene in the early stages of embryogenesis (Fig.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	197	 This is in contrast to experiments done with the myogenic transcription factor MyoD: in this case only murine MyoD activated ectopic expression of myogenic markers in Xenopus embryos, whereas overexpressed Xenopus MyoD was hardly active (27).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Thus, in contrast to MyoD, the activity of HNF4 is species independent, indicating the high degree of functional conservation of the HNF4 family members in vertebrates (18,21,22).

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Based on this high-affinity binding, such heterodimers have been considered to be the functionally active forms of these receptors in vivo.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	5	 However, RXR is not the only receptor capable of forming heterodimers with other nuclear receptors.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	6	 TR (17, 18), COUP-TF (19, 20, 21), PPAR (22), and small heterodimer partner (SHP) (23) have been reported to form heterodimers with other receptors.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Interestingly, although heterodimerization with RXR usually results in enhanced transactivation, COUP-TF and SHP seem to function primarily as transcriptional repressors (23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Heterodimer formation can generate many different combinations of receptors, particularly in the light of the fact that multiple genes and multiple isoforms exist for RAR, RXR, TR, COUP-TF, and PPAR.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	9	 As the expression of each isoform depends on cell type and the stage of growth and development, heterodimerization among all these receptors results in the formation of an extremely diverse group of receptors.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In principle, the enormous number of heterodimer combinations could cover a wide range of transcriptional activities, thus generating significant diversity in gene regulation.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	11	Herein, we show that estrogen receptor (ER) directly binds, through protein-protein interactions between ligand-binding domains, to HNF4, TR, RAR, and RXR, adding a complexity to the already complicated list of the heteromeric interactions.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We have also confirmed the results (29, 30) that newly cloned ER named ERss interacts with ER.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In parallel, COUP-TF (31), estrogen-related receptor 1 (ERR1) (32), and SHP (D.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Moore, personal communications) were shown to interact with ER, while this manuscript was in preparation.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	15	 We further show that coexpression of native TR, RAR, or RXR differentially regulates transactivations by ER in yeast and CV1 cells.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These results suggest that ER is a common interaction partner for a subset of receptors, and these interactions mediate novel signaling pathways in vivo.

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	31	  To confirm whether various ligand-dependent stimulations of the LacZ expressions observed reflect genuine ligand-dependent protein-protein interactions or simply ligand-dependent transactivations mediated by the AF2 domains (1), we reexamined the LacZ expressions with two previously defined AF2 mutant receptors, LexA/TR-LBD459 (33) and B42/RXR-LBDAF2 (36).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	32	 1B, the 9-cis-RA-dependent induction of the LacZ expression observed with coexpression of B42/RXR-LBD and LexA/TR-LBD was lost when B42/RXR-LBDAF2 was coexpressed instead, whereas the T3-dependent induction was specifically lost when LexA/TR-LBD459 was used.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	33	 When LexA/TR-LBD459 and B42/RXR-LBDAF2 were coexpressed, neither T3 nor 9-cis-RA-depedent induction of the LacZ expression was observed.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	34	 These results, along with our previous finding (33) in which the interactions of LexA/TR and B42/RXR were not affected by mutations into the AF2 domain of TR, clearly demonstrate that protein-protein interaction of TR and RXR are ligand independent.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Therefore, results of the yeast two-hybrid tests should be taken with caution that they may not represent true ligand-dependent interactions.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Thus, we further characterized these interactions using two additional methods (i.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	37	 mammalian two-hybrid tests and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-pull downs).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	38	ER Interacts with TR, RAR, and RXR in Mammalian Cells To examine whether ER binds to these receptors in mammalian cells, we employed a mammalian two-hybrid system that reproduces the heteromeric receptor-receptor interactions (37).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	39	 2, cotransfection of CV1 cells with expression vectors for VP16/TR, VP16/RAR, and VP16/RXR significantly increased the Gal4/ER-LBD-mediated induction of the Gal4-TK-Luc reporter gene activity (4-, 7.

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	54	 As expected, luciferase was not able to interact with any of the GST proteins (data not shown).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	55	 However, ER readily interacted with GST/TR, GST/RAR, and GST/RXR either in the presence or absence of ligand (Fig.

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	57	 In contrast, ER bound to GST fusion to the receptor-binding domain of SRC-1 (GST/SRC-R) (38) in an E2-stimulated manner (Fig.

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	59	 From these results, we concluded that ER constitutively binds to TR, RAR, and RXR through direct protein-protein interactions.

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Similar to LexA/TR-LBD, LexA/ER-LBD alone was an inert transactivator, either in the presence or absence of E2, of the previously described LacZ reporter gene controlled by upstream LexA-binding sites in yeast (33).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	70	 To gain insights into the functional consequences of these interactions in vivo, we coexpressed holo-proteins of these ER-interacting receptors in the LexA/ER-LBD-expressing yeast cells.

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	108	 First, a series of chimeric HNF4s we recently constructed to define the HNF4 homodimeric interactions and RXR heterodimeric interactions (10) differentially interacted with ER (our unpublished results).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Second, we isolated a few mutant RXRs that show specifically impaired interactions with ER while maintaining wild-type interactions with other receptors (our unpublished results).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Similar to the chimeric HNF4s, these mutations also reside within the I-box of the RXR, which was recently found to be essential for homo- and heterodimer formations (9, 10), suggesting that HNF4 and RXR exploit the conventional dimerization domains (the I-box) to interact with ER.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Recently, the DNA-binding pattern of the RXR was shown to be regulated by ligand-dependent modulation of its oligomeric state (dimer vs.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	112	 tetramer), and the tetramerization domain was defined to be distinct from the dimerization domain I-box (45).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Thus, further mutational studies within this newly defined tetramerization domain of RXR, as well as mapping the regions of ER essential for these interactions, will be required to clearly decode the oligomeric status of these ER heterocomplexes.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	114	The LexA-based yeast two-hybrid system presents two possible complications to study protein-protein interactions.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	115	 First, the full-length LexA used in this system contains its own dimerization domain, which could complicate interpretation of the interaction results, particularly where dimerization is a prerequisite for two target proteins to interact with each other.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Second, this system cannot distinguish between genuine ligand-dependent protein-protein interactions and ligand-dependent transactivations.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	117	 For instance, the ligand-induced stimulations of the LacZ expressions when LexA/TR and B42/RXR-LBD were coexpressed were shown to reflect ligand-dependent transactivations mediated by the AF2 domains of TR and RXR (Fig.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	118	 With these complications, other methods such as the GST pull-downs should be employed to probe protein-protein interactions.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	119	 The interactions of ER with TR, RAR, and RXR were hormone-independent in both mammalian two-hybrid tests and GST pull-downs, suggesting that the seemingly hormone-dependent interactions in yeast (Fig.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	120	 1) may have been the hormone-dependent transactivations of the AF2 domains.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	121	 The T3-dependent stimulation of the LacZ expression with TR-LBD and ER-LBD coexpressed (Fig.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	122	 1A) may have also reflected the T3-dependent transactivations of the AF2 domain of TR.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	123	 The basal interactions between these proteins might have been too low to detect in the yeast system, which, however, became detectable with an aid from the activated transactivations of the AF2 domain upon T3 addition (Fig.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	124	 1A; see the results with LexA/ER-LBD and B42/TR-LBD).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	125	The physiological implications for these interactions have been accumulating.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	126	 For instance, manipulations of T3 and E2in vitro were shown to potentiate or mutually inhibit effects of gene expression (40, 46, 47).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Environmental conditions that alter levels of circulating T3, such as cold temperature, were also shown to alter E2-dependent female reproductive behavior (48, 49, 50, 51).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	128	 TR was recently shown to attenuate ER-mediated transactivations from the vit A2 consensus ERE, which is not necessarily dependent on DNA binding, as the TR DNA-binding mutant was still able to inhibit E2-dependent transactivation (52, 53).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	129	 However, under similar conditions, we observed a modest enhancement of the ERE-mediated transactivations by either liganded or unliganded ER when cotransfected with TR (Fig.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	130	 The reasons for this discrepancy are not currently known.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	131	 In addition, retinoids have been shown to inhibit the growth of hormone-dependent breast cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro (54, 55, 56).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Nonadditive inhibition has been demonstrated between retinoids and antiestrogens, suggesting that each agent may produce common antiestrogenic effects.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Recently, synergistic interactions between HNF3 and HNF4 mediating apolipoprotein AI gene expression were shown to be further potentiated by cotransfected ER (57), in which the physical association of ER and HNF4, as described in this report, may play a role.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	134	 However, the physiological implications for the ER/SHP (D.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Moore, personal communications), ER/COUP-TF (31), and ER/ERR1 (32) interactions are not currently known.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	136	In conclusion, we found that ER directly binds to a subset of nuclear receptors through protein-protein interactions between ligand-binding domains, and these ER heterocomplexes led to differential regulation of transactivations by ER.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	137	 From these results, we propose that ER is a common interaction partner for a subset of receptors, and these different ER heterocomplexes should mediate novel signaling pathways in vivo.

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	152	Cell Culture and Transfections CV1 cells were grown in 24-well plates with medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped serum.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	153	 After 24 h incubation, cells were transfected with 150 ng of ss-galactosidase expression vector pRSV-ss-gal and 100 ng of a reporter gene ERE-TK-CAT or ERE-TK-Luc, along with 10 ng ER- and increasing amounts (50 to 100 ng) of TR, RAR, or RXR expression vector.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Total amount of expression vectors were kept constant by adding decreasing amounts of the CDM8 expression vector to transfections containing increasing amounts of the TR, RAR, or RXR vector.

0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	1	Department of Cell Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	2	It has been reported that increased Shh expression in the notochord results in the increased expression of HNF3ss in the floor plate and the subsequent appearance of other ventral markers in the neural tube (6).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	3	 This results in the suppression of the dorsalizing signals, induced by BMP-2/4 originating from the neuroectoderm (7).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The appearance of ventral markers within the neural tube establishes a dorso-ventral boundary, which is broadly described as dorso-ventral patterning.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The induction of motor neuron markers within the ventro-lateral region is coincident with this Shh-mediated activity in the neural tube.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Jessell and co-workers (8) have demonstrated that conditioned media from COS-1 cells that overexpress and secrete Shh can mediate motor neuron differentiation in naive neural plate explants.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	7	Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and belong to the orphan receptor subclass (9, 10).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Two genes called COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII have been identified in mammals.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	9	 COUP-TFs are capable of dimerizing with the retinoid X receptor and are known to affect the regulation of retinoic acid receptor, retinoid X receptor, and vitamin D receptor responsive genes (9).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	10	 COUP-TFs in general are expressed during embryonic development and are proposed to mediate essential mesenchymal-epithelial interactions that are crucial for proper organogenesis (10).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	11	 To that effect, mRNA of COUP-TFII has been detected in the mesenchymal compartment of several developing organs such as the kidney, breast, and prostate (10).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	12	COUP-TFs are expressed in the developing murine central and peripheral nervous systems.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	13	 It is hypothesized that these two genes play a role in regulating the developmental fates of diencephalic neuromeres by altering the expression of some of the key factors involved in cell fate determination (11).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Most importantly, COUP-TFII mRNA is highly expressed in differentiating motor neurons within the neural tube of a developing chick embryo.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Notochord transplantation experiments suggest that this increase in COUP-TFII mRNA within the ventro-lateral region of the chick neural tube is mediated by signals derived from the notochord (12).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Hence, we hypothesize that Shh, a secreted morphogen derived from the notochord, can elicit this increase in COUP-TFII expression in differentiating motor neurons.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	17	For our studies we used the P19 mouse embryocarcinoma cells that were previously used to study the retinoid-mediated regulation of COUP-TFs (13, 14).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Also, these cells exhibit some characteristics of neuronal cells when treated for extended periods with all-trans retinoic acid (15).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	19	 For our initial experiments, conditioned medium derived from COS-1 cells transfected with a mouse Shh expression construct was applied to P19 cells.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Later, an Escherichia coli-expressed N-terminal 20-kDa Shh protein fragment was used in our studies.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In this report we provide evidence that Shh can induce COUP-TFII transcripts in P19 cells and evidence to implicate a novel target element on the COUP-TFII promoter that mediates this Shh-induced activity.

0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Densitometric analysis reveals a 3- to 5-fold increase in COUP-TFII mRNA levels after adjusting for the GAPDH internal control.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	27	 B, COS-1 cells were transfected with pBKCMV alone (lane 1) or pBKCMV-Shh (lane 2 and 3).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The medium was concentrated to 1/20 of the volume and separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The gel was subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to a Western analysis as described in Materials and Methods.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The 20-kDa band represents the secreted form of Shh N-terminal fragment.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Lane 3 represents a membrane that contains the same media from lane 2 except that it was probed with a primary antibody that was preblocked with the specific antigen.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	32	  To ascertain the presence of secreted Shh in the conditioned media, we performed a Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the secreted N-terminal 20-kDa Shh protein fragment (Fig.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Results from these experiments suggest that immunodetectable levels of the secreted 20 kDa N-terminal fragment of Shh are only present in COS-1 cell-conditioned media transfected with the pBKCMV-Shh plasmid (Fig.

0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Since the signaling function of Shh is restricted to this N-terminal secreted fragment, we shall refer to this fragment as Shh for the remainder of this report.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	36	Induction of COUP-TFII Promoter Activity by Conditioned Media Containing Shh To identify the mechanism of this Shh-mediated increase in COUP-TFII mRNA, we analyzed the effect of the Shh-containing conditioned media on the COUP-TFII promoter.

0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	39	 2 the conditioned media containing Shh (lanes 2 and 3) can increase COUP-TFII promoter activity.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In a separate experiment we show that this increase can be elicited by adding 1 nM N-terminal 20-kDa Shh protein directly to COS-1 cells transfected with the p1.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Hence, it can be inferred that P19 and COS-1 cells possess the necessary factors to transduce the Shh signal.

0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	81	Characterization of the ShhRE in P19 Cells To further confirm that the region between -1316 and -1298 is sufficient to confer the Shh response, we used this sequence in a heterologous promoter function assay.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	82	 A 42-bp oligonucleotide (ShhRE) that includes this region and the flanking sequences was synthesized, and three copies of this oligo were placed upstream of a tkLUC reporter gene to determine whether this element confers Shh inducibility through a heterologous promoter.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	83	 In addition, four specific mutations, M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5, were introduced along this element and three copies of each of these mutant oligos were cloned upstream of a tkLUC reporter (Fig.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The resulting plasmids were then transfected into P19 cells, and reporter gene activity in response to 1 nM Shh was analyzed.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	85	 4B, three copies of ShhRE can provide a 5- to 7-fold increase in reporter gene activity in response to Shh (compare C and Shh).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	86	 4B, the M2, M3, and M4 mutations abolish the Shh response (compare S and S M1, S M2, S M3).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	87	 In contrast the M1 and M5 mutants were still capable of mediating this Shh-induced reporter gene activity (compare S, S M1, and S M5).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	88	 These results indicate that the nucleotide sequences defined by the mutant oligos M2, M3, and M4 are important for mediating the Shh response.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Hence, the point mutations introduced within the ShhRE that abolish transactivation must affect the binding of a putative transcription factor to this DNA element.

0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	97	 The resulting autoradiograph indicates that there are two specific bands (see arrows), which are specifically enriched by Shh treatment (Fig.

0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	109	The identification of this ShhRE provides us with a valuable tool to study the various signaling pathways that are induced by Shh.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Previously, it was reported by Ingham and his colleagues (17) that a binding site for the Ci (cubidus interruptus) protein is a consensus HhRE (GACCACCCA), since it mediates the activation of the ptc (patched) promoter by Shh.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Ptc is a downstream target gene of Hh and is part of the putative membrane-bound Shh receptor complex (18, 19, 20).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	112	 However, the exact mechanism of ptc activation via this Ci element remains to be determined.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Interestingly, the ShhRE found on the COUP-TFII promoter bears very little similarity to that of the Drosophila Ci binding site.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	114	 In our oligo competition experiments, we demonstrate that any changes in the core sequence (TACATAATGCGCCG) are deleterious to Shh-induced binding.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Also, a transcription factor data bank analysis revealed very little information as to the exact identity of the factor(s) that may bind this element.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	116	 The identification of this novel response element suggests that in higher vertebrates the pleiotropic effects of Shh can be mediated by multiple pathways, some of which may target the Gli (mammalian homolog of Ci) binding site and others may target novel elements such as the one in the COUP-TFII promoter.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	117	 5, the DNA-binding complexes in P19 nuclear extracts are induced by Shh.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	118	 The precise mechanism for this increase in binding is not known.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	119	 It is possible that Shh may simply modulate the activity of this factor(s) that binds to the ShhRE.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	120	 In agreement with this possible modulatory role for Shh, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) has been implicated in the Hh-signaling pathway.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	121	 In Drosophila, it is believed that PKA agonists can suppress signaling mediated by Hh.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Also, localized loss of PKA -/- activity in a Drosophila imaginal disc can mimic Hh activity even in the absence of Hh (21, 22).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Similar results have been obtained using a dominant negative form of PKA in the mouse dorsal central nervous system (23, 24).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	124	 These observations have led to the popular belief that reversal of a PKA-repressed pathway is one of the major mechanisms of Hh activity in Drosophila and in mammals.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	125	 However, we do not observe a significant decrease in our transient transfection assays when COS-1 cells are treated with both Shh and forskolin (90  microM) using the 3X ShhRE-tkCAT.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Also, forskolin fails to decrease Shh-induced binding in an EMSA using radiolabeled ShhRE (data not shown).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	127	 These results suggest that in higher vertebrates additional pathways that are independent of PKA may also be induced by Shh.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	128	 The identification of COUP-TFII as a novel target gene and the characterization of a ShhRE within its promoter may allow for the unraveling of this complex pathway.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	129	Our results provide a novel target gene for Shh, namely COUP-TFII, which can be exploited to study some of the intermediate steps in the Shh-signaling pathway.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	130	 In particular, COUP-TFII is a very well characterized transcription factor whose ability to affect the function of several other nuclear receptors provides an attractive target for the pleiotropic effects of Shh signaling.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	131	 However, the expression of COUP-TFII transcripts and areas in which Shh exerts its signaling activity may be limited to a few regions within the developing embryo (1, 10).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	132	The Shh homozygous null mice display the predicted phenotype based on the expression profile of this protein.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The Shh null mice display a cyclopia phenotype along with a loss of maintenance and organization along the axial midline structures of the developing embryo (25).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	134	 However, in the Shh null mice we can detect some COUP-TFII transcripts (F.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	135	 This observation suggests that COUP-TFII is not exclusively regulated by Shh.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	136	 These results are not surprising since COUP-TFII is expressed throughout mouse embryonic development in a wide variety of tissues (10, 11).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Also, we and others have shown that COUP-TFs are downstream target genes of retinoic acid and that their expression is increased by treatment with both 9-cis and all-trans retinoic acid (13, 14).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	138	We have generated COUP-TFII homozygous null mice to study the possible involvement of COUP-TFII in motor-neuron differentiation.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	139	 However, the COUP-TFII null mice die before 10.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Interestingly, no obvious change in the overall morphology within the ventro-lateral region of the neural tube is observed (F.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	141	 We believe that the presence of COUP-TFI transcripts in the neural tube may allow for some functional compensation of COUP-TFII, which may obscure any obvious defects in motor neuron differentiation.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	142	 We are currently attempting a localized knock out of both COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII in the ventro-lateral region of the neural tube to study the possible involvement of these genes in motor neuron differentiation.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	143	Our results have provided a novel target gene for Shh signaling in P19 mouse embryocarcinoma cells.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Activation of COUP-TFII, which is known to harbor a trans-repressor domain in its C-terminal 15 amino acids, may have important implications in neural tube patterning (26).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Shh has been implicated in enabling the notochord-derived signals to repress the dorsalizing signals induced by BMP-2/4 from the roof plate and or the neural epithelium of the neural tube (7, 27).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	146	 It has been reported that COUP-TFI can inhibit the BMP-4 promoter in fetal rat calvarial osteoblasts (28).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	147	 It is possible that temporal induction of COUP-TFII expression by Shh may serve to mediate this very repression in specific regions that are fated to become motor neurons in the ventro-lateral region of the neural tube.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	148	 In conclusion, our results provide a novel target gene (COUP-TFII) and a novel target element (ShhRE) that seem to mediate Shh-induced COUP-TFII expression in P19 mouse embryocarcinoma cells.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	149	 This finding will allow for the elucidation of the numerous signaling pathways induced by Shh.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received May 31, 2001; Revised and Accepted July 9, 2001.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	3	Relatively little information is available concerning the regulation of expression of the HNF4 gene.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	4	 A series of up to 10 DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS) in adult liver chromatin, spread out over 15 kb of DNA upstream of the start of transcription of HNF41, the initially isolated isoform (1), implies that its regulation is complex (13,14).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	5	5 kb fragment of DNA upstream of the transcription start site and its 5' deletions to analyze expression in transient transfection assays in hepatoma cells as well as in transgenic mice.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	6	 While the long fragment and deletions down to  to 228 bp showed similar activity in transient expression assays, only the long fragment conferred appropriate activity to a reporter gene in transgenic mice.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	7	 These results imply that the distal HS harbor important regulatory sites for HNF41 expression.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Several splice variants of HNF4 have been described (reviewed in 12), so it is assumed that all of the HNF4 variants concern alternative splicing events within a single gene region.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, the most recently described of them, HNF47, contains a unique sequence encoding the N-terminal portion of the protein and the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), implying that it is transcribed from a separate promoter (15).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	10	We have analyzed the regulatory role of distal sequences upstream of the HNF41 promoter and characterized a 700 bp enhancer conferring high activity and glucocorticoid induction to both a heterologous and the HNF41 promoter.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We have found LETF binding sites and glucocorticoid-responsive sequences essential for enhancer activity in a 240 bp sub-region.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Our results are in line with the requirement for upstream sequences for tissue-specific activity of the HNF41 promoter (14) and with glucocorticoid induction of HNF41 expression (11,15) and lead us to propose a model of biphasic regulation of this enhancer involved in HNF41 expression during liver development.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Dex induction was observed only in FGC4 (2 to 3-fold) and not in H5 cells and, with one exception, it was found only for the most active fragments.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Moreover, Dex treatment increased the activity of the 700/ to 34pZLUC constructs 2-fold, which accounts totally for the Dex induction of  to 6.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	88	A 240 bp region is sufficient for enhancer activity and Dex inducibility and is transactivated by HNF1 and HNF41 Deletions were performed in the 700 bp enhancer to delineate the sequences that are critical for basal and inducible expression (Fig.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Concerning the 5' and 3' deletions, in BspEI and B1E5A2 basal activity was strongly reduced compared to that of the 700 bp enhancer and hormone inducibility was abolished.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The sequences deleted between HpaI and DraI had a negative effect on both basal and induced activity because their loss led to increased activity.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Further deletion from DraI to AvaI caused a strong decline in both basal and hormone-induced activity.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	92	 An internal deletion, (BspEI to StuI), also strongly reduced both basal and induced activities compared to the 700 bp enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Therefore, three adjacent blocks of sequence lying between the PvuII and DraI sites are important for full basal and hormone-induced activity of the 700 bp enhancer, with the most 5' one (PvuII to BspEI) being the most critical for the Dex response.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Analysis of two central fragments, PvuII to DraI and BspEI to DraI, confirmed that an element required for hormone response is located between the PvuII and BspEI sites.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	96	Because it is known that the HNF4 gene is subject to cross-regulation by HNF1 and to auto-regulation (24,39 to 42), several of the fragments were tested for transactivation by HNF1 and HNF41.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	97	 The 700 bp enhancer is transactivated by both factors in H5 (Fig.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	101	 In addition, in H5 cells the 700 bp enhancer is transactivated similarly by HNF41 and HNF47 and less efficiently by HNF1ss than HNF1 (Fig.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	102	In conclusion, these results show that the 700 bp enhancer is transactivated by HNF41, HNF47, HNF1 and HNF1ss.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Furthermore, the 240 bp PvuII to DraI sequence contains HNF4 and HNF1 response elements and acts as a cell-specific enhancer whose activity is increased by glucocorticoids.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Furthermore, the HNF4 consensus site is included in a GRE consensus site which is affected by the HNF4 mutation while the HNF3 mutation touches a half-GRE consensus site.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	205	 These data show that GRE consensus sites intermingled with the LETF sites are required for maximal Dex inducibility of the 700 bp enhancer, as is the case for the C/EBP site in F1.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	206	A functional HNF1 binding site is essential for basal enhancer activity The 700 and 240 bp enhancers are similarly transactivated by HNF1.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	207	 A computer search for putative HNF1 binding sites in the 700 bp sequence using a weighted matrix (44) revealed three sites with high scores.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	210	 In DNase I footprinting experiments using purified recombinant truncated HNF1 protein (HNt) we demonstrated that the two most upstream consensus sites correspond to authentic HNF1 binding sites (BS1 and BS2, respectively; data not shown).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Then we tested the recombinant HNF1 protein by EMSA using double-stranded oligonucleotides containing BS1, wild-type (oligo BS1) or mutated (oligo BS1m) in order to abolish HNF1 binding (27).

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	225	  To investigate whether BS1 could mediate transactivation by HNF1 we used oligo BS1m to mutate BS1 in the 700 bp enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	226	 We obtained two mutant reporter plasmids of which one (BS1m*) contains an insertion of two G residues within BS1 in addition to the expected mutation.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	227	 As shown in Figure 7B, in H5 cells this mutant plasmid exhibited the same low basal activity as the B1E5B2 reporter plasmid but transactivation by co-transfected HNF1 was severely compromised, in spite of the continued presence of intact BS2 and BS3 sites.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	229	 These results thus show that BS1 is required not only for transactivation by HNF1, but also for enhancer activity of the 700 bp region in differentiated hepatoma cells.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	232	 C/EBP, HNF4 and HNF3 binding sites are located in the 240 bp minimal enhancer, PvuII to DraI, whereas an HNF1 binding site overlaps its 3'-end and two other HNF1 binding sites lie further downstream.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The C/EBP site and the first (BS1) HNF1 site are required for full basal activity.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	243	The 700 bp enhancer contains a 240 bp core sequence sufficient for both enhancer activity and Dex induction and within which three footprints (F1 to F3) have been identified.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	250	 The F1 to F3 and HNF1 sites exhibit the highest scores (90 to 100%).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	251	 This fact implies that the HNF41 enhancer is an important element that plays a similar role in humans.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	252	The C/EBP site is the strongest footprint in the enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Its mutation significantly reduces enhancer activity but only in cells that produce C/EBP, implying that this site responds specifically to binding of C/EBP.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Previously we proposed that HNF4 regulates its own expression based on studies of stable transfectants (24,42).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Our data here support such a direct auto-regulation mechanism because the enhancer core sequence contains a functional HNF4 response element.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	256	 In addition, HNF3 transactivates the enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	257	 However, while mutation of the HNF4 and HNF3 sites had only small effects, the introduced mutations impaired binding of the factors only partially.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	258	 The HNF41 enhancer is strongly transactivated by HNF1 and more weakly by HNF1ss.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Transactivation by HNF1 is mediated by a weak HNF1 binding site, which is also required for high basal activity of the enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	260	 A similar functional role of weak HNF1 binding sites has been reported for the mouse phenylalanine hydroxylase gene enhancer (21).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	261	 A functional HNF1 binding site in the HNF41 enhancer, in addition to the site described earlier in the promoter region (14), accords with earlier reports of cross-regulation between HNF4 and HNF1 (39 to 42).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Based on the strong response to HNF1, we propose that this factor plays a critical role in enhancer activity.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	263	In agreement with our observations, glucocorticoids have been shown to activate HNF4 expression in primary cultured rat hepatocytes (11).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Moreover, HNF41, but not HNF47, is induced by glucocorticoids in murine hepatic cells (15).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Maximal Dex induction of the enhancer requires the F1 to F3 region where three imperfect GRE and five imperfect half-GRE consensus sites were found, some overlapping with the F1 to F3 footprints (see Fig.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Although competition EMSAs using GRE failed to provide evidence for binding of GR, the presence of GRE consensus sites and responsiveness to Dex imply that GR binds to the enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Indeed, mutations introduced into LETF binding sites that affect GRE whole sites or half-sites compromised Dex induction, implying that these sites are functional.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Moreover, induction of the 700 bp enhancer was restricted to differentiated hepatoma cells, implying that a liver-specific protein(s) is required for the glucocorticoid effect.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Indeed, the LETF can synergize with GR to achieve glucocorticoid induction of the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) (45 to 47) and the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) genes (48).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	270	 A similar situation appears to exist for the HNF41 enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	271	At first sight, it is surprising to observe that the major transactivators for the HNF41 enhancer are hormone-activated GR and LETF that are expressed late in development, such as C/EBP and HNF1, even though it is known that HNF4 transcripts are first detected very early (2).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	272	 However, probes that do not distinguish between the HNF41 and HNF47 isoforms were used for analysis of early embryos.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Recent work from our laboratory has revealed that expression of the HNF41 isoform is strong in the liver only at the end of fetal life and at birth, whereas the HNF47 isoform is the predominant form of HNF4 in embryonic liver (M.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	274	Weiss, submitted for publication).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	275	 The dramatic activation of HNF41 that occurs just before birth could be assured, on the one hand, by C/EBP, whose expression is also activated at birth (49), and, on the other, by glucocorticoids.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Indeed, the TAT and PEPCK genes, which like HNF41 have enhancers in which glucocorticoid hormone response modules overlap LETF sites (46 to 48), are strongly induced by glucocorticoids at birth.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	277	HNF41 is thus expressed at low levels in embryonic liver.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Binding sites in the HNF41 enhancer do include transcription factors that are present in the developing liver.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	279	 HNF3 and ss are among the first LETF to be expressed in this tissue (50).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	280	 HNF1ss, known to be expressed before HNF1 in the embryonic liver (4,5), is a transactivator of the enhancer, as is HNF47.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	281	Although many studies have contributed to the notion that the group of LETF is subject to cross-regulation and to auto-regulation (4,5,8,9,14,24,30,31,34,35,39 to 42,51 to 63), this is the first detailed study of an enhancer regulating expression of one of these factors.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Furthermore, this analysis concerns one of the first of these factors to be expressed, HNF4 (2).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	283	 The results of this study are entirely consistent with the observed behavior of the HNF4 gene in vivo and provide a basis to explain its expression pattern.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Indeed, binding sites for essentially all of the LETF so far identified are present, including factors expressed early during development, such as HNF3 and ss, HNF1ss and HNF47, and others that are expressed a little later, such as HNF1, and in particular those that are up-regulated at birth, including C/EBP, HNF41 and, perhaps most importantly, activated GR.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Consequently, the properties of the  to 6 kb enhancer are consistent with it being involved both in the initiation of expression of HNF41 and in its maintenance.

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	1	(Received for publication, February 12, 1997).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	2	 Figueiredo  , Aldo Galeone  , Luciano Mayol   and E.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	3	The DNA-bending protein TF1 is the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPO1-encoded homolog of the bacterial HU proteins and the Escherichia coli integration host factor.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	4	 We recently proposed that TF1, which binds with high affinity (Kd was ~3 nM) to preferred sites within the hydroxymethyluracil (hmU)-containing phage genome, identifies its binding sites based on sequence-dependent DNA flexibility.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Here, we show that two hmU-A base pair steps coinciding with two previously proposed sites of DNA distortion are critical for complex formation.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The affinity of TF1 is reduced 10-fold when both of these hmU-A base pair steps are replaced with A-hmU, G-C, or C-G steps; only modest changes in affinity result when substitutions are made at other base pairs of the TF1 binding site.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Replacement of all hmU residues with thymine decreases the affinity of TF1 greatly; remarkably, the high affinity is restored when the two hmU-A base pair steps corresponding to previously suggested sites of distortion are reintroduced into otherwise T-containing DNA.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	8	 T-DNA constructs with 3-base bulges spaced apart by 9 base pairs of duplex also generate nM affinity of TF1.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We suggest that twin hmU-A base pair steps located at the proposed sites of distortion are key to target site selection by TF1 and that recognition is based largely, if not entirely, on sequence-dependent DNA flexibility.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	10	The genome of the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPO1 contains 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU)1 in place of thymine, and discrimination between T- and hmU-containing DNA is important during phage multiplication (1, 2).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	11	 For one phage-encoded protein, the DNA-binding and -bending protein TF1, this discrimination is essentially absolute: the high affinity of TF1 (Kd order of magnitude nM) for preferred sites within the hmU-containing phage genome is greatly reduced for the corresponding T-containing DNA (3, 4).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We recently showed that the affinity of TF1 for hmU-DNA is matched in T-containing DNA constructs that contain sets of two consecutive mismatches separated by 9 bp of duplex, indicating that hmU-content and appropriately placed flexible loops contribute similarly to complex formation.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	13	 We proposed, therefore, that DNA in a complex with TF1 is distorted at two sites that are separated by 9 bp of duplex DNA, sites corresponding to two hmU-A base pair steps, and that TF1 identifies its target sites through recognition of sequence-dependent DNA flexibility (5).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Here we examine the requirement for hmU residues across a 37-mer DNA duplex representing a preferred binding site within the phage genome (4) and specifically evaluate sequence requirements at the two inferred sites of DNA distortion.

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	20	Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments were carried out as described (5).

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The affinity of TF1 for the 37-mer hmU-containing duplex (Kd was ~3 nM; Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	30	 1A) was reduced 10-fold upon replacement of the two hmU-A base pair steps corresponding to the potential sites of distortion with A-hmU, G-C, or C-G steps (Figs.

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Remarkably, TF1 was found to have essentially undiminished affinity for DNA in which the two hmU-A base pair steps are completely surrounded by T-containing DNA (Kd = 4 nM; Fig.

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Our interpretation of these observations is that hmU content affords an increased flexibility that is recognized by TF1 and that hmU-A base pair steps symmetrically disposed about the center of the binding site are targets for specific distortion in the protein-DNA complex.

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The high affinity of TF1 was fully restored for DNA constructs with sets of 2- or 3-nt bulges with suboptimal binding for DNA with a pair of 1-nt bulges (Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Replacing the T-containing top strand of bulge constructs with the corresponding hmU-containing strand did not affect complex formation (data not shown).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Bulge-loops are considered to generate directed kinks in the helix axis (8, 9).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Consistent with the presence of such kinks, we observed a reduction in electrophoretic mobility of bulged DNA constructs, the magnitude of which depended on the size of the bulge (data not shown).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The mobility of protein-DNA complexes was similar irrespective of the nature of the DNA construct.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	88	The TF1 double mutant protein TF1 (E15G/T32I) binds DNA with ~40-fold higher affinity than does wild-type TF1 (10) due to interactions outside the central 25-bp region of the binding site (5).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	89	 The presence of bulge-loops in T-DNA affected the affinity of TF1 (E15G/T32I) and wild-type TF1 in similar ways, consistent with unaltered interactions for the mutant protein with a central DNA segment that includes proposed sites of bending (data not shown).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	90	The structure of TF1 reveals the presence of flexible -ribbon arms that are directly involved in DNA binding (11),2 as does the structure of the closely related HU protein (12, 13) and the recently reported structure of integration host factor (IHF) in a complex with DNA (14).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	91	 At the tip of the DNA-binding arms, TF1 contains a Phe residue at position 61 in place of the Arg found in all other members of this protein family.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	92	 TF1(F61R) has reduced preference for hmU-DNA over T-DNA (15) but was seen to retain high affinity for hmU-DNA (Kd = 9.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Substituting Phe-61 with Tyr had little effect on affinity (Kd = 6.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Replacing Phe-61 with a polar, uncharged residue (Ser or Gln) significantly reduces both DNA binding affinity and site-selectivity (15).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Notably, the affinity for hmU-DNA of both TF1(F61S) (Kd = 236  plus or minus  19 nM) and TF1(F61Q) (Kd = 685  plus or minus  48 nM) increased more than 5-fold for T-DNA with 2 3-base bulges (Kd = 36  plus or minus  2 and 90  plus or minus  7 nM, respectively; Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	96	 This is in contrast to wild-type TF1 that bound hmU-DNA and bulge-DNA constructs (1+2, 1+3, 0+2, and 0+3) with approximately the same affinity (Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	97	 T-DNA with sets of 4-nt loops, which also reproduces the affinity of wild-type TF1 for hmU-DNA (Fig.

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Apparently hmU content and flexible loops in T-DNA contribute similarly to complex formation for these TF1 mutant proteins, which are deficient in binding and bending of hmU-DNA (15, 16), whereas DNA with a static kink generates an increase in affinity.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	100	Our previous conjecture that TF1 principally identifies its preferred binding sites through recognition of sequence-dependent DNA flexure was based on an analysis of affinities for DNA constructs with sets of 4-nt loops (5).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	101	 For this mode of target site selection, the prediction would be for the sequence at the sites of distortion to significantly affect complex formation.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	102	 This prediction appears to be borne out both in terms of preferred base pair steps in the context of hmU-DNA (Figs.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	103	 1 and 2) but particularly by the significant effect of hmU-A base pair steps in a T-containing surrounding sequence (Figs.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	104	 We propose that hmU content confers a site-specific flexibility on the DNA duplex that is recognized by TF1.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	105	 hmU-A base pair steps that are situated at presumptive sites of DNA bending make the principal contributions to complex formation with TF1.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	106	 hmU residues at other positions that generate measurable, yet suboptimal affinities, presumably do so either due to longer range effects on DNA flexure or because of alternative placement of TF1.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	107	 An effect of hmU residues on the deformability of the double helix is corroborated by the increased affinity observed for other members of the family of type II DNA-binding proteins, HU and IHF, and for the unrelated eukaryotic protein, HMG1 (17).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Changes in complex formation by both major and minor groove-binding proteins and antibiotics induced by introduction of other modified bases have also been interpreted in terms of effects on DNA deformability by exocyclic substituents (18-20).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	109	Inferences about increased flexure of DNA containing modified bases stress the need for analysis of the associated structures and conformational energetics.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Structural nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of an A-hmU base pair flanked by G-C base pairs indicates no significant deviations from classical B-form DNA (21), although nearest neighbors do influence the structure (22).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	111	 13C or 31P nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation experiments may provide the required insights into the dynamics of duplex DNA the size of a protein binding site, features that are only poorly extractable from measurements using techniques such as fluorescence polarization and DNA cyclization (23, 24).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	112	 The suggested locations of DNA bends in the TF1 DNA complex coincide with two hmU-A base pair steps.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Considering the unique properties of the T-A step in terms of diversity of structure (25, 26), it would be of particular interest to determine whether the inherent deformability of the T-A step is accentuated in hmU-A.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	114	For a protein that bends DNA through a large angle (16), it is not surprising to find a greater affinity for DNA whose axis is kinked by unpaired bases (Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Indeed, similar results have been previously reported for HU (27).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	116	 We note that T-DNA constructs with pairs of suitably placed 4-nt loops or 3-nt bulge-loops generate the same affinity for wild-type TF1.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	117	 However, different structures and energetics of deformation are indicated by the significantly higher affinity for bulge constructs of the TF1 mutant proteins TF1(F61S) and TF1(F61Q), which are impaired in DNA binding and bending.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	118	 These observations are consistent with a static kink introduced by bulge-loops compared with a looser more flexible structure imposed by symmetric loops (8, 9, 24, 28); we suggest that pre-bent DNA bulge-loop constructs also permit complex formation with certain TF1 mutant proteins, whereas binding and bending of DNA with sets of 4-nt loops (or hmU content) require a protein-mediated introduction and stabilization of DNA kinks.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	119	Replacement of Phe-61 at the tip of DNA-binding arms with a polar, uncharged residue may render TF1 mutant proteins either incapable of producing specific DNA kinks, a process which would be aided locally by the presence of DNA bulge-loops, or deficient in securing the resulting DNA conformation, demands on which would be lessened in DNA with a predisposed orientation.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	120	 If TF1, like IHF, employs a totally conserved Pro residue to intercalate between specific base pairs of the binding site (14), then the deficiency of TF1(F61S) and TF1(F61Q) in DNA binding and bending may reside in their inability to stabilize a severely bent DNA conformation.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Phe-61 contributes to the striking preference of TF1 for hmU-DNA over T-DNA (15).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	122	 TF1(F61R) also has high affinity for hmU-DNA but a reduced preference for hmU-DNA over T-DNA (15).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	123	 In addition, IHF (which has higher affinity for a specific binding site in hmU-DNA compared with T-DNA (17)) relies heavily on indirect readout to recognize its binding sites (14).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	124	 If TF1 and IHF engage their DNA targets in an isomorphous fashion, the preference for hmU-DNA characteristic of TF1 may not be due to specific interactions between Phe-61 and hmU residues of the TF1 binding site.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Rather, the inability of TF1 to stabilize a T-DNA duplex that is severely kinked through intercalation of Pro residues may be alleviated by the more pliable hmU-DNA.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	126	 On the other hand, the possibility that TF1 does use Phe-61 directly for inducing DNA kinks at two hmU-A base pair steps remains to be established or disproved by direct structure determination.

0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received June 11, 1998; Revised and Accepted October 15, 1998.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	4	COUP-TF II is an orphan nuclear receptor that has no known ligand in the `classical sense'.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	5	 COUP-TF interacts with the corepressors N-CoR, SMRT and RIP13, and silences transcription by active repression and trans-repression.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Forced expression of the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF II in mouse C2 myogenic cells has been demonstrated to inhibit morphological differentiation, and to repress the expression of: (i) the myoD gene family which encodes myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins; and (ii) the cell cycle regulator, p21Waf-1/Cip-1.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In the present study, we show that COUP-TF II efficiently inhibits the myoD-mediated myogenic conversion of pluripotential C3H10T1/2 cells by post-transcriptional mechanisms.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Furthermore, repression of MyoD-dependent transcription by COUP-TF II occurs in the absence of the nuclear receptor cognate binding motif.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The inhibition of MyoD-mediated trans-activation involves the direct binding of the DNA binding domain/C-region and hinge/D-regions [i.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	10	 amino acid (aa) residues 78-213] of COUP-TF II to the N-terminal activation domain of MyoD.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Over-expression of the cofactor p300, which functions as a coactivator of myoD-mediated transcription, alleviated repression by COUP-TF II.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Further binding analysis demonstrated that COUP-TF II interacted with the N-terminal 149 aa residues of p300 which encoded the receptor interaction domain of the coactivator.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Finally we observed that COUP-TF II, MyoD and p300 interact in a competitive manner, and that increasing amounts of COUP-TF II have the ability to reduce the interaction between myoD and p300 invitro.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The experiments presented herein suggest thatCOUP-TF II post-transcriptionally regulates myoD activity/function, and that crosstalk between orphan nuclear receptors and the myogenic bHLH proteins has functional consequences for differentiation.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	15	The process of skeletal muscle differentiation involves the activation and induction of a large array of muscle-specific genes, and exit from the cell cycle.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The myoD gene family encodes myogenic specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins that activate and control this process (reviewed in 1-3).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	17	 MyoD plays a dual role during myogenesis, activating both muscle specific gene transcription and promoting cell cycle exit by inducing the expression of p21Cip-1/Waf-1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases and cellular proliferation (4-6).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Transactivation by MyoD involves: (i) the bHLH domain, that is involved in both DNA binding and dimerisation; (ii) the heterodimerisation of MyoD with the ubiquitously expressed E2A gene products, E12 and E47 (7); (iii) the binding of MyoD-E2A heterodimers to specific E-box motifs (CANNTG) in muscle-specific enhancers (reviewed in 1-3); and (iv) the recruitment of the cofactors p300 and PCAF (8-10).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The cofactors p300 and PCAF are critical coactivators for MyoD during myogenic commitment and differentiation.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The N-terminal acid-rich activation domain of MyoD directly interacts with p300 and recruits PCAF to form a ternary multimeric complex on promoter elements (8,11).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These events lead to hyper-acetylated and transcriptionally-permissive chromatin.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Moreover, p300 and PCAF coactivate myoD-mediated trans-activation of the p21 gene, and are necessary for MyoD-mediated cell cyle arrest (11).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	23	The transcriptional activity of MyoD is modulated by environmental cues related to the concentration of growth factors, receptors and oncogene products which promote cell division (reviewed in 12).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	24	 These agents inhibit the transcriptional activity of MyoD by promoting: (i) the direct phosphorylation of the bHLH region and/or the interaction with c-jun, which prevent DNA binding; (ii) the activation of inhibitor of differentiation expression (Id), a bHLH protein that lacks DNA binding ability, and functions as a dominant negative; and (iii) the suppression/sequestering of myogenic specific transcription factors and cofactors.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	25	The orphan nuclear receptors COUP-TF II, Rev-erbA and RVR are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and are abundantly expressed in proliferating myoblasts (12-15).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	26	 However, the expression of this group of receptors is repressed during differentiation.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Constitutive expression of COUP-TF II cDNA in mouse C2 myogenic cells blocks morphological differentiation by suppressing the levels of myoD mRNA, increasing cyclin D1 protein levels, and blocking the induction of myogenin and p21 mRNAs after serum withdrawal (14,16).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The molecular basis for these effects has not been elucidated.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	29	COUP-TF IIis ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues, and regulated by the morphogen, sonic hedgehog (17).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	30	 During embryogenesis, COUP-TF II is expressed in the developing CNS in a spatio-temporal manner (18,19), and in the dermatomial region of the somite at 10 days post coitum, which will give rise to the axial skeletal and tongue muscle (20).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	31	 COUP-TF proteins are highly expressed in many other developing organs and the expression level decreases with completion of differentiation, suggesting that COUP-TF is involved in organogenesis (21,22).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	32	 COUP-TF binds to direct and inverted repeats of the RGGTCA motif spaced by 0-12 nt (23-26).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	33	COUP-TF isoforms I and II have been demonstrated to: (i) repress hormonal trans-activation of target genes by the nuclear receptor family (23-26); (ii) repress trans-activation by the potent GAL4VP16 chimera (16); (iii) interact with TFIIB; and (iv) negatively regulate the transcription of many other genes(e.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Apolipoprotein AI gene) (21,27-29).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Inhibition of trans-cription by COUP-TF II has been shown to be mediated by two main mechanisms, active repression and transrepression (30).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Active repression by COUP-TF involves direct binding and competition for the occupancy of a common response element (31).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Transrepression involves inhibition of transcription by COUP-TF II in the absence of its cognate binding motif, or independent of nucleic acid binding (30).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Interestingly, we (16) and Achatz et al.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	39	 (30) have demonstrated that the DNA binding domain (DBD)/C-region of COUP-TF II is necessary for transrepression.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The molecular mechanism underlying COUP-TF II transrepression is unclear; however, it has been suggested that direct protein-protein interactions between COUP-TF and essential cofactors may be involved.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Whether COUP-TF II directly regulates the transcription of the bHLH regulators is unclear.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Furthermore, the fact that COUP-TF II represses transcription in the presence and absence of its cognate binding motif raises the scenario that COUP-TF II may control MyoD activity or the formation of the functional MyoD ternary complex.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	43	Active repression by COUP-TF II is mediated by the nuclear corepressors (i.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	44	 N-CoR/RIP13 and SMRT/TRAC-2) (16,32-35).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Corepressors actively repress transcription by: (i) interacting with Sin3A/B and recruiting histone deacetylases (i.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	46	 HDAc-1 or Rpd3) which actively promote chromatin condensation via hypo-acetylation of the chromatin (36-39); and (ii) binding key components of the basal transcriptional machinery (i.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	47	 TFIIB, TAFII32 and TAFII70) (40).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	48	 In the present study, we demonstrate that that repression of MyoD-mediated transactivation by COUP-TF II involves direct binding to MyoD and p300.

0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	98	We have previously demonstrated that proliferating C2C12 myoblasts express COUP-TF II mRNA and that constitutive expression of COUP-TF II cDNA in mouse C2 myogenic cells blocks morphological differentiation by suppressing the expression levels of the myoD gene family and critical cell cycle regulators (14,15).

0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	225	 aa 78-213), was sufficient to interact with the RID of p300.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Interestingly, the VP16-COUP-TF II chimeras 1/2 and 1/3, which contain only part of the DBD (i.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	227	 from aa 134), were not able to interact with the RID of p300, suggesting that the entire DBD is required for binding.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	228	To confirm that COUP-TF II and p300 interact directly, we used the in vitro GST pulldown assay.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Equal quantities of glutathione agarose-immobilised GST (negative control) and GST-COUP-TF II full-length and various sub-domains (GST-COUP-TF II AB, GST-COUP-TF II ABCD, GST-COUP-TF II CD, GST-COUP-TF II CDE and GST-COUP-TF II DE) were incubated with in vitro 35S-radiolabelled full-length p300.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	230	 The resulting pulldown clearly showed a direct interaction between full-length COUP-TF II and in vitro translated p300 (Fig.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Furthermore, the CD region of COUP-TF II, spanning aa 78-213, is required for the interaction with p300 (Fig.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Interestingly, this is the same region that interacts with MyoD.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	233	 It should be noted that the ABCD and CDE regions of COUP-TF II are also sufficient to repress the MyoD-dependent conversion of C3H10T1/2 cells and that the DBD of COUP-TF II (aa 79-144) is essential for the repression of trans-activation in the absence of the cognate binding motif and nucleic acid binding.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	234	COUP-TF II, p300 and MyoD interact in a competitive manner.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	235	We then embarked on experiments designed to analyse whether competitive binding between these interacting proteins was an issue with respect to the formation of a ternary complex.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	236	 We examined the ability of increasing amounts of COUP-TF II CDE to affect the efficiency of interaction between GST-MyoD and radiolabelled p300 (Fig.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	237	 We observed that increasing amounts of radiolabelled COUP-TF II CDE reduced the ability of a fixed amount of 35S-labelled p300 to interact with GST-MyoD.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Similarly, we observed that increasing amounts of myoD reduced the ability of p300 to interact with COUP-TF II (Fig.

0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	242	 In each pulldown, the input lanes represent ~10% of the total protein.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	243	 (B) Glutathione-immobilised GST-COUP-TF II protein was incubated with 1  microl of 35S-radiolabelled p300 and either 2, 4 or 8  microl of radiolabelled MyoD as indicated.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	244	This suggested that the interaction between COUP-TF II, p300 and myoD is competitive in nature, and that COUP-TF II may be involved in the process that regulates the interaction between MyoD and its cofactor, p300, which is essential for trans-activation of gene expression.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	245	The regulation of myogenesis (i.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	246	 muscle differentiation) is intimately controlled by a group of muscle specific bHLH proteins encoded by the myoD gene family (myoD, myogenin, myf-5, MRF-4) (reviewed in 1-3).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The products of the myoD gene family are involved in a variety of protein-protein interactions with many factors that mediate transcription [e.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	248	 E12 and E47, TFIIB; 7,44], control the cell cycle (e.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	249	 RB; 45), and regulate chromatin accessibility and architecture (p300 and PCAF; 11).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	250	 These protein-protein interactions regulate cellular proliferation and activate myogenic specific transcription that encodes the contractile phenotype.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Insights into the process of myogenesis have been provided by the myoD gene family of transcription factors, because they function at the nexus of command circuits that control the mutually exclusive events of division and differentiation.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	252	The nuclear receptor superfamily are potent regulators of development, differentiation, homeostasis and organ physiology; however, their functional role in mammalian muscle differentiation, regulation of MyoD and myogenesis has only been resolved at a descriptive level.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	253	 The classical ligand activated nuclear receptors (e.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	254	 thyroid hormone receptor) promote differentiation and muscle maturation in vivo (12,46).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	255	 However, the orphan nuclear receptors including Rev-erb[alpha], RVR and COUP-TF II, which are abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle and proliferating myogenic cells, antagonistically regulate muscle differentiation and appear to be involved in the maintenance of the proliferative state (13-15).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	256	This study was directed toward identifying some of the mechanistic aspects of orphan nuclear receptor-mediated repression of muscle differentiation and myogenic conversion.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Our work suggested that repression of MyoD-mediated trans-activation and myogenic conversion by COUP-TF II involves direct interactions with MyoD and its coactivator, p300.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Furthermore, the study provides another line of evidence in a biological context which demonstrates that COUP-TF II-mediated repression of MyoD-dependent trans-activation occurs in the absence of the orphan receptor cognate binding motif.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	259	 This observation strengthens the view that trans-repression by COUP-TF II has a functional role during mammalian muscle differentiation.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Finally, it demonstrates that direct crosstalk between the orphan nuclear receptor and bHLH pathways has functional consequences for the regulation of differentiation and phenotypic acquisition.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	261	 This mode of action and crosstalk between two central regulatory components may turn out to be utilised in other pathways of mammalian differentiation.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	262	Specifically, our study showed that COUP-TF II could repress MyoD-mediated myogenic conversion of pluripotential 10T1/2 cells, when myoD expression was driven by a viral promoter refractory to COUP-TF II action.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	263	 This immunochemical analysis suggested that the CDE region (but not the N-terminal AB region) of COUP-TF II was necessary for the repression of myoD-mediated myogenic conversion.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	264	 In particular, the C and D regions of the orphan receptor, between aa residues 78 and 213, which encode the DBD and hinge region, respectively, were specifically involved in these events.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	265	 We observed that a MyoD-dependent reporter gene driven by four multimerised MyoD binding sites (from the MCK-enhancer), cloned upstream of the herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter, was specifically inhibited by COUP-TF II expression.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Our study suggested that one of the mechanisms involved in this process of repression was the direct interaction between MyoD and COUP-TF II.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Additional in vitro experiments demonstrated that the interaction was mediated by the acid-rich N-terminal activation domain of MyoD (which also mediates p300 binding) and the CD region of COUP-TF II.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Furthermore, COUP-TF II interacted with the N-terminal RID (aa 1-149) of the cofactor p300.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	269	 This is perhaps not surprising, since many other classical ligand activated nuclear receptors (e.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	270	) interact with the coactivator p300 (42).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	271	 However, the fact that the DBD (C-region) and hinge/D-region of COUP-TF II mediate the interaction to p300 and MyoD is novel, and perhaps suprising.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	272	 With respect to the in vitro and in vivo requirement of the COUP-TF II DBD and hinge region (aa 79-213) as a dimerisation interface for myoD and p300, it should be mentioned that this domain contains the DR and T box motifs, which have been implicated as dimerisation interfaces in RXR (and other nuclear receptors).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Furthermore, they are highly homologous to the similar motifs found in RXR, which is expected, since COUP-TF II and RXR belong to the same nuclear receptor sub-family (47,48).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	274	 The DR box has been strongly implicated in the heterodimerisation of TR and RAR with RXR.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	275	 The DR boxes in RXR[gamma] and COUP-TF II are highly homologous.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Similarly, the T-box sequence that forms a third helix in RXR, and is implicated in homo- and heterodimerisation, is very similar in COUP-TF II and RXR (49-53).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Recently, COUP-TF II and SpI have been demonstrated to synergistically regulate the transcription of the HIV type I LTR (54).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	278	 In support of our observations, they demonstrated that the in vitro and in vivo physical interaction with SpI is mediated by the DBD of COUP-TF.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Furthermore, the Octamer transcription factors are recruited by the C-region (DBD) of the glucocorticoid receptor (55).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	280	COUP-TF II-mediated repression of trans-activation involves the cofactor p300, since co-expression with p300 alleviates the silencing of transcription.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Our study suggested that repression may involve sequestration of this vital cofactor for myoD-mediated trans-activation, since COUP-TF II directly interacts with p300.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Whether inhibition of MyoD-dependent trans-activation by COUP-TF II binding is a result of: (i) a conformational change in MyoD (which is detrimental to function); (ii) a prevention of p300/cofactor/coactivator binding; (iii) and/or sequestering of cofactors (e.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	283	 p300) by COUP-TF II is unclear at present.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	284	 However, the in vitro GST-pulldown data does suggest that MyoD, COUP-TF II and p300 interact in a competitive manner, and that increasing amounts of COUP-TF II have the ability to reduce the interaction between myoD and p300 in vitro.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	285	Achatz and colleagues have demonstrated that repression of transcription by COUP-TF II activity is dependent on the DBD and a segment spanning aa residues 193-399 (30).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Single point mutations in the DBD that ablated sequence-specific binding did not affect the silencing of transcription.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	287	 (16) demonstrated that the repression of GAL4VP16-mediated trans-activation involves the DBD of COUP-TF II in the absence of its cognate binding motif.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Achatz suggested that the regions critical for repression of trans-activation by COUP-TF II were involved in mediating protein-protein interactions.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	289	 In the present study, we show that the DBD and hinge region of COUP-TF II alone are sufficient to bind either MyoD or p300.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Deletions of COUP-TF II that contain only part of the DBD (i.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	291	 from aa 134), however, are not able to interact with the RID of p300, suggesting that the entire DBD is required for binding.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Although the DBD and hinge region functions as a dimerisation interface in COUP-TF II, we also observed that the presence of the E-region strengthens the specificity of the interaction (G.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	293	 While this manuscript was being reviewed, it was demonstrated by Froeschle et al.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	294	 (56) that the DBD of the retinoic acid receptor also directly interacts with MyoD.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Our data and the above data suggested that the DBD of the nuclear receptors may also encode a dimerisation interface for the bHLH family of proteins.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	296	Forced expression of COUP-TF II in C2 myogenic cells blocks differentiation and in particular ablates the induction of p21 mRNA expression (14).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Moreover, in normal proliferating C2 cells, COUP-TF II mRNA is expressed, however, during cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation, the mRNA levels are repressed (15).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Transcription of the p21 gene is specifically stimulated by MyoD during myogenic differentiation, and is coactivated by a transcriptional complex that contains both p300 and PCAF (11).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	299	 In the present study, we show that MyoD-mediated transcription is significantly repressed by COUP-TF II.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	300	 This suggests that COUP-TF II is involved in the maintenance of the proliferative state, by controlling the trans-activation of the p21 gene.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	301	Nuclear receptors have also been shown to interact with a growing family of PAS/bHLH domain coactivators (e.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	302	 SRC1/N-CoA-1, TIF-2/GRIP-1, ACTR/RAC-3/pCIP) (57-59).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	303	 However, the N-terminal bHLH/PAS domains in these coactivators function as activation domains, interact with other proteins or are involved in target gene specificity.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	304	 There has been no documented interactions between these regions of the cofactors and the nuclear receptors.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	305	In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that suggests that one of the mechanisms that mediates repression of muscle differentiation and myogenic conversion by COUP-TF II involves direct interactions with MyoD and its coactivator, p300.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Whether the direct crosstalk between the orphan nuclear receptor and bHLH pathways has target gene specificity in a developmental context remains to be elucidated, and will be a focus of future studies in the context of mammalian differentiation.

0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	301	 At 5  microM and 10  microM of cyclopamine, the reduction of X-gal staining was more pronounced in the stomach when compared with the controls (Fig.

0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	303	 The downregulation of COUP-TFII expression when Hh signaling is inhibited by cyclopamine substantiates the notion that Hh signaling regulates COUP-TFII expression in the stomach.

0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	305	2 Cre recombinase firmly established that COUP-TFII is essential for radial patterning of the stomach.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	306	5, it is already apparent that the circular smooth muscles layers and the enteric neurons layers are expanded and disorganized in the conditional mutants.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	307	 These defects persist at later stages of development.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Although COUP-TFII in the epithelial compartment has not been deleted, the epithelium is considerably thicker in comparison with the control littermates, indicating signals from the mesenchyme are required for appropriate epithelium growth.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	309	 The defects display by the COUP-TFII conditional mutants indicate that COUP-TFII is essential for radial patterning of the developing stomach and these defects are not seen in the compound heterozygote of Nkx3.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Instead, the inappropriate differentiation of the smooth muscles cells and enteric neurons in the mesenchyme has been shown when Hh signaling is disrupted by treatment with cyclopamine (Sukegawa et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Shh is believed to be the epithelial signal that inhibits the gut mesenchyme to differentiate into smooth cells and the neural crest cells to differentiate into enteric neurons.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Our findings indicate that COUP-TFII participates in the negative regulation of differentiation of smooth muscle cells and enteric neurons in the gut mesenchyme.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	313	 COUP-TFII can either serve as a downstream target of Hh to mediate its negative function in the gut mesenchyme or exert its effect in a pathway parallel to Hh to regulate mesenchymal differentiation.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	314	In addition to radial patterning of the stomach, COUP-TFII is also required for AP patterning of the stomach.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	315	 The anterior shift of the limited ridge that divides the fore- and hind-stomach, the reduced size of the fore-stomach, the expansion of the hind-stomach and the expansion of EAP expression into the hind-stomach are all consistent with disruption of the AP axis patterning in the stomach.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	316	 However, the differentiation of the epithelium of the fore- and hind-stomach in the adult mutant remains unchanged; with all the molecular markers analyzed, even the mutant stomach is posteriorized.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	317	 The posteriorization and ectopic extended expression of EAP in the hind-stomach of the conditional mutant have been demonstrated in the Shh-null mutant mice (Ramalho-Santos et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	318	 The striking similarity of the phenotypes exhibited by conditional COUP-TFII-null mutants and animals, chick and mouse, when Hh signaling is disrupted further implicates that Hh and COUP-TFII act in the same and/or parallel pathways.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	319	Although the general slight reduction of expression of COUP-TFII in the Shh-null mutant is a little surprising, the high expression of Ihh in the expanded hind-stomach of the Shh-null mutant could have compensated for the missing Shh to induce COUP-TFII expression.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Indeed, the downregulation of COUP-TFII expression in the mesenchyme of the stomach is more pronounced in the explants treated with cyclopamine, supporting the notion that COUP-TFII is a downstream target of Hh signaling.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	321	 In addition, Shh signaling can directly activate COUP-TFII expression and Shh-N activates COUP-TFII expression in P19 cells without de novo protein synthesis (Krishnan et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Furthermore, analysis of the COUP-TFII promoter has identified an ShhRE that is distinct from the defined Gli-binding site (Krishnan et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Thus, all the above results indicate that COUP-TFII mediates Hh signaling in the stomach.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Taken together, our results established that COUP-TFII is essential for radial and AP patterning of the stomach.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Restriction of anterior Shh expression and attenuation of Shh action in the epithelium of the COUP-TFII conditional mutant, in turn, suggests a potential role for COUP-TFII in the stimulation or maintenance of Shh expression.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	326	Shh derived from the epithelium signals the mesenchyme of the stomach, but how mesenchymal factors influence endodermally expressed Shh is unclear.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	327	 The Hoxa5-null mutant phenotype provides evidence for mesenchyme-mediated regulation of Shh expression in the developing stomach (Aubin et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Similarly in chick, it was suggested that adjacent mesenchyme regulates Shh expression (Narita et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	329	 In our study, COUP-TFII was ablated in the mesenchyme and the observed dysmorphogenesis suggests that COUP-TFII potentially affects such mesenchymal factor(s).
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	330	 One such candidate, Bmp4, which belongs to the TGFss superfamily, is expressed in the mesenchyme of developing murine stomach, while the chick ortholog has been demonstrated to play a role in gizzard patterning.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Bmp4 is important for mesoderm development, but because of early lethality in Bmp4-null mutants, no specific role for Bmp4 in gastric development has been elucidated (Winnier et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	332	 Interestingly, it has been shown that COUP-TFII binds to the mouse Bmp4 promoter and regulates Bmp4 promoter activity in transient transfection assays (Feng et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	333	, 1995), suggesting COUP-TFII might function through BMP signaling.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Another member of TGFss super family, activin, governs embryonic axial patterning, and restricts Shh expression in Hensen's node (Monsoro-Burq and Le Douarin, 2001).
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Furthermore, the expansion of Shh expression domain within the stomach of Acvr2a/Acvr2b mutant mice indicates a restriction of Shh in the foregut that is potentially regulated by TGFss/Bmp signaling.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	336	 As Acvr2 is able to interact with BMPs (Kim et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	337	, 2000), mesenchymal expressed Bmp4 may restrict Shh expression.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	338	 Alternatively, it is possible that COUP-TFII may modulate the expression of activin/activin receptor themselves.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	339	 Enhanced activin signaling may restrict the expression domain of Shh to the anterior border and perturb the epithelial growth, as seen in the conditional mutant stomach.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	340	 Further analysis of TGFss/Bmp/activin signaling in the COUP-TFII conditional mutant stomach may shed light on which mesenchymal factor(s) that regulate Shh expression are affected by the absence of COUP-TFII.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	3	LTR-retrotransposons are closely related to retroviruses.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Both types of elements encode Gag, protease, reverse transcriptase, and IN proteins and both depend on IN to insert their cDNA into the genome of a host cell.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The LTRs, positioned at the ends of the cDNA, are subdivided into an upstream segment, U3, a central region, R, and a downstream segment, U5.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	6	 A large number of biochemical studies with purified IN have characterized the chemistry of insertion (10-12).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The INs of retroviruses have two activities that are necessary for the integration of the viral cDNA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	8	 At first, 2 or 3 nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the LTRs.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	9	 This site-specific nucleolytic cleavage or "3' processing reaction" is required to position the "CA" dinucleotides at the 3' ends of the cDNA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The CA dinucleotides are conserved among all retroviruses and their position at the 3' ends of the cDNA is required for the second step of retrovirus integration, the "strand transfer reaction.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	11	" During this second step, the 3' hydroxyls of the terminal "A" act as nucleophiles in a pair of transesterification reactions that cleave the phosphodiester bonds in the target DNA and simultaneously make a covalent bond between the 3' ends of the viral DNA and the 5' ends of the target DNA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	12	In retroviruses, the minus strand primers initiate reverse transcription 2 or 3 nucleotides from the LTR and this results in additional nucleotides at the cDNA termini that IN removes during the processing reaction.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In the case of most LTR-retrotransposons the minus strand primers initiate reverse transcription with no added nucleotides.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	14	 As a result, these LTR-retrotransposons are thought to proceed to the strand transfer reaction without a processing step (13).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	15	The INs of retroviruses have three protease-resistant domains and the functions of these domains have been studied extensively (12, 14, 15).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The NH2-terminal domain contains a conserved motif similar to zinc fingers.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Although this domain does bind zinc, little else is known about its function.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The central domain is the catalytic core that contains highly conserved acidic residues, Asp, Asp, and Glu, that are juxtaposed on an RNase H-like fold.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	19	 These three amino acids are conserved in all the INs of retroviruses, LTR-retrotransposons, and DNA transposons (16).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The central domain of HIV-1 IN was shown to be sufficient for catalytic activity in in vitro assays for the reverse reaction of strand transfer known as disintegration (17).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The COOH-terminal domain is less well conserved but has nonspecific binding activity to DNA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Although the structure of individual domains has been determined for several INs, no single structure yet contains all three domains (18).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	23	Tf1 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is one of the LTR-retrotransposons that contains a chromodomain at the COOH terminus of IN (8).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Its high level of transposition activity allows Tf1 to be studied as a model for reverse transcription and integration.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Expression of Tf1 from a high copy plasmid results in the formation of virus-like particles, the reverse transcription of the Tf1 mRNA, and the integration of the cDNA into intergenic sequences (19-21).

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	31	In this report the activities of Tf1 IN and the function of its chromodomain were studied.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	32	 IN and IN without the chromodomain (CH-) were expressed in bacteria and purified.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Biochemical assays for disintegration and strand transfer showed that IN possessed substantial activity.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Because Tf1 cDNA was predicted to terminate with CA, it was surprising that IN also had strong 3' processing activity.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This indicates that the position of the minus strand primer relative to the LTR is not sufficient to predict the presence of processing activity.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The most unexpected result was that CH- had significantly higher specific activity than IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In addition, CH- was much less dependent on specific sequences at the termini of the donor DNA than was IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	38	 These results reveal that the chromodomain in the Tf1 IN modulates both the level and specificity of integration.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The primer for the minus strand of Tf1 is positioned adjacent to the LTR so it is predicted that no processing activity is required (28, 29).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	172	 However, sequences of Tf1 cDNA extracted from particles revealed the surprising result that 85% of the 3' ends had one or more untemplated nucleotides.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	173	4 Because these nucleotides are added to the 3' ends after the CA dinucleotide, they are expected to block integration.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	174	 We therefore speculated that Tf1 IN would have a processing activity that would remove these nucleotides to expose the CA dinucleotides and allow integration.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The processing activity of IN produced the 24-nt sequence as the dominant product from the substrates with "tt," "at," "ttt," and "ttttt" as single-stranded extensions.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	186	 In the one case of a substrate with a Bl end ("at"), IN generated the 24-nt species along with several other smaller products.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The activities are expressed as the percent of conversion.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	207	  For retrovirus INs, the product of the processing activity is the only substrate suitable for strand transfer.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Therefore, reactions with efficient processing activity also exhibit strand transfer.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The processing activity of Tf1 IN with either the "at " or "tt" extensions was high and strand transfer was detected (Fig.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The processing activity with the 3- and 5-nucleotide extensions was less efficient and no strand transfer was observed.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Thus, the IN of Tf1 was similar to INs of retroviruses in that processing was required for strand transfer.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	212	The amounts of processed products accumulated by CH- were similar to that of IN (Fig.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	213	 However, CH- generated substantially more products of strand transfer than IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The levels of these strand transfer products greater than 24 nt were quantified.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The activity of CH- with all substrates was significantly higher than that of IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	216	 For example, the activities with the tt-Ov was 57% and with at-Ov was 38% relative to that produced with the pre-processed substrate.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	217	 The comparable figures for IN were 11 and 15%, respectively.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Because the increase in strand transfer requires enhanced 3' end processing, these data indicate that the 3' end processing activity of CH- is higher than that of IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	219	The efficient processing of the U5 substrates suggested that the Tf1 proteins specifically recognized and removed the extensions beyond the CA dinucleotide.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	220	 To test whether other sequences in the substrate were recognized, IN and CH- were assayed for activity using a substrate with the U5 sequence of HIV-1 (Fig.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The HIV-1 substrate was 21 nt long and had the physiological GT extension 3' of the CA dinucleotide.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Processing activity would reduce the 21-nt species to 19 nt.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Compared with the processing activity of HIV-1 IN with this substrate, the Tf1 proteins exhibited very little activity.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	224	 This indicates that in addition to the CA dinucleotide, the Tf1 proteins recognize sequence in the U5 substrate specific for Tf1.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	225	 It was also seen that HIV-1 IN did not utilize the Tf1 pre-processed substrates (data not shown).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	226	Processing the U3 End of the LTR Retroviral INs have processing activities that remove extensions 3' of the CA from both the U5 and U3 ends of the cDNA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Because the Tf1 proteins were found to have processing activity on the U5 end, we tested whether they could also process extensions from the U3 end of Tf1.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The results show that both CH- and IN can remove nucleotides 3' of the CA in the U3 sequence (Fig.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	229	 As seen with the U5 substrates, the shorter extensions on the U3 substrates were processed more efficiently than those with longer extensions.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	230	 The cleavages of the Ov versions were somewhat more efficient than the Bl counterparts.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	231	The processing activity of CH- with 3-, 5-, and 6-nucleotide extensions was significantly greater than that of IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	232	 However, comparing the activities of the proteins with the shorter extensions was complex because the strong strand transfer activity of CH- reduced the accumulation of the processed species.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	233	 To approximate the processing activities of IN and CH-, the levels of strand transfer were quantified.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	234	 As found above for the U5 substrates, CH- exhibited substantially higher levels of activity.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	235	 For example, the activities with tt-Ov was 88%, with tt-Bl was 32%, and with ttt-Ov was 19% of that produced with the pre-processed substrate.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	236	 The comparable figures for IN were 11 and 4%, and not detectable, respectively.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	237	Strand Transfer Activities Require Pre-processing of the Extensions 3' to CA The processing activities of IN and CH- were estimated by measuring the products of the subsequent strand transfer.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	238	 This was done because the products of processing can be readily converted by strand transfer activity into larger oligonucleotides.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	239	 However, the accumulated products of strand transfer would be an overestimate of processing if the Tf1 proteins could mediate strand transfer with substrates that retained nucleotide extensions 3' to the CA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	240	 To test this possibility, strand transfer reactions were conducted with substrates that possessed a2',3'-dideoxynucleotide at their 3' end.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Unless removed by processing, this substrate would lack the necessary 3' hydroxyl and as a result it would block strand transfer.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	261	 This indicated that the strand transfer occurred only after an efficient removal of the blocking sequence.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	262	 The strand transfer activity with the Ov substrates was substantially greater than seen with the Bl versions.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	293	 It was thought that the 3' end processing activity of retroviruses and LTR-retrotransposons is required only in the cases where the priming of minus strand reverse transcription adds nucleotides beyond the conserved CA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	294	 For Tf1, the 3' end of the minus strand primer is immediately adjacent to the U5 sequence of the upstream LTR (28, 29).

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Nevertheless, most other LTR-retrotransposons such as Ty1 have minus strand primers immediately adjacent to the U5 sequence of their LTR and are not thought to have processing (39).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	310	 The finding that Tf1 IN has processing activity brings into question the predicted lack of processing activity in the INs of the other LTR-retrotransposons.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Approximately 25% of Ty1 cDNA terminates with nontemplated nucleotides (40).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	312	 The cDNA with the nontemplated additions could participate in integration only if the IN has processing activity.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	314	The removal of nontemplated nucleotides by IN may also occur with retroviral cDNA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	315	 In vitro experiments show that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase possesses terminal transferase activity that adds nontemplated nucleotides to the 3' end of the nascent DNA (43-45).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	316	 A time course of reverse transcription during HIV-1 infection identified a prominent species of cDNA that had one nucleotide extra on the 3' end of the plus strand (46).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	317	 This led the authors to propose that the extra nucleotide was the result of nontemplated addition and that the 3' processing activity of IN removed it.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	318	Perhaps the most striking results presented in this report indicate a role for the chromodomain in modulating integration.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Although removing 15% of IN might be expected to reduce activity substantially, the deletion of the chromodomain resulted in a intriguing increase in the disintegration and strand transfer activities.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	320	 CH- also had greater 3' processing activity than IN, assuming that the greater amounts of strand transfer products generated were all derived from processed oligonucleotides.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Evidence supporting this assumption was that oligonucleotides with the blocking nucleotide (dd)c 3' of the CA were just as efficiently converted into products of strand transfer by CH- as oligonucleotides without the (dd)c block (Fig.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	322	 These data indicate that the chromodomain of Tf1 IN negatively modulates the IN activities.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	323	In addition to its role in limiting integration activity, the chromodomain had a significant impact in restricting the sequence at the 3' end of the donor DNA that could function in strand transfer.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Only when the chromodomain was present was there a strict requirement for the ACA at the 3' end of the donor DNA (Fig.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	325	 The strong specificity of the intact IN is in contrast to the IN of Ty1, which in similar types of assays can tolerate many alterations in the 3' end of the donor DNA (42).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	326	 However, INs of retroviruses, such as HIV-1, lack chromodomains and yet exhibit strict requirements for the sequences at the 3' end of the donor DNA (35, 37).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Thus, the chromodomain is not the only means for INs to achieve this strict requirement for the CA at the 3' end of donor oligonucleotides.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Therefore, it appears that in the case of Tf1 IN, the chromodomain evolved independently as a means of restricting donor sequences.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	329	Both contributions of the chromodomain, limiting IN activity and increasing sequence specificity, may result from a single mechanism that restricts access to the active site of IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	330	 Although there are several examples of chromodomains that interact directly with histone H3, the lack of histone proteins in our assays indicates such an interaction is not required for the restrictive properties of the Tf1 chromodomain.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Functional analyses of several chromodomains recently revealed an unexpected diversity of interaction targets such as DNA and RNA (7).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	332	 It is possible that the chromodomain of Tf1 restricts IN activity through interactions with the donor DNA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Regardless of the mode of inhibition, there is the interesting possibility that in vivo, the inhibition is regulated.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	334	 One intriguing hypothesis is that the chromodomain does interact with histone H3 and it is this interaction at the target site that relieves the inhibitory function of the chromodomain.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	335	 The chromodomain of HP1 forms an organized cluster of strands and helices in response to its interaction with the NH2 terminus of H3 (32, 47).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	336	 This dramatic reorganization is consistent with a role in regulating integration.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	337	Although chromodomains are known to exist in many INs of LTR-retrotransposons (8, 9), the results reported here are the first direct effort to identify the function of the chromodomain in IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	338	 The restrictive role of the chromodomain identified here may very well be true for the other chromodomain containing INs.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	339	 In addition to INs, chromodomains have been identified in several other enzymes.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	340	 The H3 lysine 9-specific histone methyltransferase Su(var)3-9, the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors, CHD, the DNA methyltransferase CMT, and the histone acetylase CDY, are all enzymes that contain chromodomains (7).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	341	 In light of the restrictive function of the chromodomain in Tf1 IN, it will be interesting to test how the chromodomains in these other proteins affect their enzymatic activities.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	342	The poor solubility of the recombinant INs studied thus far has been a major obstacle in producing high resolution structures.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	343	 High concentrations of salt or the introduction of amino acid substitutions have been necessary to solubilize individual domains of INs.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	344	 A number of structures have been determined for each of the three domains of the INs from the retroviruses HIV-1, simian immunodeficiency virus, avian sarcoma virus, and Rous sarcoma virus (18).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	345	 However, the lack of a structure for an intact IN makes it difficult to model the spatial relationships between the three domains.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	346	 During the purification of Tf1 IN it became clear that this IN was substantially more soluble than other integrases previously studied.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	347	 It is possible that this solubility will lead to the first crystal structure of a full-length IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	348	 This would serve as a significant leap in understanding the structures of INs in general and more specifically, of HIV-1 IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	349	 A structure of an intact IN would substantially facilitate the design and development of new drugs against HIV IN and, thus, contribute to the ongoing fight against AIDS.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	7	Initial studies identified COUP-TFs as transcriptional activators (19, 20, 21, 22); nevertheless, COUP-TFs can repress the transcriptional activation mediated by a number of ligand-bound nuclear receptors, including VDR, TRs, RXRs, and RARs (23, 24, 25, 26).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	8	 A functional cross-talk between COUP-TFs and retinoid-signaling pathways during development has been proposed, based on the comprehensively documented antagonistic effects of COUP-TFs on retinoid-dependent gene expression, and the observation that COUP-TF genes are themselves targeted by retinoids (7, 8, 15, 27, 28).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, recent data indicate that the orphan receptors can also serve as accessory factors for some ligand-bound nuclear receptors such as GR, ER, and RAR (29, 30, 31).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In some specific promoter contexts, COUP-TFs are thus able to enhance the ligand-induced transactivation function of these various receptors, suggesting that COUP-TFs may be required for effectively establishing the cues for certain genetic responses after exposure of the cell to a ligand.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In this respect, it is not surprising that common phenotypes, such as similar bone fusions, are generated in COUP-TFI-/- and RAR1-/-/RARss-/- independent knockout experiments (16, 32).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The recent finding that COUP-TFI is required for the induction of growth inhibition and apoptosis by retinoic acid in cancer cells further substantiates a positive interaction between COUP-TFs and retinoid receptors in vivo (31).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	13	With very few exceptions, most ligand-dependent nuclear receptors can be activated in a ligand-independent manner through phosphorylation events (33).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	14	 As an example, ER can activate transcription after phosphorylation, independent of supplemented E2 (33, 34, 35, 36, 37).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In a similar manner, many other ligand-regulated nuclear receptors are either activated or repressed through phosphorylation events (33, 34), and these regulatory mechanisms seem relevant also to the orphan receptors such as Nur77/NGFI-B, HNF-4 or ROR (38, 39, 40, 41).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Although COUP-TFs were cloned more than 10 yr ago, a ligand has yet to be elucidated or characterized, suggesting that COUP-TFs could be true orphan nuclear receptors.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The presence of several putative phosphorylation sites for MAPKs, PKC, and casein kinase II (CKII), within its sequence led us to postulate that COUP-TFI could be targeted by cellular kinases.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In this report, we demonstrate that COUP-TFI can be directly phosphorylated by PKC and MAPK, these phosphorylation events differently modulating COUP-TFI functions.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	19	 COUP-TFI is thus likely to be regulated by extracellular signals transduced through distinct phosphorylation pathways.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	40	 2A, in silico analysis of the human COUP-TFI protein sequence revealed several putative phosphorylation sites targeted by distinct cellular kinases, namely CKII, PKC, and proline-directed kinases such as MAPKs.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The consensus phosphorylation sites were defined as S/TXXD/E for CKII (44), S/TXR/K for PKC (45), and PX1-2S/TP for the three distinct MAPK pathways identified in mammalian cells (46).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	42	 These pathways include members of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/p44MAPK and ERK2/p42MAPK, the Jun NH2-terminal kinase and the p38 kinase (47, 48, 49).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The three putative MAPK phosphorylation sites identified within the human COUP-TFI sequence were found to be highly conserved throughout evolution (8), and were clustered in the amino-terminal A/B domain (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The putative CKII and PKC phosphorylation sites, some of which were also evolutionarily conserved (8), were in contrast distributed throughout the COUP-TFI sequence (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The DNA binding domain (DBD) contained exclusively PKC target sites, whereas the A/B and the putative ligand binding domain (LBD) of the receptor displayed both CKII and PKC potential target sequences (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The presence of several putative phosphorylation sites for various cellular kinases in the human COUP-TFI sequence raises the possibility that, similar to posttranslational modifications described for several nuclear receptors, COUP-TFI could be a phosphoprotein in vivo, whose activity may be regulated by specific phosphorylation events.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	47	 To test this hypothesis, we cloned the human COUP-TFI cDNA encoding residues 57 to 423 in frame with the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) coding sequence of the mammalian expression vector pBC/GST.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	65	 COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the COUP-TFI-dependent reporter gene Vn-luciferase (Luc) (containing the wt Vn gene promoter sequence, see Fig.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Consistent with our previous results, cotransfection with increasing amounts of COUP-TFI expression plasmid led to a dose-dependent induction of reporter gene activity.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Neither the basal nor the stimulated transcriptional activity of the reporter gene was modified by treatment of the cells with DRB (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The expression level of COUP-TFI was also unaffected by this treatment (data not shown, see Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Based on these experiments defining that inhibition of the CKII pathway in vivo does not affect COUP-TFI-mediated transcriptional activation, it seems unlikely that this kinase regulates COUP-TFI function.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Whereas basal activity was not altered, treatment of the cells with PD980059 led to a significant decrease (76% inhibition of the activation) in reporter gene activity observed in the presence of 50 ng of COUP-TFI expression vector (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	74	 As assessed by Western blotting, this inhibition was not due to a decrease in nuclear receptor expression (data not shown, see Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The inhibitory effect of the specific MAPK inhibitor on the induction of the Vn gene promoter by COUP-TFI was not restricted to COS-7 cells as similar results were obtained in experiments utilizing P19 cells (data not shown).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	76	 3B, treating cotransfected COS-7 cells with GF 109203X in the absence of expression vector did not influence basal activity.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	77	 In contrast, GF 109203X induced a marked reduction (60% inhibition of the activation) in the reporter gene activity observed in the presence of 50 ng of COUP-TFI expression vector (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Concurrent with the previous observation, the inhibition of COUP-TFI- induced reporter gene activity was not due to a reduced expression of COUP-TFI in COS-7 cells treated with GF 109203X (data not shown, see Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Thus, the blocking of either the p42MAPK/p44MAPK or the PKC signaling pathway results in a strong inhibition of the COUP-TFI-dependent transcription, suggesting that COUP-TFI function may be positively regulated by these kinases in vivo.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	100	 In addition to these four sites, the COUP-TFI 84 to 423 protein, which is deleted of almost the entire A/B domain (86 first amino acids), is devoid of the third putative MAPK phosphorylation site (T63) and of a CKII phosphorylation site (T66).

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Moreover, both PD980059 and GF 109203X efficiently counteracted the reporter gene activation mediated by 50 ng of COUP-TFI 57 to 423 expression vector.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	104	 This observation suggests that the region spanning residues 1 to 56 of COUP-TFI, including one PKC and two MAPK potential phosphorylation sites, is dispensable for transactivation and is not involved in the regulation of COUP-TFI activity by the PKC and MAPK pathways.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	107	 These data suggest that residues 57 to 83 play a crucial role, directly or indirectly, in the COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation, and raise the possibility that the third (T63) MAPK phosphorylation site could be a hierarchal requisite for COUP-TFI activity and for the MAPK-mediated regulation of the nuclear receptor functions.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	108	 This was, to some extent, confirmed by the observation that PD980059 is significantly less efficient in inhibiting the COUP-TFI 84 to 423-mediated transcriptional activation than it is in decreasing COUP-TFI 57 to 423-induced activation (Fig.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The residual effect of PD980059 on COUP-TFI 84 to 423-mediated transactivation suggests the involvement of an additional nonconsensus MAPK phosphorylation site located between residues 84 to 423, or that MAPK indirectly modulates COUP-TFI activity.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Finally, in cells cotransfected with 50 ng of COUP-TFI 84 to 423 expression vector, treatment with GF 109203X reduced the reporter gene activity to the basal level (Fig.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	208	 In vitro phosphorylation of the GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 423 fusion protein by purified PKC did not affect the amount of labeled COUP-TFI retained by the fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The PKC-induced enhancement of DNA binding is therefore unlikely to result from an increase in the ability of COUP-TFI to homodimerize.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	210	 To further delineate the mechanism of this PKC-mediated regulation, we aimed to map the functional domain(s) of COUP-TFI that were targeted by PKC in vitro.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	216	 We can therefore conclude that multiple functional domains of COUP-TFI are selectively phosphorylated by PKC in vitro.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Consistent with the result that PKC positively regulates the DNA binding activity of COUP-TFI without affecting its dimerization function, we provide evidence that the DBD of COUP-TFI, but not its LBD, is directly targeted by PKC.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	227	 To investigate this hypothesis further, we performed in vitro phosphorylation assays to determine which functional domain(s) of COUP-TFI could be targeted by the purified MAPK (ERK2/p42MAPK) in vitro.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Our next objective was to determine whether MAPK-mediated phosphorylation could directly regulate the transactivation function of COUP-TFI.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	246	 This putative MAPK phosphorylation site was therefore inactivated through replacement of the conserved threonine residue to a nonphosphorylatable alanine residue.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Indeed, in this cellular context, mutation of the third MAPK phosphorylation site resulted in a significant decrease in the transactivation of the Vn gene promoter by COUP-TFI (Fig.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	266	 In this study, we provide data that clearly show that PKC directly targets COUP-TFI in vitro and enhances its binding to various response elements.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Precedents for both positive and negative regulations of DNA binding by phosphorylation exist for numerous nuclear receptors, including ER, GR, RAR, TR2, TRss1, Nur77/NGFI-B, and HNF-4.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	268	 These regulatory mechanisms are not yet fully understood and highly complex, as they involve a wide range of protein kinases with target sites located within, nearby, or far from the DBD.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	269	 While phosphorylation-mediated by PKA enhances GR binding to DNA (51), this kinase has been shown to inhibit binding of HNF-4 in vitro and in vivo (40).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Consistent with the involvement of the A-box in the high affinity DNA binding of HNF-4 (52), phosphorylation at a consensus PKA-dependent site located within this region results in a modification of the receptor binding to DNA (40).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Similarly, phosphorylation of NGFI-B within its A-box also decreases DNA binding (38, 39).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	272	 In both cases, the reduction of DNA binding of the receptor is likely to reflect a local effect: phosphorylations occurring nearby to the DBD could either induce a local conformational change impairing DNA recognition, inhibit protein/DNA contacts by steric hindrance, or electrostatically hinder interactions between the phosphate groups of the protein and the similarly charged phosphate backbone of the DNA.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	273	 In contrast, phosphorylation of TR2, a variant of the thyroid hormone receptor, within a unique carboxy-terminal region mediated by CKII decreases its binding to DNA via a mechanism that is likely to involve a phosphorylation-induced change in the overall conformation of the protein (53).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	274	 A similar mechanism, which is likely to underlie the positive regulation exerted by CKII on the binding of ER to its response element, involves phosphorylation events occurring at an amino acid residue located within the amino-terminal A/B domain of the receptor, resulting in intramolecular interactions affecting the DNA binding domain and its function (54, 55).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	275	 In addition to these direct mechanisms, indirect phosphorylation-mediated regulations of DNA binding have also been reported; these are often due to a modulation of the dimerization interface of the nuclear receptors by phosphorylation events.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	276	 For example, phosphorylation of TRss1 enhances TRss1/RXR heterodimerization, leading to an increase in DNA binding (56, 57).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Such an indirect regulation of DNA binding is also relevant for RAR/RXR heterodimers where PKC-mediated phosphorylation event at a serine residue located in the T-box of RAR prevents heterodimerization (58, 59).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Based on the finding that the T-box of RAR engages dimerization contacts with the DBD of RXR (60), phosphorylation occurring within this region may introduce strong conformational constraints on the dimerization interface, thus impairing heterodimerization and subsequent DNA binding (58, 59).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	279	 While PKC has been shown to down-regulate DNA binding for members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, both through direct and indirect mechanisms, there is, to our knowledge, no evidence for PKC-mediated positive effects on the DNA binding of any member of this superfamily.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	280	 In this report, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of COUP-TFI by PKC increases the affinity of the orphan receptor for specific DNA elements.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Moreover, we show that the enhancement of DNA binding does not result from a modification of the ability of COUP-TFI to homodimerize, but rather appears to be a direct mechanism.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Consistent with this idea, the DBD of COUP-TFI is targeted by PKC in vitro, whereas the LBD, which contains the major homodimerization surface (61), is not.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Mass spectrometry analysis allowed us to ascertain that T121 is a target for PKC, whereas no other modifications were detected.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Although the region spanning amino acids 1 to 57 also contains at least one target site for PKC, our data demonstrate that the amino-terminal A/B domain of the nuclear receptor is dispensable for DNA binding and its phosphorylation-dependent regulation.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	285	 We propose that COUP-TFI binding to DNA is positively and directly regulated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation targeting T121 within the DNA binding domain of the receptor.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	286	COUP-TFI may integrate multiple signaling pathways considering our finding that the MAPK pathway specifically regulates COUP-TFI transactivation function.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	287	 While having no effect on nuclear translocation or DNA binding function, inhibition of the p42MAPK/p44MAPK pathway in vivo strongly inhibits the COUP-TFI-mediated transcriptional activation of the Vn gene promoter.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Moreover, we showed that ERK2/p42MAPK directly targets COUP-TFI at distinct phosphorylation sites in vitro.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	289	 While the LBD is not phosphorylated by MAPK, at least one target site is present in the amino-terminal region of the A/B domain (i.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	291	 The functional relevance of this phosphorylation event in vivo remains unclear because the deletion of the amino-terminal region to residue 57 does not affect the subcellular distribution, DNA binding activity and transactivation function of the receptor, or the MAPK-mediated regulation of the COUP-TFI-dependent transcription.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Other phosphorylation sites, located between residues 57 and 153, are directly targeted by ERK2/p42MAPK in vitro, and the ERK2-mediated phosphorylation event that might specifically target T63 in vivo is shown here to play an active role in cell-specific transcriptional activation by COUP-TFI.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Such a modulation by MAPK-mediated phosphorylation could result from modifications in coactivator recruitment as previously reported for various nuclear receptors.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Indeed, ERss can be activated by the Ras-dependent MAPK pathway in the absence of its cognate ligand via direct phosphorylation within the A/B domain (62, 63).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Recent studies have shown that phosphorylation of MAPK target sites located in the AF-1 region stimulates ligand- and AF-2-independent interaction between ERss and SRC-1, thus allowing for ligand-independent activation of ERss (63).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	296	 In addition to ERss, several authors have reported observations of functional cross-talk between growth factors and ER signaling pathways, both in the absence and presence of ligand (64, 65, 66, 67, 68).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Consistent with the requirement of the AF-1 region for the activation of the apo-form ER in response to growth factors, one serine residue S118 located in the A/B domain of ER is directly targeted by the MAPK in response to EGF, and these phosphorylation events increase the AF-1 activity (66, 67, 68).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	298	 The mechanism underlying this enhancement has recently been elucidated and involves the MAPK-dependent recruitment of the coactivator p68 by the AF-1 region of ER (69).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	299	 In addition to these local effects, the MAPK pathway can, by intramolecular communication between different nuclear receptor domains, positively or negatively regulate coactivator binding by domains that are distinct from the ones targeted by specific phosphorylation events (70, 71).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	300	 For example, phosphorylation of a serine residue located within the hinge region of SF-1 is required for maximal interaction of its LBD with the coactivator GRIP-1, results in the ligand-independent activation of SF-1 (71).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Similarly, MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of a single amino acid residue in the A/B domain of PPAR alters the overall conformation of the apo-form receptor in a way that impairs ligand binding, thereby indirectly preventing the recruitment of coactivators such as SRC-1 (70).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Thus, interdomain communication allows phosphorylation events targeting the amino-terminal A/B domain of PPAR to regulate independent properties of the LBD.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	303	 This regulatory mechanism is involved in the MAPK-mediated inhibition of PPAR ligand-dependent transactivation function in response to various growth factors and cytokines, and has important repercussions on PPAR activity in vivo (70, 72, 73).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Taken together, these results show that MAPK-mediated phosphorylation events play crucial roles in the modulation of nuclear receptor/coactivator interactions, a regulatory mechanism that, according to recent data, may also be relevant to nuclear receptor/corepressor interactions (74, 75).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Further experiments will tell if ERK2 can modify COUP-TFI/coactivator interactions.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	306	Integration of multiple signaling pathways by the human COUP-TFI nuclear receptor would undoubtedly have repercussions on a wide range of biological processes that involve COUP-TFI, such as cellular growth, differentiation, apoptosis as well as embryonic development (8, 11, 13, 16, 17, 31, 76).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Results described in this study indicate that there is a possibility that a variety of extracellular stimuli, transduced by MAPK and PKC signaling pathways, participate in the multifactorial regulation of the diverse biological processes that are controlled by COUP-TFI.

0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	282	 The various neutralizing mAbs had no significant effect on STAT6 phosphorylation.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	283	On the basis of these results, we propose a model for the activation of STAT5 by rGM-CSF via the hybrid receptor c/GM-CSFRss.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	284	 We suggest that STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation are regulated independently and that the translocation pathway is controlled by the c/JAK3 complex, which, in cells with type I IL-4R, is necessary for the translocation of STAT5 to the nucleus (35).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	285	The hybrid receptor is functional not only in leukemic cell precursors, but also in normal progenitors, although its functions appear more limited in normal cells.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Indeed, in normal CBPr CD34+/CD56- progenitors, the hybrid receptor controls the IL-15 to dependent phosphorylation of STAT5 but not of STAT3 and STAT6.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Moreover, levels of GM-CSF to dependent STAT5 phosphorylation are decreased by anti-c mAb in CBPr CD34+/CD56- progenitors, but not in TF1ss cells.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	288	 These differences may be due to differences in origin (normal versus pathological) and/or degree of primitiveness of the two types of CD34+ cell.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	289	 In any case, our results emphasize the involvement of the hybrid receptor in the control of normal and pathological hematopoiesis, with this receptor probably displaying various functions during hematopoietic development.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	290	The absence of the hybrid receptor on nonhematopoietic cells strengthens the evidence for its "specific" involvement in hematopoiesis.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	291	 The distribution of this receptor in cells of various lineages and functions suggests that it is involved in the development of hematopoiesis, probably affecting engagement in myeloid, rather than lymphoid, lineages.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Indeed, the inhibition of c/JAK3 signaling by the GM-CSFRss chain should be interpreted in light of the inhibition of lymphocyte maturation and myelopoiesis dysregulation observed in mice and humans bearing c or JAK3 deletions or mutations (9 to 11).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	293	In erythrocytic TF1 cells, we describe, for the first time, a novel IL-15R/c/TRAF2 complex that triggers specific IL-15 signaling, even though these cells do not express the IL-15Rss chain23, a subunit indispensable for the c chain functions (7).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Both subunits of the IL-15R/c heterodimer are functional, although they behave differently from what would be expected based on the results obtained for other cell types.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	295	 It has been reported that IL-15R, associating with the signaling molecule TRAF2, activates the transcription factor NF-B, in the absence of a link with the c chain (12, 24).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	296	 In contrast, in TF1 cells, IL-15R and c are associated but we nevertheless observed the phosphorylation, not only of IB, but also of JAK3 factors.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	297	 However, the phosphorylation of JAK3 factor was only observed in samples treated with rIL-15 and anti to GM-CSFRss mAb, indicating that the c/JAK3 pathway is functional in the absence of the IL-15Rss chain but is controlled by the hybrid receptor.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	298	The association of IL-15R/c/TRAF2 may play a regulatory role at certain stages of hematopoiesis, associating NF-B activation, which is involved in the control of erythropoiesis (15), with the conditional activation of JAK3-dependent pathways.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	299	Finally, we showed that rIL-15 induced the phosphorylation of STAT6 both in leukemic TF1ss proerythroid precursors, and in normal CBPr CD34+/CD56- progenitors.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Our data suggest that this unusual IL-15 to dependent pathway, the activation of which in mast cells was attributed to the high-affinity p65 IL-15RX receptor (28, 29), is also triggered in other types of CD34+ precursor.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	301	 However, in TF1ss cells, this pathway is controlled by the classical IL-15R/ss/c receptor and/or by the c/GM-CSFRss hybrid receptor, whereas in normal CBPr, CD34+/CD56- IL-15 to dependent STAT6 phosphorylation is not controlled by the hybrid receptor.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Overall, these results suggest the possible and complex involvement of STAT6 in the control of hematopoiesis (36) and provide further evidence that IL-15/GM-CSF are involved in cross talk.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	303	Recent data have shown that unprimed hematopoietic progenitors secrete several mediators activating autocrine/paracrine regulatory loops (3).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	304	 For instance, CD34+ cells may express GM-CSF transcripts (3) and a biologically active IL-15 that controls expression of the c chain, but is not competent for inducing the spontaneous differentiation of these cells into NK cells (20).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Thus, IL-15 and GM-CSF may contribute, by means of the hybrid receptor, to the autocrine/paracrine cross talk that controls the development of hematopoietic cells (3), perhaps by inhibiting the spontaneous engagement of these cells in the lymphoid lineage.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	306	 In contrast, in leukemic hematopoiesis, the action of the hybrid receptor is probably irreversible and may be involved in the molecular mechanisms responsible for the inhibition of differentiation in certain leukemic clones.

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	2	Silencing activity of unliganded TR and RAR requires limiting factors termed corepressors (5).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Recently, two corepressors that bind to unliganded TR and RAR have been cloned using a yeast two-hybrid screen: N-CoR (nuclear receptor-corepressor) (10, 11) and SMRT (silencing mediator for RAR and TR) (12, 13, 14, 15).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Binding of these corepressors is necessary for unliganded receptors to silence the activity of target promoters.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Prevailing evidence suggests that binding of hormone changes the conformation of the receptors, which results in the release of the corepressor and recruitment of coactivators, thereby abolishing their silencing activity.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	6	 These two corepressors exhibit significant sequence homologies in their receptor-interacting domains, suggesting the existence of a corepressor gene family.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	7	 COUP-TFs (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors) belong to the steroid receptor superfamily and are classified as orphan receptors because their ligand has yet to be defined.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	8	 There are two COUP-TF genes in mammals, COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	9	 COUP-TFs have been implicated in neurogenesis, organogenesis, and cell fate determination (16, 17, 18, 19).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	10	 COUP-TFs can form stable homodimers and bind to a variety of hormone response elements recognized by other members of the steroid receptor superfamily, such as RAR, retinoid X receptor (RXR), TR, vitamin D receptor (VDR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	11	 COUP-TFs can thereby inhibit transcriptional activities of these receptors on both consensus and natural response elements (17, 20).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Four mechanisms have been proposed to address COUP-TF s ability to inhibit the transactivation function of other members of the steroid receptor superfamily.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	13	 First, COUP-TFs repress the hormone-dependent transactivation of target genes by VDR, TR, and RAR through direct competition for occupancy of their response elements (21, 22, 23).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Second, COUP-TFs heterodimerize with RXR to reduce the available concentration of RXR for heterodimerization with TR, VDR, RAR, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and thus indirectly interfere with these receptors to transactivate their target genes (21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Third, COUP-TFs can tether to DNA via LBD-LBD interactions with TR, RAR, and RXR to transrepress their activities (27).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Finally, COUP-TFs have been shown to repress basal and activator-dependent transcriptional activities of various promoters when their binding site is placed upstream or downstream of these promoters (27).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The silencing domain in COUP-TFs was localized to the C terminus of the putative LBD, which can be transferred to the heterologous Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Activators that can be repressed by COUP-TFs include acidic (Gal4-RII), glutamine-rich (Gal4-ftzQ), proline-rich (Gal4-CTF1P), and Ser/Thr-rich (Gal4-ZenST) transactivators (27).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Because COUP-TF can repress such a diverse group of transactivators, it is unlikely that COUP-TF s repression is through direct quenching of these transactivators or by interfering with their respective targets.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	20	 It is rather likely that COUP-TFs interact with a common target, a putative corepressor(s) that mediates their repression.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	21	To substantiate this hypothesis, we address two major questions in this paper; 1) Does COUP-TFI-mediated repression require corepressors? and 2) If it does, does COUP-TFI share corepressors with other receptors, such as TR and RAR? To answer these questions, we first examined whether cofactors are involved in COUP-TFI-mediated repression using either self-squelching or TR/COUP-TF-mediated mutual squelching experiments.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Next, we examined whether COUP-TFI can interact with N-CoR or SMRT.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Finally, we examined whether N-CoR or SMRT can function as a corepressor in COUP-TFI-mediated repression.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Results from these experiments indicate that both N-CoR and SMRT can function as corepressors for COUP-TFI-mediated repression of target genes.

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	57	 First, we examined whether COUP-TFI can interact specifically with these authentic corepressors.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we confirmed that these corepressors can interact with TRss in a hormone-dependent manner.

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	88	 4B), the repression domains of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190 to 920 may interfere with the Gal4 activation domain function in a yeast two-hybrid assay; thus, a fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190-2453 is not able to activate ss-galactosidase activity of the reporter.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	89	 However, both N-CoR fragments encoding amino acids 190-2453 and 921-2453 were found to interact with COUP-TFI in an in vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay because these in vitro interactions are presumably not influenced by the repressor function of N-CoR.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Thus, a fragment of COUP-TFI encoding amino acids 56 to 423 can interact specifically with N-CoR in yeast and in vitro.

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	130	 The evidence that the TR mutant, TR168 to 456 (V174A/D177A) (28), which does not interact with the putative corepressors, cannot squelch the basal repression of Gal4-COUP-TFI further supports the notion that common corepressors may be involved in basal repression between TRss and COUP-TFI.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Furthermore, overexpression of COUP-TFI, but not COUP-TFI35, can squelch the basal repression activity of Gal4-TRss, also suggesting that common corepressors can function for both COUP-TFI and TRss.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Theoretically, the target of transcriptional interference may be either a basal transcription factor(s) or a corepressor(s).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Transfection of COUP-TFI or TRss did not change the basal transcription of a PRE-tk-luciferase reporter lacking a proper response element (data not shown), suggesting that squelchers are unlikely to interfere directly with the function of any basal transcriptional machinery.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Therefore, the target(s) of interference between COUP-TF and TRss is likely to be one or more transcriptional corepressor protein(s).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	135	Because COUP-TFI can form homodimers by itself or form heterodimers with TRss (27), it is possible that the squelchers can form non-DNA-binding heterodimers with the repressors used in Figs.

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	139	 However, several lines of evidence suggest that this is not the case.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	140	 First, both COUP-TFI and TRss have the ability to bind specifically to corepressors.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Second, a mutant form of TRss (TR168 to 456 (V174A/D177A)), which loses its ability to interact with corepressor but retains its intact dimerization domain, is not able to inhibit the repression activity of Gal4-COUP-TFI.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Third, COUP-TF mutant (COUP-TFI35), which loses its ability in silencing, also loses its ability to squelch repressor activity of TRss.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Finally and most importantly, we have demonstrated directly that both N-CoR and SMRT can mediate repressor activity of COUP-TFI (Fig.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	144	 6) and reverse the self-squelching activity (Fig.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Therefore, inhibition of repression activity by squelchers in Figs.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	146	 1, 2, and 3 indeed results from squelching of a limiting corepressor(s).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	147	Because squelching experiments showed that COUP-TFI may share a corepressor(s) with TRss, we examined protein-protein interaction between COUP-TFI and N-CoR or SMRT in a yeast two-hybrid assay and in in vitro GST pull-down assays as shown in Figs.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	148	 The amino acid 921-2453 fragment of N-CoR interacts with COUP-TFI.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	149	 This result is consistent with what has been observed in TR interaction studies (10, 33).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Interaction between COUP-TFI and the amino acid 190-2453 fragment of N-CoR was not detected in a yeast two-hybrid assay, but was detected in an in vitro GST pull-down assay.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	151	 This discrepancy is likely due to the potent repressor domain of the N-terminal portion of N-CoR, which suppresses the Gal4 activation function, resulting in interference with ss-galactosidase expression.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Consistent with this interpretation, Seol et al.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	153	 (33) also recently demonstrated that the repressor domain of N-CoR strongly interferes with the mammalian two-hybrid assay to study the protein-protein interaction between N-CoR and TR or RAR.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	154	 On the other hand, the amino acid 29 to 564 and amino acid 565-1289, but not amino acid 1192 to 1495, fragments of SMRT strongly interact with COUP-TF in yeast and in vitro assays.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Based on these data, we concluded that there are at least two COUP-TFI-interacting domains within the SMRT molecules.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The lack of interaction between COUP-TFI and SMRT (1192 to 1495) is surprising because this region interacts very strongly with TRss.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Thus, different repressors may interact differentially with SMRT.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Finally, the corepressor-interacting region in COUP-TFI is localized in the extreme C terminus, which is quite different from the region of TR and RAR where hinge and N-terminal portions of LBD are involved in this interaction.

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The CoR box is a conserved region of human TR, TRss, RAR, and RevErb A.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The CoR box of TRss is a repressor domain that interacts with corepressors; however, CIDs of RevErb A are different from the region of CoR box.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	167	 B, Receptor-interacting domains of SMRT and N-CoR.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Receptor-interacting domains of corepressors are indicated below each scheme of SMRT and N-CoR.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	169	 In N-CoR, there are two repression domains (RD1 and RD2) as shown in the N-terminal region.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The most N-terminal region of SMRT (amino acids 1 to 483) contains four putative repeated motifs and it has 44% identity with N-CoR.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The acidic-basic motif () and the serine-glycine-rich domain (SG) in the central region are indicated.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Glutamine-rich regions (Q) and predicted amphipathic -helix (H) regions are also indicated.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	173	  In support of this observation, N-CoR has been shown to function as a corepressor for RevErb A (34).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	174	 However, a region homologous to the CoR box in the RevErb A, which is necessary for TR and RAR to interact with N-CoR, is not required for RevErb A-mediated repression.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	175	 N-CoR contains two adjacent but distinct interaction domains, amino acids 2040 to 2239 and 2239 to 2296.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The former fragment of N-CoR strongly interacts with both TR and RevErb A; however, the latter fragment of N-CoR interacts weakly and preferentially with RevErb A.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Taken together, these data suggest that different nuclear receptors, utilizing different amino acid sequences, repress transcription by interacting with different region of N-CoR or SMRT as shown in Fig.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	178	Recently, an activator for COUP-TFII has been identified using a yeast two-hybrid screen, designated ORCA (orphan receptor coactivator) (35), and this factor is identical to a recently described ligand (p62) of tyrosine kinase- signaling molecule p56lck, suggesting that ORCA may link COUP-TFII and cell surface signal transduction pathways.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	179	 This integrating role may be similar to what is observed with cAMP response element-binding protein CBP and the related protein p300.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	180	 CBP plays a role in integrating cAMP second messenger and nuclear hormone receptor signal transduction pathways.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Of interest, ORCA/p62 shares a small region of homology with CBP, suggesting a potential similarity in their mechanism of action.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	182	 However, based on their data, ORCA/p62 does not bind directly to COUP-TFII-binding sites and COUP-TFII/ORCA complex is not detected in gel retardation assays.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Therefore, it is possible that ORCA/p62 may function directly or indirectly by phosphorylating COUP-TFII or ORCA/p62 may overcome the function of a specific COUP-TFII-associated corepressor.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Because ORCA/p62 can convert COUP-TFII into a transcriptional activator in a ligand-independent manner in mammalian cells, it is possible that COUP-TFI can also be activated by a coactivator(s) in a ligand-independent manner.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Our preliminary data showed that overexpression of hSRC-1a (36), which is a general coactivator for members of steroid receptors, cannot relieve the repressor activity of Gal4-COUP-TFI in HeLa cells (data not shown).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	186	In conclusion, we demonstrated that corepressors are involved in the mechanisms of COUP-TFI-mediated gene silencing, and that both N-CoR and SMRT can function as corepressors for COUP-TFI in mammalian cells.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Therefore, orphan receptors such as COUP-TFI and RevErb A can function as a repressor in vivo by utilizing corepressors that are common for members of the TR and RAR subfamily.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Many COUP-TFII +/ to  mutants die before weaning suggesting a haploinsufficiency phenotype of the COUP-TFII gene (7).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Upon analyzing the mating patterns of COUP-TFII +/ to  mice, we found that the COUP-TFII +/ to  females have reduced reproductive function.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	9	 COUP-TFII +/ to  female mice exhibited reduced fecundity characterized by reduced litter size, and genotype-dependent reduction in growth in the progeny.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Because normal female reproduction requires functional coordination throughout female hypothalamo-hypophyeal-ovarian endocrine axis, as well as an endocrinological link between ovary and uterus, subtle defects in multiple organs of this axis, could significantly alter the normal reproduction.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Therefore, we investigated the ovarian and uterine physiology of the COUP-TFII +/ to  mice to determine the cause of this reduction in female fecundity.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	12	Here, we report on the phenotypic analysis of the COUP-TFII +/ to  mouse, specifically related to female ovarian and uterine function.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Analysis of ovarian function was conducted by challenging COUP-TFII +/ to  and control mice with a superovulatory regimen of gonadotropins and assaying the ability of the ovary to ovulate and produce ovarian steroids.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The COUP-TFII +/ to  mouse showed normal ovulation of oocytes but demonstrated a reduced capability for synthesizing sex steroid hormones.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This reduction is due to the reduction of the expression of steroidogenic enzymes important for P4 synthesis and the reduction of vascularization in COUP-TFII heterozygotes.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Analysis of uterine function in the COUP-TFII +/ to  mice was accomplished by assaying the response of the uterus to an endocrine induction of the decidual reaction.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	17	 COUP-TFII +/ to  showed a reduced decidual cell reaction in response to the artificial stimulation, indicating a defect in endometrial function.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Significant growth retardation of COUP-TFII +/ to  was clearly shown in mutants as compared with the wild-type controls nursed by either COUP-TFII +/+ or COUP-TFII +/ to  mothers (Fig.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	35	A, Gene dosage effect of COUP-TFII on postnatal growth rate was assessed by daily monitoring of body weight of progeny from wild-type male X heterozygote female (for wild-type or heterozygous pups nursed by heterozygous mother) or heterozygous female X wild-type female (for wild-type or heterozygous pups nursed by wild-type mother).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Normal growth was assumed in wild-type pups nursed by wild-type female.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Significantly retarded growth rate was seen in heterozygous pups nursed by wild-type mother, but better than wild-type pups nursed by heterozygous mother.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Most severe growth defect was seen in heterozygous pups nursed by heterozygous mother.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	39	 B, Estrus cyclicity was assessed by daily inspection of vaginal smear of 20-wk-old virgin females.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	42	  In the analysis of the fecundity of the COUP-TFII +/ to  mice, the ability of the females to have normal reproductive cycles were monitored by recording the estrus cycles of 3-month-old females through daily inspection of vaginal smears.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The diagnostic difference was facilitated by modified Papanicolou staining.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	44	 A representative estrus cycle was schematized in Fig.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	45	 COUP-TFII +/+ females showed regular cyclicity, whereas COUP-TFII +/ to  female mice showed prolonged diestrus or metestrus, or lack of obvious estrus phase.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Thus, estrus cycles of female heterozygote were found to be irregular.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	47	To ensure the expression of COUP-TFII expression is reduced in the heterozygote, we isolated protein extracts from ovariectomized wild-type and COUP-TFII+/ to  uteri and performed Western blot analysis using COUP-TFII-specific antibodies.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Figure 2 shows that the expression of COUP-TFII is greatly reduced in comparison to the control.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The bar graph indicates that the expression levels of COUP-TFII are reduced approximately 2-fold in COUP-TFII+/ to  mice.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Similar level of reduction in COUP-TFII expression was also shown in the ovaries of COUP-TFII +/ to  in comparison to the controls (data not shown).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The above results indicate that COUP-TFII expression correlates with the loss a single allele in the COUP-TFII+/ to  mice.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	57	 COUP-TFII expression was reduced to about half in COUP-TFII +/ to  mice.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	58	  Expression of COUP-TFII in Female Reproductive Axis The above analysis demonstrates that COUP-TFII +/ to  female mice shows abnormal reproductive cycles and delayed puberty.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Part of this phenotype may be due to expression of COUP-TFII in the uterus because previous analysis has shown COUP-TFII is expressed in the adult female endometrium (8).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	60	 However, to determine where else COUP-TFII may be acting, the expression of COUP-TFII in the female reproductive axis was assessed.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	61	 This was accomplished using a genetically engineered mouse in which the LacZ reporter had been knocked into the COUP-TFII gene (9).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	62	 This mouse allows for the rapid and sensitive assay of the expression pattern of COUP-TFII.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Histological sections from hypothalamus, pituitaries, ovaries, and uteri from COUP-TFII-LacZ mice were analyzed by X-gal staining.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	67	 In the adult ovary, strong staining was found in the theca cells, the layer surrounding the granulosa cells of ovarian follicles, but not detected in the granulosa cells.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Weaker staining was detected in mesenchymal cells surrounding the corpus luteum (Fig.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	69	 To ensure that the X-gal staining faithfully recapitulated the endogenous COUP-TFII expression, we used COUP-TFII-specific antibody in immunostaining to assess the expression of COUP-TFII in the ovaries.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Again, strong staining was found in the theca cells, weak staining in the corpus luteum, and no detectable staining in the granulosa cells (Fig.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The patterns of COUP-TFII expression using immunostaining are virtually identical with that shown using X-gal staining.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Thus, X-gal staining could be used as an alternative assays to assess endogenous COUP-TFII expression patterns.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	92	Because uterine gene expression is regulated by steroid hormones, we also examined the effects of exogenous steroid hormones and exogenous gonadotropins on COUP-TFII expression in the uterine endometrium (Fig.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	93	 In ovariectomized females, COUP-TFII expression was high in endometrial stroma (Fig.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Therefore, the reduction in fertility in the COUP-TFII +/ to  may be due to deficiencies in any of these three organs.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	122	 To determine whether the cause of the reduced fertilely may be due to a reduction in ovarian function, ovarian function was assayed by determining the ability of the ovaries to respond to a superovulatory regimen of hormones and determining the number of oocytes ovulated, as well as the production of progesterone after superovulation, as well as during pregnancy.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	123	 The results of this analysis are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	124	 There was no significant difference between COUP-TFII +/ to  and COUP-TFII +/+ in the number of oocytes ovulated in response to gonadotropins.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Although the ability of the COUP-TFII +/ to  mice to ovulate is normal, perturbation in the level of progesterone, P4, production may contribute to the reduced fertility.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	126	 As shown in Table 4, P4 levels were significantly decreased in COUP-TFII +/ to  females subsequent to exogenous hCG stimulation.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Measurement of P4 and pregnenolone (P5) levels in pregnant (gestational d 15) females, were shown to be lower in heterozygous females, although statistically not significant.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Therefore, the ovaries of COUP-TFII +/ to females are able to undergo normal ovulation, but the reduction in fertility may be due to impairment of the corpus luteum of COUP-TFII +/ to  mouse ovaries to produce P4 in early pregnancy.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	131	  Reduction of Expression Levels of Steroidogenic Components Critical to P4 Synthesis We showed that the predominant site of expression of COUP-TFII in the ovary is the theca interna, but not in the granulosa cells.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Theca cells are responsible for synthesizing precursor C19 steroids in the preovulatory follicle in response to LH, and granulosa cells aromatize the precursor steroids in vivo under the regulation of FSH (10).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	133	 In the corpus luteum, however, large luteal cells that are believed to be derived from the granulosa cells are capable of synthesizing P4 from circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (10).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Thus, vascularization of corpus luteum upon ovulation is considered to be important to supply the luteal cells with the substrates to synthesize P4.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	135	Considering the importance of COUP-TFII in angiogenesis (7), we conducted microscopic examination of COUP-TFII+/ to  and wild-type super ovulated ovaries to determine whether vascularization is perturbed.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Although no obvious microscopic abnormality could be detected in the COUP-TFII+/ to  ovaries, we noted the lumen of vessels in COUP-TFII +/ to  ovaries is not as dilated as the COUP-TFII +/+ control, suggesting that COUP-TFII +/ to  ovaries might not be well supplied with blood (Fig.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	137	 We then used an endothelial-specific marker, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM), in immunostaining to examine the vessel more closely.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	138	 A considerable reduction in CD31 (PECAM-1)-positive stained vessels was seen in the COUP-TFII +/ to  corpus luteum (Fig.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	152	  The impaired steroid production in the COUP-TFII+/ to  female mice could also be due to alteration in the expression levels of steroidogenic components critical for P4 biosynthesis.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	154	 As a control, we first examined the mRNA expression levels of COUP-TFII and showed that COUP-TFII mRNA level was reduced to 30% in the heterozygote in compared with the wild-type controls (Fig 5D).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Similarly, a significant reduction (40%) of cytochrome P450, family 11, subfamily a, polypeptide 1 (Cyp11a1), mRNA levels was detected (Fig.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The reduction of mRNA expression of all these components important for P4 biosynthesis will no doubt also contribute to the observed reduction of P4 levels in the COUP-TFII+/ to  female mice.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Reduced Decidual Cell Reaction in COUP-TFII Heterozygote.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	168	Decidual cell reaction was induced by traumatizing left uterine horn (L) after hormonal treatment of ovariectomized wild-type or heterozygous females.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Right horn (R) was left intact for control.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	170	 A, Typical deciduoma formation in the left uterine horn of wild-type female is shown on the top panel, whereas limited decidual cell reaction was seen in the left uterine horn of heterozygous female shown in the bottom panel.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	171	 B, Wet weight of left horn and right horn from each animal was weighted and ratio between left stimulated horn and right control horn (L/R ratio) were calculated.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	172	 There was significant decrease (P = 0.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	173	018) in L/R ratio for COUP-TFII heterozygous females.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	174	There is abundant expression of COUP-TFII in the VMH of the central nervous system.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Although the significance of VMH expression is not clear, several of the observed haploinsufficiency phenotypes (e.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	176	 growth retardation and delayed puberty) are consistent with the idea that the COUP-TFII +/ to  mouse may suffer from mild hypopituitarism.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	177	 However, there was no significant decrease in IGF-I in heterozygotes (data not shown), which is indicative of other potential growth perturbation.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	178	 COUP-TFII has been implicated to interfere with the function of the orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) (11).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	179	 SF1 null mice resulted in defective development of VMH (12).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Rescue experiments using SF1 null mutants indicated SF1 functions in VMH to regulate late onset obesity (13).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Thus, it might be interesting to speculate that COUP-TFII and SF1 reciprocally regulate growth in VMH.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Future specific deletion of COUP-TFII could elucidate this aspect of COUP-TFII function.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	183	Although the role of COUP-TFII in the VMH is speculative, the role of COUP-TFII in the ovary was investigated.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	184	 COUP-TFII mice did not demonstrate impairment in ovulation but did show impairment in the ability of P4 production.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The reduced capability to synthesize P4 in response to exogenous gonadotropin suggests potential defects in the ovarian function of COUP-TFII +/ to .
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Theca cells in the ovaries are responsible for synthesizing precursor C19 steroids in the preovulatory follicle in response to LH, and granulosa cells aromatize the precursor steroids in vivo under the regulation of FSH (11).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	187	 In the corpus luteum, however, large luteal cells that are believed to be derived from the granulosa cells are capable of synthesizing P4 from circulating LDL (11).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Thus, vascularization of corpus luteum upon ovulation is considered to be important to supply the luteal cells with the substrates to synthesize P4.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The high expression of COUP-TFII in the theca cells, but not in granulosa cells, suggests COUP-TFII might be involved in a steroidogenic pathway, or it might have a significant role during vascularization of the corpus luteum.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Here, we showed that vascularization as measured by PECAM immunostaining is perturbed in COUP-TFII +/ to  mice as compared with the controls.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	191	 This might lead to inefficient delivery of LDL to the large luteal cells resulting in the reduced ability of the corpus luteum to synthesize P4.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	192	 In addition, we also show that the expression levels of mRNA of CYP11a1, HSD3b1, and StAR are significantly reduced in the COUP-TFII+/ to  female mice.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	193	 All of these genes are important for the biosynthesis of P4.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Thus, the reduction in the expression of these genes will directly contribute to the observable reduced P4 levels in the COUP-TFII+/ to  female mice, and the decrease in circulating P4 in pregnant COUP-TFII +/ to  females might result in the reduced ability of the uterus to support pregnancy.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	195	The reduced levels of P4 in early pregnancy may impact on COUP-TFII expression in the uterus during early pregnancy.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Analysis of the expression of COUP-TFII in the uterus shows that E2 treatment caused drastic decrease of COUP-TFII expression in the endometrial stroma, whereas P4 treatment with E2 attenuates E2 action, restoring COUP-TFII expression in the stroma.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	197	 COUP-TFII expression was low after treatment with PMSG, which induces ovarian E2 synthesis, and COUP-TFII expression in the endometrial stroma increased expression after hCG, which induces ovarian P4, are consistent with steroid hormone regulation in hormone-treated ovariectomized females.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	198	 The lower levels of P4 in the COUP-TFII +/ to  mouse combined with the loss of one COUP-TFII allele in the uterine stromal cell may be the partial cause of the haploinsufficient decrease in uterine function in these mice.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	199	 However, reduced uterine stromal cell function was still observed after exogenous administration of P4 indicating that part of the haploinsufficient phenotype is specific to the uterus.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	200	During implantation, the endometrial stromal cells undergo a series of complex processes called decidualization (14, 15).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The process of decidualization involves concurrent cell proliferation, differentiation, as well as angiogenesis.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Based on our findings, it is evident that uterine function is significantly affected in COUP-TFII heterozygous females.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	203	 The relatively high expression of COUP-TFII in endometrial stromal cells, the steroid regulation of COUP-TFII expression in the endometrial stroma, and the reduced decidual cell reaction all support this notion.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Identification of the role of COUP-TFII in the process of decidualization may be discerned from the analysis of what other genes have been shown to regulate this process.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	205	Several targeted null mutant mice, including progesterone receptor (PR) (16), Hoxa-10 (17), and 11 (18) exhibited defects in decidual cell reaction.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Consistent with the notion that P4 is required for decidualization in human endometrium, decidual cell reaction was absent in PRKO female mice (16).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	207	 One of the potential key genes that are regulated by P4 is Indian hedgehog (IHH) (8), a well-known morphogen.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Hedgehog signaling is known to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation during embryonic development (19).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The fact that IHH is expressed at preimplantation endometrial epithelial cells and its expression is rapidly induced by P4 (8) further implicates its role in mediating PR function.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Importantly, it has been demonstrated that COUP-TFII is regulated by hedgehog signaling (20).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	211	 One of the intriguing possibilities is that P4 regulates IHH in the luminal epithelium, priming stroma cells for decidualization.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	212	 COUP-TFII, a downstream target of IHH could mediate IHH signaling in the endometrium during periimplantation (8).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Importantly, both IHH and COUP-TFII had been implicated in angiogenesis (7, 21).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	214	 It is our speculation that during artificially induced decidualization or repeated remodeling of endometrium after first conception, normal vascularization is moderately, but functionally significantly affected by COUP-TFII.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	215	Taken together, phenotypic analysis using the haploinsufficiency model of COUP-TFII indicated several functions of this gene in the female reproductive tract.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Combination of those haploinsufficiency phenotypes throughout the female reproductive axis might additively affect female reproductive function.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Although use of this model might be limited for overall phenotypic analysis, it, perhaps, could reveal the global impact of a gene dosage effect (as in human genetic conditions) on female reproduction.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	218	 We propose that COUP-TFII plays an important role in the endometrial stroma during the periimplantation period.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Detailed molecular and cellular mechanisms could be elucidated by conditional gene targeting approaches, such as using endometrial-specific Cre recombinase.

0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Therefore, although a wide range of fatty acids were found within its ligand binding pocket, HNF4 appears to exhibit selectivity toward a subset of those found in bacteria.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Future experiments with mammalian tissues are required to determine which fatty acids bind under relevant conditions and whether the capacity of HNF4 to serve as a fatty acid sensor has physiological or pathological ramifications.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	68	The fact that the fatty acids were persistently bound even after a multistep purification indicated that they were tightly associated.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	69	 This was borne out by additional attempts to strip the lipids from the protein, as the fatty acids remained associated after dialysis and gel-filtration chromatography (data not shown).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	70	The serendipitous presence of fatty acids provided an opportunity to analyze how ligands bind to HNF4.

0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Density beyond that point was weak, indicating that the remainder of the chain is either flexible or occupies multiple conformations.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The cavity has an internal volume of 370 A3, calculated by the program Voidoo (18), which is almost entirely occupied by fatty acid.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	74	 While this volume is within the normal range for nuclear receptor LBDs, the elongated, relatively linear shape of the pocket is atypical.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Both oxygens of the fatty acid head group are ion-paired with the guanidinium group of Arg226, and one oxygen forms additional hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH of Gly237 and side chain OH of Ser181 (Fig.

0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	84	Although HNF4 and RXR are similar in terms of amino acid sequence, their ligand binding specificities are distinct.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	85	 This is due in part to Phe313 in RXR, which points inward and directs bound 9-cis-retinoic acid upward toward 5 (19).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The corresponding residue in HNF4 is Ala223, which, presumably because of the decreased bulk of the side chain, allows the fatty acid ligand to curl downwards toward 7.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	87	 It is thus particularly interesting to note that F313A substitution in RXR leads to constitutive activation, due to the spontaneous binding of an endogenous fatty acid as we have seen for wild-type HNF4 (19).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The fatty acid in the binding pocket of RXR F313A adopts a U shape, and density is interpretable out to the C18 position.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In contrast, the side chains from residues Met182 and Met342 fill the upper portion of the HNF4 ligand binding pocket to prevent the fatty acid from looping around to form a U, and we don't see density past the C12 position.

0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	91	Helix 12 Adopts Two Conformations-- The two molecules within each dimer adopt distinct conformations.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In the first, referred to as the open state, 12 is fully extended and contiguous and collinear with 10 (Fig.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The second molecule of each homodimer adopts a closed conformation, with 12 situated against the body of the LBD.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The conformation of the "open" state is fixed by crystal packing between two open forms at an axis of symmetry.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	95	 In the closed state, residues Leu360, Leu361, Met364, and Leu365 form a hydrophobic face on 12 that interacts with a corresponding hydrophobic surface on the body of the domain created by residues from 3 (Met182, Lys183, Leu186, Leu187, Leu189, and Val190) and 4 (Leu211, Ala215, Gly216, and Leu219).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Residues Gln362 and Glu363 help to anchor 12 through hydrogen bonds with Lys350 in 10 and Arg212 in 4, respectively.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Since fatty acid ligands similarly occupy the ligand binding pockets of molecules in open and closed conformations, the structural rearrangement does not appear to be required for ligand-mediated activation as has been proposed for other nuclear receptors (17, 20, 21).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	98	 It is possible that to lock the domain in its closed and active state, both ligand and coactivator must be bound, but since our structure lacks coactivator, it does not test this hypothesis.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	99	The Dimer Interface-- As opposed to many nuclear receptors that form heterodimers, HNF4 functions primarily as a homodimer (22).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Consistent with this, the LBD of HNF4 crystallizes as a canonical homodimer with near-perfect 2-fold symmetry about the interface (Fig.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	101	 A 1156-A2 surface of each monomer is buried at the dimer interface.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	102	 A coiled coil interaction between 10 from each molecule dominates the interface, with hydrophobic side chain-side chain interactions (Phe325:Phe325, Leu329:Leu329, Leu330:Ile283, Leu332:Leu330, Pro333:Pro333 and Trp340:Trp340) along its length (Fig.

0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	104	MODY1 Mutations-- Of 14 mutations in HNF4 that have been found in patients with the MODY1 form of diabetes (5, 8, 9, 23), three encode substitutions within the LBD (V255M, E276Q, R324H).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	105	 The side chain of Val255 (in 7) points into the ligand binding cavity where it participates in ligand recognition.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	106	 While questions have been raised about functional consequences of the V255M substitution (24), the structure suggests that a methionine side chain at this position would partially occlude the ligand binding cavity and potentially alter binding affinity or specificity.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Contact between Val255 and backbone atoms of 10 in the vicinity of Met342 is also predicted to stabilize the protein fold.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Therefore, the V255M substitution might also decrease protein stability and reduce its concentration in cells or ability to homodimerize.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Side chains from the other two MODY1-associated residues, Glu276 (amino terminus of 8) and Arg324 (9/10 loop), form an ionic interaction, and Glu276 forms a second ionic interaction with Arg317 (also in the 9/10 loop).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Neither of these residues is involved directly in ligand binding, but mutations in them may influence dimerization.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	111	 While the residues themselves are not at the dimer interface, the 9/10 loops of two molecules interact with each other.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Since the residues help tether the 9/10 loops, it is likely that loss of interactions between Glu276 and Arg324 would destabilize dimerization.

0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Moreover, we have revealed the importance of functional interactions between the nuclear factor for interleukin 6 (NF-Il6), Sp1 and COUP-TFI in the regulation of the initial phase of HIV-1 gene transcription in brain cells (15).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The transcription factor Sp1 is one of the crucial cellular proteins for efficient HIV-1 gene transcription (16 to 18).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	17	 A number of studies have reported that Sp1 can serve as an anchor for indirect binding of other transcription factors to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) region.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In all cell types, an interaction between Sp1 and Tat is required for optimal HIV-enhancer activation (19).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Moreover, Sp1 is able to recruit the Cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb to the LTR, which helps to bypass a requirement for TAR/Tat and promotes processive transcription without Tat (20).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In microglial cells, the main HIV-1 target cells in the brain (6), Sp1 anchors COUP-TF (13) and NF-IL6 (15) to the three GC-boxes adjacent to the viral CATA box.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The CATA box is used instead of the TATAA box for optimal HIV-1 gene transcription and replication (21).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	22	 We have shown that Sp1 and COUP-TF interact and cooperate in the transcriptional activation of HIV-1 gene transcription (13).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Moreover, COUP-TF can substitute to Sp1 association with the viral Tat protein to restore Tat function and HIV-1 replication in microglial cells (22).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	24	 These results highlight the key roles of Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins in HIV-1 expression in microglial cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	25	Members of the COUP-TF family have been shown to bind related zinc finger proteins named COUP-TF-interacting protein 1 (CTIP1) and 2 (CTIP2) that are highly expressed in brain and immune systems (23,24).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Recent results support the selective contribution of these proteins in the development and function of the nervous and immune systems (24).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	27	 We recently described that the nuclear cofactor CTIP2 inhibits the subsequent phase of HIV-1 gene transcription and viral replication by relocating the viral transactivator Tat protein to transcriptionally inactive regions of chromatin via Hp1 (25).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In the present work, CTIP2 overexpression leads to the repression of HIV-1 replication.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In contrast, CTIP1 was unable to affect Tat function.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Using confocal microscopy to visualize Tat subcellular distribution in the presence of each CTIP proteins, we found that CTIP2, but not CTIP1, leads to the disruption of Tat nuclear localization and to its recruitment within CTIP2-induced nuclear ball-like structures.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In addition, we showed that CTIP2 and Hp1 associate with Tat to form a three-protein complex.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	32	 These findings suggest that the inhibition of HIV-1 expression by CTIP2 correlates with the recruitment of Tat within CTIP2-induced structures and its relocalization within inactive regions of chromatin.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	33	On line with this study, we noticed that CTIP proteins also affect HIV-1 gene transcription in the absence of Tat, which means that CTIP proteins may also impair endogenous cellular transcription factor functions of importance for the initial phase of HIV-1 gene transcription.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	34	Here, we report that CTIP proteins repress HIV-1 gene transcription via the proximal LTR region which binds Sp1 and COUP-TF transactivators.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Since COUP-TF and Sp1 cellular transcription factors are two of the major contributors to HIV-1 gene transcription in microglial cells, we have postulated that Sp1- and COUP-TF-mediated LTR-driven activation may be impaired by CTIP1 and CTIP2.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	36	 We report here that both CTIP1 and CTIP2 repress Sp1- and COUP-TF-mediated stimulation of HIV-1 gene expression.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Since the CTIP2 repressive activity is much stronger than the CTIP1-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 replication, we focused our study on CTIP2.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	38	 CTIP2-mediated repression of Sp1 and COUP-TF functions results from direct physical interactions of these cellular transcription factors with CTIP2.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Association with CTIP2 forces Sp1 and COUP-TF relocation to CTIP2-induced subnuclear structures containing the heterochromatin-associated protein Hp1.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Moreover, CTIP2 can be recruited to the HIV-1 promoter by a physical association with Sp1 bound to the GC-box regions of the LTR.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Since Sp1 or COUP-TF transcription factors are necessary for the Tat function in microglial cells (22), CTIP2-mediated repression of COUP-TF and Sp1 functions may largely contribute to the previously described CTIP2-mediated impairment of Tat activity and viral replication in microglial cells (25).

0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	130	 We have previously shown that CTIP2 harbors two independent interaction domains with the viral Tat protein (25).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	131	 This prompted us to determine whether an additional interaction interface was located in the N-terminal or the central region of CTIP2.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	132	 To this end, GST pull-down experiments were performed with additional deletion constructs.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	133	 As expected, the deletion mutant 350 to 716 was not able to interact with COUP-TF and Sp1, confirming that the C-terminal region of CTIP2 containing residues 717 to 813 mediates binding to these transcription factors.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	134	 However, the 1 to 354 and the 145 to 434 constructs appeared to be able to restore interactions, suggesting that the central region of CTIP2 located between the residues 145 and 354 might be sufficient for COUP-TF and Sp1 association.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	135	Thus, these findings indicate that CTIP2 interacts in vitro with the zinc finger domains of COUP-TF and Sp1 by two interfaces located in the central region (residues 145 to 354) and the C-terminal region (residues 717 to 813).

0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	239	 As expected, this heterologous promoter, containing three consensus binding sites for Sp1, was highly inducible by ectopic Sp1 overexpression (lane 3).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Interestingly, overexpression of CTIP2 also repressed Sp1-mediated transcriptional stimulation in the context of the GC-WAP promoter (lane 4), indicating that Sp1 binding sites were sufficient for CTIP2 activity.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	241	 These results also suggest that CTIP2 may be able to repress transcription of other Sp1-sensitive cellular genes.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	242	View larger version (12K):    Figure 7 Sp1 binding sites are dominant and sufficient but not absolutely necessary for transcriptional repression mediated by CTIP2.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	243	 (A) Microglial cells were transfected with 3  microg of pGC-WAP-CAT reporter vector and 1  microg of expression vectors as indicated.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	244	 (B) Microglial cells were transfected with 3  microg of pLTR-CAT, pLTR-CAT mutGC or pLTR-CAT GC and 1  microg of the indicated Flag-CTIP2 vector.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Two days post-transfection, CAT activities were measured and expressed relative to the value obtained with the reporter plasmids pGC-WAP-CAT or pLTR-CAT alone with the standard deviations indicated (values correspond to an average of at least three independent experiments carried out in duplicate).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	246	  To decipher whether CTIP2 repressive function is exclusively mediated by the Sp1 binding sites, we have further examined the LTR sequences responsible for CTIP2-mediated transcriptional repression.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	247	 To do that, we have transfected microglial cells with pLTR-CAT vectors containing mutated or deleted GC-boxes in the presence or absence of CTIP2.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	248	 As previously shown, CTIP2 expression resulted in a strong repression of the basal LTR-driven CAT activity (Figure 7B, lane 2).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Mutation (lane 3) or deletion (lane 5) of the Sp1 binding sites resulted in a  > 90% impairment of the LTR transcriptional activity, confirming the importance of endogenous Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins, which bind to this region and stimulate the initial phase of LTR-driven transcription in microglial cells (13).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Surprisingly, CTIP2 was still able to repress the low remaining transcriptional activity of the mutated (lane 4) and of the deleted (lane 6) LTR, suggesting that CTIP2 may also affect HIV-1 gene transcription via association with some other cellular transcription factors yet to be characterized.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	251	Here, we addressed the mechanism whereby CTIP2 impairs the initial phase (prior to Tat expression) of HIV-1 gene transcription in microglial cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	252	We report that CTIP proteins inhibit Sp1- and COUP-TF-mediated activation of HIV-1 gene transcription and replication in microglial cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	253	 To decipher the mechanism whereby CTIP2 alters COUP-TF and Sp1 functions, we examined whether these proteins interact in vitro and in cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	254	 GST pull-down experiments revealed that CTIP2 associates with the N-terminal region of COUP-TF and with the C-terminal region of Sp1 in vitro.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In this way, CTIP2 presents two interfaces for Sp1 and COUP-TF interactions.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	256	 COUP-TF and Sp1 proteins bind the central and the C-terminal region of CTIP2 in vitro.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	257	 These results are consistent with the previously reported interface domains of Arp1 (COUP-TFII) with CTIP1 (23).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Confocal microscopy observations of COUP-TF and Sp1 location in the presence or absence of CTIP2 reveal that CTIP2 colocalizes with COUP-TF and Sp1 within nuclear ball-like structures.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Moreover, the heterochromatin-associated protein Hp1 is also present in these structures.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	260	 There are three Hp1 protein family members in mammals, Hp1, Hp1ss and Hp1.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	261	 The Hp1 isoform is mainly detected in transcriptionally repressed heterochromatic region (36).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Thus, the colocalization of CTIP2 with endogenous Sp1, COUP-TF and Hp1 proteins as reported here strongly suggests that these proteins are relocated to transcriptionally inactive regions of heterochromatin in microglial cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Those CTIP2-induced structures may represent a new class of nuclear structures (25).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Moreover, our observations may favor the hypothesis, suggesting that the formation of nuclear bodies inhibits HIV-1 gene transcription by sequestering a variety of factors required for transcriptional activation [reviewed in (37)].
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	265	Co-immunoprecipitation data indicate that the described subnuclear colocalization results from physical interactions between Sp1, COUP-TF, Hp1 and CTIP2 in the nucleus of microglial cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Since Hp1, Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins associate with CTIP2 in microglial cells, we address their respective interaction interfaces in vitro.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Our findings show that the central zinc finger domain of CTIP2 may preferentially bind Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins, while the C-terminal region may bind to Hp1.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	268	 In the presence of the viral Tat transactivator, CTIP2 also associates with Hp1 via its C-terminal region.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Taken together, these findings suggest a permanent association of CTIP2 with Hp1 via its C-terminal region.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	270	 The central domain of CTIP2 may be reserved for the interactions with the functionally repressed transcription factors.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Our observations indicate that COUP-TF and Sp1 could bind together to CTIP2 and that COUP-TF and CTIP2 do not compete for Sp1 binding.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Those findings suggest the formation of a ternary complex, including COUP-TF, Sp1 and CTIP2 proteins.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Thereby, CTIP2 links these transcriptional activators to transcriptionally repressed heterochromatic region.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	274	 CTIP1 and CTIP2 proteins have been described as sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (33).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	275	 The core-binding site identified in this study is highly related to the canonical GC-box sequence.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Since Sp1 anchors COUP-TF to the GC-box sequence of the viral LTR region (12), we addressed how CTIP2 interacts with the HIV-1 promoter.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Our findings demonstrate that CTIP2 is not able to directly bind the three viral GC-box sequences in vitro.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	278	 CTIP2 is recruited to the HIV-1 LTR via its association with Sp1 bound to this region.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Moreover, CTIP2 is not in competition with COUP-TF for Sp1-mediated anchorage to the viral promoter, indicating that the three proteins are linked together to the LTR in vitro.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	280	 The ChIP experiments conducted in a cellular context confirm that CTIP2, Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins do bind the proximal region of the HIV-1 promoter in chromatin-integrated and non-integrated contexts.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	281	The surprising reduction of Sp1 or COUP-TF binding to the viral promoter in the presence of CTIP2 apparently does not agree with the in vitro observations.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	282	 We show that Sp1 anchors CTIP2 and COUP-TF to the HIV-1 LTR and that Sp1 binding to the GC-box sequence is necessary for CTIP2 recruitment to this region.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Nevertheless, since Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins are not accessible to their related antibodies in the CTIP2-induced nuclear structures, one wonders whether the observation of reduced binding to the LTR may result from protein sequestration and/or chromatin environment.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	284	 ChIP experiments also indicate that CTIP2 promotes Hp1 recruitment to the LTR encompassing the Sp1 binding sequences.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Mutation of the Sp1 binding sites abolished this recruitment.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Taken together, these results suggest that the Sp1-mediated anchorage of CTIP2 to the HIV-1 LTR region may recruit a large complex that promotes Hp1 association, heterochromatin environment and viral gene transcriptional silencing.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	287	 In Jurkat cells, CTIP2 associates with the histone deacetylase SirT1 in a large complex.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	288	 CTIP2-mediated recruitment of SirT1 to promoter template results in a deacetylation of the bound histones H3 and H4 and in a transcriptional repression (35).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	289	 The chromatin structure close to the HIV-1 gene promoter is involved in viral post-integration latency phenomenon (38).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Further studies will be necessary to examine the CTIP2-recruited complex that promotes HIV-1 gene silencing.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	291	To control whether the CTIP2 repressive function is mediated by Sp1 binding sites, we have examined its ability to repress a heterologous promoter containing three consensus GC-boxes.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Our findings reveal that GC-box sequences are sufficient for CTIP2-mediated repression of Sp1 stimulation, suggesting that CTIP2 may impact the transcriptional activity of other GC-box containing promoters.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	293	 In agreement with these observations, CTIP2 is still able to repress LTR-driven transcriptional activity of a LTR deleted downstream of the GC-box sequences.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Recruitment of CTIP1 to the template by a COUP-TF family member has been found to result in a transcriptional repression of a reporter gene harboring a COUP-TF binding site (23).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	295	 In the context of the HIV-1 promoter, deletion of the previously described COUP-TF binding site did not impact CTIP2 repressive function.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Moreover, EMSA and ChIP experiments demonstrate that CTIP2 interacts with the proximal region of the LTR excluding the COUP-TF binding sequence.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Taken together, these findings indicate that the COUP-TF binding sequence, located downstream to the GC-box region, might not be implicated in the CTIP2 repressive functions.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	298	 As widely reported, deletion of the LTR GC-box region results in a drastic ( > 90%) reduction of the LTR-driven transcriptional activity (13 to 15,22).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	299	 These observations confirm the crucial contribution of Sp1 and COUP-TF transcription factors to support viral gene transcription in microglial cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Moreover, they highlight the importance of CTIP2-mediated repression of Sp1 and COUP-TF protein functions.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Most of the 80% CTIP2-mediated reduction of the basal transcriptional level may be charged on to this repressive activity.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Surprisingly, CTIP2 is still able to repress the 10% remaining transcriptional activity driven by a GC-box deleted LTR, suggesting that CTIP2 may also be able to repress the expression of mutated strains of virus.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	303	 This remaining activity represents  < 10% of the global CTIP2-mediated repressive activity.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	304	Nevertheless, we have previously suggested that COUP-TF restores the viral Tat function in the context of a GC-box mutated LTR by anchoring Tat to the basal transcriptional machinery (22).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Interestingly, we observed that CTIP2 is also able to repress this functional cooperation (C.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	306	 These results suggest that, in this context, COUP-TF may bind CTIP2 via its N-terminal region and the general transcription factor TFIIB via its C-terminal part as described previously (39).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Thus, in the absence of Sp1-mediated linkage to the GC-box region of the HIV-1 LTR, CTIP2 may bypass Sp1 association by a COUP-TF-mediated linkage to the basal transcriptional machinery.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Moreover, this proposed indirect linkage might be weak since it appeared undetectable by ChIP experiments.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Along this line, CTIP2 might also associate to some other cellular transcription factors yet to be characterized.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	310	These studies fully complete those reporting CTIP2-mediated repression of the viral Tat function (25).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Since Sp1 or COUP-TF association is necessary for Tat function in microglial cells (22), it can be postulated that CTIP2-mediated impairment of Sp1 and COUP-TF function contributes to the previously observed repression of Tat function.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	312	The chromatin structure at the site of provirus integration is reminiscent to post-integration latency phenomenon (38).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	313	 In vitro, latent T-cell clones frequently contain HIV-1 genome integrated in heterochromatin structures.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	314	 This is in contrast to a productive infection where integration in or near heterochromatin is disfavored (40).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	315	 No antiretroviral drugs that are currently available can inhibit transcription of HIV RNA from the integrated HIV proviral DNA in infected cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Nevertheless, HDAC inhibitors are able to induce quiescent provirus, suggesting that derepression of heterochromatin structures may force viral expression from latently infected reservoirs (41,42).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Thus, investigation on factors that may promote heterochromatin structures to the viral gene promoter, such as CTIP2, appears crucial for understanding these phenomena and for the development of new anti-HIV strategies.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	318	 At this stage, further studies will be necessary to precisely examine the CTIP2-associated enzymatic activities that promote transcriptional silencing.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	319	 In addition, since our investigations were restricted to the transcriptional step of the viral life cycle, it cannot be excluded that CTIP2 also counteracts other critical steps necessary to optimal viral replication.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	320	 This possibility needs further clarification.

0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, April 18, 2003 , and in revised form, May 1, 2003.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	4	HNF4 has also been shown recently to play an important role in the regulation of hepatic glucose output, a key component of the maintenance of plasma glucose levels.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	5	 (10) recently demonstrated that the transcriptional regulation of gene for the key gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by cAMP was mediated by the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1 acting through HNF4.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	6	 These findings suggest that HNF4 may play a role in the transcriptional response of the liver to metabolic hormones and that factors regulating the activity of HNF4 could have an effect on hepatic glucose output.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	7	AMPK is the mammalian homolog of the yeast SNF1 protein kinase (11).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In yeast, the SNF1 complex is a nuclear protein that regulates expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism and is activated by phosphorylation when glucose is removed from the growth medium (12).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In mammalian cells, AMPK acts as a fuel sensor that monitors AMP and ATP levels.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	10	 It is activated by high AMP:ATP ratios during states of low energy charge.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Once activated, the enzyme reduces the activity of ATP-consuming anabolic pathways and increases the activity of catabolic ATP-producing pathways, acting to reestablish normal cellular energy balance (for review see Ref.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Depending on the tissue, a variety of physiological circumstances can cause AMPK activation including hypoglycemia (14), ischemia (15), heat shock (16), and exercise (17 to 19).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	13	 AMPK activation has been associated with several key aspects of metabolism including exercise-induced glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation in muscle (17, 20, 21), reduced lipid (22, 23) and glucose synthesis in liver (12, 24), and altered glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the endocrine pancreas (14, 25).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	14	AMPK is a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic subunit and two non-catalytic and subunits (26, 27) that exist in multiple isoforms (28 to 30).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Kinase activity is regulated allosterically by AMP binding and also by direct phosphorylation mediated by an uncharacterized AMP-sensitive protein kinase.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	16	 A potential role of AMPK in the nucleus is suggested by several observations.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The first is the similarity of the mammalian kinase to the yeast SNF1 transcriptional regulator, as described above.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Second, AMPK heterotrimers containing the 2 subunit isoform are preferentially found in the nucleus (31).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In addition, AMPK has been shown to phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivator p300 and to regulate its ability to mediate nuclear receptor transcriptional activity (32).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	20	It has been reported previously (33) that AMPK activation reduces HNF4 target gene transcription.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These findings, together with the fact that both proteins participate in the regulation of similar metabolic pathways, raise the possibility that HNF4 is directly regulated by AMPK.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The experiments described here examine the possibility that AMPK phosphorylates HNF4 and regulates its transcriptional activity.

0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	154	 This may be due to a combination of high basal phosphorylation of HNF4 by multiple kinases in vivo (36, 37) and the likelihood that there are additional AMPK phosphorylation sites on HNF4 (Fig.

0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The effect of phosphorylation on the ability of HNF4 to bind DNA would be less pronounced than the S304D mutation if less than 100% of the HNF4 protein is phosphorylated in the in vitro kinase reaction.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Although the efficiency of these reactions is unknown, it is likely that only a fraction of the HNF4 molecules become phosphorylated at Ser-304 leaving the non-phosphorylated protein free to form dimers and bind DNA.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	162	 In addition, it is also possible that dimers composed of one phosphorylated and one non-phosphorylated HNF4 molecule are competent to bind DNA.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	163	Because HNF4 binds DNA as a homodimer, the defective DNA binding of the S304D mutant could be due either to reduced dimer formation or to a diminished affinity of mutant dimers for DNA.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	164	 To examine directly the effect of the mutant on dimerization, in the absence of DNA, an in vitro association assay using 35S-labeled HNF4 monomers of different sizes was carried out.

0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Densitometry analysis of the Western blot demonstrated that the lower input amount of S304D protein (lane 6) did not account for the reduction in the amount of S304D bound to wild-type GST-HNF4 protein (data not shown).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	170	To examine further the ability of dimers composed of one unphosphorylated monomer and one phosphorylated monomer to form and bind to DNA, wild-type and S304D mutant HNF4 proteins of different sizes were mixed together and the resulting dimers analyzed by gel mobility shift.

0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Taken together, these results demonstrate that, in vitro, a negative charge on serine 304 inhibits dimer formation and that the effect is more pronounced when both monomers contain the additional negative charge.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	176	To examine the effects of Ser-304 phosphorylation on dimer formation and DNA binding in vivo, wild-type, S304A, and S304D expression constructs were transfected into CHO cells (which have very low amounts of endogenous HNF4).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	177	 After transfection, AMPK was activated by AICAR treatment, and nuclear extracts were prepared for gel mobility shift assays.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	178	 As observed in vitro the S304D phosphomimetic mutant showed reduced DNA binding activity (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	179	 In addition there is a mild reduction in DNA binding of the wild-type protein upon AICAR treatment (Fig.

0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	181	 However, much of this reduction in DNA binding activity correlates with changes in the amount of HNF4 present in the various transfections (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	182	 For example, the amount of S304D protein is significantly lower than the wild-type protein (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	183	 3D, compare lane 8 to lane 4, lower panel).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Likewise, the amount of wild-type HNF4 is reduced after AMPK activation (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	185	 3D, compare lanes 4 and 5, lower panel).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The reduction of HNF4 amounts after AICAR treatment did not occur with the phosphorylation-defective S304A mutation (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	187	 3D, compare lanes 6 and 7, lower panel) suggesting that the effect is due to phosphorylation at serine 304.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	188	 These changes in HNF4 protein amounts suggest that addition of a negative charge to serine 304 reduces the stability of the HNF4 protein in these cells.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	189	Potential effects of AMPK activation on HNF4 protein stability were further explored by examining the appearance of proteolytic products of wild-type and mutant HNF4 proteins in transiently transfected CHO cells treated with AICAR.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Western blot analysis shows that in the absence of AICAR detectable amounts of degradation fragments appear in only lysates from cells transfected with the phosphomimetic S304D HNF4 (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The activation of AMPK by AICAR addition induced the appearance of degradation fragments from the wild-type but not the phosphorylation-defective S304A protein (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	192	 These findings indicate that phosphorylation of HNF4 on serine 304 increased the proteolytic degradation of the protein.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In addition, these results strongly support the conclusion that AMPK phosphorylates HNF4 on serine 304 in vivo.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	194	 To measure the rate of degradation of wild-type and mutant HNF4 proteins, a tetracycline-regulated expression system was used to transiently express wild-type and 304 mutant HNF4 in transfected CHO cells.

0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo results suggest that phosphorylation of HNF4 at Ser-304 has two effects on HNF4: to reduce its ability to form functional dimers, and to reduce the stability of HNF4 in vivo.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	198	The HNF4 dimerization and DNA binding results presented above predict that the AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of HNF4 on serine 304 would have a negative effect on its transcriptional activity.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	199	 To determine whether this is the case, plasmids expressing wild-type and Ser-304 mutant proteins were transfected into CHO cells together with an HNF4-responsive reporter plasmid.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	200	 As predicted from the DNA binding studies, the S304D mutant showed significantly less transcriptional activity than the wild-type HNF4 protein (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The S304A mutant was slightly more active than the wild-type protein suggesting the possibility that there is a basal level of phosphorylation that reduces the activity of the wild-type protein.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	202	 These results indicate AMPK-negative regulates HNF4 activity by phosphorylation of serine 304 and suggest that AMPK activity could influence the expression of HNF4 target genes.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	203	In addition to the effects on HNF4 dimerization and DNA binding, phosphorylation of HNF4 on Ser-304, or conversion of Ser-304 to an aspartic acid, also caused an increase in the degradation rate and a reduction in the amount of HNF4 protein (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Our results are consistent with previous findings showing that activation of AMPK in primary hepatocytes resulted in a reduction in the amount of endogenous HNF4 (33).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Taken together, our findings suggest a model in which one of the branches of the AMPK signaling pathway results in the phosphorylation of HNF4 on serine 304, leading to both a reduction in the amount and activity of HNF4 and a subsequent reduction in the expression of HNF4 target genes.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	206	Although the work reported here is focused on the phosphorylation of the serine 304 residue in HNF4, it is clear that this is not the only site on HNF4 that is phosphorylated by AMPK.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The HNF4/A fragment from the N-terminal half of the protein was strongly phosphorylated in vitro on a site that we were not able to map.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	208	 This site (or sites) may be responsible for the remaining phosphorylation of the full-length protein that occurs when the Ser-304 residue is mutated to alanine (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	209	 We are currently mapping the AMPK site in the N terminus of HNF4 so that we can determine their functional significance.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	210	 In addition to the regulation of HNF4 activity that we describe here, it has been reported previously that HNF4 DNA binding activity is repressed by protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of residues in the DNA binding domain (37).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	211	 It has also been reported that phosphorylation of HNF4 on tyrosine residues affected its transcriptional activity and sub-nuclear localization (39).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	212	 These findings, together with those reported here, suggest that that HNF4 is a highly regulated transcription factor and that multiple signaling pathways influence its activity.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	213	An interesting question concerning the phosphorylation of HNF4 by AMPK in vivo is the cellular location in which it occurs.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	214	 HNF4 is strongly associated with the nucleus, whereas most of the known AMPK substrates are cytoplasmic enzymes.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Although it is possible that HNF4 is also phosphorylated by in the cytoplasm, the most appealing compartment for the interaction would be the nucleus.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Several observations support this possibility.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	217	 First, specific isoforms of the kinase have been reported to be present in the nucleus (31, 40).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Second, other transcriptional components have been reported to be potential substrates of the kinase; the co-activator p300 (32) and the carbohydrate-response transcription factor ChREBP (41).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Finally, the yeast homolog of mammalian AMPK, SNF-1, is present in the nucleus (for review see Ref.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	220	 13) and is associated with chromatin, possibly in a gene-specific pattern (42).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Together these observations suggest the intriguing possibility that at least some version of mammalian AMPK may be a component of the transcriptional complex on specific genes that are regulated by cellular energy balance.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	222	What would be the physiological outcome of reduced HNF4 target gene expression? The answer to this question depends on the tissue being considered.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	223	 In the endocrine pancreas, reduction of HNF4 activity would be predicted to have significant effect on the ability of the islet to secrete the appropriate amount of insulin.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	224	 This possibility is illustrated by the phenotype of MODY1 patients who have only one normal allele of the HNF4 gene and presumably a reduced amount of active HNF4 protein (3).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	225	 These patients have a defective insulin secretion in response that appears to be a primary effect of reduced HNF4 levels in pancreatic -cells (4, 43).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Consistent with the apparent role of HNF4 in pancreatic physiology are the observations that HNF4 regulates a variety of -cell genes involved in glucose sensing and insulin secretion (6 to 8).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	227	Like HNF4, AMPK also clearly plays a role in the physiology of the endocrine pancreas.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	228	 It is likely that the -cell senses glucose concentration as fluctuations in the amount of intracellular ATP generated by glucose oxidation.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	229	 The insulin secretory machinery gauges the amount of insulin to secrete by sensing these ATP level fluctuations (for review see Ref.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	230	 It is possible that the changes in cellular energy balance in -cells that occur in normal physiology have an effect on HNF4 phosphorylation and activity and that fluctuation in HNF4 activity are part of the normal physiological regulation of the islet.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Consistent with this possibility is the observation that low glucose levels induce AMPK activity in cell lines derived from pancreatic -cells and the suggestion that changes in kinase activity are involved in insulin secretion (25).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Alternatively, it is possible that AMPK-mediated changes in HNF4 activity are relevant in pathological conditions where AMPK is aberrantly activated and HNF4 activity is suppressed below normal levels.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	233	 This situation could potentially result in a physiological circumstance analogous to the MODY1 phenotype.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	234	Another tissue where AMPK-mediated changes in HNF4 target gene expression could have a significant metabolic effect is the liver.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	235	 It has been understood for many years that HNF4 plays an important role in the liver, regulating genes involved in lipid (45), amino acid (46, 47), and glucose metabolism (48, 49) and the coagulation cascade (50).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	236	 It has been reported recently that HNF4 plays a key role in the induction of hepatic gluconeogenesis by mediating the transcriptional effects of the co-activator PGC1 (10).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	237	 On the other hand, the reduction of HNF4 levels due to haploinsufficiency in MODY1 patients did not cause major liver abnormalities (5, 51), although changes in amounts of some liver-derived serum proteins were observed (52).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	238	It is clear that an AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of HNF4 could potentially have important effects on liver and pancreatic islet physiology.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	239	 We are currently examining HNF4 phosphorylation in hepatic and pancreatic cell lines to determine whether AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-304 occurs under more physiological conditions and to ascertain the potential metabolic role of the phosphorylation events described here.

0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	7	In mammals, HNF4 is encoded by two different genes: HNF4 and HNF4 (10).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The HNF4 gene potentially encodes nine distinct isoforms.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Their structure and nomenclature are presented in Ref.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	10	 HNF4 isoforms result from both alternate promoter usage and alternative splicing.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	11	 1A, promoter P1 initiates transcripts that contain exon 1A (isoforms 1 to 6), whereas promoter P2 initiates transcripts that contain exon 1D (isoforms 7 to 9; Refs.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Isoforms 2 and 8 are the alternatively spliced variants of isoforms 1 and 7, respectively.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	13	 They contain a 30-bp insert in their 3' sequence (Fig.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Compared with these four isoforms, isoforms 3 and 9, which have a completely different 3' sequence, are much less expressed, whereas isoforms 4 to 6 are very poorly expressed or have not yet been identified in vivo (1, 13).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The expression of HNF4 isoforms varies with development, differentiation, and tissue origin (1, 14, 15, 16).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The expression of HNF4 mainly initiates at the P1 promoter in adult liver and kidney (15).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Recently, two different groups documented the expression of transcripts of the P2 promoter in insulinoma INS-1 cells, as well as in mouse and human pancreatic islets, but did not detect transcripts of the P1 promoter, leading to the conclusion that HNF4 transcription is driven almost exclusively by the P2 promoter in the endocrine pancreas (11, 12, 17).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Strongly contrasting with these data, we observed that HNF4 transcripts initiated at the P1 promoter are substantially expressed, alongside P2 promoter transcripts, in human pancreatic ss-cells and in the rodent pancreatic ss-cell lines RIN m5F and HIT-T15.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Only HNF4 isoforms initiated at the P1 promoter contain the activation function module AF-1, which is encoded by exon 1A.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The AF-1 plays a key role in HNF4 transcriptional potential and in the recruitment of coactivators that are essential for HNF4 function (18, 19, 20).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	21	 We show that lack of the AF-1 in HNF4 isoforms initiated at the P2 promoter markedly decreases both the transcriptional potential and interaction with several coactivators.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Conversely, lack of the AF-1 does not affect the repression of HNF4 activity by small heterodimer partner (SHP).

0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	180	Compared with isoform 7, isoform 1 is a stronger transcriptional activator in nonpancreatic ss-cells except on promoters of genes that are expressed early in liver (15, 16, 42).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Our functional studies showed that the transcriptional potential of HNF42 was significantly stronger than that of isoform 8 in models of pancreatic ss-cells.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Interestingly, these results were obtained on the promoter of HNF1, which plays a crucial role in these cells (7, 9, 43, 44).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Because HNF1 expression is regulated by HNF4 in pancreatic ss-cells (5, 45), we suggest that expression of the HNF4 P1 promoter producing isoforms 1 and 2 is most probably of major importance in pancreatic ss-cells.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	184	 From our data obtained with HNF42 containing a mutated AF-1, we can infer that the difference in transcriptional potential between isoforms 2 and 8 was due to the lack of the AF-1 module in the latter isoform.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	185	Furthermore, lack of AF-1 in HNF4 resulted in a decreased interaction with p300 and GRIP-1 coactivators.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Interaction with p300 was studied using a fragment (amino acids 340 to 528) that interacts with both the HNF4 AF-1 and AF-2 (20).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Despite interaction through the AF-2, we observed a marked decrease in binding of HNF4 lacking the AF-1, thus highlighting the substantial contribution of AF-1 to the interaction with p300.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Consistent with this result, we observed that p300 enhanced the transcriptional potential of isoform 2 more efficiently than that of isoform 8 and HNF42 with a mutated AF-1.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Interestingly, the AF-1 module is also required for the synergistic action of p300 and GRIP-1 to enhance the HNF4 transcriptional activity (42).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	190	In contrast to these coactivators, the corepressor SHP interacted similarly with HNF42 and 8 and repressed their transcriptional activity to similar extents.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	191	 This strongly suggests that SHP-mediated recruitment of transcriptional inhibitor(s) is not AF-1 dependent.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), another HNF4 corepressor (46), was shown to interact similarly with HNF41 and HNF47 (42).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	193	 It appears therefore that the HNF4 AF-1 interacts only with coactivators whereas the AF-2 interacts with both coactivators and corepressors in a mutually exclusive fashion.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Because the balance between coactivators and corepressors is crucial for HNF4 transcriptional activity (38, 46), lack of the AF-1 in isoforms 7 and 8 most probably results in a shift toward a lower ability to recruit coactivators and a subsequent lower coactivator-mediated enhancement of HNF4 transcriptional potential.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	195	 SHP is highly expressed in human pancreatic islets (Moerman, E.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	196	, unpublished results) and may serve as an important checkpoint to balance the activity of the transcriptional network of pancreatic ss-cells (7, 8).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	197	 In these cells in which the HNF4 AF-2 has a high probability to be occupied by SHP, the transcriptional activity of isoforms containing the AF-1 may be more efficiently enhanced by coactivators.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Thus, even if the AF-1-dependent cofactor-mediated modulations of HNF4 transcriptional activity observed in this study and in Ref.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	199	 42 remain to be shown in pancreatic ss-cells, our results strongly argue for an essential role of the promoter P1-driven HNF4 isoforms in these cells.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	200	A cross-regulatory loop between HNF1 and HNF4 has been evidenced in pancreatic ss-cells, as reviewed in Refs.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	201	 In the model proposed by Ferrer (9), activation of the HNF1 promoter by HNF4 is crucial to maintain HNF1 expression above the threshold level required to hold the HNF1/HNF4 circuit in the switch-ON state and, consequently, to avoid ss-cell dysfunction and development of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (9).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Expression of the HNF4 P1 promoter transcripts in pancreatic ss-cells is probably crucial to maintain this circuit in the switch-ON state.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Indeed, HNF4 is expressed at a limiting amount in ss-cells, and, among isoforms 1, 2, 7, 8, and , only the first two contain the AF-1 module, which confers a stronger transcriptional potential and leads to a more efficient recruitment of coactivators.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Thus, expression of isoforms 1 and 2 is likely of crucial importance in the transcriptional network controlling pancreatic islet function.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, what is not clear is how a given nuclear receptor makes the switch from the p160/p300 complex to the DRIP complex.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Whereas the switch from corepressor to coactivator binding is apparently made by a conformational change in the receptor upon ligand binding, both types of coactivators bind liganded receptor and bind principally via the AF-2.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This suggests that perhaps a change not in the receptor but in the coactivators is required to make the switch from one complex to another.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, what might cause that switch is completely unknown at this point.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	14	In an attempt to answer some of these questions, we examined the interaction between an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4, NR2A1) and the DRIP complex.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	19	In this study, we show that the HNF4 LBD also interacts with a complex containing DRIP proteins in the absence of exogenously added ligand.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	70	 For example, spermine did not enhance binding of DRIP205.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Spermine also only marginally affected the ability of the HNF4 LBD to interact with another protein, namely 35S-labeled HNF41 (Fig.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The effect of spermine also required the presence of the NR boxes of DRIP205 as pull-downs with the full-length DRIP205 containing mutations in the two NR boxes (DRIP205.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	81	 These results indicate that whereas the effect of spermine was dependent on the presence of the AF-2 and the NR boxes, it was not due to an increased interaction between just these two regions.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	96	  Additional studies support the notion that the effect of the spermine may be due to more than simply an enhancement of the AF-2-NR box interaction and may in fact involve the entire DRIP205 molecule.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Because other coactivators have been found to interact with the DNA binding domain (DBD) of nuclear receptors (23, 24), we sought to determine whether DRIP205 might also interact with the HNF4 DBD and whether that interaction was affected by the addition of spermine.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Whereas the HNF4 DBD bound remarkably well to both the wt DRIP205 (67%) and the DRIP205 containing the mutated NR boxes (54.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Whereas it is possible that the decrease in binding of the full-length DRIP205 to the HNF4 DBD is not related to the increased in binding to the LBD, it is equally possible that the two effects are related.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	102	 For example, spermine could induce a conformational change in DRIP205.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	103	wt that causes a decrease in the interaction with the HNF4 DBD and an increase in the interaction with the LBD, perhaps as a result of increased access to the NR boxes.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Such a conformational change could also explain why the HNF4 LBD binds the truncated DRIP205 products better than the full-length DRIP205 and why that binding is not affected by spermine to in the truncated products, the NR boxes may already be fully accessible (Fig.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	105	If spermine is primarily affecting DRIP205 and not HNF4, then one might expect to see a similar affect on the interaction with other nuclear receptors.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Rather, the results suggest that blocking synthesis of polyamines such as spermine specifically decreased the ability of HNF41 to activate transcription.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Proposed Model for a Role of Polyamines in Transcriptional Activation.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	159	Polyamines such as spermine may decrease the binding of activators such as HNF4 and VDR to coactivators such as GRIP1 (a p160 family member) but increase the binding to DRIP205 (shaded molecules).
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	160	 This would allow for a switch between the p160/p300 complex and the DRIP complex, both of which interact with nuclear receptors via a common docking surface, the AF-2 (black dot).
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	161	 As described in the text, one potential source of the polyamines could be the chromatin.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	162	  Polyamines are small, ubiquitous, organic polycations found at relatively high concentrations in the cell, approximately 1 to 2 mM.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	163	 They have been implicated in a wide variety of physiological functions and have been found to bind proteins as well as nucleic acids (reviewed in Refs.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Perhaps one of the most intriguing, if elusive, roles of polyamines is in the regulation of gene expression.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Polyamines are implicated in the formation of higher order chromosomal fibers, facilitating condensation of chromatin fragments and interacting specifically with nucleosome core particles and DNA (31).
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Whereas this would suggest that an increase in polyamine levels would globally repress transcription, in fact it results in an increase in expression of many genes (32), suggesting that polyamines regulate gene expression by additional mechanisms.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	167	 One such mechanism could be via affecting the interaction of transcriptional activators, such as HNF4, with coactivators, such as the DRIP complex.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	168	The data presented in this study indicate that p160 family member GRIP1 and DRIP205 can synergistically activate transcription (Fig.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	169	 5B), suggesting that they act in a single pathway but raising the question of how the switch is made from one coactivator to the other.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Our data also show that the polyamine spermine can decrease the binding of at least two different nuclear receptors to GRIP1 (Fig.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	171	 5A) and can increase the binding to DRIP205 (Figs.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	172	 3 and 4), suggesting that polyamines may play a role in that switch.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Support for that role in vivo is observed when blocking the biosynthesis of polyamines resulted in a decrease in HNF4-mediated transcription (Fig.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	174	 If polyamines were acting at the level of chromatin only, and not at the level of coactivators, then one would expect a decrease in polyamine levels to decondense the chromatin and result in an increase, not a decrease, in transcription.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Therefore, the in vivo as well as the in vitro results suggest that polyamines may play a role in transcription activation other than altering the state of the chromatin.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	176	 However, it must be noted that other interpretations of the in vivo data are possible and that additional experiments are required to definitively prove that polyamines modulate the synergy between GRIP1 and DRIP205 in vivo.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	177	The model of polyamines playing a role in the switch between different coactivator complexes is intriguing but provocative, and raises several important questions.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	178	 One is how do polyamines affect binding of coactivators to activators? Whereas the mechanism is not known, our results suggest that it is not due to a simple enhancement of the interaction between the AF-2 of the nuclear receptors and the NR boxes of DRIP205 (Fig.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Rather, because truncated DRIP205 products bound the HNF4 LBD equally well in the presence and absence of spermine (Fig.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	180	 3), we favor a model in which polyamines induce a conformational change in DRIP205 that exposes otherwise buried NR boxes.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	181	 There is at least one example already of a conformational change in a coactivator that is important for its function (33).
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Another important question is where do the polyamines come from? Most of the polyamines in the cell are not free but are bound to negatively charged molecules such as chromatin (28, 29, 30).
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Because others have shown that the hyperacetylation of histones inhibits the ability of polyamines to condense the chromatin (31), it is possible that acetylation of histones by coactivators such as p300 or p300/CBP-associated factor may also cause a release of polyamines from the chromatin.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	184	 If this were the case, then upon activator binding DNA and recruiting a HAT-containing coactivator complex, there would be an increase in the local polyamine concentration that could then mediate the switch from the HAT-containing complex to the DRIP complex.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Some evidence already exists that polyamine levels can affect histone acetylation by influencing the action of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases (32).
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Finally, an attractive feature of the model is that it could apply not only to nuclear receptors but to any transcriptional activator that recruits both HAT-containing coactivators and the DRIP/TRAP/ARC/mediator complex, of which there are several examples (4, 7).

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	3	Hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is a transcription factor whose expression is crucial for mouse embryonic development, for liver-specific gene expression and for the prevention of one form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Its domain structure has been defined previously and is similar to other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	5	 A repressor domain has now been localised to a region of 14 amino acids (residues 428-441) near the C-terminus of HNF4 and is sufficient by itself to repress the activity of the activation function 2 (AF2) domain.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Multiple mutations within this repressor domain enhance activity.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Interestingly, this repressor domain shares homology with a repressor domain in the progesterone receptor.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In a detailed mutagenesis study of the AF2 core, we demonstrate that L 366, which is conserved in the AF2 core between HNF4 and a number of orphan nuclear receptors, is essential for the full activity of the AF2 domain.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Furthermore, a double mutation of E 363 and L 366 suggests that these residues might act in a cooperative manner.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	10	Hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) was first isolated as a protein involved in regulating a number of liver-specific genes (1).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	11	 It shares amino acid sequence homology with the nuclear receptor superfamily.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Since no ligand has yet been found for HNF4, it is classified as an orphan nuclear receptor.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	13	Extensive work carried out on nuclear receptors (e.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	14	 oestrogen and retinoic acid receptors) has shown that they have a modular structure, with distinct regions carrying out specific functions (2).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The N-terminal region (A/B) contains an activation function 1 (AF1) whose activity can be cell-type as well as promoter-context specific (3).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	16	 A highly conserved zinc finger domain, required for DNA binding, is present in region C, with region D acting as a hinge (2).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The C-terminal half of these receptors contains a long hydrophobic domain (region E), which encodes various functions.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	18	 These include receptor dimerisation, ligand binding and a ligand-dependent activation function 2 (AF2) (2).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The AF2 domain contains a core region of seven amino acids [Phi][Phi][KHgr]a[Phi][Phi]a/L (where `[Phi]' is a hydrophobic residue, `[KHgr]' any residue, `a' an acidic residue and L = leucine) which is critical for activation and is conserved in many nuclear receptors (4).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The extreme C-terminal region of these receptors (region F) varies in length between receptors and its function is unknown.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In HNF4, this region is extended and contains a proline-rich domain (1).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	22	HNF4 is expressed in many tissues including liver, kidney, pancreas and intestine (1,5,10).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	23	 There are a number of isoforms generated by alternative splicing (5).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	24	 For example, the HNF4[alpha] gene in humans encodes three isoforms, [alpha]1, [alpha] 2 and [alpha]4.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	25	 There is, in addition, a distinct [gamma] subtype encoded by the HNF4[gamma] gene (5).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The rat HNF4 isoforms 1-455 and 1-465 are equivalent to human [alpha]1 and [alpha]2 respectively (1,6).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In Xenopus laevis, HNF4 is encoded by two distinct ([alpha] and [beta]) genes (7).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	28	Deletion of HNF4 is embryonic lethal in mice, since it resulted in the induction of cell death in embryonic ectoderm and impairment of gastrulation of mouse embryos carrying a homozygous (-/-) knockout of the HNF4[alpha] gene (8).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In the regulation of the factor IX gene, point mutations which disrupt an HNF4 binding site result in haemophilia B (9,10).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Recently, heterozygotes carrying mutations in the HNF4[alpha] allele were linked to one form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY1) (11).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	31	 HNF4 is also involved in the regulation of a number of genes required for both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as well as erythropoiesis (1,12).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	32	 These genes include apolipoprotein CIII, pyruvate kinase, [alpha]1-antitrypsin and erythropoietin.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	33	Previous work aimed at investigating the C-terminal activation domain of HNF4 in transcription showed that large deletions in the C-terminal region abolished transactivation (12,13).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	34	 HNF4 was also shown to interact with the basal transcription factor TFIIB (13).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Recent evidence has suggested that E363 and L366 of the AF2 core are important for the activity of the AF2 domain (14).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	36	 However, this study was limited to single mutations at either position in the context of GAL4-HNF4 deletion fusion constructs (amino acids 128-370) which lacked other essential domains (the N-terminal AF1 domain, the DNA binding domain, and the repressor domain in the extended C-terminal region which is characterised in this report).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	37	In this report, we demonstrate by extensive mutagenesis in the context of both full-length HNF4 and full-length HNF4 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain that Leu 366 of the AF2 core is essential for full AF2 activity.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	38	 By investigating the effect of a double mutation involving both E363 and L366, we show that these residues may act cooperatively.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	39	 In addition, we have precisely mapped the location of a repressor domain (initially described in ref.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	40	 14 and postulated to lie between residues 371 and 455) to amino acids 428-441 and have defined amino acid residues within this domain which are required for its activity.

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Another potential criticism of a previous study (14) is that the conclusions as to the importance of particular amino acid residues of the AF2 core particular were based on studies of a single point mutant at each position, 363 and 366, which might not be representative had other mutants been studied.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Here we set out to study multiple mutations at position 366 of the AF2 core and to study a double mutant involving both positions 363 and 366 to gain further insight into the role of the AF2 core.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	173	The results of successive C-terminal deletions (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	174	 2) and fine deletion mapping (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	175	 4) initially suggested that L366 might be important for the activity of the C-terminal AF2 domain.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Therefore, four different point mutations (L->A, D, Q or I) were constructed to definitively assess the role of L 366 in both full-length HNF4 (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	177	 5C and D) and GAL4 full-length HNF4 fusion constructs (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	178	 All mutations decreased the transactivation activity, indicating that Leu 366 is required for full activity.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	179	 However, in contrast to a previous report where the activity of a mutant at 366 was reduced to [sim]5% of wild-type, we detected activities varying from [sim]35 to 75% of wild-type.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	180	 This suggested, surprisingly, that transactivation activity is not absolutely dependent on Leu 366, even although it is conserved in a number of orphan receptors (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	181	 A, D, Q and I were clearly functional at least in our transient transactivation assay.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	182	 This result is not an artefact of the fusion of intact HNF4 to the GAL4 DNA binding domain, since essentially similar quantitative results were obtained irrespective of whether full-length HNF4, or full-length HNF4 fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain, were studied (compare Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	183	 However, the fact that a conservative amino acid substitution 366 (L->I) showed the highest activity in our assay ([sim]60-70%), whereas non-conservative amino acid substitutions 366 (L->A, D, Q) showed lower activities (35-60%) still argues for the functional importance of Leu at 366 (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	184	E363 is also highly conserved between HNF4 and all nuclear receptors with known ligands, although it is substituted by a D in some orphan receptors (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	185	 E363 was selected for mutation because it is known to be involved in the formation of a salt-bridge and is critical for transactivation in RAR[gamma] (18).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Mutation of E363->A in HNF4 here (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	187	 5) indicated that this residue, like residue 366, was required for full activity.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Our result at this position differed from a previous report (where activity was reduced to  < 5% of wild-type; 14) in that significant residual activity was observed (between 50 and 70% of wild-type; Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	189	 5C and D) depending on whether with the full-length HNF4 construct or the GAL4 full-length HNF4 fusion construct was used in the transactivation assay.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	190	 We attribute this difference to the fact that full-length HNF4 was used in our studies, whereas HNF4 deletion constructs were used in the previous report (14).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	191	It is significant that a double mutant of 363 and 366 also retained [sim]50% activity in our assay (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The fact that the double mutant failed to demonstrate an additive effect over and above that of the two point mutants assayed separately is consistent with E363 and L366 cooperating to regulate the activity of the AF2 domain.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	193	 These experiments illustrates both the importance of E363 and L366 of the AF2 core, yet also demonstrate the core is partly redundant at least in our transactivation assay.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	194	 It remains possible that the redundancy observed in the mutations studied here results from a compensatory effect of the AF1 domain, which is known to transactivate (14) and is present in our full-length HNF4 constructs.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	195	Our initial C-terminal deletion experiments suggested the presence of a repressor activity within residues 380-455 (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	196	 2B, and previously proposed to lie between residues 371 and 455; 14).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	197	 By aligning the amino acid sequence of the PR repressor domain (19) with the entire HNF4 sequence, a short region (residues 430-441) showing 40% identity to a previously characterised repressor domain in PR was localised in HNF4 (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This presumptive repressor domain was first shown to confer repressor activity by itself (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Thus, when a short peptide from amino acid 428 to 441 containing the HNF4 repressor domain was fused in-frame downstream of a high activity C-terminal deletion fusion construct, transactivation was severely inhibited, decreasing from >300 to 22%.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	200	 This is unlikely to be the result of decreased protein expression of this particular fusion construct, since a gel shift analysis of a panel of deletion constructs all showed reasonably similar levels of protein expression (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	201	 3) This implied that the peptide containing amino acids 428-441 was sufficient, by itself, to act as a repressor.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Further evidence for this repressor domain came from a study of two constructs with multiple point mutations (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	203	It is interesting to note that in the experiment where the isolated repressor domain was fused to F 1-372 (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	204	 6B), the AF2 core was intact; hence an activity closer to the that of the full-length fusion (100%) might have been expected, whereas an activity of 22% was observed (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	205	 This suggests the repressor domain had a more potent inhibitory effect when fused closer to the AF2 core, than if it were in its normal location.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Perhaps the close proximity of the repressor domain to the AF2 core may restrict the accessibility of potential coactivator proteins to the AF2 core, either by binding a corepressor protein or simply by masking critical residues in the AF2 core.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	207	 In the case of the PR repressor domain, the repressor domain was shown to mediate its function through an unknown corepressor (19).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Experiments in an attempt to determine if the HNF4 repressor domain functioned through a corepressor were unfortunately inconclusive (data not shown).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	209	It is obviously interesting to know how the repressor domain in HNF4 functions and if it is required to regulate the activity of HNF4 in vivo.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	210	 An attractive, but speculative mechanism might involve the phosphorylation of threonine residues in the sequence ITTI (residues 434-437).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	211	 A corepressor might bind to the repressor domain in the phosphorylated state and dissociate in the dephosphorylated state.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Thus mutations which disrupt these threonine residues would prevent phosphorylation, thus preventing repression and thereby enhancing the activity of HNF4.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	213	In summary, our characterisation of the AF2 domain in the C-terminal region of HNF4 has given new insights into the function of residues 363 and 366.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	214	 By extensive mutagenesis we have shown that L366 is essential for full AF2 activity.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	215	 An E363A/L366A double mutant suggested that E363 and L366 may act cooperatively to regulate the activity of the AF2 domain.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	216	 We have also shown that the activity of the AF2 domain is regulated by a repressor domain located within a proline-rich region.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	217	 We have localised this repressor domain to within amino acid residues 428-441 of HNF4, and showed it was necessary and sufficient for repressor activity in transient transfection studies in HeLa cells.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Furthermore, multiple point mutations within this repressor domain in the context of the full-length HNF4 fusion construct abolished repressor activity.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The repressor domain shares homology with a recently reported C-terminal repressor domain in the progesterone receptor (19).

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	5	As suggested by various studies, directional migration can be achieved by short-range guidance cues and by long-range diffusible gradients (Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996).
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Contact guidance relies on a permissive environment, on which gradients of diffusible guidance molecules can be superimposed, to achieve directional migration.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, the distribution and molecular nature of short- and long-range molecules, and the substratum that interneurons use in their migration towards the cortex, are poorly understood.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Motogenic factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor and the neurotrophin molecules BDNF and NT4, have been shown to influence the numbers of cells migrating away from the subpallium (Polleux et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Guidance molecules with repulsive and attractive activities are likely to be involved in guiding migrating cells from the subpallium to the pallium, and within the subpallium (Marin et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	10	 For the substratum, one report has shown that blocking the function of the TAG1 adhesion molecule results in a marked reduction in GABAergic neurons in the cortex (Denaxa et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	11	 However, in Tag1 mutant mice, there is no major alteration in the tangential migration of interneurons (Marin and Rubenstein, 2003), and treatment of cortical slices with phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), an enzyme that cleaves GPI-anchored proteins, such as TAG1, does not alter interneuron migration (Tanaka et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Therefore, nothing is known about the nature of short-range guidance contact cues involved in tangential migration.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	13	The nuclear orphan receptor COUP-TFI favours migration of neurons through an integrin-dependent mechanism in cell cultures (Adam et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Overexpression of COUP-TFI in retinoic-acid-treated neuronal aggregates coated with different cell substrata, such as polylysine, laminin or fibronectin, results in a higher rate of migration compared with controls, whereas overexpression of a mutated form of COUP-TFI has no effects on cell migration.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Moreover, increased levels of vitronectin, an extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule involved in neurite extension, motor neuron differentiation and possibly neuronal migration, are detected both in aggregate and monolayer cell cultures after overexpression of COUP-TFI.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This, and the data that show that COUP-TFI stimulates transcription from the vitronectin promoter in vitro, strongly suggests a role of COUP-TFI in the regulation of ECM synthesis during the process of neuronal migration.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Although COUP-TFI has been shown to be involved in cortical regionalization and axon pathfinding in the developing telencephalon (Zhou et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	18	, 2001), its role in promoting cell migration in vivo has not been established so far.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	19	Here, we show that COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII are expressed in migrating cells in specific pathways in the basal telencephalon of mouse embryos at a stage when interneuron migration is robust.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Moreover, expression of COUP-TFI in the cortex co-localizes with the GABAergic marker calbindin, suggesting that a subpopulation of COUP-TFI-positive cells in the cortex are GABAergic interneurons.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	21	 With the help of transplantation and tracing techniques in organotypic slice cultures, we first show the presence of a dorsal-to-ventral migratory pathway that originates in the region of the interganglionic sulcus.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	22	 We then demonstrate that COUP-TFI is expressed in the basal telencephalon in neurons not only migrating dorsally towards the cortex, but also ventrally towards the pre-optic area (POa) and the hypothalamus.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Finally, by ectopic expression of COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII in the GEs, we show an increased rate of migrating cells.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	24	 While COUP-TFI appears to control dorsal and ventral migration in the basal telencephalon, COUP-TFII is more specific in modulating tangential migration into the intermediate zone of the cortex, suggesting distinct functions of COUP-TFs in regulating cell migration in the developing forebrain.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	25	Slice culture experiments Organotypic slice cultures of embryonic mouse telencephalon were prepared as previously described (Anderson et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Brain slices 250  microm thick were used for the grafting experiments (see below), for tracing with the fluorescent carbocyanide dye 1,1'-dioctadecyl 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI; Molecular Probes), and for electroporation and lipofectamine injections (see below).
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	27	Grafting experiments For the grafting experiments, the MGE, the LGE, or the region at the MGE/LGE border (MLGE) were removed from the donor brain slices derived from a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing transgenic embryo (Hadjantonakis et al.

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The chimaeric slices were examined 1 hour after the transplant under a stereoscope with a GFP filter, to confirm that the transplants were successfully and correctly integrated into the host; slices where the grafts did not integrate, or integrated in an incorrect location, were not used for this study.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The medium was changed every day, and after about 60 hours the slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	36	 We injected the constructs into the desired region of the brain slices, under microscopic guidance with a micro-syringe (Hamilton, Reno, Nevada, USA) held by a micromanipulator system using a 33-gauge blunt-ended needle (Hamilton).
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The slices were then cultured for 60 hours, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and either observed by confocal microscopy (Leica DMIRE2) or embedded in OCT for further sectioning in a cryostat.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	38	Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence The brains were sectioned and treated for immunostaining according to standard procedures.

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	46	Cell counting In the grafting experiments, the cells were counted on images obtained from 6  microm sections of the slices that were acquired with a CCD camera attached to a conventional microscope.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	47	 To count the cells, a standardized box (a 40x enlargement of the slice) was used; for each transplant, three sections were evaluated, and for each section, the cells in two different regions were counted.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	48	 In the gain-of-function experiments, an image of the whole slice was obtained by confocal microscopy, after reconstruction of all of the confocal planes.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The GFP-positive cells that migrated towards the cortex or towards the POa were counted on this reconstructed image, and normalized for the total number of GFP-positive cells [e.

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	54	 At this stage, COUP-TFI expression was localized to all layers of the neocortex, to the piriform cortex, to the ventricular and subventricular zones of the LGE, to the ventricular zone of the MGE, to the POa, and in scattered cells in various regions of the basal telencephalon (Fig.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	55	 By contrast, COUP-TFII expression was mainly restricted to the marginal zone of the neocortex and to the piriform cortex and POa of the basal telencephalon.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Scattered COUP-TFII-positive cells were also identified in the LGE, at the cortico-striatal boundary, and in the intermediate zone of the neocortex (arrowheads in Fig.

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	230	In this report, we have identified a novel migratory path, which to our knowledge has never been reported before.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Using grafting experiments, DNA electroporation and tracer injections, we have shown that cells located in the interganglionic region, where the MGE and LGE fuse together, have the capability of migrating ventrally towards the pre-optic and hypothalamic regions of the diencephalon (Figs 3, 4, 5).
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	232	 As this path originates from the interganglionic region at specific caudal levels, it is very likely that it has been missed in other studies using similar approaches (Anderson et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The novelty of this path is twofold: first, cells migrate tangentially from dorsal to ventral, along the subventricular zone of the MGE, i.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	234	 in opposite directions with respect to the MGE-derived cortical interneurons; and second, these cells exit the basal telencephalon and migrate into the basal diencephalon.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	235	 These cells are different from the gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons, which originate in the olfactory placode and migrate along the vomeronasal nerve fibres until they reach the POa and hypothalamus (Wray et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Migration of GABAergic neurons from the GEs to the dorsal thalamus has been observed in human brains; however, rodent embryos did not reveal a similar migratory pathway (Letinic and Rakic, 2001).
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	237	 With the help of retroviral cell tracing, Marin and collaborators (Marin et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	238	, 2000) have shown that cells emanating from the MGE and the adjacent POa/anterior entopeduncular area express the transcription factor Nkx2.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	239	1 and migrate to the developing striatum, where they differentiate into local circuit neurons.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	240	 It would be interesting to find out whether Nkx2.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	241	1 is also involved in the opposite migratory path described in this report.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	242	Furthermore, we have shown that cells originating from the CGE migrate via different streams into the basal diencephalon, and in particular into the hypothalamus (Fig.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	243	 As opposed to the MLGE transplant, in which the stream of ventrally migrating cells is quite compact, cells migrating out of the CGE take a medial and latero-ventral route.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	244	 We do not know the fate of these ventrally migrating cells.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	245	 In-vivo ultrasound-guided labelling or transplantation (Nery et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	246	, 2001), in which total cortices are manipulated in toto and characterized at later stages, would help us to understand the final destinies of these migrating cells.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	247	Is the basal telencephalon only chemorepulsive? Transplantation experiments and co-culture assays have shown that the POa and hypothalamic regions prevent interneurons from migrating in a ventral direction by secreting repulsive molecules that are responsible for the dorsal migration of interneurons towards the cortex (Marin et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	248	 However, the cues mediating this action have not been identified yet.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Here, we show that cells originating from more dorsal and caudal regions are capable of migrating ventrally towards the POa/anterior hypothalamus.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	250	 How do we reconcile these different results? First, the previous studies showed that the majority of interneurons that originated from the MGE avoided migrating in ventral directions.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	251	 This is what is expected for a circumscribed graft in a section where the two GEs are well separated (Marin et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	252	 However, the dorsal-to-ventral cell migration that we describe in this report originates from a restricted region, the interganglionic sulcus, at more caudal levels.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	253	 It is plausible that in order to follow the migration that originates in the MGE and LGE, this region was not included in other studies.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Therefore, we hypothesize that cells originating from different rostrocaudal levels can have different responses to the same environment by expressing position-dependent receptors.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Accordingly, COUP-TFs are not expressed in ventrally migrating cells at more rostral levels, where the two GEs are well separated (data not shown).
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Thus, the POa and hypothalamus can have different roles, repulsion versus attraction, according to the type of cells they encounter.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	257	A novel role for COUP-TFs in neuronal migration in the developing forebrain COUP-TFs are orphan nuclear receptors of the steroid/thyroid superfamily shown to be involved in neurogenesis, axogenesis and neural differentiation (Park et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	258	 In the cortex, COUP-TFI is mainly known for its role in regionalization and in guidance of thalamocortical projections (Zhou et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	259	, 2001), whereas COUP-TFII is a fundamental player in angiogenesis and heart development (Pereira et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	260	 In this report, we have provided the first insights into the functional roles of COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII in neuronal migration in vivo.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	261	 In a previous report, it was shown that COUP-TFI could regulate cell adhesion mechanisms required for the differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells (Adam et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Because of the substrates on which cells were plated, it was suggested that COUP-TFI could modify the synthesis of ECM molecules, making cells autonomous for migration and spreading.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Our expression data in vivo and our functional data in organotypic cultures support these results in a context in which cell migration assumes a fundamental role in achieving neuronal diversity.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	264	 By using these different approaches, we have first shown expression of COUP-TFs in highly motile neurons, such as GABAergic and reelin-positive cells (Fig.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	265	 2); we have then confirmed the co-localization of COUP-TFI in migrating neurons in a series of grafting experiments (Figs 3, 4, 5); and finally, we have directly demonstrated a role of COUP-TFs in modulating cell migration in a gain-of-function approach (Figs 6, 7).
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Our data also demonstrate that COUP-TFs can control directional migration.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Indeed, cells expressing higher levels of COUP-TFs (and thus GFP) not only tend to spread and lose their aspect of aggregates, but also follow specific migratory pathways (dorsal and/or ventral) that are intrinsic to cells expressing COUP-TFs (Fig.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	268	Therefore, we hypothesize a dual role for COUP-TFs.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	269	 First, they should regulate short-range cues, such as ECM and/or adhesive molecules, and in this way modulate the neighbouring environment.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Changes in a permissive environment would allow random dispersion of migratory cells.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Indeed, in the absence of COUP-TFI, GABAergic cells do migrate into the cortex, although in a less organised fashion than in the normal situation (M.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Therefore, we favour the hypothesis that COUP-TFI is involved in modulating cell migration, more than inducing cells to initiate migration.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	273	Second, we propose that COUP-TFs control diffusible guidance molecules, and/or their receptors, involved in cell migration.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Indeed, ectopic expression of COUP-TFI led to the correct directional migration of the targeted cells, i.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	275	 dorsal into the cortex and ventral into the POa (Fig.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	276	 6D), suggesting that cells over- or mis-expressing COUP-TFI were able to respond to COUP-TFI-dependent guidance cues.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	277	 More striking is the behaviour of MGE-migrating cells after mis-expression of COUP-TFII.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	278	 In this case, neurons that were committed to migrate into the marginal and intermediate layers of the neocortex (see control in Fig.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	279	 7C) migrated at higher rates solely into the intermediate layer, avoiding specifically the marginal layer (Fig.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	280	 7D), suggesting that COUP-TFII regulates guidance cues required for migration into the intermediate zone of the neocortex.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	281	 This behaviour is in accordance with the COUP-TFII expression pattern and the grafting experiments described in this study.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Indeed, COUP-TFII-positive cells in the marginal zone are Cajal-Retzius cells, as seen by the co-expression with reelin, and it is now well established that Cajal-Retzius cells originate exclusively from the pallium (Hevner et al.

0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	3	The trans-acting factors that regulate CYP11B2 expression remain poorly defined.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1),1 is shown to play a crucial regulator of most steroid hydroxylase genes, including CYP17 and CYP11B1 (5, 6).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	5	 However, SF-1 actually represses rather than activates expression of hCYP11B2 (7 to 9).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In addition, other transcription factors that are expressed in the adrenal cortex include the NGFI-B family of orphan nuclear receptors, such as Nurr1, NGFI-B, and NOR-1.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The NGFI-B family receptors are highly expressed in the adrenal zona glomerulosa cells as well as in aldosterone-producing adenomas (8, 10, 11).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These three nuclear receptors are rapidly induced early response genes that enhance transcription by binding to a consensus sequence, named NBRE-1, as well as an Ad5 element of the hCYP11B2 promoter.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In addition, CREB and ATF-1 enhance transcription of the hCYP11B2 gene by binding to a CRE (9, 12, 13).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Our previous data (12) showed that human adrenocortical H295R nuclear proteins containing chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs) were bound to the  to 129/ to 114 sequence, designated as the Ad5 element of the hCYP11B2 promoter by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The COUP-TFI was originally identified as an activator of the chicken ovalbumin gene (14, 15); however, COUP-TFs mostly function as transcriptional repressor of many target genes.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	12	 COUP-TFs inhibit the transcription of other nuclear receptor such as retinoic acid receptor and thyroid hormone receptor (14).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Furthermore, COUP-TFI represses basal transcriptional activity by active repression utilizing transcriptional corepressors, such as N-CoR and SMRT (16).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	14	 We and other investigators have previously demonstrated that COUP-TFI and SF-1 regulate the bovine CYP17 expression in a mutually exclusive manner (17, 18).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	15	 We have previously reported that COUP-TFI is expressed in the normal adrenal cortex and that expression levels of COUP-TFI is inversely correlated with those of CYP17, but correlated with those of N-CoR in adrenal cortical adenomas (18 to 23).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	16	We, therefore, have screened COUP-TFI-interacting proteins from a human adrenocortical adenoma cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system and identified Ubc9 (24) and PIAS1, which are small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1)-conjugating enzyme and SUMO-1 ligase, respectively.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The SUMO post-translationally modifies many proteins with roles in diverse processes, including regulation of transcription, chromatin structure, and DNA repair (25 to 30).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The SUMO modification has not been generally associated with increased protein degradation.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Rather, similar to non-proteolytic roles of ubiquitin, SUMO modification regulates protein localization and activity.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The SUMO E1-activating, E2-conjugating enzymes, and E3-ligase are involved in the sumoylation machinery.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In contrast to the ubiquitin system where dozens of E2 enzymes have been identified, Ubc9 is the only known SUMO-E2-conjugating enzyme.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Several SUMO-E3 ligases have been identified that promote transfer of SUMO from E2 to specific substrates.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	23	 To date, three unrelated proteins have been suggested to have SUMO-E3 ligase activity; the protein inhibitors of activated STAT1 (PIAS1) proteins (31 to 33), RanBP2 (34, 35), and polycomb group protein Pc2 (36).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The present study described that both Ubc9 and PIAS1 can function as transcriptional coactivators of COUP-TFI for the hCYP11B2 gene transcription in a sumoylation-independent manner.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	25	 These proteins are shown to form a complex in the nucleus and exhibit a very unique localization in the adrenal zona glomerulosa cells.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We demonstrated here that COUP-TFI, Ubc9, and PIAS1 are recruited to an endogenous CYP11B2 promoter, thus contributing to aldosterone biosynthesis in adrenal zona glomerulosa cells.

0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	289	 However, Ubc9 or PIAS1 potentiated the transactivation mediated by COUP-TFI.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Subsequently, coexpression of the Ubc9 or PIAS1 deletion mutant, Ubc9-(1 to 58) or PIAS1-(1 to 150), which impairs COUP-TFI binding, did not affect the transactivation mediated by COUP-TFI, indicating that interaction of COUP-TFI with Ubc9 or PIAS1 is required for COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	291	 In addition, coexpression of Ubc9 and PIAS1 synergistically enhanced the COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Third, reduction of endogenous Ubc9 or PIAS1 by small interfering RNA decreased COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation of the human CYP11B2 promoter activity, indicating that endogenous Ubc9 and PIAS1 normally contributes to COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Fourth, ChIP assays clearly showed that COUP-TFI, Ubc9, and PIAS1 were recruited to a native COUP-TFI-regulated CYP11B2 promoter, demonstrating a functional coupling between COUP-TFI and Ubc9-PIAS1 in vivo.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Therefore, Ubc9 and PIAS1 possess all the characteristics expected for transcriptional coactivator proteins of COUP-TF in vivo.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	295	To confirm further that Ubc9 and PIAS1 are coactivators of COUP-TFI, we ruled out several other possible ways in which these proteins might enhance COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	296	 First, as SUMO-1 conjugation plays an important role in protein modification, the effects of Ubc9 and PIAS1 on COUP-TFI transactivation might be the result of effects of Ubc9 and PIAS1 on COUP-TFI protein concentrations.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Our preliminary experiments showed that overexpression of Ubc9 or PIAS1 did not alter COUP-TFI protein concentration in H295R cells (data not shown).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Second, it was also possible that overexpression of Ubc9 or PIAS1 increases the concentrations of some coactivators or decreases the concentrations of some corepressors, which have been shown to interact with COUP-TFI, but the results showed that overexpression of these proteins did not alter the protein concentrations of SRC-1, GRIP-1, or SMRT in the cells (data not shown).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Because these experiments were performed by transient transfection, we are not able to conclude unequivocally that Ubc9 and PIAS1 have no effects on these coregulator concentrations, and further investigation is required.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Third, another possibility is that overexpression of Ubc9 or PIAS1 increased the DNA-binding affinity of COUP-TFI.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	301	 To exclude the possibility, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays to determine whether bacterially or in vitro transcription-translated Ubc9 or PIAS1 proteins affect the binding of COUP-TFI to its response element DNA (Ad5) of the human CYP11B2 promoter region.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	302	 The results showed that Ubc9 or PIAS1 have no effects on COUP-TFI binding to the Ad5 element (data not shown).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Fourth, it has been proposed that SUMO-1 conjugation targets proteins to different cellular localizations.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	304	 SF-1 can be directed into nuclear speckles and sequestered from the nucleolus in the presence of SUMO-1, thus resulting in transcriptional repression (39).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	305	 It is therefore possible that coexpression of Ubc9 and PIAS1 alters subcellular localization of COUP-TFI.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	306	 However, based on the subcellular localization data (Fig.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	307	 3), localization of COUP-TFI continues to be in the nucleus without re-localization.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Taken together with the above-mentioned findings, Ubc9 and PIAS1 clearly function as novel coactivators of COUP-TFI in vivo.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	309	 However, detailed molecular mechanisms are largely unknown and further investigation is required.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	310	Role of Ubc9 and PIAS1 in Sumoylation SUMO-1 conjugation (sumoylation) has been reported to play an important role in many cellular processes (25 to 30).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Sumoylation resembles ubiquitination, but the enzymes involved in these three processes are distinct.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	312	 SUMO-1 is conjugated to target proteins at the consensus sequence KXE ( is any hydrophobic amino acid, and X is any amino acid).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	313	 COUP-TFI has no such SUMO consensus sequence; however, several proteins, such as Mdm2 and CREB, are also modified at sites other than KXE (26).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Further investigation is required to elucidate whether COUP-TFI is sumoylated in vivo.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	315	Our data showed that both wild type and sumoylation-defective mutants Ubc9 (C93S) and PIAS1 (C351S) similarly enhanced COUP-TFI-regulated CYP11B2 promoter activities, indicating that these proteins possess dual distinct functions, SUMO-dependent and SUMO-independent pathways, such as coactivator function.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	316	 However, it is possible that ectopically produced Ubc9 and PIAS1 regulate COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation through not only sumoylation of COUP-TFI but also conjugation of SUMO-1 to one or more other cellular factors involved in transcriptional regulation.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Recent data have raised the intriguing possibility that SUMO modification may have a specific impact on the ability of some transcription factors to function synergistically (27, 40, 41).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Previous studies of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) had identified a region referred to as a synergy control motif, mutation of which led to a selective increase in the activity of the GR from promoters bearing multiple, but not single sites.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	319	 The synergy control motif contains a consensus SUMO acceptor site, and recent data have shown that this is, in fact, the major site of addition of SUMO in the GR.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Considerable numbers of transcription factors, including GR (41 to 44), androgen receptor (32, 33, 45 to 51), progesterone receptor (47, 52), mineralocorticoid receptor (53, 54), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (55), and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) (39, 56), are modulated by SUMO-1 attachment, and SUMO-modified transcription factors mostly resulted in attenuation of transcription.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Recent studies demonstrated that one of the molecular mechanisms of sumoylation-mediated repression is protein modified by SUMO-1 recruited histone deacetylases and transcriptional corepressors, thus repressing transcription (29, 38, 57 to 59).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	322	 However, there are also opposite examples of SUMO-modified proteins, which lead to transcriptional activation rather than repression.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Transcriptional coactivators, such as SRC-1 and GRIP1, are shown to be modified by SUMO-1, thus resulting in enhanced transcriptional coactivator capacities (60, 61).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Therefore, sumoylation does not necessarily induce transcriptional repression depending on the substrates.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	325	 The molecular mechanisms that could explain how SUMO modification affects transcriptional regulation are largely unknown.

0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	338	 They also showed that Ang II treatment dramatically decreased levels of COUP-TF in the cells, thus activating StAR gene expression.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	339	 Based on these findings, it is tempting to speculate that levels of expression of COUP-TFI, Ubc9, or PIAS1 are regulated by Ang II treatment.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	340	 We therefore investigated these possibilities in H295R cells; however, Ang II treatment did not affect expression levels of COUP-TFI, Ubc9, or PIAS1 in real-time reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis (data not shown).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	341	 The reason why Ang II treatment showed different effects on COUP-TFI levels between other report and ours is not known; however, different cellular context, such as bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa cells and human H295R cells, may be one reason for that.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	342	 We do not know a physiological role of COUP-TFI and Ubc9-PIAS1 in Ang II and K+ regulation of hCYP11B2 expression in this study, and this should be investigated.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	343	In conclusion, we identified novel COUP-TFI-interacting proteins, Ubc9 and PIAS1, and these proteins function as coactivators of COUP-TFI for human CYP11B2 transactivation.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	344	 The unique localization profiles of these proteins in adrenal zona glomerulosa cells are consistent with a crucial physiological role in aldosterone biosynthesis.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	345	 Therefore, the COUP-TFI-Ubc9-PIAS1 complexes shed new light in controlling the long term capacity of the adrenal gland to produce aldosterone.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	346	 In addition, these studies provide new mechanisms through which COUP-TFI can act as a transcriptional activator through the novel interaction with Ubc9 and PIAS1.

0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The inducibility of this gene by interleukin-6 (IL-6) in rat liver (16) and by PRL in rat luteal cells (11) has provided a unique opportunity to delineate the cellular signaling mechanisms used by each cytokine to control the tissue-specific expression of this gene.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In previous analyses, we have shown that Stat 5 is activated by PRL and binds to specific -activating sequences (GAS) sites present in the promoter of the 2M gene and originally referred to as the IL-6 response element (IL6-RE) based on the activation of this gene by IL-6 in rat liver (16).

0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	10	As a result of additional analyses of the 2M promoter, we observed that when a 109-bp region directly 3' of the Stat 5-binding sites was deleted, the 2M promoter-reporter construct lost both its high basal activity and PRL-regulated induction.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	11	 When the sequence of this region was examined, we noted that it contained putative binding sites for SF-1 and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Like SF-1, COUP-TF is a member of the orphan nuclear receptor superfamily (17, 18).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, unlike SF-1, it is presumed to be expressed ubiquitously and has been shown to exhibit complex interactions by binding, as a heterodimer, other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (19).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	14	 COUP-TF homodimers bind to a wide spectrum of response elements containing, as a core half-site, the A/GGGTCA motif, the spacing and orientation of which determine the relative binding affinity of COUP-TF (19).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Recent evidence indicates that Stat proteins may interact functionally with other transcription factors and coregulatory molecules, including members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (20, 21, 22, 23, 24).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Based on the close juxtaposition and functional activities of the PRL response element (PRLRE) and the putative orphan receptor-binding sites, it seemed reasonable to predict that factors binding to these regions might interact to control maximal expression of the 2M gene in granulosa-luteal cells.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	17	Based on these considerations and the tissue- specific expression of this gene in the rat ovary, the following studies were undertaken to determine which Stat 5 proteins were present and functional in differentiated granulosa cells, if either SF-1 or COUP-TF bound to the intact 2M promoter, and if either SF-1 or COUP-TF interacted functionally with Stat 5 proteins to confer maximal expression of this gene in response to PRL.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The functional activities of the Stat-binding sites and the orphan receptor-binding sites were analyzed by generating site-specific mutations in the context of the intact promoter and transfecting differentiated granulosa cells with specific intact and mutant promoter-luciferase reporter constructs.

0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Because activated (phosphorylated) Stat proteins bind DNA whereas the nonphosphorylated Stats do not, the activated factors are readily detected in EMSAs.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Accordingly, whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared from differentiated granulosa cells before or 15 min after PRL treatment, incubated with labeled 2M GAS2 probe, and resolved by electrophoresis.

0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	71	 These data show that PRL rapidly stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat 5b in granulosa-luteal cells but that, even in the presence of continuous exposure to PRL, the amount of phospho-Stat 5b decreases progressively with time, coincident with reduced DNA-binding activity (data not shown and Ref.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	72	Stat 5b Is a Key Regulator of 2M Gene Expression in the Ovary Having established that Stat 5b, rather than Stat 5a, is the major Stat 5 protein activated in these granulosa-luteal cells and knowing that Stat 3 fails to bind the 2M PRLRE (10, 11), we sought to determine whether disruption of Stat 5b binding to the promoter would abolish promoter activity.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	73	 For this we cotransfected into differentiated granulosa cells vectors expressing either wild-type Stat 5b or a truncated, splice variant form of Stat 5b (Stat 5b-40C) that has been shown to act in a dominant negative fashion to suppress Stat 5b function in other cells (25, 26).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	74	 A reporter construct containing four copies of the proximal Stat-binding site ligated to the minimal 2M promoter-luciferase gene (4XGAS 2M) was chosen as the reporter construct since in previous studies (10, 16) it has been shown to exhibit a greater response to PRL treatment than the intact 2M promoter.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	75	 When wild-type Stat 5b expression vectors were cotransfected with the 4XGAS 2M luciferase construct, the PRL-induced response was similar to cells cotransfected with the empty vector (Fig.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	76	 4), indicating that endogenous amounts of Stat 5b were already in excess.

0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	78	 These data indicate that PRL induction of 2M in differentiated granulosa cells is dependent on activation of Stat 5b and that the truncated splice-variant of Stat 5b can act as a dominant negative factor in granulosa cells as it does in other cells (25, 26).

0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	165	 When both the SF-1 and the COUP-TF sites (mSF-mCOUPTF) were mutated, basal and PRL-stimulated luciferase activities were similar to that of the intact promoter-reporter construct.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Collectively, these data document that within the ORRE of the 2M promoter, SF-1 acts as a positive regulator whereas COUP-TF acts as a repressor of transcriptional activation.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Combined with the data from the EMSAs, these results indicate that although mutation of the SF-1 site decreases the affinity of COUP-TF binding to the 2M promoter, COUP-TF binds this region (albeit with reduced affinity) and retains potent repressor activity.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Thus, both of these nuclear receptors appear to control the basal activity of the 2M promoter in granulosa-luteal cells but do not markedly alter the response to PRL.

0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Specifically, FSH has been shown to regulate the expression of numerous genes in granulosa cells that contain SF-1 binding sites.

0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	229	 These data indicate that the ability of PRL to induce 2M in these differentiated cells is related, in part, to the induction-maintenance of PRLR in these cells.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	230	 However, since PRL does not induce 2M in immature cells that also express the long form of the PRLR, additional factors regulating either the PRL-signaling cascade or the A-kinase system must be regulated by FSH/T as the granulosa cells differentiate.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	231	Based on the opposing actions of SF-1 and COUP-TF in regulating the basal activity (Fig.

0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	233	 EMSAs were performed using labeled ORRE and extracts prepared from either immature/undifferentiated granulosa cells (in which 2M is not induced) or from FSH/T- treated/differentiated granulosa cell extracts (Fig.

0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	246	When the studies described herein were originally initiated, we had shown that Stat 5a was expressed in rat granulosa cells, activated by PRL, and bound to the PRLRE of the 2M promoter.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	247	 We have extended these observations by showing that both Stat-binding sites are critical for PRL-induced activity of the 2M promoter.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Neither site alone in the context of the intact promoter exhibits significant functional activity.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	249	 These results indicate that the two sites may interact to stabilize or increase the binding of coregulatory molecules that interact with the transcriptional machinery.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	250	 As new information about the complexity of the Stat 5 family of transcription factors was reported (34, 35), reagents to these new family members allowed us to extend our initial observations.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Using antibodies specific for Stat 5b, we show that not only is it present in the rat granulosa cells, it is expressed at higher levels than Stat 5a, is activated by PRL, and binds to the PRLRE of the 2M gene.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	252	 These results obtained in granulosa-luteal cells in culture support those observed in luteal cells in vivo (10, 11).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Antibodies to Stat 5b have allowed us to document that in differentiated granulosa cells Stat 5b is tyrosine phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in response to PRL.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	254	 In addition, truncated, splice-variant forms of Stat proteins have been cloned.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	255	 For the Stats in which truncated forms have been identified, Stat 1 (36, 37) Stat 3 (38), and Stat 5 (25, 26), the mutants lacking the transactivation domain have been shown to exert dominant-negative functions in transcription assays (25, 26, 36, 37, 38).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	256	 When we coexpressed the truncated Stat 5b variant with the 2M promoter-luciferase reporter construct, PRL-induced activity was markedly impaired, supporting the hypothesis that Stat 5 is the major PRL-regulated activator of 2M promoter activity in the differentiated granulosa cells.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Taken together, our results provide evidence that PRL-mediated signaling events that transactivate the 2M gene in the granulosa-luteal cells occur by mechanisms similar to those that regulate cytokine signal transduction of target gene activity in other tissues, such as mammary gland (13, 39, 40) and liver (35, 41).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	258	 That Stat 5, especially Stat 5b, plays a major role in transducing PRL action in ovarian cells has been supported recently by the generation of mutant mice.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Although female mice null for Stat 5a do not exhibit an overt ovarian phenotype (42), mice null for Stat 5b alone (43) are infertile and exhibit abnormal ovarian functions.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Based on the luteal cell-specific expression of 2M in vivo as well as its regulation by PRL and Stat 5b in cultured cells, we predict that corpora lutea of the infertile mice either fail to express 2M or express it at a markedly reduced level.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	261	Our results have also provided new evidence to indicate that other regions, in addition to the PRLRE, regulate the expression of 2M in granulosa-luteal cells.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	262	 The region directly 3' of the PRLRE binds both SF-1 and COUP-TF and has been designated herein as the ORRE of the 2M promoter.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	263	 When this region of the 2M promoter was deleted, leaving the PRLRE intact, transgene activity was reduced to baseline and PRL inducibility was abolished.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Based on these initial observations, we predicted that Stat 5 binding to the PRLRE interacted synergistically with the orphan receptors binding to the 3'- regulatory region to confer maximal promoter activity.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	265	 This initial hypothesis was supported by observations of others who have shown that Stats synergistically interact with a variety of other transcription factors and coregulatory molecules.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	266	 In mammary epithelial cells, Stat 5 interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor for activation of the ss-casein gene by PRL (23, 44).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	267	 In liver cells, Stat 3 synergizes (interacts) with glucocorticoid receptor for activation of the 2M gene by IL-6 (24).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Stat 1 and Sp1 interact to activate ICAM-I promoter in human tracheobronchial epithelial cells (21).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	269	 In addition, Stat 2 has been shown to bind CBP/p300 and enhance gene activation by interferon- (20).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	270	 When site-specific mutations were generated in either the Stat 5, SF-1, or COUP-TF binding sites within the context of the intact 2M promoter, a different set of functional interactions was observed.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	271	Mutation of either one or both Stat 5-binding sites markedly reduced PRL inducibility.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	272	 As mentioned above, these results indicate that the functional activity of the PRLRE is dependent on the binding of Stat 5 to each site and that these two sites interact to confer maximal PRL inducibility.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	273	 However, mutation of the Stat sites did not alter the high basal activity observed with the intact 2M promoter-reporter constructs compared with the -48 2M minimal promoter construct.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Contrary to our initial hypothesis, these results indicated that the Stat sites acted independently of the factors binding to the ORRE.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	275	 However, when site-specific mutations of the SF-1 site or the two COUP-TF binding sites were generated, marked changes in the basal activities of the mutant constructs were observed.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	276	 The mutant SF-1 construct that failed to bind SF-1 exhibited markedly reduced basal activity, whereas the COUP-TF mutant construct that failed to bind COUP-TF, but did bind SF-1, exhibited elevated basal activity.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	277	 These results indicated that SF-1 is a transcriptional activator and enhances 2M promoter activity, whereas COUP-TF acted as a corepressor to antagonize the activity of SF-1 and thereby reduce the functional activity of the intact 2M promoter.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Thus, the 2M gene can be added to a growing list of genes that are regulated by SF-1 in ovarian cells and highlights the importance of SF-1 in many diverse functions within the gonads and adrenals as suggested by the phenotype of mice null for SF-1 (1).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Furthermore, these observations provide the first evidence that COUP-TF is present and functional in ovarian granulosa cells and can regulate the expression of an ovarian gene.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Although the actions of COUP-TF are complex and have been shown to be both stimulatory and inhibitory (17), our data indicate that COUP-TF acts as a corepressor of SF-1 action in the intact promoter of the 2M gene.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	281	 This observation supports results obtained by one other study in which the effects of SF-1 were blunted by COUP-TF (5).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	282	Although the mechanism by which COUP-TF blocks the actions of SF-1 on the 2M promoter have not been entirely defined, our data show an interesting juxtaposition and interaction of SF-1- and COUP-TF-binding sites.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Of note, mutation of the SF-1 site reduced by 10-fold the binding affinity of COUP-TF for the DR1 and DR2 regions of the 2M promoter.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	284	 From this, we conclude that the binding of COUP-TF to DR1 and DR2 overlaps the SF-1 site or adjacent sites.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	285	 However, despite the dramatic reduction in the binding affinity of COUP-TF to the SF-1 mutant region, COUP-TF retained potent repressor activity as revealed by the markedly reduced basal activity of the SF-1 mutant construct.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	286	 These interactions of SF-1 and COUP-TF indicate that any change in the relative levels or activity of these factors could markedly alter the basal activity of the 2M gene and thus its expression.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	287	Both PRLRE and ORRE are dependent on the differentiation of granulosa cells.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	288	 In the case of the PRLRE, granulosa cell differentiation is obligatory, in part, because of the increased expression of PRLRs on the cell surface.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Increased PRLR number enhances the activation of Stat 5b, which is constituitively expressed in the same amount in immature as well as differentiated granulosa cells.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	290	 In the case of the ORRE, the molecular basis for the enhanced activity of this region in differentiated cells, as opposed to immature cells, remains to be determined but likely involves altered functional activity and complex interactions of SF-1 or COUP-TF on the ORRE.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	291	 As shown herein, the amounts and relative ratios of these two factors binding to the 2M ORRE are different in immature and differentiated granulosa cells.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	292	 There is a relative 6-fold increase in SF-1 binding in differentiated granulosa cells compared with the immature granulosa cells.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Therefore, increased basal activity of the 2M promoter may depend on the increased binding of this transcriptional activator.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	294	 In addition, functional changes are likely to involve the selective phosphorylation of either factor or a coregulatory molecule.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Phosphorylation of SF-1 would be predicted to increase activity of the ORRE, whereas phosphorylation of COUP-TF might decrease its repressor activity on the ORRE.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	296	 The phosphorylation of either factor might alter the recruitment of other coregulatory molecules.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Phosphorylation of SF-1 has been shown to occur in differentiated granulosa cells (45) and, therefore, may be a critical event in increasing both basal activity of 2M as well as increasing the expression of PRLR.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	298	 In combination, these two events promote enhanced transcription of 2M by PRL.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	299	 As mentioned above, most cells do not express SF-1 but do express COUP-TF.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Therefore, it is possible that in these cells the repressor activity of COUP-TF is unopposed by any other transcription factor, thereby reducing expression of the gene.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	301	In summary, we have shown that expression of the 2M gene in ovarian granulosa-luteal cells involves not only PRL-induced activation of Stat 5b/a but also the opposing interactions of SF-1 and COUP-TF on an ORRE.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	302	 The close juxtaposition of these regions initially indicated that there might be a functional synergism between the factors binding to the PRLRE and the ORRE.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	303	 However, using site-specific mutations, rather that deletion analyses, we have been able to show that these regions act independently of each other in the context of the intact 2M promoter.

0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	7	PPAR-mediated transcriptional regulation of target genes is tightly controlled by ligand activation.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Fatty acid (FA) derivatives and the hypolipidemic fibrates are natural and synthetic PPAR ligands, respectively (3).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	9	 PPAR mediates the action of fibrates on plasma lipid levels by regulating the transcription of genes controlling lipoprotein metabolism (4).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Moreover, PPAR is a pivotal modulator of intracellular lipid metabolism by regulating the gene expression of proteins involved in FA uptake, FA esterification, FA entry into the mitochondria, peroxisomal and mitochondrial FA catabolism, and ketone body synthesis (1).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In addition to intra- and extracellular lipid metabolism, glucose and energy homeostasis as well as body weight were also reported to be influenced by PPAR activators (5, 6).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Furthermore, PPAR is an important regulator of vascular inflammation.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	13	 PPAR inhibits the expression of various inducible factors implicated in the promotion of a local inflammatory response within the developing atherosclerotic plaque (2).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In addition, PPAR regulates the expression of lipoprotein receptors and cholesterol transporters involved in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway in macrophages (7, 8).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	15	 PPAR activators reduce plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in vivo (9, 10) and reduce the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in humans (11, 12, 13, 14).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	16	In addition to ligand activation, transcriptional control of PPAR target genes depends on its expression levels.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	17	 High levels of PPAR expression are observed in tissues with elevated FA catabolic rates, such as liver, heart, kidney, muscle, and the large intestine (15, 16, 17).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In rodents, PPAR is regulated by stress (18) and by different hormones, such as GH, glucocorticoids, insulin, and leptin (19, 20, 21, 22).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	19	 PPAR expression oscillates diurnally (18), is diminished with age (23), and is induced during brown adipocyte differentiation (24).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Furthermore, starvation increases PPAR expression levels in liver leading to changes in mRNA levels of PPAR target genes (25).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Low PPAR mRNA levels result in decreased PPAR activity in pancreatic islets of obese Zucker diabetic (fa/fa) rats (22), in rat cardiomyocytes during cardiac hypertrophy (26), in livers of male Syrian hamsters upon lipopolysaccharide administration (27), and in intestinal epithelial cells during hypoxia (28).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Moreover, PPAR expression levels correlate with human apo AI gene induction in response to fibrate treatment as demonstrated in human apo AI transgenic mice crossed with PPAR-deficient mice (29).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	23	However, to date, studies addressing the regulation of PPAR gene expression have been largely performed either in rodent cells or in animal models.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Although the regulation of PPAR expression in humans remains largely unknown, the observation that hepatic PPAR mRNA levels vary significantly among individuals (30, 31) suggests that PPAR is also regulated at the transcriptional level in humans.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Indeed, hPPAR mRNA levels are induced during monocyte differentiation into macrophages (32), and high glucose concentrations up-regulate PPAR gene expression in human macrophages from healthy control subjects as well as from type 2 diabetic patients (33).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	26	To understand the molecular mechanisms governing PPAR regulation, we decided to identify and functionally characterize the 5'-flanking region of the hPPAR gene.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In the present manuscript the transcription start site was determined, and the upstream 5'-flanking region of the hPPAR gene was identified and cloned and its transcriptional activity was examined.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	28	1 In the course of these studies the sequence of the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the hPPAR gene was completed and an alternatively spliced exon within the 5'-UTR of the gene was identified.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Finally, hPPAR promoter activity was shown to be regulated by the nuclear receptors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII), and PPAR itself.

0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Genomic sequence upstream of the previously reported exon 1a sequence (37) was obtained by primer walking the BAC clone containing the hPPAR gene.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Despite the overall low degree of homology shown by the PPAR 5'-UTRs among different species, a sequence of around 60 bp was found to be 88% homologous to a region close to the transcription start site in the mouse PPAR 5'-UTR (Fig.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	46	 This prompted us to examine whether the transcription start site in the human gene could also be upstream of this region.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Accordingly, a primer close to that sequence (primer IP18, Fig.

0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	53	 To confirm the results of the 5'-RACE experiments, ribonuclease (RNase) protection analysis was performed.

0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	190	Finally, to analyze whether hPPAR mRNA expression is regulated by PPAR agonists, primary hepatocytes isolated from human liver were cultured for 24 h in medium containing fenofibric acid.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	191	 hPPAR mRNA levels were markedly up-regulated upon treatment with fenofibric acid (Fig.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Taken together, these data show that PPAR positively autoregulates its expression.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	193	To study PPAR regulation in humans, we characterized the 5'-flanking region of the hPPAR gene and identified the hPPAR promoter.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The genomic organization of hPPAR was recently reported (34, 35).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	195	 The hPPAR gene contains at least eight exons in which exons 1 and 2, the 5'-end of exon 3, and the 3'-end of exon 8 are not translated (34, 35).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	196	 As an initial step in our study, the 5'-UTR of the hPPAR gene was further characterized, resulting in the completion of the 5'-end sequence of exon 1, renamed exon 1a, and in the identification of an alternatively spliced 5'-variant.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	197	 An alternatively spliced exon in the mouse PPAR 5'-UTR has been previously reported (36).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	198	 However, alignment of both mouse and human 5'-UTR sequences revealed no significant degree of homology between them despite the coding exons being very similar between species.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	199	The transcription start site of the hPPAR gene was mapped.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The proximal promoter of the hPPAR gene contains no typical TATA or CCAAT boxes and has a high GC content, including several consensus Sp1 sites, features that are also present in the mouse PPAR promoter (36).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Excluding the proximal GC-rich region, both promoters do not show a high degree in sequence homology (40%).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	202	 However, only a small fragment of the mouse PPAR promoter has been sequenced to date (36).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	203	 This sequence disparity in both the 5'-UTR and the promoter regions may indicate that PPAR gene expression among species could be regulated in a different manner although sufficient data to establish a thorough comparison between species are lacking at this stage.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	204	Computer-assisted analysis of the hPPAR promoter sequence identified various putative transcription factor binding sites, such as sites for members of the early growth response (Egr) gene family, which are involved in the induction of monocytic differentiation (45).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Egr proteins could thus be involved in the up-regulation of hPPAR expression upon monocyte differentiation into macrophages (32) although further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Furthermore, potential sites for NFB and AP1, factors involved in the transduction of several cytokine and proinflammatory signals, as well as for the myeloid zinc finger gene, MZF-1, were found in the hPPAR promoter.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	207	 PPAR inhibition of NFB- and AP1-induced expression of inflammatory response genes (46) lies at the basis of its antiinflammatory activities.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	208	 It is tempting to speculate that hPPAR expression, in its turn, is controlled by inflammatory cytokines.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Because rodent PPAR mRNA levels are increased by glucocorticoids (20, 21), putative GR response elements were searched for.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	210	 No obvious GR response element could be detected within the hPPAR regulatory region analyzed; however, regulation studies in human tissues or cell lines would be necessary to determine whether hPPAR expression is also modulated by glucocorticoids in humans.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	211	HNF4 is a nuclear receptor that plays a key role in liver-specific gene expression (47) and is required for mammalian hepatocyte differentiation and for normal metabolic regulation in liver (48).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	212	 HNF4 is expressed at high levels in liver, kidney, and intestine (47).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	213	 It binds as homodimers to DR1-like response elements, thereby modulating the expression of several liver-enriched genes encoding apolipoproteins, coagulation factors, serum proteins, proteins of the cytochrome P450 family, and genes involved in FA and glucose metabolism (49).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Regulation of hPPAR by HNF4 is consistent with the tissue-expression pattern shown by PPAR.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	215	 In the present study induction of hPPAR promoter activity by HNF4 is reported.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	216	 A HNF4-RE was identified at nt -1,492 to -1,483 within the hPPAR promoter.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	217	 This element closely resembles several HNF4-REs found in other genes and the GGGGCA A AGGTCA consensus HNF4 binding site (50).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Moreover, the regulation of PPAR gene expression by HNF4 in vivo in mice was recently demonstrated using HNF4-deficient mice (51).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	219	 These mice display significantly lower PPAR mRNA levels compared with the wild-type mice, thus demonstrating that PPAR expression is regulated by HNF4 also in mice.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Nevertheless, the promoter experiments performed with the hPPAR promoter indicate that the HNF4 site identified is not responsible for the activity of the hPPAR promoter in liver because the promoter construct lacking this site still possesses a significant activity in HepG2 cells (Fig.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	221	 This may suggest that this site binds as well other factors, such as COUP-TF, present in these cells that negatively regulate the hPPAR promoter either as a result of a direct repression of the promoter or due to competition with factors, such as HNF4, for binding to the site.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	222	 In addition, negative factors may bind to sites located between -1,664 and -1,206 bp in the hPPAR promoter.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Future studies on the regulation of this promoter will be required to elucidate the factors governing hPPAR gene expression in liver.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	224	Members of the COUP-TF family of orphan nuclear receptors have been reported to bind DR1 sites that are also recognized by HNF4 (52).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	225	 COUP-TF actively represses or antagonizes HNF4-mediated transcriptional activation of several genes (39, 41, 42, 43, 44).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	226	 COUP-TF II has been shown to play a role in cardiac energy metabolism and heart development (53, 54).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	227	 In this study, COUP-TFII was also shown to bind the HNF4-RE within the hPPAR regulatory region and to repress both basal and HNF4-induced hPPAR promoter activity.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The COUP-TFII antagonism may finely tune HNF4-dependent gene expression.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	229	 The expression level of a COUP-TFII/HNF4 target gene would therefore depend on the relative concentrations of both transcription factors in a given cell type or during a certain condition.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	230	 For instance, the age-dependent diminution of apo AI gene expression has been shown to occur at the transcriptional level and to be associated with a decrease in the binding capacity and expression of HNF4 and a parallel increase in COUP-TFII binding and concentration levels (55).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Interestingly, PPAR gene expression is also diminished in aged rats (23).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Further studies are required to demonstrate whether the molecular mechanisms described for the age-dependent decline of apo AI can also explain the decreased expression of PPAR with age.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	233	Finally, PPAR is also capable of binding to the HNF4-RE.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Induction of PPAR gene expression by PPAR agonists has been reported in different rodent cell lines (22, 24, 56).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Our data indicate that PPAR agonists, such as fenofibrate, induce hPPAR mRNA levels in primary cultures of human hepatocytes as well as hPPAR promoter activity, suggesting that these effects are exerted at the transcriptional level.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Furthermore, induction of hPPAR promoter activity is dependent on the identified HNF4-RE.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Autoregulation is a common feature among nuclear receptors.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	238	 For instance, GRs are regulated by glucocorticoids, and glucocorticoids exert these actions mainly at the level of transcription (57).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	239	 AR is another nuclear receptor that is autoregulated (58), and three different ER promoters have been shown to be regulated by estrogens (59).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	240	The coding exons of the hPPAR gene have been screened for polymorphisms.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	241	 A leucine-to-valine missense mutation at codon 162 in exon 5 of the hPPAR gene (L162V) was recently identified (34, 35).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	242	 This polymorphism shows an enhanced transactivation activity (34) and has been associated with altered plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in type 2 diabetic subjects (34), supporting a role for PPAR in dyslipidemia and diabetes in humans also.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Variants have been identified in other exons and introns of the hPPAR gene (Ref.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Staels, unpublished observations).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	245	 However, these polymorphisms either show low frequency in the populations studied or they do not directly affect PPAR activity due to their location in intronic sequences of the gene.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Thus, it will be interesting to search for polymorphisms in the promoter sequences of the gene that may affect PPAR expression and function.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	247	Taken together, the 5'-flanking region of the hPPAR gene has been characterized, cloned, and functionally studied.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	248	 HNF4 induces hPPAR expression via a DR1 element present in the hPPAR promoter, whereas this effect is antagonized by the orphan receptor COUP-TFII.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In addition, PPAR itself modulates its own expression.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Knowledge of the hPPAR promoter structure will allow further studies of the molecular mechanisms governing hPPAR gene regulation.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	251	Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5'-RACE) PCR and RT-PCR Analysis Total human liver RNA was isolated using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (61).

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, February 25, 2002, and in revised form, April 2, 2002.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	3	Retinoids, the natural and synthetic vitamin A analogs, exert profound effects on many biological processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation (1, 2), and are recognized as promising agents for the prevention and treatment of various cancers.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The effects of retinoids are mainly mediated by two nuclear receptor classes, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)1 and retinoid X receptor (RXR) (3-5).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Both are encoded by three different genes (, , and ) and function as ligand-inducible transcription factors in vivo mainly as RXR/RAR heterodimers.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	6	 trans-Retinoic acid (trans-RA) binds RARs, whereas 9-cis-RA binds both RARs and RXRs.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Binding of retinoids to their receptors induces receptor conformational changes that switch on transcription of genes containing RA response elements (RAREs) (3-5).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In addition to their positive regulation of RARE-containing genes, retinoid receptors, in response to their ligands, can inhibit effects induced by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and the transcriptional activity of the proto-oncogenes c-Jun and c-Fos (6), which are components of the AP-1 complex, which often has a role in cancer cell proliferation (7).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The activation of AP-1-responsive genes by TPA or c-Jun/c-Fos through TPA response elements (TREs) is repressed by retinoid receptors in a ligand-dependent manner (8-10).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Conversely, AP-1 represses transactivation of retinoid receptors (8, 9).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	11	 This mutual antagonism appears to play a critical role in regulating cell growth and differentiation (6).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	12	 For example, overexpression of c-Jun conferred retinoid resistance to breast cancer cells (11), while overexpression of retinoid receptors enabled trans-RA to inhibit AP-1 activity in ovarian cancer cells and their growth (12).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The functional interaction between AP-1 and retinoid receptors is also observed for other nuclear receptors, including glucocorticoid receptor (13-16), thyroid hormone receptor (17), vitamin D receptor, estrogen receptor (18, 19), and androgen receptor (AR) (18).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	14	The anti-AP-1 activities shown by liganded retinoid receptors appear to contribute significantly to the therapeutic efficacy of retinoids against hyperproliferative diseases (6).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Transcription of various AP-1-responsive genes, such as collagenase and stromelysin, which have roles in tumor progression and invasiveness (20), is inhibited by retinoids (8-10) and has been reported to contribute to their reversal of human bronchial epithelial squamous differentiation (21).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Retinyl methyl ether, which effectively prevents mammary cancer in animals, strongly suppressed AP-1 activity in breast cancer cell (22).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Interestingly, RAR, a negative regulator of cancer cell growth (23), potently inhibits AP-1 activity and collagenase expression in both breast and lung cancer cells (24).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Recent studies demonstrate that retinoids that specifically inhibit AP-1 activity but antagonize RAR transactivation on RAREs inhibited the growth of many different types of cancer cells (25-27).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Anti-AP-1 retinoids inhibited squamous differentiation of human bronchial epithelial cells (21), TPA-induced transformation and the clonal growth of the promotion-sensitive JB6 mouse epidermal cell line (28), and papilloma formation in animals (29).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Thus, anti-AP-1 activity of retinoids contributes to their chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects, presumably by blocking the processes of tumor promotion and cell transformation.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	21	The mechanism by which retinoids inhibit AP-1 activity remains largely unclear.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Unlike the effect of retinoid receptors on RAREs, inhibition of AP-1 activity by retinoid receptors is independent of retinoid receptor-RARE interaction (8-10).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Previous studies suggested several possible mechanisms for AP-1 inhibition by retinoid receptors.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	24	 First, retinoid receptors are reported to physically interact with c-Jun and/or c-Fos (8, 9).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	25	 This interaction results in the mutual inhibition of their DNA binding and transactivation functions and could explain the cross-talk occurring between AP-1 and retinoid signaling.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	26	 However, a large excess of either retinoid receptor protein or c-Jun and c-Fos proteins was required to inhibit in vitro binding to the TRE or RARE, respectively (8, 9).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Because the in vivo footprint assay for glucocorticoid receptor and AP-1 interaction did not reveal any effect on DNA binding (30), whether RAR and AP-1 directly interact in vivo remains to be established.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Subsequently, it was suggested that blocking activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway that activates AP-1 might be responsible for AP-1 inhibition by retinoid and other nuclear receptors (31).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Although this mechanism may explain how retinoids inhibit AP-1 activity under some conditions, it does not address how mutual inhibition occurs.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Recent results suggest that the molecular basis of receptor-mediated inhibition of AP-1 transcriptional activation might be due to competition for a common coactivator, such as the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CBP), which is required for transcriptional activation by both the AP-1 complex and RARs (32).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	31	 However, a domain of RAR capable of inhibiting AP-1 activity, such as the DNA-binding domain (33), does not interact with CBP (32).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The development of retinoids that specifically inhibit AP-1 activity without transactivating RARs (25, 26) also argues against the involvement of RAR coactivators in RARs-AP-1 cross-talk.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Thus, the availability of CBP is unlikely to be the sole modulator of RAR and AP-1-signaling pathways, and other adapter proteins may be involved in the antagonism of AP-1 activity by RARs.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	34	Recent studies demonstrate that orphan receptor COUP-TF is involved in regulation retinoid responses (34, 35).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	35	 COUP-TF is encoded by two distinct genes, COUP-TFI (EAR-3) (36, 37) and COUP-TFII (ARP-1) (38).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Both show exceptional homology and overlapping expression patterns, suggesting their redundant functions (39).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	37	 COUP-TF can modulate retinoid responses through either its high affinity binding to various RAREs or its heterodimerization with RXR (40-43).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	38	 We previously reported that COUP-TF expression was required for cancer cell growth inhibition by trans-RA (35).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	39	 We further demonstrated that the effect of COUP-TF is partly due to its induction of RAR that mediates growth inhibition by retinoids in various cancer cells (35).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	40	Cell Culture-- HeLa ovarian and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS); Calu-6 lung cancer and HT-1376 bladder cancer cells were grown in MEM containing 10% FCS; and T-47D and ZR-75-1 breast cancer and H292 lung cancer cells were grown in RPMI-1460 medium with 10% FCS.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	41	Plasmid Construction-- CAT reporter constructs TRE-tk-CAT and 73Col-CAT have been described (8, 17, 22, 24), as have expression vectors for RAR, COUP-TF, c-Jun, and c-Fos (8, 17, 22, 24, 44).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	42	 pcDNA3-COUP-TFII C-terminal deletion mutants pcDNA3-COUP-TFII7, pcDNA3-COUP-TFII30, and pcDNA3-COUP-TFII108 were generated as described (35).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	43	 pcDNA3-COUP-TFII N-terminal deletion mutants were constructed by cloning PCR products from COUP-TFII into pcDNA3 (Stratagene) using the following forward primers: TATAGGTACCATGGCGCCGCCCGTGCCC for pcDNA3-COUP-TFIIN25; ATATGGTACCATGACGCCAGCCCAGACG for pcDNA3-COUP-TFIIN50; AATTGGTACCATGCACATCGAGTGCGTG for pcDNA3-COUP-TFIIN75; and ATTAGGTACCATGCACCATCGCAACCAG for pcDNA3COUPTFIIN125.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The oligonucleotide GTGGCAGTTGAGGGGATCC was used as the reverse primer for these mutants.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	45	Transient and Stable Transfection Assays-- HeLa cells (1  x  105 cells/well) were plated in 24-well plates for 16-24 h before transfection as described (34, 35, 45), and other cancer cells (5  x  105 cell/well) were seeded in six-well plates.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	46	 A modified calcium phosphate precipitation procedure was used for transient transfections (34, 35, 45).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Briefly, 200 ng of reporter plasmid, 100 ng of -galactosidase of expression vector (pCH 110; Amersham Biosciences), and various amounts of each expression vector were mixed with carrier DNA (pBluescript) to give 1000 ng of total DNA/well.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	48	 CAT activity was normalized for transfection efficiency to the responding -Gal activity.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	49	 For stable transfections, the pRC/CMV-COUP-TF recombinant was transfected into MDA-MB231 and HT-1376 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, and the stable clones were screened with G418 (Invitrogen) as described (35).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Integration and expression of transfected cDNA were determined by Southern blotting and Northern blotting, respectively.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	51	Preparation of Receptor Proteins-- Receptor proteins for RAR, TR3, COUP-TF, and its mutants were synthesized by in vitro transcription-translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) as described previously (34).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Amounts of translated proteins were determined by [35S]methionine incorporation and SDS-PAGE with quantitation by incorporated radioactivity after normalization relative to methionine content.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	53	Gel Retardation Assay-- A fragment of the collagenase promoter region 73 to +63 containing one AP-1-binding site (TRE) was excised from a collagenase-CAT construct (8).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	54	 In addition, the AP-1 binding sequence 5'-GATCCGGATGAGTCACCA-3' was synthesized.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Two fragments were labeled with [32P]dCTP for use as probes for protein-DNA interaction.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	56	 In vitro translated protein was incubated with the probe in a 20- microl reaction mixture containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	59	 DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and then gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	60	GST Pull-down Assay-- To prepare glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun or GST-c-Jun mutant fusion proteins, each c-Jun DNA or c-Jun mutant fragment was cloned in frame into the expression vector pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria using the manufacturer's procedure and analyzed by gel retardation assays and Western blotting (data not shown).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	62	 To determine the interaction between COUP-TF and c-Jun, the fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The vector protein (GST), prepared under the same conditions as a control, was also immobilized.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Beads were preincubated with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) at room temperature for 5 min.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	65	 35S-labeled in vitro translated COUP-TF proteins (2-5  microl, depending on translation efficiency) were then added to the beads.

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	71	Correlation between COUP-TF Expression and Inhibition of AP-1 Activity by trans-RA-- We recently reported that expression of COUP-TF is required for growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by trans-RA in various cancer cells (35).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Since inhibition of AP-1 activity by retinoids is known to contribute to their anticancer effects, we studied whether COUP-TF expression was involved in the process.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The effect of trans-RA on inhibiting AP-1 activity (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	74	 1A) was evaluated in COUP-TF-positive T-47D and ZR-75-1 breast cancer and Calu-6 lung cancer cell lines and in COUP-TF-negative MDA-MB231 breast cancer, H292 lung cancer, and HT-1376 bladder cancer cell lines (35).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	75	 AP-1 activity induced by TPA was determined by transient transfection using the reporter 73Col-CAT, which contains a TRE that binds AP-1 (8).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	76	 TPA-induced reporter activity was strongly inhibited in a trans-RA-dependent manner in the COUP-TF-positive ZR-75-1, T-47D, and Calu-6 cell lines.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	77	 In contrast, trans-RA showed very little effect on TPA-induced 73Col-CAT activity in the COUP-TF-negative MDA-MB231, H292, and HT-1376 cell lines.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Thus, COUP-TF expression correlates positively with the ability of trans-RA to inhibit AP-1 transcriptional activity.

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The 73Col-CAT reporter was transfected with or without COUP-TF into COUP-TF-negative cancer cell lines (MDA-MB231, H292, and HT-1376).

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	92	 The activities of cotransfected -galactosidase were used as reference values.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	93	Trans-RA-dependent and -independent Antagonism of AP-1 Activity by COUP-TF-- The positive association between COUP-TF expression and trans-RA-induced anti-AP-1 activity suggested that COUP-TF was required for trans-RA to inhibit AP-1 activity and that the absence of COUP-TF expression in MDA-MB231, H292, and HT-1376 cells might be responsible for the lack of trans-RA activity.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Therefore, we transiently transfected the COUP-TF expression vector and the 73Col-CAT reporter into the COUP-TF-negative cell lines, in which trans-RA did not inhibit AP-1 transcriptional activity (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Upon COUP-TF transfection, trans-RA inhibited TPA-induced reporter activity in both MDA-MB231 and H292 cells in a COUP-TF concentration-dependent manner.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Interestingly, COUP-TF transfection alone produced some inhibition of AP-1 activity.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	97	 This observation suggested that COUP-TF inhibited AP-1 activity in both trans-RA-dependent and -independent manners in MDA-MB231 and H292 cells.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	98	 When evaluated in HT-1376 cells, COUP-TF expression was able to inhibit AP-1 activity independently of trans-RA (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	99	 However, it failed to confer the ability of trans-RA to inhibit TPA-induced reporter activity, even at high transfection levels, suggesting that trans-RA-dependent inhibition of AP-1 activity by COUP-TF is impaired in this cell line.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	100	The above results suggested that COUP-TF alone inhibited AP-1 activity.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	101	 We then examined the anti-AP-1 activity of COUP-TF in HeLa cells, in which TPA strongly induced the transcription of the transfected 73Col-CAT reporter.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Similar to that observed in other cancer cell lines (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	103	 1B), COUP-TFI cotransfection inhibited TPA-induced reporter activity in a COUP-TFI concentration-dependent manner (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Cotransfection of COUP-TFII produced almost identical results (data not shown).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Activation of collagenase promoter by TPA occurs mainly through induction of AP-1 activity that activates the TRE in the promoter (7).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	106	 We therefore examined whether COUP-TF expression also interfered with transactivation activity of c-Jun homodimer and c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Cotransfection of 73Col-CAT with the c-Jun expression vector into HeLa cells led to about 5-fold induction of reporter expression (Fig.

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	236	 In COUP-TF-positive ZR-75-1, T-47D, and Calu-6 cancer cell lines (35), trans-RA strongly inhibited the ability of TPA to activate transcription of the collagenase promoter, whereas in COUP-TF-negative MDA-MB231, H292, and HT-1376 cell lines, trans-RA failed to suppress TPA activity (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	237	 This finding is consistent with a previous study showing that trans-RA effectively inhibited AP-1 activity in ZR-75-1 and T-47D cells but not in MDA-MB231 cells (49).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	238	 The requirement of COUP-TF in trans-RA-mediated AP-1 inhibition was further demonstrated by our findings that transient expression of COUP-TF in COUP-TF-negative cells (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	239	 1B) restored the ability of trans-RA to inhibit TPA-induced AP-1 transactivation and that stable expression of COUP-TF in MBA-MB231 cells enabled trans-RA to inhibit TPA-induced c-Jun expression (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	240	We have reported that COUP-TF expression contributes to growth inhibition by trans-RA in cancer cells because COUP-TF on binding to the RAR promoter induces RAR expression (35).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	241	 RAR is reported to be a potent AP-1 inhibitor (24), suggesting that COUP-TF-induced RAR probably contributes to the inhibition of AP-1 activity (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Our observations that COUP-TF can effectively interact with c-Jun in vitro (Figs.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	243	 3 and 4) and inhibit AP-1 transcriptional activity on transient transfection (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	244	 2) also suggest that COUP-TF is directly involved in antagonizing AP-1 activity.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	245	Inhibition of AP-1 activity appears to be a common characteristic of nuclear receptors, as has been demonstrated for the progesterone, estrogen, androgen, thyroid hormone, glucocorticoid, and retinoid receptors, which can functionally interact with the AP-1 complex.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	246	 This study reveals that the orphan receptor COUP-TF behaves similarly.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The molecular basis of the interaction between nuclear receptors and AP-1 pathways remains largely unknown.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Models proposed include direct protein-protein interaction (8, 9, 13-15), inhibition of Jun N-terminal kinase activity (31), and competition for CBP (32).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Our results of GST pull-down assays (Figs.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	250	 4B and 5) and mutation analysis (Figs.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	251	 4 and 5) support the first model.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	252	 The requirement for the COUP-TF DBD for c-Jun binding is similar to observations that the DBDs of glucocorticoid receptor (14, 15) and RAR (47) are essential for their interaction with AP-1.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Interestingly, the in vitro DNA-binding study showed that COUP-TF is a more effective inhibitor of AP-1 binding than RAR (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	254	 3) on the basis of the levels of each receptor to exert this effect.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	255	In contrast to inhibition of AP-1 activity by other receptors that require their respective ligands, COUP-TF effectively inhibited AP-1 transactivation in the absence of any ligand (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Such a ligand-independent inhibition of AP-1 activity may restrict expression levels of AP-1-responsive genes in cancer cells (Figs.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Interestingly, we observed that COUP-TF expression potentiates antagonism of AP-1 activity by trans-RA.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	258	 However, regulation of trans-RA activity by COUP-TF appears to require RAR or RAR, because transiently transfected COUP-TF was unable to confer anti-AP-1 activity to trans-RA in HT-1376 cells lacking RAR or - (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	259	 8B) unless RAR was cotransfected.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	260	 In addition, stable expression of COUP-TF restored trans-RA-induced anti-AP-1 activity in MDA-MB231 cells (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	261	 6) having RARs (48) but not in HT-1376 cells lacking RAR and - (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Thus, expression of both RAR/ and COUP-TF is required for optimal inhibition of AP-1 activity by trans-RA.

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	5	 HBV is a major pathogen causing acute and chronic liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (3, 4).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	6	 HBV transcripts are regulated by the transcriptional control of four different promoters and two enhancer elements (5).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	7	 HBV is replicated from a RNA intermediate as a template for reverse transcription (1).

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Recently, multiple binding sites for liver-specific or ubiquitous transcription factors and several hormone response elements (HRE) have been identified in the core promoter region, including Sp1 (7, 8), TATA-binding protein (9), HNF3 (10), HNF4 (11), C/EBP (12), and other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, such as the retinoid X receptor (RXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), COUP-TF1, and ARP1 (13).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	11	 For example, HNF4 and RXR/PPAR can stimulate the expression of the 3.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	12	5-kb core RNA, COUP-TF1 suppresses the expression of both the pre-C RNA and C RNA, and TR2 preferentially represses the expression of the pre-C RNA (14).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These findings suggest that these nuclear receptors may play important roles in viral transcription.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The detailed mechanisms of how the core promoter is differentially regulated by these nuclear receptors remain unclear.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	15	The testicular orphan receptor 4 (TR4) (NR2C2) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (15-17).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This family includes classic steroid hormone receptors, the thyroid hormone receptor, the retinoid receptors, and many nuclear orphan receptors whose physiological ligands have not been identified (18).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Members of this superfamily typically contain two major conserved domains, the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the ligand-binding domain (LBD) (18).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Most nuclear receptors bind to their cognate ligands, translocate into the nucleus, and bind to the specific HREs to turn on their downstream target genes.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	19	 TR4 was isolated from human prostate and testis cDNA libraries and is considered to be an orphan receptor, because its ligand has not been found (15).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Our previous data showed that TR4 recognizes different AGGTCA direct repeat (DR) sequences either inducing or suppressing its target genes.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	21	 For example, TR4 induces reporters containing the DR1 site of human ciliary neurotrophic factor  receptor promoter and the DR4 site of the -myosin heavy chain promoter (19, 20).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In contrast, TR4 suppresses RXR/retinoic acid receptor (DR1), vitamin D3 receptor (DR3), and RXR/PPAR (DR1)-mediated transactivation as shown by the reporter assay (21-23).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These results suggest that TR4 may act as a negative regulator of its target genes containing hormone response elements (HREs) by competition with other nuclear receptors for binding to the HREs (21, 23).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In addition, our previous data showed that TR4 could also suppress androgen receptor-mediated transactivation via protein-protein interaction (22).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	25	The distribution of TR4 expression is ubiquitous in many tissues, including the central nervous system, adrenal gland, spleen, thyroid gland, and liver (16, 19, 23).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Also, there are many other nuclear receptors expressed in the liver, such as HNF4 (24) and RXR/PPAR (25, 26).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These findings suggest that these nuclear receptors in the liver can coordinately regulate gene expression by interacting with HRE sequences in the promoters of their target genes.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Our data show that TR4 can interfere with a number of other nuclear receptors by competing for binding to the same HREs (21, 22).

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	62	TR4 Protein Binds Specifically to the TR4RE-HBV Consensus Site of the HBV Core Promoter-- Previous studies showed that the activity of the HBV core promoter could be differentially regulated by RXR or PPAR via recognizing consensus binding sites on the HBV core promoter (13, 14).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Our previous data also showed that the TR4 has a better affinity than RXR to recognize the DR1-HRE in the promoter of the cellular retinol-binding protein II gene (21).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	64	 To examine whether TR4 can bind to the potential DR1-HRE (named TR4RE-HBV, nucleotide coordinates 1751-1778 of the HBV ayw DNA sequence) on the HBV core promoter (13), the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed with in vitro translated TR4 protein, using radiolabeled TR4RE-HBV oligonucleotides as probes.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	65	 1, no specific supershift complex was seen with an anti-TR4 monoclonal antibody when using mock lysates (Fig.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	66	 In contrast, the TR4-CpFL supershift complex was observed in the presence of an anti-TR4 antibody using in vitro translated TR4 lysates (lanes 3 and 4).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Moreover, when we replaced wild type TR4RE-HBV with various mutants, we found that TR4 could only bind specifically to the wild type TR4RE-HBV, but not to other mutated TR4RE-HBVs, except for the M3 mutant, which has marginal binding (lanes 5-10).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The M1 double mutant with nucleotides changed from A to T (1765) and G to A (1767) represents the HBV mutant frequently found in the patients with chronic hepatitis (33).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	69	 TR4 was not able to bind to the M1 and M2 mutants (lanes 5 and 6), indicating that the second mutated nucleotide of the DR1-AGGTCA motif is essential for TR4 binding to the TR4RE-HBV.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	70	 In addition, a TR4-specific antibody can supershift the TR4 TR4RE-HBV complex (lane 4), and this binding can be reduced in the presence of 100-fold unlabeled TR4RE-HBV probe but not the probe with an androgen response element probes or TR4RE-HBV mutant probes (lanes 11-15), suggesting that the binding between TR4 and TR4RE-HBV is specific.

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	176	Suppression of HBV Pre-core and Core mRNA Expression by TR4-- To further confirm the suppression of HBV core promoter activity by TR4, we applied a primer extension assay to see if TR4 can also influence mRNA expression of two HBV transcripts from the HBV core promoter.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The first transcript is pre-C mRNA, which is the precursor of HBeAg; the other transcript is C mRNA, serving as the template for reverse transcription (6, 36).

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	180	 This result therefore confirms the reporter assays showing that TR4 can suppress HBV core promoter transcription via binding to the TR4RE-HBV site on the HBV core promoter.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	181	Earlier studies have identified two consensus DR1 binding sites for nuclear receptors in the HBV promoter.

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The other site (AGGTTAAAGGTCT, nucleotide coordinates 1757-1769) is located in the core promoter that can be recognized by HNF4 and TR4 as described in current studies (13).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	184	 The detailed mechanisms of how these nuclear receptors modulate HBV gene expression via these two DR1 sites remain unclear.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Our data strongly suggest that TR4 preferentially binds the DR1 site of the core promoter, because TR4 suppression is abrogated if this site is mutated (Fig.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The selective binding of TR4 to the 2nd DR1 site may be a key step for TR4 to prevent other nuclear receptors from binding to this site, thereby repressing transcription.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	187	 However, we cannot rule out the possibility that TR4 may also regulate HBV gene expression through the DR1 site of enhancer I, because our data indicate that TR4 can recognize this site (data not shown).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Moreover, because TR4 binding to the 2nd DR1 site is prevented by two mutations ((1756 (A to T) and 1767 (G to A)), which are frequently found in patients with chronic hepatitis, one may speculate that HBV may utilize these two mutations to escape suppression mediated by TR4 and/or other transcriptional repressors.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Alternatively, creation of new mutations at these consensus DR1 sites may be able to increase the opportunity for other modulators to regulate HBV expression via these mutated DR1 sites (32).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	190	TR4 is highly homologous with another orphan receptor, TR2 (15).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Earlier studies indicated that TR2 and TR4 could modulate the expression of a set of genes through binding to the same HREs (19, 38).

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Our current data show that TR4 can repress both pre-C RNA and C RNA expression.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Moreover, compared with the marginal suppression of TR2 on CpLuc reporter activity, TR4 has a much stronger suppressive effect on CpLuc reporter activity (data not shown), suggesting that TR4 may play a significant role in this regulation.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Also, our data suggest that simple competition for binding to the DR1 site by these two nuclear receptors may not fully account for their distinct regulation of HBV core gene expression, because both nuclear receptors regulate target genes through binding to the DR sites (19, 38).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	196	 The detailed mechanisms underlying the distinct regulation of HBV gene expression by these two closely related orphan receptors remain unclear.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The interaction of TR4 and HNF4 suggests that the TR4 affects HBV gene expression at multiple levels, most importantly, including the DNA binding and protein-protein interactions.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Nevertheless, previous reports also suggested that COUP-TF could differentially modulate target gene expression via similar HREs.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	199	 For example, COUP-TF1 can induce the 7-hydroxylase promoter activity via the DR4 binding site and repress myosin heavy chain promoter activity via a similar DR4 binding site (39).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Similar differential modulation of target gene expression also occurred with TR4, via binding to similar DR1 binding sites (21, 23).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	201	The contrasting effects of TR4 on the synthetic TR4RE-HBV versus the entire HBV promoter (Fig.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	202	 3 versus 4) suggest that promoter context, especially sequences other than the TR4RE-HBV, may also play important roles for TR4 to modulate HBV core promoter activity.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	203	 It is possible that sequences flanking the TR4RE-HBV may recruit one or more repressors that can cooperate with TR4 to form a protein complex to repress HBV core promoter.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	204	 In addition, we have examined the effects of TR4 on HBV core promoter activity in non-liver cells and found that TR4 was able to induce the luciferase activity of the Cpluc reporter in H1299 cells (data not shown).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	205	 This interesting finding implies that some cellular factors in liver cells may modulate the transcriptional activity of TR4 in the regulation of the HBV core promoter.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	206	 However, the detailed mechanisms of this distinct regulation by TR4 remain unclear.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	207	TR4 may modulate its target gene expression via two distinct mechanisms.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	208	 First, TR4 can suppress target gene expression via competition with other nuclear receptors, such as RXR (DR1), VDR (DR3), and retinoic acid receptor  (DR5), for the same consensus HRE sites (21, 22).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Previous studies showed that ligand-activated RXR/PPAR or PPAR can increase HBV core promoter activity through the TR4RE-HBV site (DR1) (13, 14).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Therefore, it appears that TR4 may compete for the same binding site with these nuclear receptors resulting in repression of HBV core promoter activity, which this regulation does not involve in any interaction between TR4 and other nuclear receptors (21, 22).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Second, TR4 can also modulate gene expression via protein-protein interactions with other nuclear receptors.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	212	 For example, TR4 can suppress androgen target genes through interactions with the androgen receptor (40).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	213	 In the current study, we found TR4 cannot only bind to the same DR1 site on HBV core promoter as HNF4 (Fig.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	214	 5), but also interact with HNF4 (Fig.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The TR4-mediated repression resulted from this interaction was confirmed by using TR4 deletion mutants in several parallel experiments and may further support that there might be multiple mechanisms by which TR4 proceeds in this repressive regulation.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Previous studies showed that TR2, a close member of TR4 family, and RIP140 (receptor-interacting protein 140), one of TR4-interacting proteins, can interact and recruit histone deacetylases for gene silencing (22, 41, 42).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	217	 It is possible that TR4 may carry out this repression through similar mechanisms, which would be an interesting direction for our future study to test the involvement of histone deacetylases in this regulation.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	218	On the other hand, in HBV-infected liver cells, the repressive function of TR4 may be unfavorable to the HBV replication because the core promoter controls the transcription of the template C RNA for viral DNA synthesis.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	219	 We speculate that the functional association of TR4 and HNF4 could be a unique way to relieve TR4-mediated repression, because HNF can reduce TR4 binding to the DR1 site through either competition for DNA binding or protein-protein interactions (Fig.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	220	 The underlying mechanisms of how these nuclear receptors differentially influence the transcription activation of HBV genes during infection will require more extensive study.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	221	 8, TR4 can directly bind to the TR4RE-HBV and therefore prevent other nuclear receptors from activating the HBV core promoter.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Alternatively, TR4 can interact with nuclear receptors, such as HNF4, to form an inactive protein complex.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Either of these two activities may result in the suppression of HBV core promoter.

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	226	 This figure depicts a simple model of the HBV core promoter and the regulation of this promoter via TR4RE-HBV by TR4.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	227	 A, The binding of TR4 to the TR4RE may restrict the accessibility of this site to other essential nuclear receptors for transcriptional activation.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Also, the interaction of HNF4 and TR4 inhibits HNF4 transcriptional activity and results in the suppression of the HBV core promoter activity.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	229	 B, during natural infection, by an unknown mechanism, the interaction of HNF4 and 2R4 may prevent TR4 from binding to the DR1 site (Fig.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Therefore, this regulation can relieve TR4-mediated repression and allow HNF4 or other nuclear receptors to proceed to the transcriptional activation.

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	5	 This tightly regulated feedback mechanism is necessary because bile acids are highly toxic and cholesterol is needed for maintaining cellular structure and function.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Recent studies (4) have revealed that bile acid feedback has far-reaching impacts on liver metabolism; it not only regulates bile acid synthesis in the digestive system but also regulates cholesterol, lipoprotein, triglyceride, and glucose metabolisms.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The discovery that lithocholic acid (LCA) is an endogenous ligand for pregnane X receptor (PXR) suggests that bile acids may also regulate drug metabolism in the liver and intestine by induction of CYP450 enzymes (27, 34).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	8	 PXR and its human ortholog steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) induce the CYP3A, CYP2B, and CYP2C families of steroid- and drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver and intestine (17).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Despite the high-sequence identity in the ligand-binding domain between human and mouse PXR, they are very different in ligand selectivity.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Pregnenolone-16-carbonitrile (PCN) and dexamethasone are strong agonists for mouse PXR but weaker agonists for human PXR.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In contrast, rifampicin, an antibiotic that has been used to treat intrahepatic cholestasis, activates human PXR, but not mouse PXR (18).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Previous studies (6, 20) from this laboratory show that PCN and dexamethasone strongly reduced CYP7A1 activity, mRNA, and protein expression levels in rat livers.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This finding was recently confirmed by reports that PCN inhibited Cyp7a1 mRNA levels in mouse liver but had no effect on Cyp7a1 mRNA expression in Pxr knockout mice (27).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These results suggest that PXR may mediate LCA and PCN inhibition of mouse Cyp7a1 gene transcription.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	15	 It was proposed that activation of PXR by drugs and bile acids might protect the liver against drug and bile acid-induced cholestasis (27, 34).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	16	Our previous studies identified two bile acid response elements (BAREs): BARE-I and BARE-II.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These two BAREs are essential for basal transcriptional activity and also for conferring bile acid feedback inhibition (reviewed in Ref.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	18	 They contain several AGGTCA-like repeating sequences, which are potential binding sites for nuclear receptors.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A direct repeat spaced by four bases (DR4) in the rat BARE-I is a binding site for an orphan receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream transcription factor-II (COUP-TFII; NR2F2) and also for liver orphan receptor (LXR; NR1H3).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, COUP-TFII and LXR do not bind to the human BARE-I due to the lack of a DR4 motif (5).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The factor that binds to the human BARE-I has not been identified.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The BARE-II contains an 18-bp sequence that is completely conserved in rats and humans.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)4 binds to a DR1, and human -fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF; NR5A2) or mouse liver-related homolog (LRH) binds to an overlapping half-site sequence in the BARE-II.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	24	 HNF4 is the only nuclear receptor that is able to stimulate the human CYP7A1 gene; all other factors tested (FTF, COUP-TFII, LXR) inhibited the human CYP7A1 gene (2, 5, 29).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	25	Bile acids are known to activate nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4), which binds to the inverted repeat (IR1) sequences and induces several genes involved in lipid metabolism (reviewed in Ref.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	26	 However, FXR inhibits the CYP7A1 gene by inducing a negative receptor, small heterodimer partnet (SHP), which interacts with FTF and inhibits its transactivation of the CYP7A1 gene (3).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The FXR/SHP/FTF mechanism is consistent with lacking inhibition of Cyp7a1 and induction of Shp mRNA expression in Fxr null mice fed with bile acids (26).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, bile acid feeding still inhibits Cyp7a1 expression in Shp null mice (15, 33), suggesting that mechanisms alternative to the FXR/SHP/FTF pathway must exist for bile acids to inhibit Cyp7a1 mRNA expression in Shp null mice (33).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The alternative mechanisms include the cytokine/MAPK/JNK pathway, protein kinase C/cJun pathway, FXR/FGF19/FGFR4 pathway, and the PXR-mediated pathway (4).

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	347	In bile acid or drug-induced cholestasis, PXR may be activated to induce CYP3A4, which catalyzes 6-hydroxylation of bile acids for renal excretion.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	348	 PXR also induces dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase that excretes sulfate-conjugated bile acids.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	349	 Our findings suggest that PXR inhibition of CYP7A1 gene transcription may be an additional mechanism for reducing intrahepatic bile acid concentrations and further protect the liver from toxic effects of bile acids and xenobiotics.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	350	 PXR inhibition of SHP may also be a part of the PXR protection mechanism, because SHP could interact with PXR to inhibit CYP3A4 induction (22).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	351	Our cell-based mammalian two-hybrid assay, co-IP, and ChIP assays all confirm the interactions of PXR with HNF4 and PGC-1.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	352	 The interaction between PXR and HNF4 is novel and is consistent with our model that factors bound to the BARE-I and BARE-II interact and coordinately regulate basal transcription of the CYP7A1 gene (8).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	353	 HNF4 is known to play a central role in regulation of bile acid synthesis (3).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	354	 There are reports that HNF4 is required for PXR-mediated xenobiotic induction of CYP3A4 in mice (31) and that HNF4 regulates PXR expression and xenobiotic response during fetal liver development (14).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	355	 Therefore, the PXR and HNF4 interaction may be physiologically important in the coordinated regulation of xenobiotic and bile acid metabolisms.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	356	 Both two-hybrid assay and co-IP assay using HepG2 and primary hepatocyte extracts show that rifampicin markedly enhances PXR interaction with HNF4.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	357	 The interaction between PXR and PGC-1 is as strong as between HNF4 and PGC-1.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	358	 This is the first report that PXR is a target of PGC-1.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	359	 Rifampicin is not required for PXR to interact with PGC-1 and does not affect HNF4 and PXR binding to CYP7A1 chromatin.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	360	 On the other hand, rifampicin dissociates PGC-1 from CYP7A1 chromatin likely due to enhancing PXR interaction with HNF4.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	361	Our results suggest a model for PXR, HNF4, and PGC-1 regulation of the CYP7A1 gene (Fig.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	362	 HNF4 and PGC-1 are the most important transactivators of the human CYP7A1 gene.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	363	 PGC-1 interacts with HNF4, which binds to the BARE-II and activates human CYP7A1 gene.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	364	 According to this study, PXR binds to the BARE-I and interacts with PGC-1 but may not be important in basal transcription of the CYP7A1 gene.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	365	 It should be noted that our model does not suggest a ternary complex formation among PXR, HNF4, and PGC-1.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	366	 PGC-1 is a coactivator that binds to the LBD of both PXR and HNF4.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	367	 Therefore, it is not likely that PGC-1 interacts simultaneously with both nuclear receptors.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	368	 Ubiquitous coactivators, SRC-1 and CBP, are known to interact with PXR and HNF4; however, our data show a much stronger interaction of PXR with PGC-1 than SRC-1.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	369	 Nuclear receptor/coactivator complexes may facilitate the recruitment of histone acetytransferase to remodel the chromatin to allow recruitment of other coactivator/mediator complexes and assemble the general transcriptional machinery that regulates RNA polymerase II activity (10).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	370	 On the basis of our results, we propose a model that activation of PXR by rifampicin would allow PXR to interact directly with HNF4 and exclude PGC-1 from interacting with HNF4, resulting in suppression of the CYP7A1 gene transcription.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	371	 Corepressors, such as SMRT and NCoR1, have been shown to inhibit nuclear receptor activity (7).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Our preliminary results show that the interaction of SMRT and NCoR1 with HNF4 and PXR is very weak.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	373	 It is also possible that rifampicin-activated PXR may compete with HNF4 for PGC-1, thus inhibiting CYP7A1 gene transcription.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	374	 This mechanism of PXR inhibition of gene transcription is not likely because PGC-1 interaction with PXR or HNF4 does not require a ligand and rifampicin-activated PXR and HNF4 is known to strongly induce, not inhibit, CYP3A4 gene transcription.

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	378	 PGC-1 interacts with HNF4, which binds to the BARE-II and transactivates the human CYP7A1 gene.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	379	 According to this study, PXR is able to bind to the BARE-I.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	380	 Coactivators SRC-1 and cAMP response element binding protein binding protein (CBP) and histone acetytransferase (HAT) may be also recruited to remodel chromatin and recruit other coactivator complexes to induce the basal transcription of the CYP7A1 gene by RNA polymerase II.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	381	 Bottom: rifampicin activates PXR to promote its interaction with HNF4.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	382	 This interaction may disrupt the interaction between PGC-1 and HNF4 (and may be also PXR) and result in suppression of CYP7A1 gene transcription.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	383	 Corepressors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) may be also recruited to inhibit CYP7A1 gene transcription.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	384	  Very recently, a homeobox transcription factor, Prox1, has been shown to interact specifically with FTF and inhibits the CYP7A1 gene (24).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	385	 Prox1 is expressed in the liver and intestine and may play an important role not only in liver development, but also in regulation of bile acid synthesis.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Our Q-PCR analysis detects very high levels of Prox1 mRNA in human primary hepatocytes, indicating that Prox1 might be the dominant repressor of CYP7A1 gene expression in human livers.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	387	 However, it is not known whether bile acids or drugs affect Prox1 interaction with FTF, HNF4, or PXR.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	388	 Another recent report (28) shows that Prox1 interacts with FTF and inhibits SHP gene expression and that Prox1 specifically interacts with histone deacetylase (HDAC)3.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	389	 HDACs are known to form complexes with nuclear receptors and corepressors and inhibit gene transcription (13).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	390	 The roles of these transcriptional repressors in mediating bile acid inhibition of CYP7A1 gene transcription remain to be elucidated.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	391	In summary, this study provides the first evidence that PXR is able to interact with HNF4 and PGC-1 and plays a role in mediating rifampicin and bile acid inhibition of CYP7A1 gene transcription.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	392	 On ligand binding, PXR interacts with HNF4, blocks PGC-1 interaction with HNF4, and results in inhibition of the CYP7A1 gene.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	393	 The PXR pathway may be important for preventing bile acid and drug-induced cholestasis by inhibiting bile acid synthesis as well as stimulating bile acid transport, excretion, and detoxification.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	394	 Thus PXR plays a central role in coordinated regulation of bile acid homeostasis and drug metabolism.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	395	 This may be the mechanism for using rifampicin and steroids to treat pruritus of intrahepatic cholestasis and primary biliary cirrhosis (1, 12).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	396	 Efficacious PXR agonists may be developed for treating these chronic liver diseases.

0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	2	The function of differentiated ss-cells is dependent upon a network of transcription factors that are required for the expression of key genes involved in glucose sensing, insulin biosynthesis, and regulated exocytosis (1 to 4).
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Disturbance of this network, even by mutations causing a modest decrease in the protein level, has been shown to lead to important clinical manifestations such as diabetes and/or obesity.
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	4	Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII; also called NR2F and ARP-1) is an orphan member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily that binds DNA by a Zn-finger DNA binding domain (5).
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	5	 COUP-TFII is generally considered to be a functional transcriptional repressor of genes controlled by nuclear hormone receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4, which are well known to play important roles in the glucose-responsive phenotype of ss-cells (6,7).
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The possibility that COUP-TFII might play a role in glucose homeostasis is supported by in vitro studies suggesting that this protein is involved in regulating insulin gene expression in pancreatic ss-cells (8) but also in the expression of several other genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism (9,10).
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	7	 It has been shown that COUP-TFII is expressed in the early developing endocrine pancreas and in mature differentiated islet cells (11).
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, until now the potential function of COUP-TFII in pancreatic ss-cells remains unknown.
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	9	 One way to address this issue is to generate COUP-TFII-deficient mice.
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Since global COUP-TFII deficiency results in embryonic lethality (12), we generated in this study a conditional knockout of the COUP-TFII gene using the Cre-loxP system.

0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Since there are no precedents for embryonic lethal phenotypes resulting from ss-cell-specific gene deletions, this lethality, together with the observations of Magnuson and colleagues (14), led us to examine possible Cre-induced deletion of the floxed COUP-TFII allele in other tissues than endocrine pancreas.

0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis using the A5HF and R5HF primers showed that liver and kidney mRNA was decreased by 20% in heterozygous floxed mice with respect to normal animals (data not shown).
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Accordingly, COUP-TFII protein analyzed by Western blot was also slightly decreased (by 10 to 20%) in hepatocyte nuclear extracts of heterozygous floxed mice.
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Therefore, the floxed COUP-TFII allele is hypomorphic, which could explain the death of some homozygous floxed COUP-TFII pups.

0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	6	HNF1 contains two domains involved in DNA binding (an atypical homeodomain and a POU-like domain), an N-terminal dimerization domain and a C-terminal transactivation domain (1).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Several proteins interact with various HNF1 domains and play crucial roles in HNF1 function.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	8	 DcoH (Dimerization Cofactor of HNF1), is a small protein, which binds to the HNF1 dimerization domain and is involved in dimer stabilization (19).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The ability of various HNF1 domains to interact with multiple coactivators allows formation of a platform for recruitment of a transcriptional complex, leading to a strong enhancement of transcription.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	10	 CBP/p300 interacts with both the DNA binding domain and the activation domain of HNF1 while P/CAF, SRC-1 and RAC3 interact with the HNF1 activation domain (20,21).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Each of these coactivators can independently increase activation of transcription by HNF1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In addition, they cooperate with each other to further enhance the HNF1-mediated activation of transcription (21).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	13	 HNF1 can also interact with GATA 4, GATA 5 and Cdx-2 transcription factors (22).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The interactions between HNF1, GATA5 and Cdx-2 lead to a cooperative enhancement of HNF1-mediated activation of transcription (22).

0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	46	  To control the possibility that HNF4 does not act as a transcriptional partner of another transcription factor, we analysed the effect of HNF4 on the VP16 activation domain fused to the GAL4 DBD (construct GAL4-VP16).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	47	 HNF4 was unable to enhance the VP16-mediated activation of transcription (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	48	 1C), thus indicating the selectivity of the cooperation between HNF4 and HNF1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	49	As predicted from the results of Ktistaki and Talianidis (9), we observed that full-length HNF1 and HNF4 physically interact (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Interestingly, pull-down experiments also showed that HNF1 lacking its activation domain (HNF1-AD) efficiently interacted with HNF4 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	51	 This result indicates that the sequence 1 to 291 of HNF1, containing the dimerization and DNA binding domains, is able to interact with HNF4.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	52	 This prompted us to investigate whether coexpression of HNF4 and HNF1-AD could activate the HNF1-TATA promoter.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Despite their efficient interaction, HNF1-AD and HNF4 were unable to activate transcription (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	54	 1E), thus indicating that cooperation between HNF1 and HNF4 requires the HNF1 activation domain.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	55	AF2 is not the only sequence within the HNF4 LBD required for interaction and cooperation with HNF1 The repressive action of HNF1 on HNF4 was unambiguously shown to require the HNF4 LBD (9).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	56	 However, using truncated fragments of HNF4, Ktistaki and Talianidis mapped the sequence involved in the interaction with HNF1 between residues 337 and 368, leading to the conclusion that the HNF4 AF2 activation function is necessary and sufficient for interaction with HNF1 (9).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	57	 In fact, this sequence does not contain solely the AF2 (sequence 358 to 366 corresponding to helix 12 of the LBD), but also a fragment forming part of the large helix termed H10 to H11, according to conventional nomenclature (31).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Indeed, H10 and H11 are contiguous in HNF4 and form a helix that plays a key role in HNF4 function (31).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Furthermore, the integrity of this helix is crucial for protein conformation (32).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	60	 These recent findings begged a re-evaluation of the HNF4 sequence involved in interaction with HNF1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Using full-length HNF4, we analysed the effects of point mutations located in the HNF4 LBD (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	62	 2A) on the interaction and cooperation with HNF1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The E262A mutation was shown to affect HNF4 dimerization (26).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The E276Q mutation does not alter the intrinsic HNF4 transcriptional activity but impairs recruitment of HNF4 transcriptional partners (24,33).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Owing to the bulky side chain of phenylalanine, the A223F mutation was hypothesized to affect occupancy of the ligand binding pocket by fatty acids that act as structural cofactors rather than as conventional ligands (31).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Accord ingly, A223F mutation mildly impaired HNF4 transcriptional activity and interaction with coactivators (data not shown).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	67	 In the AF2 module, the acidic group of the amino acid residue side chain at position 363 and the hydrophobic nature of the amino acid residue side chain at position 365 are strictly conserved and play a key role in nuclear receptor function (34).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Residue L366 is also important since the L366Q mutation alters HNF4 transcriptional activity (35).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Pull-down assays showed that introducing three mutations E363K, L365Q and L366Q in the AF2 (HNF4-AF2mut construct) altered interaction between HNF4 and HNF1 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Note however that the decrease in interaction was mild.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	71	 This result confirms the involvement of the AF2 in the interaction between HNF1 and HNF4 but indicates that this module is not the unique sequence required for interaction between these proteins.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Interaction with HNF1 was also significantly decreased by the A223F and E276Q mutations while mutation E262A had no effect (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Consistent with data from pull-down assays, the HNF4-mediated enhancement of HNF1-dependent transcriptional activation of the ( to 96/+11) LPK promoter was not impaired by the E262A mutation but was significantly decreased with the mutants A223F, E276Q and HNF4-AF2mut (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	74	 We controlled so that mutant and wild-type HNF4 were expressed at a similar level in transfected cells as shown in Figure 2D for mutants A223F and HNF4-AF2mut and in (24,26) for the mutant E276Q and E262A, respectively.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	75	 It appears therefore that the interaction and cooperation between HNF4 and HNF1 depend on both the AF2 module (helix 12) and the integrity of the HNF4 LBD.

0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	95	 In the absence of HNF1, the coactivator p300 alone or coexpressed with HNF4 was unable to activate the HNF1-TATA promoter (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	96	 On this promoter, p300 slightly enhanced HNF1 transcriptional activity (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Note that this moderate increase is due at least in part to the low ratio of p300/HNF1 expression vectors used in our experiments (3:1) compared to that used in other studies performed on other promoters [e.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	98	 We have verified that by using a higher ratio, we could obtain a stronger enhancement of HNF1 activity by p300 alone (data not shown).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Interestingly, in the presence of HNF4, p300 synergistically enhanced HNF1-mediated activation of transcription: the activity of the promoter was increased 18.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	100	7-fold higher than the additive value for the induction of HNF1 activity by p300 and HNF4 alone (1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The marked p300-mediated enhancement of cooperation between HNF1 and HNF4 could also be observed on the ( to 96/+11) LPK promoter (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	102	 On both promoters, the enhanced cooperation between HNF1 and HNF4 was significantly impaired by mutations in the HNF4 AF2 module (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	103	 These results strongly argue for the involvement of HNF4 in the p300-mediated activation of these promoters despite the absence of HNF4 response element in their sequences.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The result obtained with the HNF4-AF2mut led us to investigate whether mutations in AF2 affect p300 binding.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Pull-down experiments clearly showed a much weaker interaction of p300 with HNF4-AF2mut than with wild-type HNF4 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	106	 This result is in line with our previous observation that deletion of the AF2 resulted in a decrease in interaction (about 70%) between HNF4 and p300 (33).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Therefore, we cannot exclude that the impaired cooperativity of HNF4-AF2mut was also due to reduced p300 recruitment.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Because it has been documented that HNF4 and CBP/p300 form a transcriptionally active complex (36), we verified whether in our experimental conditions this complex was sufficient to achieve the strong cooperation.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	109	 This question was addressed by the use of human HNF1 promoter containing a HNF4 response element but lacking a HNF1 binding site.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Using the same p300/HNF4 expression vector amounts used in Figure 3A and B, cotransfection of p300 failed to strongly enhance the HNF4-mediated activation of transcription (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	111	 It appears therefore that the strong activation of transcription observed in Figure 3A and B requires a ternary complex including HNF1, HNF4 and p300.

0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Using GST pull-down assays, we mapped more precisely the amino-terminal sequence of p300 involved in interaction with full-length HNF1 between residues 340 and 528 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	128	 We also confirmed that full-length HNF1 interacts with the carboxy-terminal region of p300 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	129	 We have previously shown the ability of HNF4 to interact with the amino-terminal domain of p300 (33).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	130	 HNF4 also interacted with the p300 carboxy-terminal region as shown in Figure 4C.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The presence of multiple interaction surfaces between these proteins led us to analyse the effect of HNF4 on the recruitment of the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of p300 to HNF1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The strategy consisted of determining whether HNF4 affects the cooperation between HNF1 and the amino- or carboxy-terminal fragments of p300 fused to the VP16 activation domain named Np300-VP16 and Cp300-VP16, respectively (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Expression of the VP16 activation domain affected neither the basal activity of the promoter nor its activity in the presence of expression vectors for HNF1 alone or together with HNF4 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Expression of Np300-VP16 failed to affect the basal activity of the promoter and the HNF1-mediated activation of this promoter (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Similar results were obtained with expression of Cp300-VP16 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Conversely, in the presence of both HNF1 and HNF4, Np300-VP16 and Cp300-VP16 markedly enhanced the promoter activity (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	137	 These results indicate that, in a cellular context, p300 recruitment by the HNF1 to HNF4 complex can be mediated through both its amino- and carboxy-terminal regions and reinforce data obtained in Figure 3 suggesting that HNF4 improves p300 recruitment to a promoter containing a HNF1 binding site (Fig.

0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The cross-talk involves both expression activation, through binding to promoters (solid lines), and modulation of the transcriptional potential, through protein to protein interactions (dotted lines), of the other HNF transcription factor.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	159	  Interplays between two transcription factors in both activation and repression of transcription have already been documented.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Indeed, cross-talk between HNF6 and HNF3ss, two other liver-enriched transcription factors, also results in opposite effects on the activities of these proteins (38).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	161	Despite their efficient interaction, HNF4 and HNF1 lacking its activation function (HNF1-AD) were unable to cooperate.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Such a behaviour is reminiscent of that of CBP and P/CAF with HNF1 (1 to 280) (21).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Only the simultaneous overexpression of CBP and P/CAF together with that of the truncated HNF1 could activate transcription (21).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	164	 This points to a critical role for the HNF1 activation domain, which could be the recruitment of other required coactivators and/or stabilization of the transcriptional complex recruited by HNF1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	165	Our results indicate that the HNF4 AF2 is involved in interaction with HNF1, but also that other regions of the HNF4 LBD are required for full interaction between these proteins.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Ktistaki and Talianidis previously stated that the HNF4 AF2 is sufficient for interaction with HNF1 (9).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The discrepancy between their conclusion and our results is likely explained by the fact that these authors used deletion of a fragment (residues 337 to 368), which includes not only the AF2 but also part of the large helix H10 to H11, the integrity of which has meanwhile been shown to be crucial for the protein conformation (32).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	168	 We observed that two-point mutations in the HNF4 LBD, A223F and E276Q, significantly decreased interaction and cooperation with HNF1 thus demonstrating that the integrity of the HNF4 LBD is required for the synergy with HNF1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	169	The similarity of phenotypes exhibited by diabetic patients carrying MODY1 and MODY3 mutations has been ascribed to the mutual control of transcription of HNF1 and HNF4.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The ability of HNF4 to serve as an HNF1 coactivator could provide an additional explanation to the closely related phenotypes of these MODY forms of diabetes.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Impairment of interaction and of enhancement of HNF1 transcriptional activity by the HNF4 E276Q mutation may be physiologically relevant since this mutation is correlated with MODY1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Unfortunately, the low transfection efficiency and the presence of large amounts of endogenous HNF4 in pancreatic ss-cells prevented us from analysing the effects of this mutation on the synergy between HNF4 and HNF1 in these cells.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	173	Our results support a model that involves the combined action of HNF4 and the coactivator p300 to achieve the highest rate of transcription mediated by HNF1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Our results also strongly suggest that HNF4 improves p300 recruitment.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	175	 The synergy between HNF4 and p300 may be mediated in two ways.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The first involves simultaneous interactions of HNF4 and p300 with HNF1 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	177	 In this case, HNF4 could indirectly improve HNF1 to p300 interaction through induction of a HNF1 conformational change.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Such a mechanism is reminiscent of that of the CBP-mediated improvement of the interaction between HNF1 and P/CAF (21).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Similarly, upon docking to PPAR, PGC-1 undergoes a conformational change that permits binding of SRC-1 and p300 (39).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The second involves docking of p300 by HNF4, which is bound to HNF1 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	181	 The recruitment of p300 to the HNF1 to HNF4 complex could be mediated by its amino- and/or carboxy-terminal regions, which contain the C/H1 and C/H3 domains, respectively.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	182	 These domains are known to be involved in protein to protein interactions (40).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The presence of multiple interaction surfaces in HNF1, HNF4 and p300 most probably facilitates formation of a ternary complex formed with these proteins (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	184	 The remaining synergy between HNF1 and HNF4 after mutations in the HNF4 AF2 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	185	 3) may be accounted for by the ability of p300 to interact and activate the HNF4 AF1 (33,41) and by the fact that the two above mentioned mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	186	In conclusion, our results highlight a new way by which HNF4 can regulate gene expression.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	187	 HNF4 not only directly binds to promoters but also, through interaction with other transcription factors already bound to DNA, can facilitate coactivator recruitment to further enhance transcription.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Recently, it has been shown that HNF4 also serves as coactivator for Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding protein-2 (42).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Furthermore, our results yield insights into a higher complexity of the transcriptional network and on the primordial relationship between HNF1 and HNF4 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	190	 In the regulatory loop between HNF1 and HNF4, HNF4 can activate both HNF1 expression and transcriptional activity.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	191	 In contrast to these additive processes, the negative effect of HNF1 on HNF4 transcriptional activity can attenuate the HNF1-mediated activation of expression.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	192	 These regulatory feedback mechanisms will have to be taken into account considering that HNF1 and HNF4 are involved in a large diversity of pathways controlling function of multiple organs, notably liver and endocrine pancreas.

0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	3	 In contrast with the steroid receptor homodimers, orphan receptor homodimers can bind to both palindromic and DR-response elements.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In particular, the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) binds as a homodimer to DR1 and is a strong constitutive transcriptional activator (11).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In contrast with HNF4, homodimers of the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors (COUP-TFs) such as EAR2, EAR3, and ARP1 are potent dominant repressors of both basal transcription and transactivation by several receptors, including RXR, RAR, VDR, and TR (12).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Repression of these pathways by COUP-TF is believed to be accomplished in part by direct competitive binding and by the presence of a strong carboxy-terminal repressor domain (13).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Interestingly, COUP-TF has an ability to heterodimerize with RXR, thereby titrating RXR into a transcriptionally inactive complex (14).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	8	A dimerization interface has previously been identified within the DNA binding domains (DBDs) of RXRs, RARs, VDR, and TRs that selectively promotes DNA binding to cognate direct repeat HREs (15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	9	 An additional dimerization interface that mediates cooperative binding to DNA, referred to as the I-box, has recently been mapped to a 40-amino acid region within the carboxy-terminal ligand binding domains (LBDs) of RAR, TR, COUP-TF, and RXR (21).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In contrast to the interface within the DBDs, this dimerization motif promotes cooperative binding with similar efficiency to all three classes of repeats, DR, IR, and ER.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The two dimerization domains appear to work in sequence and led to a two-step hypothesis for binding of heterodimers to DNA (2, 21).

0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, formation of a second dimer interface within the DBD restricts receptors to bind to DRs.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	14	A dimerization interface referred to as the I-box has recently been mapped to a 40-amino acid region within the carboxy-terminal LBDs of RAR, TR, COUP, and RXR (21).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The I-box sequences are moderately conserved among a subset of nuclear receptors including the homodimerizing HNF4, leading us to test whether the HNF4 I-box region plays a similar role in the homodimeric interactions.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	16	 To this end, we constructed a series of chimeras between HNF4 and RXR.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	17	 PCR was used to construct B42/HNF, a chimeric protein consisting of the B42 transactivation domain fused to the entire hinge and LBDs (D, E and F, amino acids 106 to 455) of the rat HNF4 (Fig.

0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Furthermore, coexpression of B42/H/X-338/429 or B42/X-HHH led to approximately 4- and 7-fold enhancements of the transcriptional activity of LexA/HNF4, respectively.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In contrast, the RXR I-box could not substitute the HNF4 I-box for the homodimeric interactions, as shown by inabilities of B42/H/X-298/389, B42/H-XXX, and B42/X/H-428/339 to enhance the transcriptional activity of LexA/HNF4.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These results demonstrate that the HNF4 I-box is indeed a sufficient and transferable interaction interface for the homodimeric interactions.

0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	39	 In these interactions, LexA/RAR, which includes a full-length RAR in contrast to LexA/TR and other LexA chimeras consisting of only LBDs, shows higher ss-Gal activities than LexA/TR, probably due to the AF1 activation domain in the RAR A/B domains (25).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Since LexA/TR and LexA/RAR show similar basal activities in yeast, this difference results in higher fold-activations with LexA/RAR than LexA/TR.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	41	 For instance, coexpression of B42/RXR conferred approximately 44-fold activation to LexA/RAR and approximately 11-fold activation to LexA/TR (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	42	 It is noteworthy that incorporation of only the RXR I-box sequences conferred to the resulting chimera the ability to heterodimerize with RAR and TR (Fig.

0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	70	 First, none of the chimeric receptors was able to enhance the constitutive transcriptional activities of the LexA/HNF4, demonstrating that substitution of any of these HNF4 subregions with that of the RXR I-box blocked homodimerization.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	71	 This suggests that important residues for the homodimeric interactions are present throughout the entire HNF4 I-box.

0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	138	 from homodimerization to heterodimerization).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	139	 The change of specificity in dimerization was achieved with at least three mutations incorporated, as shown by AR-K, which weakly interacts with LexA/RAR, but not with LexA/HNF (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Similarly, all the quadruple mutants changed specificity in dimerization (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	141	 5B; compare results with LexA/HNF4 and LexA/RAR).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	142	 It is also noteworthy that the effects of substitutions with the corresponding RXR sequences on the heterodimerizing potential of the resulting HNF4 chimeras are largely accumulative: i.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	143	 A326, R331, AR, AR-K, AR-A, AR-R, and AR-AR show relatively weak fold-activations with LexA/RAR (3- to 7-fold, as shown in Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	144	 5B), while the quadruple mutants AR-KR and AR-KA, as well as the quintuple mutant B42/H-HHX (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	145	 3B), which incorporates all the five RXR amino acids of the 11-amino acid subregion, showed much stronger fold activations with LexA/RAR (23-, 21-, and 43-fold activations, respectively).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Accordingly, identity seems to be determined in the context of the overall structures in relation to neighboring residues, rather than solely by nature of the two residues.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	147	 In addition, it will be interesting to test effects of the identified mutations in the context of full-length receptors.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	148	In conclusion, we have identified an 11-amino acid subregion of the RXR I-box as a critical domain for the heterodimeric interactions and specifically identified two residues in this subregion as determinants of heterodimerization.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Recently, we introduced random mutations into these two residues of RXR in an effort to make mutant RXR more selective in the process of heterodimerization.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Consistent with the importance of these residues in heterodimerization, we were indeed able to find a series of mutant RXRs with significantly altered specificity (S.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	151	 To understand in detail how these two residues fit into the overall structure of the I-box in each nuclear receptor and how they direct specificity in dimerization, more mutational studies as well as more structural information will be required.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	3	The cholesterol 7-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A) is transcriptionally regulated by a number of factors, including hormones, bile acids, and diurnal rhythm.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Previous studies have identified a region from nucleotides (nt) 74 to 55 of the rat CYP7A promoter that enhanced bile acid repression of the SV40 early promoter, as assayed with a luciferase reporter gene in transiently transfected HepG2 cells.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The rat CYP7A promoter/reporter activity was strongly stimulated by cotransfection with an expression plasmid encoding the nuclear hormone receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) in a dose-dependent manner.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Site-directed mutagenesis in the region of nt 74 to 55 altered this stimulation.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Recombinant COUP-TFII expressed in HepG2 or COS-1 cells were found to bind to nt 74 55 and nt 149 128 probes by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and by supershifting the corresponding band with COUP-TFII-specific antibodies.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The region of nt 176 117 was previously mapped as a retinoic acid response region and was found to bind retinoid X receptor (RXR).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	9	 EMSA supershift assays of wild-type and mutant oligomers using antibody against RXR revealed that the sequences between nt 145 and 134 were important for RXR binding.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We conclude that COUP-TFII stimulates the transcriptional activity of the rat CYP7A promoter by binding to the sequences between nt 74 to 54 and nt 149 to 128.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	11	 RXR may stimulate CYP7A gene transcription by binding to a direct repeat of the hormone response element separated by one nucleotide located at nt 146 134.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	13	17) catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in a pathway that converts cholesterol to bile acids.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The catabolism of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver is the main mechanism for elimination of cholesterol from the body and thus plays an important role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (1).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The gene CYP7A is transcriptionally regulated by a number of factors, including bile acids, cholesterol, hormones, and circadian rhythm (2-6).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	16	The CYP7A promoter structure is typical of a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II promoter in that, upstream of the TATA box, there are several cis-acting elements that regulate the transcriptional activity of this promoter (7-9).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Transient transfection assay of chimeric CYP7A promoter/luciferase constructs in HepG2 cells revealed that the region from nt 416 to +32 of the rat CYP7A gene contained the promoter and regulatory domains conferring the activation of transcription by dexamethasone and retinoic acid and suppression by bile acids, phorbol esters, and insulin (2, 3, 9, 10).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	18	 We have mapped two footprints that are protected from DNase I digestion using rat liver nuclear extracts (11).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Footprint (Fp)1 A is located between nt 81 and 35, and FpB is located between nt 148 and 129.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Nucleotide sequences in these two regions are highly conserved among homologous CYP7A genes of different species.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These footprints contain liver-enriched transcription factors binding sites and hormone response elements.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	22	 A putative bile acid response element (BARE) was mapped to the FpA region, which lead us to propose that a bile acid responsive nuclear receptor may be mediating bile acid response (11).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	23	The molecular mechanism of bile acid repression is still unknown.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Determining what factors interact with these BARE sequences is a first step in elucidating the nature of the bile acid response.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	25	 A nuclear protein factor, which was found to bind a repeated sequence -65TCAAGTTCAAG-54 was named direct repeat binding protein (DRBP).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Binding of DRBP to BARE was diminished when liver nuclear extract prepared from rats fed deoxycholate was used in EMSA (11).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The sequence from nt 73 to 57 contains an imperfect direct repeat of the hormone response element (HRE, AGGTCA) separated by four nucleotides (DR4).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	28	 According to the 3-4-5 rule for the binding specificity of the steroid/thyroid hormone family of transcription factors (12), a DR4 would be predicted to act as a thyroid hormone response element, hence "7TRE" as the tentative name for this DR4 sequence (11).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	29	 However, CYP7A promoter constructs containing these sequences did not respond to thyroid hormones in HepG2 cells (2).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	30	 A number of nuclear factors have affinity for DR4 sequences, including TR, XONR, and LXR that form heterodimers with RXR (13, 14).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	31	 COUP-TFII (or ARP-1) of orphan nuclear receptor family with promiscuous binding specificities also bind a DR4 sequence (15, 16).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	32	 COUP-TFs are believed to influence developmental changes, which is supported by the report that the COUP-TFII promoter responds to differentiation signal, retinoic acid (17).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Recently, we have mapped a complex retinoic acid response region located between 176 and 117 of the rat CYP7A promoter (10).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	34	Using transient transfection assay of CYP7A promoter/reporter activity in HepG2 cells, we have screened a number of known steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptors for their effects on gene transcription.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	35	 COUP-TFII produced one of the strongest effects on transcription.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Here, we provide evidence that orphan receptor COUP-TFII activates transcription of rat CYP7A by binding to nt 74 to 54 and to nt 149 to 128 and that an RXR homodimer may bind to a DR1 motif between 146 to 134.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In the first group, the wild-type promoter fragments (p-416/+32 and p-200/+32) showed the greatest stimulation of transcriptional activity, and the effect was positive at all points of the curve (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The second group, which includes p-416LSM74/71, p-416LSM70/66, p-41674/65, p-416LSM59/54, p-41674/54, and p20074/54 displayed considerably flatter dose-response curves (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	148	 The mutations in this group destroyed one or both of the putative HRE half-sites, AGGTCA, either by completely deleting the sequence (p-41674/65, p-41674/54, and p20074/54) or by replacing the sequence with an SpeI restriction site while preserving the relative spacing of sequences on either side of the mutation (p-416LSM74/71, p-416LSM70/66, and p-416LSM59/54) (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Reporter plasmids with both HRE half-sites deleted (p-41674/54 and p20074/54) retained significant stimulation by COUP-TFII (approximately 3-4 fold), suggesting there may be additional COUP-TFII sites elsewhere in the promoter.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	156	 With one exception, the basal promoter activity also fell into three groups, corresponding with the COUP-TFII responsiveness of the reporter plasmid (Fig.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The diffuse nature of these bands was attributed to the low abundance of the nuclear factors.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The increased band shift with COS-1 extracts was attributed to the higher activity of the MT2 promoter of pTF3A, which drives transcription of the recombinant gene encoding COUP-TFII, in COS-1 cells relative to HepG2 cells.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	173	 This presumably results in higher levels of expression of recombinant COUP-TFII in this cell line.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Overexpression of COUP-TFII was associated with a reduction in DRBP binding, even in probes unable to be shifted by COUP-TFII (nt 72/59 and 65/54).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	175	 The reduction in DRBP binding may be attributed to the reduced proportion of DRBP in the given mass of protein in COS-1 nuclear extracts overexpressed with recombinant COUP-TFII.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Alternatively, if COUP-TFII interacts with DRBP in solution, the overexpressed COUP-TFII may be sequestering the DRBP and forms larger complexes with the probe nt 74/53.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	178	 It is apparent that COUP-TFII interacts with the DR4 of nt 74 to 53 and DRBP interacts with AGTTCAAG sequence (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	179	To further confirm that COUP-TFII binds to this sequence, antiserum raised against COUP-TF was added to an EMSA using the nt 74 to 55 oligomer as a probe of nuclear extract from HepG2 cells.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The band that increased in intensity when shifted by nuclear extracts from HepG2 overexpressing COUP-TFII was supershifted by the anti-COUP-TF antibody (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	181	 3), indicating that COUP-TFII was interacting directly with the region.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Extracts prepared from cells overexpressing recombinant C/EBP, LAP, HNF4, or HNF3 did not produce any changes in the band-shift pattern (data not shown), and antiserum directed against C/EBP (potential binding site at nt 52 to 41) and c-erbA (a homologue of the thyroid receptor that is regulated by phosphorylation events) did not change the gel shift pattern (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Antibody against RAR and RXR did not supershift the nt 74 to 53 probe.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	184	 However, when performed with extracts prepared from HepG2 cells treated with all trans-retinoic acid, the ligand for RAR, the nt 74 to 54 probe was weakly supershifted with anti-RXR (data not shown).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	185	 DRBP, the major nuclear factor that binds to the sequence was not affected by the antibody, indicating that the proteins responsible for that band are distinct from COUP-TFII and RXR.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	186	 These results confirm that the COUP-TFII binds to DR4 motif, which does not bind thyroid hormone receptor.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	187	 C/EBP, LAP, HNF4, and HNF3 do not bind to this region of CYP7A promoter.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	189	The probe nt 149 to 128 shifted one band in HepG2 nuclear extracts.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Antibody against COUP-TFII supershifted the oligomer and changed the pattern of bands as if a complex was disrupted (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The amount of probe supershifted was not increased with increasing amounts of antibody, indicating that antibody was in excess.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Antibody against RXR supershifted a band in HepG2 nuclear extract treated with retinoic acid.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	193	 The antibody directed against RAR did not supershift the probe even with extract prepared from HepG2 cells treated with all trans-retinoic acid.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Retinoic acid treatment may have increased the expression of endogenous RXR and showed the supershift with anti-RXR.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	195	Once it had been determined that the antibody specific for RXR supershifted the nt 149 to 128 probe, nucleotides important for the binding of RXR were determined by EMSA with mutant oligonucleotides and the antibody against RXR.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized in which three bases were changed by transversions.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Trinucleotide mutations in nt 145 to 134 completely abolished or reduced the supershift by antibody against RXR (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Mutations in nt 133/131 did not have any effect on supershift by antibody against RXR.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	199	 These results indicate that RXR was interacting with the DR1 motif located from nt 146 to 134.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	200	Cotransfection assays of COUP-TFII expression plasmid with wild-type and mutant CYP7A proximal promoter constructs and EMSA results indicate that COUP-TFII interacts with nt 74 to 53 and nt 149 to 128 of the rat CYP7A promoter.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The region of nt 146 to 134 was shown by EMSA to bind RXR and contains HRE half-sites separated by one nucleotide (DR1), the preferred binding site for RXR homodimer (14).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The pattern of response of the mutants in nt 74 to 54 suggested that the nt 74 to 54 was the element with the strongest potential for COUP-TF activation of transcription.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	203	 The deletion of the sequences from nt 74 to 54 results in the increase of transcriptional activity of CYP7A promoter/reporter plasmids.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	204	 This sequence was previously found to mediate the bile acid response and to interact with DRBP, whose binding was sensitive to deoxycholate feeding in rats.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	205	 6 is a model which shows the binding sites for these transcription factors on the rat CYP7A proximal promoter.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Interactions of transactivators COUP-TFII and RXR with DRBP and their competition for binding to these bile acid response elements may regulate the CYP7A gene transcription by bile acids and hormones.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The CCAAT enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP and C/EBP or LAP) (21) consensus binding site flank the COUP-TFII binding site at nt 74 to 54.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The C/EBP family of transcription factors are temporally regulated and are thus important developmental regulators of gene expression.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	209	 COUP-TFII may recruit C/EBP on to the apolipoprotein A1 promoter (22).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The DBP B-site, which also is the LAP binding site, was located in the nt 149 to 118 region (23).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	211	 However, antibody directed against C/EBP and LAP did not supershift the nt 149/118 probe.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	212	 This is consistent with the lack of effect of these transcription factors on CYP7A promoter activity we observed.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	213	 The juxtaposition of the COUP-TF and C/EBP binding sites at nt 74/54 and nt 149/118 may prevent the weak binding of these factors.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	217	In light of the well-characterized negative effect of COUP-TFII on gene promoters, removing a COUP-TFII binding site in CYP7A promoter may explain the much higher activity of the deletion mutants (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	218	 However, several recent reports support our finding that COUP-TFII also can function as a transactivator (24-27).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	219	 COUP-TFII binds as a stable homodimer to many variations of GGTCA sequences in direct repeats and interferes with vitamin D3, thyroid hormone, and retinoic acid receptors by competing for the AGGTCA sites, the cognate sequences for the steroid/thyroid hormone receptors (15).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	220	 However, if the negative effect of COUP-TFII is due to interfering with a positive factor, over-expression of COUP-TFII should repress the transcriptional activity of the CYP7A promoter.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	221	 COUP-TFII activated transcription of the CYP7A promoter at all COUP-TFII expression plasmid to reporter plasmid ratios tried.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The deletion of the strong proximal COUP-TFII site at nt 74 to 55 may allow enhancers in the promoter to interact more readily with the transcriptional machinery and resulting in higher transcriptional activity.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	223	 COUP-TFII has been reported to interact with TFIIB (28) and to affect the transcriptional activity by interacting with other transcription factors.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	224	 For example, COUP-TFII is required for activation of the apolipoprotein A1 promoter by RXR (22).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	225	 As the COUP-TFII and RXR both recognized the nt 149 to 128 probe, it is possible that COUP-TFII may interact with RXR.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	226	 The heterodimer of COUP-TFII and RXR is known to bind a DR1 motif and transrepress gene transcription (13).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	227	Despite the finding that COUP-TF binds to a region responsive to bile acid repression, the role of COUP-TFII in the bile acid regulation of CYP7A is not clear and requires further study.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The region from nt 65 to 54 can confer the bile acid response to SV40 promoter, but the probe does not bind COUP-TFII in vitro (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	229	 However, the DRBP and COUP-TFII apparently share binding sequence, the 3 COUP-TFII half-site overlaps with the DRBP binding site (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	230	 COUP-TF clearly influences cholesterol metabolism, in that this transcription factor has previously been shown to affect the transcription of the promoters for apolipoprotein AI (16), apolipoprotein AII, apolipoprotein B (29), apolipoprotein CIII (29, 30) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene (27).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	231	The physiological role of the sequences from nt 74 to 54 may be to restrain CYP7A expression.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	232	 This down-regulation may be necessary because of the cytotoxicity of bile acids and the need to preserve cholesterol for synthesis of steroid hormones and membrane components.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The exact interactions of the factors involved has yet to be defined; however, the data are consistent with a model in which COUP-TFII, RXR, and DRBP interact with and bind to a negative element in the region between nt 74 and 54 and a positive element from nt 149 to 118 (10) and lead to the regulation of the CYP7A gene transcription in response to signals from bile acids and hormones.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	234	 This work contributes to the increasing body of evidence indicating COUP-TF has a prominent role in transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism and that factor binding to the nt 74 to 54 and nt 149 to 128 regions are important determinants of CYP7A transcription.

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	3	Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multifunctional cytokine that controls the growth and differentiation of various tissues.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Previously, we described the existence of a negative cis-acting regulatory element(s) within the 1- to 0.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	5	7-kilobase pair (kb) portion of the 5-flanking region of the mouse HGF promoter.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In the present study, we show that the repressor element is located at position 872 to 860 base pairs and comprises an imperfect estrogen-responsive element 5-AGGTCAGAAAGACCA-3.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We demonstrate that chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), a nuclear orphan receptor belonging to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, through binding to this site effectively silences the transcriptional activity of the HGF promoter.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We show that estrogen receptor, on the other hand, relieves the repressive action of COUP-TF, resulting in the induction of the HGF promoter.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Using mice transgenic for either 2.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	10	7 kb of the HGF promoter region linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, we found that injection of estradiol stimulates HGF promoter activity in tissues such as the mammary gland and ovary of mice harboring 2.

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Potential involvement of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors in the regulation of HGF gene expression is also discussed.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	13	Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)1 was originally identified as the major mitogenic component of serum and platelets for normal adult rat hepatocytes (1, 2).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Further investigations revealed that HGF is a multifunctional cytokine with a broad range of target cells (3, 4).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	15	 HGF elicits its biological effects through binding to and activating a specific transmembrane tyrosine kinase (4-6) known as Met (HGF receptor) (7).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	16	 HGF gene expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level and is restricted to stromal cells such as fibroblasts, macrophages, leukocytes, and endothelial cells in various tissues.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Numerous studies have shown that this growth factor is involved in the growth and regeneration of several organs (8-10).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In response to tissue loss, such as in the case of partial hepatectomy or hepatotoxin injury, the level of HGF mRNA dramatically increases in the liver as well as in other organs such as the lung and spleen (9, 10).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	19	 HGF mRNA also increases in the remaining kidney or lung after unilateral nephrectomy or pneumonectomy, respectively (9, 10).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Recent investigations in transgenic mice homozygous for a null mutation in the HGF gene (knock-out mice) have proved that HGF is essential for the development of various tissues such as liver, muscle, and placenta (11, 12).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	21	HGF expression is modulated by several cytokines and hormones.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	22	 For example, it has been shown that in MRC-5 fibroblasts and HL-60 cells HGF expression is down-regulated by transforming growth factor 1 and dexamethasone or by coculture with epithelial cells (13-15).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In contrast, phorbol esters, interleukin-1, or tumor necrosis factor  increase HGF mRNA level (16-19).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Overexpression of HGF mRNA in various neoplastic tissues has also been reported.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	25	 To understand the transcriptional regulation of HGF, the sequences of the human, rat, and mouse HGF gene promoters have been determined and the major transcriptional start sites have been mapped (20-23).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Several potential regulatory sites including NF-IL6 (also known as C/EBP) were identified in the 5-flanking region of the mouse HGF promoter by our laboratory (22) as well as by others (20-24).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	27	 We reported the identification and partial characterization of a transcriptional repressor in the promoter of the mouse HGF gene (25).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We also localized a negative regulatory region in the 5-flanking region of the mouse HGF promoter residing at position 1 to 0.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In the current study, we show that COUP-TF binds to an imperfect estrogen response element (ERE) in this region and represses HGF promoter activity.

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Our present data reveal that the molecular mechanism by which estradiol stimulates the HGF promoter is through the counteraction by ER of COUP-TF, which directly down-regulates the mouse HGF promoter.

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	224	Our previous studies have shown that a negative regulatory element is located within 964 to 699 of the 5-flanking region of the mouse HGF gene (22).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	225	 In this region, an estrogen response element (HERE1) was identified that binds to ER and is responsible for the estradiol stimulation of the mouse HGF promoter in RL95-2 cells co-transfected with an ER expression vector (32).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	226	 We now show that this same element binds with high affinity to the nuclear orphan receptor COUP-TF, which belongs to the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily, and silences the activity of the HGF promoter.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	227	 We demonstrate that the estrogen receptor competes with COUP-TF for binding to this site, thereby relieving the repressive action of COUP-TF.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	228	There are two imperfect EREs found in the mouse HGF promoter region that we have called HERE1 and HERE2 (22, 32).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	229	 HERE1 is localized in the 5-flanking region and HERE2 is in the first intron of the HGF gene.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	230	 By using gel mobility band shift and supershift assays, we demonstrated that HERE1 is similar to the ERE found in the vitellogenin (vit) gene (37) and that it binds not only to ER but also to COUP-TF (Fig.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Co-transfection of ER or COUP-TF expression vectors in NIH3T3 cells revealed that HERE1 confers the repressive function of COUP-TF to the heterologous SV40 promoter and that not only did ER overcome the suppression of COUP-TF but it also stimulated the SV40 promoter (Fig.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	232	 In the homologous mouse HGF promoter, ER only counteracted the negative effects of COUP-TF (Fig.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	233	The molecular mechanisms of COUP-TF-mediated transcriptional repression are partially understood.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	234	 COUP-TF acts via several different mechanisms to inhibit target gene transcription including competition with other nuclear receptors for the occupancy of DNA binding sites, active repression of basal transcription, active repression of transactivator-dependent transcription, quenching of transactivator-dependent transcription, transrepression of activated transcription, and titration of the common coregulator RXR (31, 38).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Our data shown here reveal that COUP-TF may down-regulate the mouse HGF promoter by active repression of basal transcription because HERE1 suppresses the basal SV40 promoter and that ER may activate HGF transcriptional activity by replacing COUP-TF and relieving the promoter from repression (Fig.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	236	 COUP-TF belongs to the orphan (thus far, no ligand has been found that can bind and directly regulate the activity of this factor) nuclear receptor family and resembles the thyroid hormone receptor/steroid hormone receptor superfamily (31, 36).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	237	 The mode by which it represses its target gene involves the binding of COUP-TF to the AGGTCA motif arranged in various configurations (i.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	238	 direct repeats (DR) or inverted repeats (IR) with different numbers of spacers ranging from 0 to 8 nucleotides) (31).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Interestingly, the AGGTCA half-site depending on its configuration forms the response elements for other nuclear receptors such as the estrogen receptor (which binds to IR3), thyroid hormone receptor (which binds to IR0 or DR4), retinoid receptors (RAR, which binds to IR0 and DR2, and RXR, which binds to DR5 and DR1), vitamin D receptor (which binds to DR3), HNF4, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (31).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	240	 It is believed that COUP-TF directly competes with these receptors for binding to the AGGTCA sequence and thus inhibits their transactivating functions.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Suppression by COUP-TF is also achieved in part through heterodimerization of COUP-TF with RXR (which is the essential transactivating partner for vitamin D3 receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, and RAR), thereby titrating RXR to a transcriptionally inactive complex (31, 38).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	242	 It is tempting to speculate that in addition to ER other members of the nuclear receptor family mentioned above may bind to the COUP-TF binding site in the HGF promoter HERE1 and thus activate HGF transcription in a tissue-specific manner.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	243	 The COUP-TF site in the HGF promoter, however, is composed of an estrogen response element (IR3) and apparently binds only to the estrogen receptor.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	244	Previous observations in our laboratory showed that administration of 17-estradiol to immature female mice caused a significant induction of HGF mRNA in the ovaries (32).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The tissue- and cell type-specific expression of the mouse HGF gene by estrogen may be due to different amounts of hormone receptors in these tissues, as shown by other studies (37).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Our present studies show that high expression of estrogen receptor in NIH3T3 cells is sufficient to counteract the suppression of COUP-TF on the mouse HGF promoter (Fig.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	247	 HGF promoter activity or lack thereof in transgenic mice also supports this hypothesis because estradiol stimulated the HGF promoter in mice carrying the 2.

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	250	 The factors that are known to activate HGF expression include cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor  and polypeptide growth factors such as epidermal growth factor.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	251	 These agents do not exert their gene-regulatory function directly through the AGGTCA motif, the DNA binding site for COUP-TF.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Although the molecular mechanisms by which these agents induce their target genes are not fully understood, it is well established that they utilize members of the AP1, C/EBP, nuclear factor B (NFKB), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Indeed, in our previous report (22) we demonstrated that several NF-IL6 (C/EBP) response elements exist in the 5-flanking region of the HGF promoter region and that IL-6 induces HGF promoter activity in a stromal (fibroblast) cell line stably transfected with an HGF-CAT chimeric construct.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	254	 In our very recent investigations using gel shift, supershift, and CAT assays, we have found that functional C/EBP binding sites exist in the HGF promoter.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	255	 We also found that co-transfection of expression vectors encoding C/EBP or C/EBP with HGF-CAT vectors dramatically (more than 20-fold) stimulates the transcriptional activity of various HGF-CAT promoter constructs (even those constructs that do not contain COUP-TF binding sites, thus indicating that promoter activation is not due to interference with COUP-TF binding).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	256	3 These observations provide an explanation for how the HGF promoter is released from repression exerted by negative acting factors such as COUP-TF.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	257	 The C/EBP family of transcription factors is known to consist of regulators of important cellular functions ranging from metabolism to cell growth to differentiation.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	258	The physiological significance of the transcriptional regulation of the HGF gene by ER and COUP-TF also remains to be elucidated.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Nevertheless, it has been shown that both HGF and COUP-TF play an important role during embryonic development.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	260	 COUP-TFs are differentially expressed in a restricted manner during organogenesis (40).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Both COUP-TF I and COUP-TF II genes are essential since COUP-TF I mutants die prenatally and COUP-TF II mutants die in utero (41).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Additionally, HGF is believed to be one of the major mediators of stromal-epithelial interactions controlling growth and morphogenesis of various tissues such as breast (39).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Studies on the embryological development of such tissues have revealed that steroid hormone-induced ductal morphogenesis and growth is accomplished via the interactions between the stromal and epithelial compartments of these tissues (34).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Therefore, the functions of COUP-TF and ER during development may be mediated in part by their ability to regulate HGF gene expression.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Our data shown here shed light on the significant interplay among transcription factors such as ER, COUP-TF, and C/EBP and polypeptide growth factors such as HGF.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	4	Received June 18, 2003; Revised August 25, 2003;.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	5	Like other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, HNF4 has a modular structure consisting of functional domains (7).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Two of these domains, the DNA binding domain (DBD) and the ligand binding domain (LBD) are involved in dimerisation of HNF4, which behaves as a homodimer (8).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Dimerisation via the DBD is involved in HNF4 dimerisation on DNA, whereas dimerisation via the LBD is essential for dimerisation in solution and strongly stabilises the HNF4 to DNA complex (9,10).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The LBD is also involved in other functions, including transcriptional activation and interaction with transcriptional partners.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Both domains are well conserved in HNF4 (11).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Crystal structures of the LBDs of HNF4 and HNF4 have recently been resolved (12,13).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These LBDs adopt the canonical fold of -helices (10 helices numbered H1 to H12 to follow the conventional nomenclature) and ss-sheets arranged as an antiparallel -helical  sandwich  in a three-layer structure shared with the LBD of other nuclear receptors (14).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The LBD structures of HNF4 and HNF4 are very similar and closely resemble that of RXR, another member of the nuclear receptor subfamily 2 (NR2).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Indeed, 194 core carbons of the LBD of HNF4 and RXR superimpose with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 1.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	14	26 A and 223 core carbons of the LBD of HNF4 and RXR superimpose with a r.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In these structures, the LBD dimerisation interface is made of residues in helices 7 (H7), 9 (H9) and 10 (H10), the major part of the interface being made up of H10.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	16	HNF4 and HNF4, which activate transcription in the absence of exogenous ligands, are considered to be constitutive transcriptional activators (1,11,13,15,16).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Their LBDs are tightly associated with endogenous fatty acids, which do not act as classical ligands but are likely required for the stability of the protein conformation (12,13).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	18	 HNF4 transcriptional activity can be enhanced by other transcription factors, including COUP-TF (17), Smad3 and Smad4 (18), or by coactivators, such as members of the p160 family (19,20), CBP/p300 (20 to 22) and PGC-1 (23).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The HNF4 transcriptional activity can also be repressed by negative transcriptional partners such as SHP (24), p53 (25) and SMRT (26).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	20	In the crystal structure of the RXR LBD, H7 adopts an unusual -helical geometry that forces the glutamic acid residue in position 352 to bulge outward from the H7 axis (27).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This structure gives rise to the formation of a series of intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds that improve RXR LBD homodimerisation (27).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In particular, residues E352 and R348 are directly involved in the dimerisation interface by forming charge-driven interactions.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The -helical conformation near E352 in the RXR homodimer and the resulting interactions were also observed in the PPAR/RXR LBD heterodimer (28).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Sequence alignment indicates that a glutamic acid residue and an arginyl residue are also encountered at the equivalent positions in human and rat HNF4 (E262 and R258).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Figure 1 shows that these residues are conserved in remote species such as Drosophila and in the Xenopus HNF4ss and are specifically encountered in members of the NR2 subfamily (27 to 29).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Interestingly, in the crystal structure of the HNF4 LBD, a bulge near E262 was also observed in H7 (12).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	27	 described this glutamate as a single residue E insert in H7 and hypothesised that it may play a crucial role in the function of nuclear receptors belonging to the NR2 subfamily, including HNF4 (27,28).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We investigated the role of the E262 and R258 amino acid residues in HNF4 function using biochemical and mutagenesis studies.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	35	 An aliquot of 150  microl of Ip buffer containing 3 mg of hydrated protein A to Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma) was added and samples were incubated under constant agitation for an additional 1 h.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	36	 After extensive washing of the beads with Ip buffer, bound proteins were resolved by SDS to PAGE.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	63	 As expected, HNF42 WT efficiently bound to both c-myc-HNF42 WT (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Conversely, all mutants failed to bind efficiently to c-myc-HNF42 WT (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Next, we analysed the effects of mutations on dimerisation of a given mutant with itself.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	66	 For these assays, we focused on mutants E262A and E262.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	67	 In co-immunoprecipitation assays, no dimer was detectable with either E262A or E262 (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	68	 This result was not due to a lower expression of mutated c-myc-HNF42 (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Impaired dimerisation of mutants was confirmed by pull-down experiments performed in increasingly stringent conditions.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	94	Mutations of residues E262 and R258 do not impair DNA binding Since HNF4 is known to bind DNA as a homodimer (8), we analysed the effect of E262 and R258 mutations on HNF42 DNA binding.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Surprisingly, none of the mutations altered HNF42 binding to the HNF4 response element of the HNF1 promoter (HNF1 site, Fig.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Results obtained with increasing amounts of labelled probe exclude that lack of detection of DNA binding impairment by E262A mutation was due to saturated binding (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Similar results were obtained with other mutants (data not shown).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Mutated and wild-type HNF4 yielded a retarded band of identical intensity and electrophoretic mobility.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	102	 More specifically, we did not observe a band of higher mobility corresponding to a HNF4 monomer bound to DNA as observed for the RAR monomer (15).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	103	 In addition, to rule out the possibility that mutants bound to DNA as two adjacent monomers, we performed EMSA with the HNF1 mt site containing one mutated half-site and obtained no binding of the mutants (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Thus, HNF4 mutants, like wild-type HNF4, bind DNA as homodimers.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	105	 To evidence possibly diminished interactions with DNA, we performed EMSA in less-favorable conditions.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	106	 First, we increased the ionic strength (300 versus 100 mM KCl in Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	107	 3A) in EMSA but found no difference in DNA binding between wild-type and mutated HNF4 (data not shown).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Second, we carried out competition experiments with COUP-TFII, which binds to several HNF4 response elements.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	109	 The rationale here was to check whether this nuclear receptor impinges on DNA binding of HNF42-E262A more efficiently than on wild-type HNF42.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	110	 In these assays, the truncated COUP-TFII AB was used to distinguish complexes formed with either HNF42 or COUP-TFII.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	111	 EMSA was performed on the CIIIB site since COUP-TFII does not bind to the HNF1 site (17,30).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	112	 COUP-TFII AB similarly competed for HNF42 WT and -E262A DNA binding (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Also, unlabelled DNA competed equally for DNA binding of both proteins (data not shown).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	114	 In addition, we observed that mutations did not alter binding to a direct repeat 2 (DR2), to which HNF4 binds less efficiently than to a DR1 (9) (data not shown).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	115	 It appears therefore that the E262 residue does not play a significant role in HNF42 DNA binding.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	130	 The I-box almost perfectly overlaps H9 and H10 that form the major portion of the dimer interface in RXR and HNF4 homodimers (12,13,27,36).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Mutagenesis studies also showed that the HNF4 I-box is an important interaction interface for homodimerisation in solution (37) and is likely involved in DNA binding (15).

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Until now, the role of the HNF4 I-box has been studied using multiple (double, triple or quadruple) mutations (15,37).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	134	 For example, the K300E-E327K HNF4 double mutant was used to show the involvement of the salt bridge between these residues in the exclusive homodimerisation of HNF4 (15).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	135	 For our comparative study, we chose a single mutation located in H10 E327M.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	136	 In co-immunoprecipitation assays with c-myc-HNF42 WT, we observed that the E327M mutation decreased HNF42 dimerisation in solution by 25% (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	137	 The extent of this decrease was similar to that observed for the R258M mutation (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	138	 A similar drop in HNF42 dimerisation in solution with E327M and R258M mutations was also observed in GST pull-down assays (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Note that the impairment of dimerisation by the E262 mutations was stronger, as observed in both co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The stronger effect of the E262A mutation on HNF42 dimerisation in solution was confirmed by a different co-immunoprecipitation assay, where unlabelled HNF42 WT, -R258M, -E262A or -E327M and the 455 antiserum raised against their common C-terminus were used to co-immunoprecipitate labelled HNF43, which contains a different C-terminus not recognised by this antiserum.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	141	 R258M, E262A and E327M mutations strongly impaired the ability of HNF42 to interact with HNF43 (Fig.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	166	 This phenomenon is likely due to the bivalency of antigen recognition by antibodies (15,32).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Conversely, when decreased DNA binding is not due to a loss of dimerisation, DNA binding is not recovered in the presence of antibodies, as observed for the D126Y and D126H HNF4 mutants (38).

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	206	 5F) exhibits a dominant-negative effect through its ability to dimerise with the wild-type protein (7).

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The rationale was that the dominant-negative mutant would exhibit a weaker repression on mutant HNF4, with impaired dimerisation, than on wild-type HNF4.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Deletion of the E262 residue also disrupted the functional cooperation between HNF42 and SRC-1a (data not shown).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	218	Like the substitution mutants in H7, several missense HNF4 mutants, including naturally occurring mutants associated with diabetes (6,30,38), also exhibit unaltered or slightly impaired transcriptional activities in transient transfection assays.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Failure to detect a subtle loss of HNF4 function in these assays where the protein is overexpressed does not exclude that these mutations may have greater consequences on HNF4 function when the protein is expressed at normal levels.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Interestingly, a significant effect of substitution mutants in H7 on HNF4 transcriptional activity could be detected by analysing the repression of this activity with an HNF4 mutant exhibiting a dominant-negative activity.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	221	 These results demonstrate the importance of E262 for HNF4 dimerisation in a cell context.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Moreover, it should be kept in mind that the activity of nuclear receptors can be repressed by proteins that prevent their dimerisation (43,44).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	223	 HNF4 is a target of AMP-activated protein kinase, which inhibits HNF4 activity by decreasing its dimerisation (45).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	224	 The ability of HNF4 to form a highly stable homodimer in solution (8) is likely crucial in this type of repressive mechanism that does not exclusively occur on DNA.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Other pathways that do not necessarily require DNA binding include cross-regulatory mechanisms in which nuclear receptors are frequently involved.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	226	 In these mechanisms, dimerisation can be of major importance (46).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Since HNF4 is known to interact with numerous other transcription factors, including Smad proteins (18), it likely participates in cross-regulatory pathways.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Therefore, involvement of H7 residues in dimerisation in solution may be crucial in HNF4 biological activities.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	229	Results obtained with the deletion mutant HNF4-E262 indicate that the E insert is required for HNF4 transcriptional activity and recruitment of transcriptional partners.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Note that, probably due in part to its impaired dimerisation, HNF4-E262 did not exhibit a dominant-negative activity.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	231	 None of the MODY1-associated HNF4 mutants can repress wild-type HNF4 activity (6).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Even single or double mutations in the AF-2 module, which is crucial for HNF4 transcriptional activity, do not result in a dominant-negative effect (J.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	233	Eeckhoute, unpublished results).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Interestingly, HNF4-D261, a mutant having a deletion of the neighbouring residue, exhibited an abolished transcriptional activity but an unaltered DNA binding (EMSA data not shown), a behaviour that is very similar to that of the E262 mutant.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	235	 These findings may be explained by the loss of the special conformation (the -helix) in H7, which was hypothesised to result from the presence of an additional residue, the  E insert  (28).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	236	 The D261 and E262 deletions most probably modify the orientation of the side chain of residues in H7.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Several residues in H7 point towards the HNF4 ligand binding pocket and probably participate in fatty acid binding, which is required for the stability and function of HNF4 and HNF4 (12,13).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	238	 The marked decrease in HNF4 transcriptional activity and recruitment of transcriptional partners caused by the E262 deletion may reflect the alteration in fatty acid binding secondary to the loss of the -helix conformation generated by this glutamate residue.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	239	From a mechanistic point of view, our results unravel distinct contributions of H7, H9 and H10 to HNF4 dimerisation and DNA binding.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	240	 H9 and H10 constitute the core of the LBD dimerisation interface of several non-steroid nuclear receptors (27,36,47,48).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	241	 This core is required for efficient DNA binding (35).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	242	 In HNF4, this core is also involved in dimerisation required for DNA binding, as evidenced using a double mutation in H9 and H10 (15).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	243	 We observed that a single mutation in H10, E327M, was sufficient to alter HNF4 dimerisation and DNA binding.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The role of H7 in nuclear receptors has been less extensively studied and only recent crystallographic data indicate that its contribution to dimerisation varies according to the receptor and, for RXR, with its homodimeric or heterodimeric state (47).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Concerning HNF4, our results clearly show that H7 has a crucial role in dimerisation in solution but does not contribute to the dimerisation activity required for DNA binding.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	246	In conclusion, our results demonstrate the key role of H7 in HNF4 dimerisation in solution and provide a new concept by which helices of the HNF4 LBD dimerisation interface contribute differently to the dimerisation required for DNA binding: whereas H9 and H10 are required for DNA binding, H7 is involved solely in dimerisation in solution.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Our data also show the key role of the E262 insert that causes a special conformation in H7 observed in both RXR and HNF4.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	248	 The key role of this glutamate is likely shared by other members of the NR2 subfamily, where it is specifically encountered, and most probably the E insert corresponds to a signature of this subfamily.

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	3	The transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4[alpha] (HNF4[alpha]) is a tissue specific transcription factor mainly expressed in the liver, kidney, intestine and the endocrine pancreas, but is also an essential regulator for early embryonic events.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Based on its protein structure HNF4[alpha] is classified as an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Comparing HNF4[alpha] transcription factors in the differentiated and dedifferentiated murine hepatocyte cell line MHSV-12 we identified in dedifferentiated cells the novel splice variant HNF4[alpha]7.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This variant is characterized by an alternative first exon and has a lower transactivation potential in transient transfection assays using HNF4 dependent reporter genes.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	7	 HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA and the corresponding protein are expressed in the undifferentiated pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cell line F9, whereas HNF4[alpha]1 only appears after differentiation of F9 cells to visceral endoderm.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	8	 HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA is also found in totipotent embryonic stem cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, the function of HNF4[alpha]7 seems not to be restricted to embryonic cells as the HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA is also present in adult tissues, most notably the stomach.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	10	 All these features suggest that the presence of distinct splice variants of HNF4[alpha] modulates the activity of HNF4[alpha] in a cell type specific way.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	11	Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) constitutes a transcription factor family (1 ,2 ) whose first member HNF4[alpha] has been identified as a factor interacting with promoter elements mediating liver specific transcription (3 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Based on the zinc finger motif of the DNA binding domain and on a potential ligand binding domain HNF4 is classified as a member of the nuclear orphan receptor superfamily (4 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	13	 HNF4[alpha] turned out to be present also in non-hepatic cells such as kidney, intestine, stomach and pancreas (5 -7 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The importance of HNF4[alpha] in gene control in tissues distinct from the liver has been documented by the fact that a human inherited disease is based on the expression of a mutated HNF4[alpha] gene in the endocrine pancreas leading to maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY1; 8 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In addition to the role of HNF4[alpha] as a tissue specific transcription factor it functions also in early embryogenesis: in the Xenopus egg we identified the HNF4[alpha] protein as a maternal transcription factor that contributes to the zygotic activation of the gene encoding HNF1[alpha] (9 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In mouse embryos HNF4[alpha] transcripts have been identified in the primary endoderm as early as day 4.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	17	5 and later in the liver diverticulum, the gut and nephrogenic tissues starting from day 8.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The early embryonic requirement of HNF4[alpha] is well established in the mouse, as the knock-out of the HNF4[alpha] gene leads to a disturbance of gastrulation and thus to early embryonic lethality (11 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The embryonic role of HNF4 seems to be evolutionary conserved, as maternal HNF4 mRNA has been identified in the Drosophila egg.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Furthermore, a large chromosomal deletion spanning the HNF4 locus results in defects in the gut and malpighian tubules of the developing Drosophila and these malformations are interpreted that HNF4 plays similar functions in invertebrates and vertebrates (7 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	21	In addition to HNF4[alpha] we have recently identified two other members of the HNF4 family, i.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	22	 HNF4[beta] in Xenopus (2 ) and HNF4[gamma] in humans (1 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Both these new members of the HNF4 family seem to have distinct but overlapping functions compared to HNF4[alpha], since both gene products show a differential expression pattern and a distinct transactivation potential of HNF4 dependent reporter genes.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	24	Further complexity of gene control by HNF4[alpha] transcription factors is apparently given by the differential splicing of the 10 initially identified exons of the HNF4[alpha] gene (6 ,8 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Thus far, six distinct splice variants of HNF4[alpha] have been identified in human and murine cDNA samples.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We use the nomenclature most recently used for the human splice variants (12 ): HNF4[alpha]1 represents the initially identified transcript (3 ) and HNF4[alpha]2 through HNF4[alpha]6 are the splice variants identified subsequently.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	27	 HNF4[alpha]2 is a splice variant that contains a larger exon 9 resulting in an insertion of 10 additional amino acids in the Pro-rich C-terminal part and has been identified in the rat (13 ), the mouse (14 ) and human (1 ,15 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	28	 HNF4[alpha]3 initially refered to as HNF-4C (16 ) has been identified in human liver cDNA and is characterized by a shorter and distinct C-terminus, whereas HNF4[alpha]4 found in human kidney and liver RNA contains in the N-terminal region the two additional exons 1B and 1C (1 ,12 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The fifth splice variant HNF4[alpha]5 carries the exon 1B and 1C found in HNF4[alpha]4 together with the larger exon 9 found in HNF4[alpha]2, whereas HNF4[alpha]6 combines exon 1B and exon 1C with the C-terminal truncation found in HNF4[alpha]3 (12 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	30	 We speculate that all these splice variants have unique properties allowing a modulation of the HNF4[alpha] activity.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Indeed, we have shown in transient transfection assays using HNF4 dependent reporter genes, that HNF4[alpha]4 has a lower transactivation potential compared to HNF4[alpha]2 (1 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	32	 However, it should be stressed that all these HNF4[alpha] variants have only been identified as mRNAs and the existence of the corresponding proteins has not been proven.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	33	The broad spectrum of tissues expressing HNF4[alpha] argues for a function of HNF4[alpha] in the establishment of the differentiation of various cell types, but most data concerning the role of HNF4[alpha] have been investigated in hepatic cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Most notably, the presence of HNF4[alpha] expression has been correlated with the differentiated phenotype of hepatocytes (reviewed in 17 ) .
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In fact, it has been shown that the introduction of HNF4[alpha] in dedifferentiated hepatocytes can lead to a redifferentiation as shown by the activation of several liver specific functions (18 -20 ), whereas the forced expression of a dominant negative mutant down-regulates several liver specific genes in differentiated hepatoma cells (21 ,22 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	36	In the present report we analyzed in the murine cell line MHSV-12 the highly differentiated hepatic phenotype that is reversibly decreased in serum-containing culture medium (23 ).

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	67	It is well established that the composition of the culture medium has a profound effect on the differentiation state of hepatocytes (23 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In general the presence of serum leads to substantial dedifferentiation of the hepatic phenotype.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	69	 To explore whether the cultivation conditions of hepatocytes has any effect on the expression of tissue specific transcription factors known to be responsible for the hepatic phenotype, we determined the presence of liver transcription factors in the immortalized murine hepatic cell line MHSV-12.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	70	 This cell line has been found to express most abundantly transcripts of liver specific proteins such as albumin, aldolase A and B as well as tyrosine amino transferase, but this liver specific expression pattern is reversibly decreased in serum containing medium (23 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Analyzing the expression of HNF1[alpha] in the MHSV-12 cell line cultured under various conditions we did not detect any change in this transcription factor (data not shown).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	72	 However, probing HNF4[alpha] in gel retardation assays using various antibodies we detected some significant differences: as illustrated in Figure 1 A, in extracts of MHSV-12 cells grown in serum-free MX83 medium, that maintains a highly differentiated hepatic phenotype (23 ), HNF4[alpha] could readily be detected in gel retardation experiments (lane 1) and this DNA-protein complex could be supershifted by an antibody raised against the A/B-domain or the F-domain of HNF4[alpha] (lanes 2 and 3, respectively).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	73	 In contrast, in extracts derived from MHSV-12 cells cultivated in the presence of serum, that leads to a dramatic dedifferentiation (23 ), we observed that the HNF4[alpha] protein detected in gel retardation assays (lane 4) did not react with the antibody specific for the A/B-domain of HNF4[alpha] (lane 5).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	74	 However, in the same extracts the presence of HNF4[alpha] protein could be verified with the antibody specific for the F-domain (lane 6).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	75	 These results imply that the properties of HNF4[alpha] change in MHSV-12 cells depending on the culture conditions.

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	84	To identify the components in the culture medium that change the properties of the HNF4[alpha] protein, we cultivated the MHSV-12 cells in MX83 medium lacking defined components and analyzed the extracts of these cells in the gel retardation assay using the A/B-domain specific antibody.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	85	 As Figure 1 B illustrates, the omission of hydrocortisone in the culture medium results in cell extracts with HNF4[alpha] protein that mostly cannot be supershifted by the A/B-domain specific antibody (lanes 3 and 4).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	86	 In contrast extracts derived from cultures grown in the absence of EGF (lanes 1 and 2) or insulin (lanes 5 and 6) contain HNF4[alpha] that is predominantly supershifted by the A/B-domain specific antibody.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Consequently, the presence of hydrocortisone in the serum-free medium leads to the expression of the HNF4[alpha] form that is recognized by the A/B-domain specific antibody.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	88	In a complementary approach we investigated the effect of the glucocorticoid hormone on HNF4[alpha] expression in MHSV-12 cells grown with serum.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	89	 As shown in the gel retardation assay of Figure 1 C, a 24 h incubation with dexamethasone leads to a substantial amount of HNF4[alpha] protein that is recognized by the A/B-domain specific antibody (lane 5).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Since this dexamethasone mediated change can be inhibited by RU486, a well known antagonist binding to the glucocorticoid receptor as a competitor of the glucocorticoid (lane 8), we assume that the effect is mediated by the nuclear hormone receptor.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	91	The findings with the cells grown without serum as well as the data with the cultures maintained in serum, both imply that a glucocorticoid mediated event alters the properties of the HNF4[alpha] protein in such a way that it is recognized by the A/B specific antibody.

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	93	The differential recognition of HNF4[alpha] by the A/B-domain specific antibody could either reflect a protein modification or a change in the amino acid sequence in the N-terminus of the HNF4[alpha] protein.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	94	 To distinguish between these two alternatives we transfected an expression vector encoding the originally described rat HNF4[alpha] protein (3 ) into MHSV-12 cells grown in the presence of serum, i.

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Analyzing increasing amounts of extracts derived from these transfected cell lines by gel retardation assays we observed a concentration dependent appearance of a HNF4[alpha] protein that can be supershifted by the A/B-domain specific antibody (marked by an arrow head in lanes 2 and 5 in Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	97	 2 ), whereas in extracts of mock transfected cells no HNF4[alpha] protein could be supershifted by the A/B specific antibody (lanes 8 and 11).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Using the F-domain specific antibody no qualitative difference could be seen between the HNF4[alpha] transfected cells and the control, but the supershifted band was stronger in the extract of the transfected cells (compare lanes 3 and 6 with lanes 9 and 12).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	99	 These results rule out the possibility that protein modification plays a major role but rather imply that the transfected HNF4[alpha] encodes a protein that is distinct in its amino acid sequence from the protein expressed in undifferentiated MHSV-12 cells.

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	117	 As the difference in the HNF4[alpha] protein is only detected with the monoclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal A/B-domain, we suspected a distinct 5'-end of the HNF4[alpha] mRNA.

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	176	 To allow a reliable quantification we made the PCR reaction with 32P-labeled dCTP that permits low cycling numbers and thus ensures quantitative measurements.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	177	 As shown in Figure 6 both these transcripts can be identified in the liver and the stomach (lanes 1 and 3), whereas in the kidney and to a smaller extent in the intestine only the HNF4[alpha]1 transcript can be detected.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	178	 In the pancreas only small amounts of HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts are present.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	179	 But the significance of this finding is questionable as the GAPDH mRNA cannot be seen probably because the pancreatic RNase was not sufficiently inhibited during RNA preparation.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	180	 However, traces of HNF4[alpha]7 RNA were also detected in the ovary, heart, bladder and brain, where no HNF4[alpha]1 transcripts and normal levels of GAPDH RNA were observed.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Clearly, the HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 splice variants are expressed differentially in the various tissues analyzed.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	182	 By quantification of the PCR products in a phosphor imager we estimate that in the stomach about a third of the HNF4[alpha] transcripts correspond to the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant (lane 3).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Furthermore, the abundance of the HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts differs by a factor of ~1000-fold between high and low expressing tissues.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	184	 HNF4[alpha]7 is expressed in embryonic stem cells of the mouse.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	185	Our initial experiments leading to the identification of the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant implied some correlation of the novel splice variant with the undifferentiated phenotype of the hepatocytes.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Therefore, we investigated the presence of HNF4[alpha]7 in the murine embryonal carcinoma cell line F9 that resembles the pluripotent stem cells of the inner cell mass of the early mouse embryo.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	187	 This cell line can can be differentiated into distinct endodermal cell types upon retinoic acid treatment.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Most interestingly these stem cells can be differentiated by retinoic acid treatment into visceral endoderm when they are cultured in suspension as aggregates and these cell types share properties of hepatocytes (24 ,32 ) .
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Based on RT-PCR we succeeded to show that undifferentiated F9 cells contain exclusively the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant ( Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	190	 7 A, lanes 1 and 2), whereas the differentiated cell population contains the HNF4[alpha]1 as well as the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variants (lanes 3 and 4).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	191	 From three independent experiments we estimated by quantification in a phosphor imager a 15-fold increase in HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA upon differentiation into visceral endoderm, whereas the level of HNF4[alpha]1 transcripts increased from undetectable levels to a value ~60% of the amount of the HNF4[alpha]7 transcript.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Since in the immortalized hepatic MHSV-12 cells grown in the presence of serum, the balance between HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 is altered by the addition of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	193	 1 ), we wondered whether a similar effect is seen in F9 cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	194	 As Figure 7 A demonstrates the expression pattern of HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 is not changed upon dexamethasone treatment in either undifferentiated or differentiated F9 cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	195	To determine whether the presence of the HNF4[alpha]7 transcript in the embryonal cell line F9 also reflects the expression of the corresponding protein, we prepared nuclear extracts from F9 cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In gel retardation assays with extracts from undifferentiated F9 cells (Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	197	 7 B) we could detect a supershift with the F-domain specific antibody (lane 3) and the A/B/C-domain specific antibody (lane 4) but no reaction with the A/B-domain specific antibody (lane 2).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	198	 In contrast in F9 cells differentiated into visceral endoderm a supershift was seen with each of the three antibodies (lanes 6, 7 and 8).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	199	 This result is consistent with the RT-PCR analysis and implies that undifferentiated F9 cells contain HNF4[alpha]7 protein, whereas HNF4[alpha]1 as well as HNF4[alpha]7 proteins are present in differentiated F9 cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	200	To further investigate the early embryonic expression of HNF4[alpha]7 we searched for the corresponding transcript in the totipotent embryonic stem cell line E14-1.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The RT-PCR analysis given in Figure 7 C demonstrates the presence of HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA in this embryonal stem cell (lane 2), whereas the RNA sample derived from the feeder cells used for the ES cell culture lack any HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts (lane 3).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Probing the same ES cell RNA for the HNF4[alpha]1 mRNA we did not detect any transcript (data not shown).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	203	From the analysis of both the F9 cells and the ES cells we conclude that the presence of HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA is a characteristic of undifferentiated embryonic cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	204	The novel splice variant HNF4[alpha]7 is expressed as the exclusive HNF4[alpha] transcript in the undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cell line F9 and the ES cell line E14-1.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	205	 The transcript is also found in the hepatocyte cell line MHSV-12 that has been established by immortalization of embryonic hepatocytes.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	206	 In this immortalized hepatic cell culture HNF4[alpha]7 predominates provided these cells are cultured under conditions that lead to dedifferentiation.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	207	 In this context it is important to stress that the MHSV-12 cell line dedifferentiated by serum addition has far more hepatic characters than the dedifferentiated hepatoma cell lines C2 and H5 that both lack any HNF4[alpha] and HNF1[alpha] transcription factors (18 ,32 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	208	Recently, the expression of HNF4[alpha] has been investigated in the ES cell line D3 (33 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Under differentiating conditions allowing the formation of embryoid bodies the appearance of HNF4[alpha] RNA has been observed, but no signal was detected in the undifferentiated embryonic stem cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The lack of HNF4[alpha] transcripts in undifferentiated ES cells probably reflects the insensitivity of the Northern blots compared to our RT-PCR assay as these authors used a full length cDNA probe that would hybridize also to the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	211	The presence of HNF4[alpha]7 in various embryonic cell types suggests that this novel HNF4[alpha] splice variant has some function during early embryogenesis.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Early embryonic expression of the HNF4[alpha] gene starting in the primary endoderm at embryonic day 4.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	213	5 of the mouse has been documented by in situ hybridization (10 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	214	 As the probe used in these experiments did not differentiate between the [alpha]1 and [alpha]7 splice variant, the identity of this signal in respect to the splice variants is not clear.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	215	 However, another in situ hybridization used a genomic fragment of the exon 1 of the original HNF4[alpha] transcript (6 ) and thus, in retrospect, was a HNF4[alpha]1 specific probe.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	216	 With this probe HNF4[alpha] transcripts were first localised only on day 7 p.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	217	 in visceral extraembryonic endoderm.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	218	 This detection at a later time point in embryogenesis could well reflect the fact that this probe could not hybridize to the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Similarly, the relatively late appearance of HNF4[alpha] binding activity in gel retardation assays starting at 8.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	220	 (25 ) might also be interpreted as a lack of reactivity of the antibody with the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Therefore, by indirect evidence the earlier appearance of HNF4[alpha]7 compared to HNF4[alpha]1, we have seen in the differentiating F9 cells (Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	222	 7A and B) matches the available data in the developing embryo.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	223	Analyzing 200 unfertilized mouse eggs we could not identify HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA whereas GAPDH mRNA was readily detectable (data not shown).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	224	 As unfertilized mouse eggs are about 20 times larger than the ES cells, the input RNA in the RT-PCR corresponds to ~4000 ES cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Since in such an ES cell aliquot we could identify the HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA, we assume that HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts are absent in the egg and accumulate by zygotic transcription in early mouse embryogenesis.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	226	 This is consistent with the appearance of HNF4[alpha] transcripts in in situ hybridization experiments with a probe detecting HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 only at day 4.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Therefore, it seems unlikely that HNF4[alpha] mRNA is a maternal component in mammals.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	228	 This is in contrast to Drosophila HNF4 (7 ) and Xenopus HNF4[beta] mRNA (2 ) that are known to be present as maternal transcripts.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	229	 However, the HNF4[alpha] protein itself might be a maternal component of the mammalian egg, a situation we have found for the HNF4[alpha] protein in Xenopus whose corresponding mRNA has disappeared at the egg stage (2 ,34 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	230	An early function of HNF4[alpha] gene expression in mammals has been established by the disruption of the gene that results in an impaired gastrulation and early embryonic lethality (11 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	231	 As the targeting vector used in these knock-out experiments lacked exon 2 and 3, the HNF4[alpha]1 as well as the HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts are devoid of the DNA binding domain.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Therefore, it is not clear at the moment which HNF4[alpha] transcripts plays the essential function at this early embryonic stage.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	233	 It should also be considered that the partial rescue of HNF4[alpha] knock-out embryos observed by supplementing the developing embryo with normal visceral endoderm (35 ) might be an effect relieving only one of the two HNF4[alpha] splice variants.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	234	We assume that the presence of HNF4[alpha]7 in the undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cell line F9 and in the embryonic stem cell E14-1 reflects already some first step of embryonic gene regulation.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Consistent with this interpretation the presence of transcripts encoding the tissue specific transcription factor HNF1[alpha] has been reported in undifferentiated F9 cells (25 ,36 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Since it is well established that HNF1[alpha] is a potential target gene of HNF4[alpha] (18 -20 ,26 ,37 ), we consider the possibility that HNF4[alpha]7 triggers HNF1[alpha] expression at this early stage.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	237	 However, the significance of such a potential effect is questionable as the HNF1[alpha] transcripts are of aberrant size and no HNF1[alpha] protein can be detected in F9 cells (25 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	238	Our analysis demonstrates that HNF4[alpha]7 is not restricted to embryonic tissues as it is also found abundantly in the stomach of the adult mouse (Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	239	 In contrast, in the liver and intestine, HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts constitute only a minor fraction as compared to HNF4[alpha]1 and in the ovary, heart, bladder and brain only traces can be found.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	240	 It will be most interesting to investigate whether in these tissues HNF4[alpha]7 is restricted to a subpopulation of cells, e.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	241	Our finding that the transactivation potential of the HNF4[alpha] splice variants differs in transient transfection assays and that the extent of this effect depends on the cell type used (Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	242	 5 ), indicates that the two HNF4[alpha] splice variants cooperate differentially with other transcription factors.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	243	 As the HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 splice variants have distinct N-termini, we expect that this domain determines the differential cooperation.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Therefore, we exclude the reported interaction with COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII (38 ) as well as the binding to HNF1[alpha] (39 ) as the mechanisms mediating the distinct properties of of HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7, since these interactions involve the C-terminus common to HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	245	 However, the specific binding observed with the basal transcription factor TFIIB (40 ) might trigger the distinct properties of the two splice variants, as the formation of this complex requires the N-terminus of HNF4[alpha] (38 ,40 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Alternatively, HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 may exert distinct activities due to differential heterodimerization with other members of the HNF4 family (1 ,2 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	247	 But we would not expect differential heterodimerization with other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, since HNF4[alpha] seems usually not to heterodimerize with these components (41 ,42 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	248	Analyzing the expression of the HNF4[alpha] splice variants we revealed that HNF4[alpha]7 is under a complex regulatory network.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In the hepatic cell line MHSV-12 the glucocorticoid plays a major role as the lack of this hormone seems to be a critical component for the appearance of HNF4[alpha]7.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Clearly, the glucocorticoid hormone alters the balance between the HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 splice variants.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	251	 As glucocorticoids are known to trigger the final stage of hepatic differentiation at birth (43 ), we have investigated the expression of these two HNF4[alpha] splice variants.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Using liver extracts from 2 days before birth up to 2 days after birth we could not see any change (data not shown).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	253	 In fact, as all the HNF4 binding activity observed in gel retardation assays could be supershifted by the A/B specific antibody at all stages analyzed, we have no data to support a major change in HNF4[alpha] splice variants at birth, although glucocorticoid action is an essential step at this developmental stage.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	254	 A lack of glucocorticoid control was also seen in F9 cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Neither in undifferentiated nor in differentiated F9 cells the addition of dexamethasone altered the level of the HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA (Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	256	 On the other hand in these F9 cells the retinoic acid mediated differentiation to visceral endoderm leads to an increase in HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA but more significantly also to the appearance of the HNF4[alpha]1 splice variant.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	257	 This change in HNF4[alpha] expression can also be seen on the protein level, as HNF4 binding activity reacting with the anti A/B antibody is only detected in the differentiated cells (Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	258	Our data show that the splice variant HNF4[alpha]7 contains a distinct first exon.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	259	 As the original exon 1 of the murine HNF4[alpha] gene has been shown to contain the initiation site of the promoter (6 ,44 ), we assume that the novel exon 1 found in HNF4[alpha]7 indicates a second promoter of the HNF4[alpha] gene.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Therefore, we propose that the differential expression of the two splice variants is mainly due to the differential use of two distinct promoters of the HNF4[alpha] gene ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
