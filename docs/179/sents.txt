MODY1 is caused by mutation in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4). To understand better the MODY1 phenotype, we tested whether HNF4 was able to modulate directly the insulin gene promoter. Transfection of cultured 293T cells with an HNF4 expression vector led to 10-fold activation of a cotransfected reporter plasmid containing the rat insulin I gene promoter. Computer analysis revealed a potential HNF4-binding site between nucleotides 57 and 69 of the promoter; mutation of this sequence led to reduced ability of HNF4 to activate the promoter. The ability of HNF4 to bind this sequence was confirmed using gel shift analysis. In transfected INS-1 beta cells, mutation of either the HNF1 site or the HNF4 site in the insulin gene promoter led to 50-75% reduction in reporter gene activity; expression of dominant negative HNF4 led to significant reduction in the activity of wild type and both mutated promoters. Thus, in addition to the previously described indirect action of HNF4 on insulin gene expression mediated through elevated HNF1 levels, HNF4 also activates the insulin gene directly, through a previously unrecognized cis element.

This selectivity is controlled primarily at the transcriptional level through well defined promoter elements (4-6). Although a number of transcription factors have been defined that interact with the insulin promoter and activate it in synergistic fashion (7-10), the action of these factors alone is not sufficient to explain the remarkable degree of cell specificity observed in vivo (9). Most likely, additional transcription factors participate in achieving specificity..

This indicates that a beta cell defect is the primary cause of MODY and implies that MODY genes have a role in insulin production and/or secretion. Consistent with this is the fact that four of the five known MODY subtypes are caused by mutations in distinct transcription factors expressed in pancreatic beta cells (13). The striking MODY phenotype caused by such single gene disorders provides clear evidence of the important role of each of these transcription factors in beta cell function..

At least eight different mutations have been identified in MODY1 patients (15). Four mutations result in truncated HNF4 proteins, of which two are nonsense mutations (14, 16), and two are frameshift mutations (17, 18). The other four mutations are missense mutations that affect various domains of the HNF4 protein (19-22)..

Like HNF4, HNF1 is expressed in liver and beta cells. In fact, HNF1 was shown to be a direct transcriptional target of HNF4 in liver (24). Furthermore, a mutation in the HNF4-binding site in the HNF1 gene promoter produces a MODY phenotype (25). Consistent with these observations, MODY1 and MODY3 show a similar clinical phenotype. Recent studies (26) have shown that induction of dominant negative (DN) HNF1 in beta cells leads to alterations in expression of a number of beta cell genes including the insulin gene. Because DN-HNF4 led to reduced activity of the Hnf1 promoter and reduced insulin mRNA levels (27), it was hypothesized that HNF4 increases insulin mRNA levels indirectly by increasing HNF1 levels, which in turn activate the promoter through binding to an HNF1 consensus sequence (28)..

0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	34	Identification of the Region in the Insulin Gene Promoter Important for HNF4 Activation-- In order to characterize further this HNF4-dependent activation, the insulin gene promoter was scanned for the presence of an HNF4 consensus binding sequence using TESS software (www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess). Such a consensus site was found between nucleotides 57 and 69 (Fig. 2), suggesting the presence of an HNF4-binding site in the promoter of the insulin gene. To determine whether this putative HNF4-binding site is necessary for HNF4 activation of the insulin gene promoter, we examined the ability of HNF4 to activate the insulin gene promoter mutated at this site. Four block replacement mutants of the insulin promoter, spanning the consensus binding sequence and designated Synt 5-8, were used (5) (Fig. 2). As before, 293T cells were transfected with reporter plasmids encoding the luciferase gene controlled by the wild type rat insulin I promoter or by one of its mutated variants, Synt 5-8, in the presence or absence of HNF4 expression plasmid. HNF4 activation of mutants Synt 5 and Synt 8, in which mutations are located outside the putative HNF4-binding site, was not reduced compared with wild type promoter activation. In contrast, mutation Synt 6 and Synt 7, each abolishing a part of the HNF4 consensus site, showed significantly attenuated activation (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the nucleotides mutated in mutants Synt 6 and Synt 7 are important for HNF4 activation of the insulin gene promoter..

An EMSA was performed using a probe containing the putative HNF4-binding site, designated the HBE element (Fig. 2). Whole cell extracts were made from HeLa cells transfected with HNF4 expression plasmid and from untransfected HeLa cells. Incubation of transfected extracts with the radiolabeled HBE probe resulted in a strong band that was absent when extracts from mock-transfected cells were used (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). Competition with unlabeled HBE oligonucleotide abolished this band (lane 3). Addition of anti-HNF4 serum generated a supershifted band that was not observed with preimmune serum, confirming the presence of HNF4 in the complex (lanes 4 and 5). Apolipoprotein C III (ApoCIII) is a well characterized target gene of HNF4 (35, 36). Competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the C3P element, an HNF4-binding site in the ApoCIII gene promoter (37), also abolished the observed band (lane 6). Competition with increasing amounts of unlabeled HBE and C3P probes indicates that HNF4 affinity to its binding site in ApoCIII gene is higher than its affinity to the binding site in the insulin gene (Fig. 4B)..

A, whole cell extracts from mock-transfected HeLa cells (lane 1) or HeLa cells transfected with HNF4 expression vector (lanes 2-6) were incubated with 32P-labeled HBE probe and separated on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Specificity of binding was analyzed by adding 100- or 60-fold molar excess of unlabeled HBE probe (lane 3) or C3P probe (lane 6), respectively. The formation of an immune complex is shown with the addition of anti-HNF4 serum (lane 4) and compared with the addition of preimmune serum (lane 5).

This implies that additional factor(s), present in beta cells, may be important for insulin gene regulation. In light of our data showing that HNF4 can bind and activate the insulin gene promoter, its possible cooperation with the other three known insulin gene transcription factors was examined. 293T cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid controlled by the rat insulin I gene promoter and with expression plasmids encoding the four transcription factors E2A, BETA2, PDX1, and HNF4. Expression of HNF4 with E2A, BETA2, and PDX1 produced a synergistic activation of the insulin gene promoter that was ~2-fold higher than the activation generated by the three factors alone (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained upon transfecting HeLa cells (not shown)..

Furthermore, HNF4 is a transcription activator of HNF1 (24, 27), and mutations in HNF1 are responsible for MODY3 (23). This raises the possibility that HNF4 may activate the insulin gene indirectly, through Hnf1 gene function. In non-beta cells, the HNF4-dependent activation we observed (Fig. 1) may be mediated in part through HNF1, but the substantial reduction in the activation of promoter mutated in the HNF4-binding site (Fig. 3) indicates that a significant portion of the effect is mediated directly..

This dominant negative protein possesses a functional dimerization domain but lacks a DNA binding domain and therefore suppresses activity of the endogenous wild type HNF4. Luciferase reporter plasmids controlled by wild type rat insulin I gene promoter or by promoter mutated either in HNF1- or HNF4-binding sites were electroporated into these cells. In the absence of doxycycline (i.e. no expression of DN-HNF4), mutations in either the HNF4 site or the HNF1 site led to reduced activity of the insulin gene promoter (Fig. 6A).

If HNF4 acts exclusively in an indirect manner, through HNF1, induction of DN-HNF4 should not affect the activity of promoter mutated at the HNF1 site. In fact, induction of DN-HNF4 significantly reduced the activity of both the wild type promoter and promoter mutated in the HNF1-binding site (Fig. 6A), confirming the involvement of HNF4 in insulin promoter activation, and showing that at least part of this effect does not involve HNF1. Furthermore, expression of DN-HNF4 led to significant reduction in activity of a promoter fragment mutated in the HNF4 site (Fig. 6A), confirming that HNF4 also increases insulin gene transcription through an indirect effect via HNF1 (Fig. 6B). Although this experimental system does not permit quantitative comparison of the relative contribution of the direct effects as compared with the indirect effects of HNF4, the significant DN-HNF4-dependent reduction in observed activity for both the HNF1 and HNF4 promoter clearly indicates that both effects are substantial.

Because the MODY phenotype involves a primary defect in beta cells, the defective function of these transcription factors must be manifested in these cells. Indeed, expression of DN-HNF1 and DN-HNF4 leads to clear alterations in expression of key beta cell genes, including the insulin gene (26, 27). Because previous studies have shown that HNF4 is an activator of HNF1 (24) and that MODY3 can be caused by mutation in an HNF4-binding site in the HNF1 promoter (25), it was proposed that the effect of HNF4 on the insulin gene promoter is indirect, mediated through activation of HNF1 (27)..

Expression of DN-HNF4 in beta cells led to reduced activity of both wild type insulin gene promoter and promoter mutated in the HNF1-binding site, strongly suggesting the presence of an HNF4-binding site elsewhere in the promoter region. Indeed, we identified such a sequence between nucleotides 57 and 69 of the promoter, and we were able to show that it is capable of binding HNF4 in vitro. We further showed that this site is essential for full activation of the promoter in beta cells and for efficient HNF4-dependent activation in non-beta cells. Expression of DN-HNF4 in beta cells also led to reduced activity of a promoter construct bearing mutations in the HNF4 site. The data therefore indicate that in addition to the previously recognized indirect action of HNF4 on insulin gene expression mediated through HNF1, there is also a direct action mediated through binding to the novel HNF4 consensus sequence in the promoter..

It has been shown that the Hnf4 promoter contains an upstream beta cell-specific promoter whose activity is regulated by HNF1. This promoter also contains a binding site for PDX1, mutations in which strongly correlate with the diabetic phenotype in a MODY family (30). Taken together, the data are consistent with the idea that HNF1, HNF4, and PDX1 participate in a complex autoregulatory transcriptional network that controls many of the functional properties of developing and mature beta cells. Of central importance in this regard is the insulin gene, whose expression is modulated by all three factors. Interestingly, we have observed synergistic activation of the insulin gene promoter by HNF4 and PDX1, which have adjacent binding sites in this promoter, thus adding an additional level of complexity to the transcriptional control network. The current results indicating that HNF4 activates the insulin gene through both direct and indirect actions will permit a more detailed understanding of the MODY phenotype.     ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Activation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene transcription in response to all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) or a glucocorticoid such as dexamethasone (Dex) requires a distinct arrangement of DNA-response elements and their cognate transcription activators on the gene promoter. Two of the accessory factor-binding elements involved in the Dex response (gAF1 and gAF3) coincide with the DNA-response elements involved in the RA response. We demonstrate here that the combination of Dex/RA has a synergistic effect on endogenous PEPCK gene expression in rat hepatocytes and H4IIE hepatoma cells. Reporter gene studies show that the gAF3 element and one of the two glucocorticoid receptor-binding elements (GR1) are most important for this effect. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that when H4IIE cells were treated with Dex/RA, ligand-activated retinoic acid receptors (retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor) and glucocorticoid receptors are recruited to this gene promoter, as are the transcription coregulators p300, CREB-binding protein, p/CIP, and SRC-1. Notably, the recruitment of p300 and RNA polymerase II to the PEPCK promoter is increased by the combined Dex/RA treatment compared with Dex or RA treatment alone. The functional importance of p300 in the Dex/RA response is illustrated by the observation that selective reduction of this coactivator, but not that of CREB-binding protein, abolishes the synergistic effect in H4IIE cells..

0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Extracellular signals received by eucaryotic cells are transferred to the nucleus where the transcription of specific sets of genes is modulated (1). The final targets of these signaling pathways are different combinations of transcription factors that bind to DNA-response elements and form various protein-protein interactions on gene promoters and thereby either activate or repress gene transcription. DNA-response elements in gene promoters often overlap or are adjacent to one another (2). This provides various possibilities for the recruitment of transcription factors and their cognate coregulators in response to distinct signals and creates the potential for considerable flexibility in gene regulation. Regulation of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)1 gene provides an excellent model system for exploring the mechanisms of signal integration in the context of gluconeogenesis, an important physiologic process (2). The expression of hepatic PEPCK is primarily accomplished at the transcriptional level (3). Glucagon (acting through cAMP), glucocorticoids, all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), and thyroid hormone activate PEPCK gene expression, whereas insulin and glucose are inhibitory (3 to 6)..

Activation of PEPCK gene transcription by Dex also requires a multicomponent glucocorticoid-response unit (GRU), which consists of two nonconsensus glucocorticoid receptor-binding sites (GR1 and GR2) (8), and four accessory factor-binding sites (gAF1, gAF2, gAF3, and the cAMP-response element (CRE)), which bind COUP-TF/HNF4, HNF3, COUP-TF, and C/EBP, respectively (9 to 12). A mutation of any one of the accessory elements results in a 50 to 60% reduction of Dex-induced PEPCK gene transcription in H4IIE hepatoma cells (11). Any combination of the mutation of two elements nearly abolishes this response (11)..

The respective transcription factors are present in about the same abundance in the H4IIE cell nucleus, and each binds with approximately the same affinity to these elements. Thus, it is of interest to understand how a cell responds to either of these inducers, whether different constellations of accessory factors and coregulators are used for each response and whether there is any functional interaction between the two units in the presence of both ligands..

This response is most dependent on the gAF3 and GR1 elements. Upon treatment with Dex/RA, ligand-activated RAR/RXR heterodimers, GR, HNF3, HNF4, p/CIP, SRC-1, CBP, p300, and RNA polymerase II (pol II) are present on the PEPCK gene promoter. Notably, the recruitment of p300 and pol II on the PEPCK promoter is increased upon Dex/RA treatment. The important role of p300 is illustrated by the fact that its reduction results in a selective loss of the synergistic effect of Dex/RA, whereas a similar reduction of CBP has no effect..

This is not a clonal cell line (20), so it is possible that different populations of cells in a culture respond to each inducer. If so, the summed responses to the two ligands should be additive. To determine the effect of the Dex/RA combination on PEPCK gene expression, real time RT-PCR assays were performed to quantify PEPCK mRNA upon Dex and/or RA treatment. Cyclophilin mRNA was also measured as a normalization control. RA and Dex caused a 4- and 2.7-fold induction, respectively, and the combination resulted in a synergistic 13.3-fold effect in H4IIE cells (Fig. 1A). In rat primary hepatocytes, PEPCK mRNA is induced 15- and 7.4-fold upon treatment with RA or Dex, respectively. When both ligands are present, a much greater than additive 39-fold induction was observed (Fig. 1B). This indication of an effect on mRNA induction within a single population of cells was confirmed at the protein level in an immunofluorescent experiment performed on primary hepatocytes. PEPCK expression is induced in 71, 67, or 70% of hepatocytes upon treatment with RA, Dex, or Dex/RA, respectively (data not shown). Because more than 50% of the cells respond to treatment with either or both ligands, we conclude that there are no discrete populations of hepatocytes that respond to either Dex or RA or to the combination.

The and elements, and the E box, were mutated in the context of PEPCK-LUC to determine which component of gAF3 is involved in the synergistic effect. As expected from previous studies (11), the E box mutation does not affect either of the Dex or RA responses nor does it have an effect on the Dex/RA response. A mutation of the site slightly reduces the RA-induced response but has no significant effect on the Dex-induced response or on the Dex/RA-induced synergistic effect. By contrast, a mutation of the site of gAF3 significantly reduces both the RA and Dex effects and abolishes the synergistic effect of Dex/RA on PEPCK gene expression (Fig. 4).

0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	47	  GR1 is a weak, nonconsensus GR-binding site which, by itself, cannot induce a Dex response on PEPCK gene expression (8). The accessory factor elements gAF1 to gAF3, with associated transcription factors, increase the affinity of binding of liganded GR to GR1/GR2 and stabilize this binding (21). The gAF1 and gAF3 accessory elements are not necessary when GR1/GR2 are replaced with high affinity, palindromic GR-binding elements (21). To test whether ligand-activated RAR/RXR heterodimers are necessary in the presence of a high affinity GR-binding element, GR1 was converted to a palindromic glucocorticoid-response element (palGRE) in the context of PEPCK-LUC. PEPCK luciferase activity is induced 80-fold by Dex in the context of palGR1 PEPCK-LUC, but when both Dex and RA are present, PEPCK gene expression is not further augmented (Fig. 6). Most interesting, the synergistic effect of Dex/RA is not seen when GR1 is converted to a palindromic high affinity GR-binding site, which is independent of gAF1 and gAF3 (8). By contrast, when either gAF1 or gAF3 is converted to a consensus RAR/RXR-binding element, in the context of the wild type GR1/GR2 elements, the synergistic effect of Dex/RA on PEPCK gene expression is actually augmented (see Figs. 3 and 5). Taken together, we conclude that the synergistic effect of Dex/RA involves enhanced GR binding to the nonconsensus GR1 element and that this may be facilitated by the binding of RAR/RXR heterodimers..
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	48	  GR1 is a weak, nonconsensus GR-binding site which, by itself, cannot induce a Dex response on PEPCK gene expression (8). The accessory factor elements gAF1 to gAF3, with associated transcription factors, increase the affinity of binding of liganded GR to GR1/GR2 and stabilize this binding (21). The gAF1 and gAF3 accessory elements are not necessary when GR1/GR2 are replaced with high affinity, palindromic GR-binding elements (21). To test whether ligand-activated RAR/RXR heterodimers are necessary in the presence of a high affinity GR-binding element, GR1 was converted to a palindromic glucocorticoid-response element (palGRE) in the context of PEPCK-LUC. PEPCK luciferase activity is induced 80-fold by Dex in the context of palGR1 PEPCK-LUC, but when both Dex and RA are present, PEPCK gene expression is not further augmented (Fig. 6). Most interesting, the synergistic effect of Dex/RA is not seen when GR1 is converted to a palindromic high affinity GR-binding site, which is independent of gAF1 and gAF3 (8). By contrast, when either gAF1 or gAF3 is converted to a consensus RAR/RXR-binding element, in the context of the wild type GR1/GR2 elements, the synergistic effect of Dex/RA on PEPCK gene expression is actually augmented (see Figs. 3 and 5).

Although Dex causes a somewhat greater recruitment of SRC-1 and p/CIP to the PEPCK gene promoter than RA (3.5- versus 2-fold and 2.8- versus 2-fold, respectively, Table I), the recruitment of these proteins is not further increased when both ligands are present. PCAF, a HAT family protein, is present in H4IIE cells but is not located on the PEPCK gene promoter under any of these treatment conditions. This is probably not due to epitope masking, as antibodies specific for different epitopes of PCAF were used. CBP and p300 are both recruited to the PEPCK gene promoter upon Dex and/or RA treatment but, despite their structural homology, the binding of CBP and p300 differs. The recruitment of CBP is induced 3.7- and 6.9-fold upon treatment with Dex or RA, respectively (Fig. 8 and Table I). The recruitment of CBP is not further increased (6.5-fold) by combined treatment with Dex/RA. By contrast, recruitment of p300 is increased 4.7-fold upon treatment with Dex/RA combination as compared with an 2.0-fold increase upon treatment with either RA or Dex alone, respectively. Antibodies specific for different epitopes of CBP and p300 were also used in this experiment, and similar recruitment profiles of CBP and p300 were observed in each case (data not shown). The increased recruitment of RNA pol II (2-, 2-, and 5-fold upon treatment with RA, Dex, and RA/Dex, respectively) parallels the change in p300 binding (Fig. 8).

In particular, the site of gAF3, which binds a RAR/RXR heterodimer, is critical (Fig. 4).

Examples include the tyrosine aminotransferase, fatty-acid synthase, L-type pyruvate kinase, insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins, and the glucose 6-phosphate catalytic subunit genes (32 to 37). We have used the phrase "metabolic control domain" (MCD) to describe an array of DNA elements and associated transcription factors that provide an integrated response to a variety of signals (2, 15). As the PEPCK gene MCD is elucidated, the central importance of one element, gAF3, has become apparent. This DNA sequence (see Fig. 4) is involved as an accessory factor in the glucocorticoid response (8), as an important element in the retinoic acid response (7), the thyroid hormone response (5), as a component of the cyclic AMP response unit (15), in the amplifying effect of PGC-1 (38), and now in the synergistic effect of Dex/RA (Figs. 2, 4, and 5). The proteins known to bind to gAF3 include COUP-TF and RAR/RXR. It remains to be seen whether these proteins account for all of the roles played by this interesting element in the MCD..

The synergistic effect of Dex/RA sets the upper end and expands the repertoire of responses available from this MCD. In this regard, it is interesting that RA affords no additional response in the presence of a high affinity GR-binding element (cGRE, Fig. 6), which elicits an exaggerated response from this otherwise wild type promoter. When considered in the context of the MCD, the PEPCK gene promoter may have evolved to have a weak GRE (GR1) which, when combined with the variety of other elements and cognate transcription factors described above, allows for a graduated response between off and fully on and therefore a very flexible means of adjusting the rate of gluconeogenesis..

Because bile acids are produced from cholesterol in liver and many enzymes involved in their biosynthesis are preferentially expressed in liver, the role of HNF4 in the regulation of bile acid production was examined. In mice, unconjugated bile acids are conjugated with taurine by the liver-specific enzymes, bile acid-CoA ligase and bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT). Mice lacking hepatic HNF4 expression exhibited markedly decreased expression of the very long chain acyl-CoA synthase-related gene (VLACSR), a mouse candidate for bile acid-CoA ligase, and BAT. This was associated with markedly elevated levels of unconjugated and glycine-conjugated bile acids in gallbladder. HNF4 was found to bind directly to the mouse VLACSR and BAT gene promoters, and the promoter activities were dependent on HNF4-binding sites and HNF4 expression. In conclusion, HNF4 plays a central role in bile acid conjugation by direct regulation of VLACSR and BAT in vivo..

0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Bile acids (BAs)1 are synthesized from cholesterol mainly in hepatocytes by a cascade of enzyme reactions. In humans, these reactions are initiated by steroid nucleus and side chain hydroxylation of cholesterol and followed by -oxidation of the side chain and resulting in the production of the primary BAs cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid (1, 2). In mice, cholic acid and -murichoric acid are the predominant primary BAs (3). Following BA biosynthesis, BAs are conjugated with glycine or taurine resulting in conjugates that are exported from hepatocytes via hepatic BA transporters such as the bile salt export pump located at the apical or canalicular membrane (1, 4 to 6). These BAs are stored in gallbladder and then transported into the small intestine. BAs are biological detergents that serve to solubilize fats, sterols, and fat-soluble vitamins in the intestine. Most BAs are recycled from the jejunum and ileum by transporters, such as apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (4, 7), and then transported back into hepatocytes from the portal circulation by transporters including sodium taurocholate cotransporter polypeptide (NTCP) and organic anion transporter polypeptide 1 (OATP1) located at the basolateral membrane (4)..

0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	7	Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor hormone superfamily that is mainly expressed in liver, intestine, kidney, and pancreas and regulates expression of target genes including several serum proteins such as apolipoproteins, blood coagulation factors, P450s, and enzymes involved in glucose, lipid, ammonia, steroid, and fatty acid metabolism by binding to direct repeat-1 elements in their promoter or enhancer regions (8, 9). Indeed, the expression of hepatic apolipoproteins, including A-II, A-IV, C-II, and C-III, ornithine transcarbamylase involved in ureagenesis, and CYP3A associated with xenobiotic metabolism, was significantly reduced in livers of liver-specific HNF4-null mice (10 to 12). A second line of liver-specific HNF4-null mice was established where Cre recombinase was placed under the control of the albumin promoter and the -fetoprotein enhancer (13). These mice exhibited a marked reduction in the expression of hepatic glycogen synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase, involved in gluconeogenesis, and reduced levels of E-cadherin, ZO-1, and CEACAM1 proteins that are critical for normal liver morphology (13)..

Whereas BA biosynthesis and transport are controlled to some degree by HNF4, it remains unknown whether HNF4 regulates the BA conjugation pathway. Nuclear receptors are involved in the control of the BA biosynthesis and transport system (6, 14, 15), but the mechanism regulating BA conjugation pathways have not been analyzed. BA conjugation reactions are catalyzed by two liver-enriched enzymes, bile acid-CoA ligase (BAL) and bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT) (1, 14). BAL activities are associated with rat BAL protein (16) and human very long chain acyl-CoA synthase homolog 2 (VLACSR-H2) protein (17), but enzymatic analysis of BAL protein has not been performed in the mouse. Because the mouse very long chain acyl-CoA synthase-related (VLACSR) gene, which is highly expressed only in liver (18) as well as rat BAL and human VLACSR-H2 genes, has a high homology to these proteins (16), it was reasonable to assume that the VLACSR gene might be the mouse homolog for the BAL gene. On the other hand, BAT genes have been cloned from mouse (19), rat (20), and human (21). The human BAT protein has conjugation activity with both taurine and glycine as substrates (21), but the mouse BAT protein only uses taurine as a substrate (19)..

A Phenomenex Luna C18 3- microm 100 x 2 mm inner diameter column (Torrance, CA) was used to separate free bile acids. The flow rate through the column at ambient temperature was 0.2 ml/min, and optimal resolution was achieved by elution with a linear gradient of water containing 0.1% formic acid (45 0%) and methanol (55 100%) for 10 min at room temperature. Separation of glycine- and taurine-conjugated bile acids was performed on an Aquasil C18 5- microm 50 x 2 mm inner diameter column (Keystone Scientific Operations, Bellefonte, PA), and the high pressure liquid chromatography system was operated isocratically at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with the mobile phase (acetonitrile/water/methanol = 30/45/25, v/v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid. The mass spectrometer was operated in the turbo ion spray mode with positive ion detection. The turbo ion spray temperature was maintained at 350  degrees C, and a voltage of 4.8 kV was applied to the sprayer needle. Nitrogen was used as the turbo ion spray and nebulizing gas.

The enzyme activity of BAL has not been analyzed in mouse, but the mouse VLACSR gene might be a candidate for a mouse BAL since VLACSR has high homology to both the rat BAL and human VLACSR-H2 that have BAL activities. Human BAT is able to conjugate both glycine and taurine (21), but mouse BAT has conjugation specificity toward taurine and not glycine (19).

0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	44	The conjugation pattern of BA in gallbladder bile was further determined by LC-MS/MS (Table II). In male H4Flox mice, taurocholic acid (TCA) and tauro--muricholic acid (T--MCA) were the predominant BAs. The concentrations of these BAs (Table II, upper) were decreased in H4LivKO mice, but the total amounts (Table II, lower) were almost unchanged (TCA) or increased (T--MCA). Most mammals secrete BAs conjugated with taurine and/or glycine, but mouse gallbladder bile contains only the taurine-conjugated forms (18). However, small amounts of glycine-conjugated BAs including glycocholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were detected in the H4Flox mice, and their levels were much lower as compared with their taurine-conjugated derivatives. In contrast to the results with control mice, taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), GDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were increased in H4LivKO mice with GDCA and GCDCA being markedly elevated. These results indicate that the conjugation pattern of BAs in H4LivKO mice is significantly different from H4Flox mice because of decreased expression of BAT. Because glycine-conjugated BAs are increased and taurine-conjugated BAs are maintained in H4LivKO mice, an unidentified BAT that can use both glycine and taurine as substrates might play an important role in H4LivKO mice..
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	45	The conjugation pattern of BA in gallbladder bile was further determined by LC-MS/MS (Table II). In male H4Flox mice, taurocholic acid (TCA) and tauro--muricholic acid (T--MCA) were the predominant BAs. The concentrations of these BAs (Table II, upper) were decreased in H4LivKO mice, but the total amounts (Table II, lower) were almost unchanged (TCA) or increased (T--MCA). Most mammals secrete BAs conjugated with taurine and/or glycine, but mouse gallbladder bile contains only the taurine-conjugated forms (18). However, small amounts of glycine-conjugated BAs including glycocholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were detected in the H4Flox mice, and their levels were much lower as compared with their taurine-conjugated derivatives. In contrast to the results with control mice, taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), GDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were increased in H4LivKO mice with GDCA and GCDCA being markedly elevated. These results indicate that the conjugation pattern of BAs in H4LivKO mice is significantly different from H4Flox mice because of decreased expression of BAT. Because glycine-conjugated BAs are increased and taurine-conjugated BAs are maintained in H4LivKO mice, an unidentified BAT that can use both glycine and taurine as substrates might play an important role in H4LivKO mice..
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	46	Expression of the Mouse VLACSR Gene Is Directly Regulated by HNF4 To investigate why expression of VLACSR was reduced in H4LivKO mice, the promoter region of the mouse VLACSR gene was cloned (Fig. 2). A transcription start site was determined by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and five major sites were identified between  to 143 and  to 85 from translation start site (+1). A putative HNF4-binding site and a GC box were found between  to 162 and  to 150 and  to 238 and  to 229, respectively (Fig. 2). To determine whether HNF4 has the potential to activate the mouse VLACSR promoter, several VLACSR promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed (Fig. 3A). When HepG2 cells, which express HNF4, were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the  to 194-bp fragment containing a putative HNF4-binding site was higher than that of the promoterless construct (pGL3/basic) and the  to 146-bp fragment (Fig. 3A). The promoter activities of the  to 220-bp fragment was higher than  to 194-bp fragment, indicating that the nucleotide sequence between  to 220 and  to 195 bp, which are GC-rich regions similar to the GC box between  to 238 and  to 229 bp, might be important for promoter activity. Furthermore, the promoter activities of the  to 256-,  to 1014-,  to 1435-, and  to 2219-bp fragments, which contain an HNF4-binding site and GC-rich sequences, were much higher than that of  to 194- and  to 220-bp fragments. To determine whether HNF4 positively regulates the promoter activity, CV-1 cells, which do not express HNF4, were used. The promoter activity of the  to 146-bp fragment was unchanged by cotransfection of the HNF4 expression vector, consistent with the absence of an HNF4-binding site (Fig. 3B). However, the promoter activity of the  to 194-bp fragment was increased by cotransfection with an HNF4 expression vector. The same results were obtained using the longer fragments, indicating that HNF4 positively regulates expression of the VLACSR gene. Interestingly, the basal promoter activity of  to 220-bp fragment was increased in the absence of HNF4 expression, and the activity of  to 256-bp fragment was much higher. Because a GC-rich sequence was observed in the region between  to 256 and  to 195 bp, the Sp1 family proteins might be important in activating maximal promoter activity in the presence of HNF4..

Liver nuclear extracts from H4Flox mice contained proteins that bound to the HNF4-binding site (Fig. 3C, lane 1). Binding was diminished by the addition of excess amounts of unlabeled VLACSR probe (wild-type) but not by the mutated probe, indicating that a protein specifically bound to this site (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 3, the lower arrow). Furthermore, these bands were supershifted by the addition of anti-HNF4 antibody, indicating that the protein bound to this HNF4-binding site was indeed HNF4 (Fig. 3C, lane 4, the upper arrow). However, supershifted bands were not detected using liver nuclear extracts from H4LivKO mice (Fig. 3C, lane 9) and no specific complex, indicated by the lower arrow, was detected using the labeled mutated probe (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 and 10). These results indicate that the HNF4-binding site in the mouse VLACSR promoter is capable of binding HNF4..
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	49	To determine whether disruption of the HNF4-binding site and GC box decreases the promoter activity, mutations were introduced into the HNF4-binding site and GC box in the mouse VLACSR ( to 1014/ to 47)-luciferase construct (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, when HepG2 cells were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the HNF4 mutant ( to 1014/HNF4 Mut) was decreased as compared with the wild-type construct ( to 1024/WT). The promoter activity of the GC box mutant ( to 1014/GC box Mut) was further decreased, and the double mutants for both the HNF4-binding site and GC box ( to 1014/HNF4/GC box Mut) had almost no promoter activity. When CV-1 cells were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the HNF4 mutant ( to 1014/HNF4 Mut) was decreased to 40% as compared with the wild-type fragment ( to 1014/WT) in the presence of HNF4 (Fig. 4C). The basal activity of the GC box mutant ( to 1014/GC box Mut) was decreased to the same level as the promoterless vector, but the activity was still increased by HNF4. Furthermore, introduction of mutations into the binding sites of both factors ( to 1014/HNF4/GC box Mut) caused a marked reduction of promoter activities even in the presence of HNF4. These results indicate that the HNF4 and a GC box-binding protein can activate expression of the VLACSR gene, but both are needed for the maximal activation..
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	50	Expression of the Mouse BAT Gene Is Directly Regulated by HNF4 In order to investigate why the expression of BAT was reduced in H4LivKO mice, the promoter region of the mouse BAT gene was cloned (Fig. 5B). An HNF4-binding site was found between  to 68 and  to 56 from the transcription start site (Fig. 5, A and B). However, the promoter activity of the 3078-bp fragment between the beginning of intron 1 and translation start site was not induced in HepG2 and CV-1 cells by cotransfection with HNF4 (data not shown). To determine whether HNF4 has the potential to activate the mouse BAT promoter, several BAT promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed (Fig. 6A). When HepG2 cells were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the  to 136-bp fragment containing a putative HNF4-binding site was higher than that of the promoterless construct (pGL3/basic) and the  to 52-bp fragment (Fig. 6A). The promoter activities of the longer fragments were much higher than that of the  to 136-bp fragment. To determine whether this effect was due to HNF4, CV-1 cells were used. The promoter activity of the  to 52-bp fragment was unchanged by cotransfection of the HNF4-expression vector, consistent with the absence of an HNF4-binding site (Fig. 6B). However, the promoter activity of the  to 136-bp fragment was increased by HNF4. The same results were obtained from experiments using the longer fragments..

Because VLACSR and BAT are preferentially expressed in liver (18, 19) as well as HNF4, HNF4 is a central factor in the regulation of VLACSR and BAT in vivo. An HNF4-binding site and a GC-rich region were identified in the promoter region of the mouse VLACSR gene. Indeed, HNF4 binds to this HNF4-binding site, and the promoter activities were dependent on this site and expression of HNF4. Furthermore, a GC-rich sequence was also important for maximal activation of the VLACSR gene because the mutated GC-rich sequence reduced its basal promoter activity. It was reported that HNF4 and Sp1, a prototypical GC box-binding protein, binds to promoter regions of genes, including apolipoprotein C-III and CYP27, and increases their expression (23, 24). In the mouse VLACSR promoter, HNF4 can still activate promoter activity when mutations were introduced into the GC box, but the resultant activity was much lower when compared with that of the wild-type promoter. This result indicates that cooperative binding of HNF4 and Sp1 to the promoter might be required for maximal induction of VLACSR expression in the liver. Furthermore, the expression of sterol carrier protein x, which is involved in the side chain -oxidation of BA, was also reduced in liver-specific HNF4-null mice, and Sp1 was identified as a critical factor regulating the sterol carrier protein x gene in an HNF4-independent manner (data not shown). Because expression of Sp1 and Sp3, typical GC box-binding proteins, was unchanged and VLACSR expression is markedly reduced in liver-specific HNF4-null mice (data not shown), post-transcriptional modification of Sp1 and/or Sp3 could reduce the expression of VLACSR in these null mice..

Actually, neither VLACSR nor BAT gene was induced in wild-type mice treated with cholic acid, a ligand for FXR (data not shown). Unlike other nuclear receptors including FXR, HNF4 is constitutively activated in vivo and in vitro without exogenous compounds (9). Thus, HNF4 positively regulates the basal levels of expression of the VLACSR and BAT genes.

We have examined whether chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF), a member of the orphan nuclear receptor family of transcription factors, is involved in this transcriptional regulation. We analyzed COUP-TF and StAR mRNA and protein levels in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells in primary culture. COUP-TF protein was readily detectable in nonstimulated cells, and AngII markedly reduced its expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 1 nM), to 46  plus or minus  4.4% of control levels after 6 h, (n = 3; P  <  0.01). This repression was paralleled by a marked decrease in COUP-TF mRNA levels, reaching 18  plus or minus  8.8% of controls (n = 3, P  <  0.01) after 6 h and by a 20-fold increase in aldosterone output. In bovine glomerulosa cells overexpressing COUP-TFI and -II, the induction of StAR mRNA and protein elicited by AngII was completely suppressed to control levels, and the aldosterone response was significantly reduced (from 4.8  plus or minus  1.1-fold the basal value in mock-infected cells to 1.9  plus or minus  0.5-fold and 2.2  plus or minus  0.7-fold in COUP-TFI- and COUP-TFII-expressing cells, respectively; n = 3; P  <  0.01 for both differences). Finally, by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we have shown a direct interaction between COUP-TF and the proximal StAR promoter. These results suggest that COUP-TF exerts a tonic inhibition on steroidogenesis by repressing StAR protein expression and that activators of aldosterone biosynthesis lift this inhibition in part by repressing COUP-TF levels..

Aldosterone is synthesized from cholesterol, the common precursor of all steroid hormones, which is stored within intracellular lipid droplets as cholesterol esters and mobilized to the mitochondrion by cholesterol ester hydrolase upon stimulation (2). The rate-limiting step in the activation of steroidogenesis is the delivery of cholesterol from the mitochondrial outer membrane to the inner membrane, where the cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme is located (3). Within the mitochondria, cholesterol undergoes an enzymatic cascade leading eventually to the formation of aldosterone..

Indeed, in human NCI-H295R adrenocortical carcinoma cells, hormone-stimulated StAR protein synthesis and steroid production are prevented by inhibition of RNA synthesis (7). In bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells in primary culture, mimicking the calcium signal gener ated by AngII leads to increased expression of StAR mRNA and protein (8). Similarly, treatment of human NCI-H295R cells with AngII results in an increase in StAR mRNA levels within 30 min, with maximal levels being reached within 6 h (7, 9). These results clearly indicate a transcriptional regulation of AngII on StAR gene expression. Various consensus response elements have been identified in the StAR gene promoter (10). Although promoter mapping studies have provided extensive information on activators of the StAR gene, the role of transcription factors that repress StAR protein expression has received less attention. The best characterized repressor of the StAR gene is DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1), a member of the orphan nuclear receptor family (11, 12, 13). Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that AngII powerfully represses DAX-1 expression in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells, thus leading to increased StAR expression and aldosterone production (14)..

These orphan members of the steroid receptor superfamily play distinct and crucial roles in fetal development of the nervous (17) and cardiovascular (18) systems. In addition to these well-established developmental effects in fetal life, the following pieces of evidence suggest a direct or indirect interaction between COUP-TF and the promoter of the StAR gene and thus an involvement of COUP-TF in adult steroidogenic cell function. First, COUP-TF colocalizes in the nuclei of the adrenal cells with DAX-1 and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), two transcription factors involved in steroidogenesis and in StAR regulation, and its expression is modulated in adrenocortical adenomas, COUP-TFI being lower in aldosterone-producing tumors than in normal tissue (19, 20) and COUP-TFII appearing to be increased in aldosteronoma cells (21). In normal adrenocortical tissue, COUP-TFI and -II expression levels appear to be qualitatively equivalent (20). Second, it has been recently shown that SF-1 and COUP-TF can activate and repress, respectively, bovine CYP17 gene transcription in Y-1 mouse adrenocortical cells (22, 23). Third, a similar competition between SF-1 and COUP-TF for a composite binding site has been demonstrated for other genes involved in steroidogenesis, including human aldosterone synthase, aromatase, and murine DAX-1 genes (23, 24, 25). Taken together, these data raise the question of a possible negative role of COUP-TF in the regulation of StAR gene expression..

Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1A, a robust COUP-TF signal was detected upon Western blot analysis of nuclear proteins from nonstimulated cells. When glomerulosa cells were challenged for 6 h with AngII, a concentration-dependent decrease in COUP-TF protein levels was observed, an inhibition to 46  plus or minus  4.4% of control levels being reached with 10 nM AngII (n = 3; P  <  0.01; Fig. 1B). Cultured bovine glomerulosa cells produced significant amounts of aldosterone into the medium (2.36  plus or minus  0.2 fmol/ microg protein/6 h), and AngII stimulation for 6 h increased aldosterone production 20-fold to 44.9  plus or minus  5.2 fmol/ microg/6 h (n = 3; P  <  0.01; Fig. 1C). A similar activation of aldosterone production was obtained with forskolin, used as a mimicker of ACTH, to 42.2  plus or minus  1.5 fmol/ microg/6 h (n = 3; P  <  0.01; Fig. 1C). To determine the kinetics of the effect of AngII on COUP-TF protein expression, we incubated glomerulosa cells with 10 nM AngII for various periods of time ranging from 0 to 15 h. As shown in Fig. 2, the inhibitory effect of AngII was time dependent: COUP-TF protein levels started to decrease after 30 min, and a complete abolition was reached within 15 h of treatment..

To determine whether de novo protein synthesis is required for AngII-mediated COUP-TF repression, we treated bovine glomerulosa cells for 6 h with 10 nM AngII in the presence of 10  microg/ml cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. Blockade of protein synthesis affected neither the inhibitory effect of AngII on COUP-TF mRNA expression (Fig. 3, A and B) nor its repression of COUP-TF protein levels in glomerulosa cells (Fig. 3, C and D). These observations suggest that de novo protein synthesis is not required for AngII-induced repression of COUP-TF. In this same series of experiments, forskolin was as potent as AngII in repressing COUP-TF mRNA (data not shown) and protein levels (Fig. 3, C and D)..

Indeed, HIV-derived lentiviral vectors efficiently integrate into nondividing cells (31, 32). Because bovine glomerulosa cells in primary culture are practically quiescent and in view of the relatively low transfection efficacy obtained in these cells with the usual transfection reagents, we used HIV-derived vectors to overexpress COUP-TFI and -II in glomerulosa cells. We first infected bovine glomerulosa cells with lentiviral vectors encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of the human phospholgycerate kinase (hPGK) promoter. The infected cells were analyzed for GFP fluorescence by flow-cytometric analysis 5 d after infection. Ninety-one percent of the cells infected with 500 ng p24 expressed GFP (data not shown). Bovine glomerulosa cells in primary culture were then infected with lentiviral vectors encoding for murine COUP-TFI or COUP-TFII under control of the hPGK promoter. Five days after infection, cells were incubated in the presence of 10 nM AngII for 6 h, and StAR, COUP-TFI, and COUP-TFII mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR with bovine- and mouse-specific primers. As expected, no endogenous signal was detected in noninfected and mock-infected cells because we used murine probes (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the infected cells displayed robust expression of mouse COUP-TFI and -II mRNA, as determined by RT-PCR with mouse-specific primers. As shown in Fig. 5B, AngII treatment for 6 h induced an increase of StAR mRNA levels in noninfected and mock-infected cells [to 172  plus or minus  14% and 165  plus or minus  10% of controls, respectively (n = 3; P  <  0.01; for both values)]. This increase was entirely blocked in cells overexpressing either COUP-TFI [104  plus or minus  12% of controls; n = 3; not significantly different (NS; P  >  0.05)] or COUP-TFII (82  plus or minus  24% of controls; n = 3; NS) (Fig. 5, A and B)..

Five days after infection, cells were incubated in the presence of 10 nM AngII for 6 h, and StAR, COUP-TFI, and COUP-TFII mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR with bovine- and mouse-specific primers. As expected, no endogenous signal was detected in noninfected and mock-infected cells because we used murine probes (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the infected cells displayed robust expression of mouse COUP-TFI and -II mRNA, as determined by RT-PCR with mouse-specific primers. As shown in Fig. 5B, AngII treatment for 6 h induced an increase of StAR mRNA levels in noninfected and mock-infected cells [to 172  plus or minus  14% and 165  plus or minus  10% of controls, respectively (n = 3; P  <  0.01; for both values)].

In man, recent studies have shown that COUP-TF expression is inversely correlated with steroid production in adrenocortical tumors (20). These data suggested that this transcription factor could function as a repressor of steroidogenesis and that the mechanism of action of physiological activators of steroid production, such as AngII or ACTH (mimicked by forskolin), could operate, in part, through a reduction of COUP-TF protein levels.

Because the StAR protein controls the rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis, we hypothesized that COUP-TF might act at this level. COUP-TF is known to negatively regulate the transcriptional activity of SF-1 and to repress various actors in the steroidogenic cascade (23, 34), such as the gene encoding cytochrome P450 steroid 17-hydroxylase, by competing with SF-1 for the binding to repeated cAMP-responsive sequences spaced by six nucleotides (repCRS2) (35). Furthermore, COUP-TF and SF-1 have also been shown to bind to overlapping binding sites involved in the regulation of the oxytocin gene in the bovine ovary (36). Although multiple SF-1 binding elements required for hormonal induction have been identified in the StAR protein gene 5'-flanking promoter region (10, 37, 38), COUP-TF has not been reported, so far, to bind to the StAR promoter or to affect its activity. Interestingly, our laboratory has demonstrated recently that the levels of another orphan nuclear receptor, DAX-1, which is known to repress StAR protein expression also by interacting negatively with SF-1 either directly or indirectly (12), are down-regulated by AngII and forskolin in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells and that this effect is correlated inversely with StAR protein expression and aldosterone biosynthesis (14)..

0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	56	We therefore examined whether COUP-TF could repress StAR expression levels by overexpressing the transcription factor in bovine glomerulosa cells. To overcome the usually low rates of efficiency observed in these cells when utilizing classical transfection reagents, we have used an HIV-derived lentiviral system yielding high levels of gene delivery in primary cells (27, 28). Indeed, infected bovine glomerulosa cells expressed high amounts of exogenous, murine COUP-TFI and -II mRNA that could be distinguished from endogenous COUP-TF mRNAs by using species-specific primers for the RT-PCR amplification. Moreover, we show here that overexpression of either isoform of COUP-TF resulted in a complete suppression of AngII-induced StAR mRNA and protein induction, a finding strongly suggesting a direct or indirect repressor role for COUP-TF on StAR promoter activity. These results were indeed confirmed by luciferase reporter gene assay of the StAR promoter in cells overexpressing COUP-TF, which showed a dramatic reduction in AngII-induced StAR promoter activity. COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII were equally effective in repressing StAR mRNA expression, although only the latter has been shown to be expressed in the cortex of the adrenal gland during organogenesis in mice (18). However, both COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII have been shown to be present in normal and tumoral human adrenocortical tissue in immunohistological studies (19, 21), and we observed a similar expression pattern of the mRNA of both isoforms in bovine glomerulosa cells (data not shown)..

Interestingly, overexpression of COUP-TFs did not affect either basal StAR expression or basal aldosterone production. This result was actually expected, in view of the robust expression of endogenous COUP-TFs in bovine glomerulosa cells, which presumably already exert a maximal repressor effect on these parameters in the resting state. Only under conditions of stimulation with AngII, when endogenous COUP-TFs are repressed, is the effect of overexpressing exogenous COUP-TF visible, preventing the normal StAR induction and steroid production elicited by the hormone. In addition, COUP-TF is certainly not the sole regulator of StAR expression, and other factors, such as DAX-1 and SF-1 (14), most probably also contribute to basal StAR gene expression. This finding is also in agreement with clinical observations showing that COUP-TFI and -II protein levels are markedly reduced in steroid-producing human adrenal tumors, as assessed by Western blot analysis (19), but contrasts with immunohistological observations indicating that COUP-TFII is highly expressed in nuclei of aldosteronoma cells (21).

Challenge of glomerulosa cells with physiological activators of mineralocorticoid production lifts this inhibition by reducing COUP-TF protein levels and COUP-TF binding to the StAR promoter, thus allowing the StAR protein to be expressed in higher amounts, intramitochondrial cholesterol transfer to occur and, eventually, aldosterone synthesis to proceed..

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	4	The tissue-specific transcription factor HNF1[alpha] is expressed in kidney, liver, intestine and stomach of Xenopus. We show that the HNF1[alpha] gene is transcriptionally activated at the onset of zygotic gene transcription and that this transcription is maintained throughout development. Ectodermal explants of blastulae (animal caps) express HNF1[alpha] mRNA upon stimulation with the mesoderm inducers activin A and BMP4 as well as on overexpression of Smad2 and Smad1, the corresponding members of the intracellular TGF-[beta] signal transducers, respectively. Beside these factors that mediate their response through serine/threonine kinase receptors, bFGF, which acts via tyrosine kinase receptors, leads to HNF1[alpha] expression, too. These embryonic inducers result in a delayed appearance of HNF1[alpha] mRNA, excluding a direct activation of HNF1[alpha]. In contrast, the maternally expressed nuclear receptors HNF4[alpha] and HNF4[beta] activate the initial HNF1[alpha] transcription, since overexpression of HNF4 leads to a rapid expression of HNF1[alpha] mRNA in animal caps. Similarly, in entire neurulae HNF4 overexpression results in increased HNF1[alpha] transcription. Therefore, we assume that the initial activation is dependent on maternal HNF4[alpha] and HNF4[beta] transcription factors whereas HNF1[alpha] induction by growth factors reflects the property of these factors to induce the differentiation of mesodermal and entodermal cell types expressing HNF1[alpha]..

These inductive factors are fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and members of the transforming growth factor [beta] (TGF-[beta]) family, with bFGF and activin A or Vg1 as the most significant members (2-6). Whereas the FGF signal is received by membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptors, TGF-[beta]s act exclusively through serine/threonine kinases on the cell surface (7). Intracellular TGF-[beta] signalling involves a class of proteins referred to as Smad proteins (7-10). In Xenopus embryos, Smad1 and Smad2 overexpression in the animal cap mimics the effect of the TGF-[beta] family members BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein) and activin A, respectively (11,12). In general, the Smad proteins seem to be phosphorylated at C-terminal serine residues by the activated type I receptor (13,14), form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 (15) and migrate into the nucleus, where they regulate the expression of TGF-[beta]-responsive genes by direct interaction with specific transcription factors (16).

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	10	In an approach to link maternal components with the transcriptional activation of a tissue-specific transcription factor we have investigated the expression of HNF1[alpha] in Xenopus (17-19). This tissue-specific transcription factor found in all vertebrates is expressed in endodermal tissues such as liver, gut and stomach but also in the kidney, a mesodermal derivative (17,20). As binding sites for HNF1[alpha] are present in several genes specifically expressed in these tissues, it is assumed that HNF1[alpha] participates in the establishment of the differentiated state. Previously, we showed by RNase protection analysis that the first HNF1[alpha] transcripts appear at the gastrula stage and therefore HNF1[alpha] gene transcription is zygotically activated (17). To reveal the regulatory elements involved in HNF1[alpha] gene activation we injected promoter constructs into fertilized eggs. We identified a minimal promoter fragment of the Xenopus gene sufficient for proper activation of the reporter gene in swimming larvae (18,19). The promoter elements mediating gene activation appear to be conserved in vertebrate evolution as the injected rat HNF1[alpha] promoter is also regulated in Xenopus. By mutational analysis of the minimal regulatory unit of the Xenopus HNF1[alpha] promoter, an OZ element, two HNF1 binding sites and one binding site for HNF4 were characterized as regulatory elements (18,19). The HNF4 binding site seems to play a predominant role, as it is not only sufficient but also essential for activation of the reporter gene (18). HNF4 is encoded in a small gene family, with HNF4[alpha] and HNF4[beta] identified in Xenopus (21,22). Both HNF4 proteins are expressed maternally and are present in a gradient from the animal to the vegetal pole (22). Overexpression of rat HNF4[alpha] in Xenopus leads to the ectopic appearance of HNF1[alpha] protein in the head and tail of swimming larvae (18). These data support the assumption that HNF4 resides on the top of a transcriptional cascade leading to activation of the HNF1[alpha] gene during embryogenesis. Since ectopic HNF1[alpha] expression was analyzed only in swimming larvae, when organogenesis is already established, it is not known whether HNF4 is able to activate initial HNF1[alpha] transcription in embryogenesis..

By RT-PCR (Fig. 1) we revealed that HNF1[alpha] transcripts are absent in the early cleaving embryo between the fertilized egg (stage 1) and the mid blastula (stage 8) stages, whereas the first transcripts are detectable at the late blastula (stage 9) stage corresponding to the initiation of zygotic gene transcription in Xenopus (31). The amount of transcript remains constant up to the late gastrula (stage 12) stage and increases by ~100-fold during further development up to the swimming larva (stage 42) stage. The amount of ODC mRNA, known to remain constant in Xenopus development (32), was similar in all RNA samples..

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	31	To analyze whether the maternal inducer activin A might initiate HNF1[alpha] expression we investigated at what time point activin A treatment leads to HNF1[alpha] gene transcription in explants of the animal pole of the balstula (animal caps). Using RT-PCR we detected HNF1[alpha] mRNA in animal pole explants at 72 h after treatment with activin A (data not shown). This late appearance of HNF1[alpha] mRNA is very similar to the induction we have seen previously when analyzing the effect at the protein level (23). As treatment of animal pole explants with activin A in conjunction with retinoic acid enhances activin A-dependent HNF1[alpha] protein induction (23), we determined the time point of HNF1[alpha] gene activation by activin A in the presence of retinoic acid. As indicated in Figure 2 the first HNF1[alpha] transcripts are detectable after 24 h of incubation (lane 4). Since under these conditions both goosecoid and brachyury transcripts are visible already after 3 h of treatment (lane 2), HNF1[alpha] expression cannot be an immediate response to activin A signalling. As Smad2 is known to be an intracellular mediator of activin A signalling (7,33), we analyzed whether the introduction of this downstream effector might also activate HNF1[alpha] gene transcription. Using an mRNA encoding a Flag tagged Smad2 protein we could verify in a western blot using a Flag tag-specific monoclonal antibody that Smad2 protein was present in the injected embryos at the time of animal cap explantation (Fig. 3, lanes 3-8). To analyze expression of HNF1[alpha] mRNA in these Smad2-injected animal caps, total RNA from the explants was isolated at different time points of culturing. Based on RT-PCR analysis HNF1[alpha] transcripts were absent in animal caps derived from Smad2 mRNA-injected embryos after 0, 3 and 6 h of incubation (Fig. 3, lanes 3-5). The first few HNF1[alpha] transcripts appeared after 24 h (lane 6). Their amount rose to a maximum (lane 7, 48 h) and remained at this level after 72 h of culture (lane 8). The same level of HNF1[alpha] induction was observed in uninjected animal caps treated with activin A for 72 h (lane 2)..

Using RT-PCR we detected HNF1[alpha] mRNA in animal pole explants at 72 h after treatment with activin A (data not shown). This late appearance of HNF1[alpha] mRNA is very similar to the induction we have seen previously when analyzing the effect at the protein level (23).

A loss-of-function study to test this assumption is difficult to perform, since HNF4 protein is already present in the egg and thus RNA depletion experiments are not possible. Therefore, we introduced a fusion protein containing the HNF4 DNA binding domain and the putative ligand binding domain linked to the repressor domain of even-skipped of Drosophila into fertilized eggs. Although this HNF4 repressor acted efficiently in hepatoma cells and was expressed at high levels in the injected embryos, we could not detect a significant reduction in endogenous HNF1[alpha] mRNA accumulation (data not shown). We assume that the level of HNF4 repressor translated prior to the MBT is not sufficient to compete with the amount of maternal HNF4[alpha] and [beta] proteins (18,22) that had accumulated during several months of oocyte maturation. In contrast, in all experiments where dominant negative variants of transcription factors have been successfully used to repress endogenous factors, e.g. brachyury or eomesodermin (44,45), the inhibition involved zygotically accumulated trans-cription factors. In these cases inhibition is probably facilitated as the embryo is preloaded with the repressors prior to expression of the zygotic factor to be inhibited..

A loss-of-function study to test this assumption is difficult to perform, since HNF4 protein is already present in the egg and thus RNA depletion experiments are not possible. Therefore, we introduced a fusion protein containing the HNF4 DNA binding domain and the putative ligand binding domain linked to the repressor domain of even-skipped of Drosophila into fertilized eggs. Although this HNF4 repressor acted efficiently in hepatoma cells and was expressed at high levels in the injected embryos, we could not detect a significant reduction in endogenous HNF1[alpha] mRNA accumulation (data not shown).

This is in contrast to experiments done with the myogenic transcription factor MyoD: in this case only murine MyoD activated ectopic expression of myogenic markers in Xenopus embryos, whereas overexpressed Xenopus MyoD was hardly active (27). Thus, in contrast to MyoD, the activity of HNF4 is species independent, indicating the high degree of functional conservation of the HNF4 family members in vertebrates (18,21,22)..

The superfamily includes receptors for a variety of small hydrophobic ligands such as steroids, T3, and retinoids, as well as a large number of related proteins that do not have known ligands, referred to as orphan nuclear receptors (2). The receptor proteins are direct regulators of transcription that function by binding to specific DNA sequences named hormone response elements (HREs) in promoters of target genes. Nearly all the superfamily members bind as dimers to HREs. A dimerization interface has previously been identified within the DNA-binding domains (DBDs) of retinoid X receptors (RXRs), retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, and thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) that selectively promotes DNA binding to cognate HREs (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). An additional dimerization interface that mediates cooperative binding to DNA, referred to as the I-box, has recently been mapped to a 40-amino acid region within the C-terminal ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of RAR, TR, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter (COUP-TF), RXR, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) (9, 10). The two dimerization domains appear to work in tandem and led to a two-step hypothesis for binding of dimers to DNA (2, 9). According to this hypothesis, the LBD dimerization interface initiates the formation of solution dimers that, in turn, acquire the capacity to bind to a number of differently organized HREs. However, formation of a second dimer interface within the DBD restricts receptors to bind to only cognate HREs (2, 9)..

Based on this high-affinity binding, such heterodimers have been considered to be the functionally active forms of these receptors in vivo. However, RXR is not the only receptor capable of forming heterodimers with other nuclear receptors. TR (17, 18), COUP-TF (19, 20, 21), PPAR (22), and small heterodimer partner (SHP) (23) have been reported to form heterodimers with other receptors. Interestingly, although heterodimerization with RXR usually results in enhanced transactivation, COUP-TF and SHP seem to function primarily as transcriptional repressors (23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28). Heterodimer formation can generate many different combinations of receptors, particularly in the light of the fact that multiple genes and multiple isoforms exist for RAR, RXR, TR, COUP-TF, and PPAR. As the expression of each isoform depends on cell type and the stage of growth and development, heterodimerization among all these receptors results in the formation of an extremely diverse group of receptors. In principle, the enormous number of heterodimer combinations could cover a wide range of transcriptional activities, thus generating significant diversity in gene regulation..

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	9	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   ER Interacts with a Subset of Nuclear Receptors in Yeast We found that coexpression of a previously described B42/RXR-LBD hybrid (33) stimulates the LexA/ER-LBD (a LexA fusion protein with the LBD of ER)-mediated LacZ reporter gene expression in the yeast two-hybrid tests, suggesting that ER-LBD interacts with RXR-LBD (Fig. 1A). This LacZ expression was further stimulated approximately 1.5-fold in the presence of 1  microM 9-cis-RA. We further found that the LexA/ER-LBD-mediated LacZ expression was stimulated when coexpressed with analogous B42 fusions to several receptors, including RAR, TR, HNF4, and ERss, suggesting that ER also interacts with these receptors (Fig. 1A). The expression was slightly enhanced by 1  microM T3 with the B42/TR coexpression, whereas it was significantly stimulated by 1  microM E2 with the B42/ERss coexpression (3-fold) (Fig. 1A). In addition, we showed that an inert transactivator LexA/ERss stimulated the LacZ reporter gene expression approximately 6.5-fold when coexpressed with B42/ERss, confirming the recently reported ERss homodimerization (29, 30) in this yeast system (Fig. 1A). In contrast, coexpression of B42 alone or B42 fusions to the LBDs of TRss, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), or the orphan receptor CAR (34) did not stimulate the LexA/ER-LBD-mediated LacZ expression, attesting to the specificity of these interactions. Similarly, expressions of all the B42 fusions alone, with no LexA fusion coexpressed, were transcriptionally inert with the LacZ reporter (data not shown). However, the B42/TR-LBD coexpression stimulated the LexA/ER-LBD-mediated LacZ expression approximately 2.5-fold in the presence of 1  microM T3, raising the possibility that TR-LBD may contain a T3-inducible interaction domain with ER. From these results, we concluded that ER-LBD may interact with RAR, RXR-LBD, TR, TRss-LBD (only in the presence of T3), HNF4-LBD, and ERssL, in which LBDs are likely to be sufficient. It is noteworthy that the LacZ expression strength by coexpression of these ER heterocomplexes was generally comparable to that of the previously described TR/RXR heterodimer (33) (Fig. 1B, compare with the results of LexA/TR-LBD and B42/RXR-LBD). Overall, the similarities in the pattern of interactions observed with LexA/ER-LBD and LexA/RXR-LBD (33, 35, 36) strongly suggest that ER, like the RXRs, is a common interaction partner for members of the receptor superfamily..

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	14	  To confirm whether various ligand-dependent stimulations of the LacZ expressions observed reflect genuine ligand-dependent protein-protein interactions or simply ligand-dependent transactivations mediated by the AF2 domains (1), we reexamined the LacZ expressions with two previously defined AF2 mutant receptors, LexA/TR-LBD459 (33) and B42/RXR-LBDAF2 (36). As shown in Fig. 1B, the 9-cis-RA-dependent induction of the LacZ expression observed with coexpression of B42/RXR-LBD and LexA/TR-LBD was lost when B42/RXR-LBDAF2 was coexpressed instead, whereas the T3-dependent induction was specifically lost when LexA/TR-LBD459 was used. When LexA/TR-LBD459 and B42/RXR-LBDAF2 were coexpressed, neither T3 nor 9-cis-RA-depedent induction of the LacZ expression was observed. These results, along with our previous finding (33) in which the interactions of LexA/TR and B42/RXR were not affected by mutations into the AF2 domain of TR, clearly demonstrate that protein-protein interaction of TR and RXR are ligand independent. Therefore, results of the yeast two-hybrid tests should be taken with caution that they may not represent true ligand-dependent interactions. Thus, we further characterized these interactions using two additional methods (i.e. mammalian two-hybrid tests and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-pull downs)..
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	15	ER Interacts with TR, RAR, and RXR in Mammalian Cells To examine whether ER binds to these receptors in mammalian cells, we employed a mammalian two-hybrid system that reproduces the heteromeric receptor-receptor interactions (37). As shown in Fig. 2, cotransfection of CV1 cells with expression vectors for VP16/TR, VP16/RAR, and VP16/RXR significantly increased the Gal4/ER-LBD-mediated induction of the Gal4-TK-Luc reporter gene activity (4-, 7.5-, and 9.5-fold induction, respectively). Similar results were obtained in the presence of 0.1  microM cognate ligand, suggesting that they interact with each other in a ligand-independent manner. As expected, VP16 alone was ineffective. Thus, we concluded that ER is capable of constitutively binding to TR, RAR, and RXR in mammalian cells. These results suggest that the various ligand-dependent stimulations of the LacZ expression in yeast (Fig. 1A) may have reflected ligand-dependent transactivations of the AF2 domains, as suggested by the results shown in Fig. 1B..

As expected, luciferase was not able to interact with any of the GST proteins (data not shown). However, ER readily interacted with GST/TR, GST/RAR, and GST/RXR either in the presence or absence of ligand (Fig. 3, A, B and C). ER didn t interact with GST alone or GST/GR, as expected. In contrast, ER bound to GST fusion to the receptor-binding domain of SRC-1 (GST/SRC-R) (38) in an E2-stimulated manner (Fig. 3D). The percentage of total [35S]ER bound by the fusion proteins were approximately 15 to 30% of the inputs (data not shown), and the E2-dependent fold-increase in the pull-down of [35S]ER by GST/SRC-R was approximately 4- to 5-fold.

To gain insights into the functional consequences of these interactions in vivo, we coexpressed holo-proteins of these ER-interacting receptors in the LexA/ER-LBD-expressing yeast cells. Interestingly, RAR, RARss, RXRss, TR, or TRss dramatically enhanced the basal transcriptional activities of LexA/ER-LBD (Fig. 4). Coexpression of RAR led to approximately 2-fold induction in the basal transcriptional activities, which was further enhanced approximately 2-fold by addition of 1  microM 9-cis-RA. Interestingly, coexpression of RXR or RXR induced the LexA/ER-LBD-mediated LacZ expression only in the presence of 1  microM 9-cis-RA; i.e. the basal level of expression was not affected by coexpression of these two receptors (Fig. 4). These results indicate that coexpression of these native receptors can differentially regulate transactivations by ER in yeast, attesting to the possible functional significance of these interactions in vivo..

Addition of 0.1  microM E2 stimulated the ER-mediated reporter gene expression approximately 5- to 7-fold in the absence of cotransfected receptors. Coexpression of TR, however, significantly stimulated both the basal and E2-induced transactivations by ER (4- and 2-fold, respectively). Interestingly, a weak additive effect was observed with the TR coexpression; i.e. E2 plus T3 resulted in approximately 1.5-fold higher activities than E2 alone (Fig. 5A; see the results with 50 ng TR cotransfected). Coexpression of RAR did not affect the basal level of transactivations by ER. However, it repressed the E2-induced transactivation almost to the basal level (Fig. 5B). In contrast, coexpression of RXR modestly stimulated the E2-induced transactivations by ER. The basal level of transactivations by ER, however, was not affected by the RXR coexpression. Similarly, coexpression of ER inhibited the 9-cis-RA-induced transactivations of a reporter construct controlled by ss-retinoic acid response element (data not shown). In addition, cotransfection results varied depending on cell types and receptor isotypes, suggesting that other factors contribute to the final phenotype of each ER heterocomplex (M.-O. Lee, unpublished results). These results, along with the yeast coexpression results (Fig. 4), suggest that these ER heterocomplexes can differentially modulate the ER-mediated transcriptional activites in vivo..

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	36	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   It has been demonstrated that control of E2-responsive gene regulation can be quite complex (reviewed in Ref. 39). Several lines of evidence indicated that gene regulation by E2 and ERE involves not only ER but also other transcription factors. For example, other nuclear receptors such as TR, RXR, COUP-TF, ERR1, and RAR have been shown to interact with EREs in addition to their cognate response elements (40, 41, 42). In this report, we have clearly shown that ER, along with RXR, is a common interaction partner for a subset of receptors, suggesting that E2-responsive gene regulation may also involve direct protein-protein interactions with other nuclear receptors. In particular, it is an interesting possibility that these different ER heterocomplexes may mediate novel signaling pathways through their own DNA-binding sites that are distinct from the conventional EREs. In contrast to the broad positive effects of RXR, these ER heterointeractions led to differential regulation of the transactivations by ER (Figs. 4 and 5). In addition, cotransfection results dramatically varied depending on cell types (CV1 vs. MCF7 cells, for instance) and receptor isotypes (M.-O. Lee, unpublished results). These differential regulations may result from direct bindings of ER heterodimers to ERE, which either positively or negatively regulates E2-induced gene expression. Alternatively, formation of a non ERE-binding heterodimer may simply inhibit E2-induced gene expression or allow other positive- or negative-acting proteins to occupy EREs instead. Despite our extensive efforts, however, we were not able to find any intermediate heterodimer bindings or inhibitions of ER bindings to ERE by these ER-interacting receptors in electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) (data not shown). Similarly, heterodimers of COUP-TF/ER (31), ERR1/ER (32), and SHP/ER (D. D. Moore, personal communications) readily detected in solution were not observed to bind EREs in EMSA. In parallel, two recent reports showed interaction of COUP-TF with orphan receptors nurr77 (20) and HNF4 (21) only in solution but not when bound to DNA. These results are consistent with the possibility that these ER/receptors may bind EREs as a heterodimer or a higher-order complex not stable enough to sustain in EMSA. These weak complexes may show distinct phenotypes by differentially interacting with other proteins such as recently defined transcription cofactors, which are often receptor- and cell type-specific (reviewed in Ref. 43). Consistent with this possibility, xSRC-3, an SRC-1 homolog we recently isolated from Xenopus, was found to show unexpected specificity in tissue distribution and receptor interactions (44)..
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	37	Even though the oligomeric status of the ER heterocomplexes are not currently known, two lines of evidence attest to the specificity of the protein-protein interactions between ER and these receptors. First, a series of chimeric HNF4s we recently constructed to define the HNF4 homodimeric interactions and RXR heterodimeric interactions (10) differentially interacted with ER (our unpublished results). Second, we isolated a few mutant RXRs that show specifically impaired interactions with ER while maintaining wild-type interactions with other receptors (our unpublished results). Similar to the chimeric HNF4s, these mutations also reside within the I-box of the RXR, which was recently found to be essential for homo- and heterodimer formations (9, 10), suggesting that HNF4 and RXR exploit the conventional dimerization domains (the I-box) to interact with ER. Recently, the DNA-binding pattern of the RXR was shown to be regulated by ligand-dependent modulation of its oligomeric state (dimer vs. tetramer), and the tetramerization domain was defined to be distinct from the dimerization domain I-box (45). Thus, further mutational studies within this newly defined tetramerization domain of RXR, as well as mapping the regions of ER essential for these interactions, will be required to clearly decode the oligomeric status of these ER heterocomplexes..

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	39	The LexA-based yeast two-hybrid system presents two possible complications to study protein-protein interactions. First, the full-length LexA used in this system contains its own dimerization domain, which could complicate interpretation of the interaction results, particularly where dimerization is a prerequisite for two target proteins to interact with each other. Second, this system cannot distinguish between genuine ligand-dependent protein-protein interactions and ligand-dependent transactivations. For instance, the ligand-induced stimulations of the LacZ expressions when LexA/TR and B42/RXR-LBD were coexpressed were shown to reflect ligand-dependent transactivations mediated by the AF2 domains of TR and RXR (Fig. 1B). With these complications, other methods such as the GST pull-downs should be employed to probe protein-protein interactions. The interactions of ER with TR, RAR, and RXR were hormone-independent in both mammalian two-hybrid tests and GST pull-downs, suggesting that the seemingly hormone-dependent interactions in yeast (Fig. 1) may have been the hormone-dependent transactivations of the AF2 domains. The T3-dependent stimulation of the LacZ expression with TR-LBD and ER-LBD coexpressed (Fig. 1A) may have also reflected the T3-dependent transactivations of the AF2 domain of TR. The basal interactions between these proteins might have been too low to detect in the yeast system, which, however, became detectable with an aid from the activated transactivations of the AF2 domain upon T3 addition (Fig. 1A; see the results with LexA/ER-LBD and B42/TR-LBD)..

For instance, manipulations of T3 and E2in vitro were shown to potentiate or mutually inhibit effects of gene expression (40, 46, 47). Environmental conditions that alter levels of circulating T3, such as cold temperature, were also shown to alter E2-dependent female reproductive behavior (48, 49, 50, 51). TR was recently shown to attenuate ER-mediated transactivations from the vit A2 consensus ERE, which is not necessarily dependent on DNA binding, as the TR DNA-binding mutant was still able to inhibit E2-dependent transactivation (52, 53). However, under similar conditions, we observed a modest enhancement of the ERE-mediated transactivations by either liganded or unliganded ER when cotransfected with TR (Fig. 5). The reasons for this discrepancy are not currently known. In addition, retinoids have been shown to inhibit the growth of hormone-dependent breast cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro (54, 55, 56). Nonadditive inhibition has been demonstrated between retinoids and antiestrogens, suggesting that each agent may produce common antiestrogenic effects. Recently, synergistic interactions between HNF3 and HNF4 mediating apolipoprotein AI gene expression were shown to be further potentiated by cotransfected ER (57), in which the physical association of ER and HNF4, as described in this report, may play a role. However, the physiological implications for the ER/SHP (D. D. Moore, personal communications), ER/COUP-TF (31), and ER/ERR1 (32) interactions are not currently known..

LexA or B42 fusions to the LBDs of GR, CAR, HNF4, RXR and TRss as well as a B42 fusion to full-length RAR were as previously described (10, 33, 35, 36). The entire hinge and ligand-binding domains (D, E, and F; amino acids 245 to 595) of the human ER were subcloned into EcoRI and SalI sites of the LexA-vector by PCR using EcoRI and XhoI-site bearing primers to construct LexA/ER-LBD. LexA or B42 fusions to full-length mouse ERss (a gift from Dr. Vincent Giguere) or human TR were similarly constructed. Yeast expression vectors, YEP-RXR, YEP-RXRss, YEP-RXR, YEP-RAR, YEP-RARss, YEP-RAR, YEP-TR, and YEP-TRss were as described (33, 59).

0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	2	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted morphogen that regulates dorso-ventral patterning within the neural tube during embryonic development. It is well established that Shh can induce motor-neuron differentiation that coincides with the appearance of specific motor-neuron markers including chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) and Isl1. However, the mechanism of Shh-induced signaling pathway in vertebrates is not clearly defined. In this report we have identified COUP-TFII as a target gene for Shh. In addition we have used a 1.6-kb region of the COUP-TFII promoter to identify a target element that mediates the Shh-induced activity. Extensive deletions introduced within this region have further enabled us to identify a novel sonic hedgehog response element (ShhRE) in the COUP-TFII promoter. Point mutations introduced within the ShhRE reveal some key nucleotides that are essential for protein(s)-binding activity. Finally, the ShhRE is capable of functioning as a true enhancer element and can mediate Shh-induced transactivation of reporter gene via a heterologous promoter..

0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	4	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Sonic hedgehog Shh is a vertebrate member of the Drosophila segment polarity gene family and is a secreted morphogen that is responsible for providing the ventralizing signals within the neural tube (1, 2). The Drosophila homolog of Shh, called hedgehog (Hh), is expressed as a 471-amino acid polypeptide that is subsequently cleaved at amino acid 257 by a unique autoproteolytic mechanism (3). The C terminus of Hh harbors this proteolytic activity, and the N terminus, which includes the signal peptide sequence, is the secreted form of the protein. Several reports indicate that the N-terminal 20-kDa protein harbors the signaling activity of this morphogen (4, 5). Similar observations have been made for its murine homolog with respect to its N-terminal activity. Consistent with this observation is the high degree of homology (94 to 99%) at the N-terminal 180 amino acids between mouse, chicken, and zebra fish members of the hedgehog gene family (1)..

This results in the suppression of the dorsalizing signals, induced by BMP-2/4 originating from the neuroectoderm (7). The appearance of ventral markers within the neural tube establishes a dorso-ventral boundary, which is broadly described as dorso-ventral patterning. The induction of motor neuron markers within the ventro-lateral region is coincident with this Shh-mediated activity in the neural tube. Jessell and co-workers (8) have demonstrated that conditioned media from COS-1 cells that overexpress and secrete Shh can mediate motor neuron differentiation in naive neural plate explants..

Two genes called COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII have been identified in mammals. COUP-TFs are capable of dimerizing with the retinoid X receptor and are known to affect the regulation of retinoic acid receptor, retinoid X receptor, and vitamin D receptor responsive genes (9). COUP-TFs in general are expressed during embryonic development and are proposed to mediate essential mesenchymal-epithelial interactions that are crucial for proper organogenesis (10). To that effect, mRNA of COUP-TFII has been detected in the mesenchymal compartment of several developing organs such as the kidney, breast, and prostate (10)..

It is hypothesized that these two genes play a role in regulating the developmental fates of diencephalic neuromeres by altering the expression of some of the key factors involved in cell fate determination (11). Most importantly, COUP-TFII mRNA is highly expressed in differentiating motor neurons within the neural tube of a developing chick embryo. Notochord transplantation experiments suggest that this increase in COUP-TFII mRNA within the ventro-lateral region of the chick neural tube is mediated by signals derived from the notochord (12). Hence, we hypothesize that Shh, a secreted morphogen derived from the notochord, can elicit this increase in COUP-TFII expression in differentiating motor neurons..

Also, these cells exhibit some characteristics of neuronal cells when treated for extended periods with all-trans retinoic acid (15). For our initial experiments, conditioned medium derived from COS-1 cells transfected with a mouse Shh expression construct was applied to P19 cells. Later, an Escherichia coli-expressed N-terminal 20-kDa Shh protein fragment was used in our studies. In this report we provide evidence that Shh can induce COUP-TFII transcripts in P19 cells and evidence to implicate a novel target element on the COUP-TFII promoter that mediates this Shh-induced activity..

Results from these experiments suggest that immunodetectable levels of the secreted 20 kDa N-terminal fragment of Shh are only present in COS-1 cell-conditioned media transfected with the pBKCMV-Shh plasmid (Fig. 1B; compare lanes 1 and 2). The N-terminal protein was used to block this antibody to corroborate its specificity (Fig. 1B; compare lanes 2 and 3). Since the signaling function of Shh is restricted to this N-terminal secreted fragment, we shall refer to this fragment as Shh for the remainder of this report..
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	21	Induction of COUP-TFII Promoter Activity by Conditioned Media Containing Shh To identify the mechanism of this Shh-mediated increase in COUP-TFII mRNA, we analyzed the effect of the Shh-containing conditioned media on the COUP-TFII promoter. A 1.6-kb promoter fragment that includes the transcription initiation site of COUP-TFII was cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene (p1.6CII-CAT) and transfected into P19 cells (13). As shown in Fig. 2 the conditioned media containing Shh (lanes 2 and 3) can increase COUP-TFII promoter activity. In a separate experiment we show that this increase can be elicited by adding 1 nM N-terminal 20-kDa Shh protein directly to COS-1 cells transfected with the p1.6CII-CAT plasmid (Fig. A; lanes 1 and 2). Hence, it can be inferred that P19 and COS-1 cells possess the necessary factors to transduce the Shh signal. These results indicate that the 1.6-kb fragment of the COUP-TFII promoter harbors the target element(s) that mediates Shh activation..

A 42-bp oligonucleotide (ShhRE) that includes this region and the flanking sequences was synthesized, and three copies of this oligo were placed upstream of a tkLUC reporter gene to determine whether this element confers Shh inducibility through a heterologous promoter. In addition, four specific mutations, M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5, were introduced along this element and three copies of each of these mutant oligos were cloned upstream of a tkLUC reporter (Fig. 4A). The resulting plasmids were then transfected into P19 cells, and reporter gene activity in response to 1 nM Shh was analyzed. As seen in Fig. 4B, three copies of ShhRE can provide a 5- to 7-fold increase in reporter gene activity in response to Shh (compare C and Shh). Also, as shown in Fig. 4B, the M2, M3, and M4 mutations abolish the Shh response (compare S and S M1, S M2, S M3). In contrast the M1 and M5 mutants were still capable of mediating this Shh-induced reporter gene activity (compare S, S M1, and S M5). These results indicate that the nucleotide sequences defined by the mutant oligos M2, M3, and M4 are important for mediating the Shh response. Hence, the point mutations introduced within the ShhRE that abolish transactivation must affect the binding of a putative transcription factor to this DNA element..

The resulting autoradiograph indicates that there are two specific bands (see arrows), which are specifically enriched by Shh treatment (Fig. 4; compare lanes 1 and 2). Also, these bands are competed by the excess unlabeled ShhRE (Fig. 5; compare lanes 2 and 8). As expected, the mutant oligos M2, M3, and M4, which fail to exhibit enhancer-like activity, also fail to compete for these specific complexes when used as competitors (Fig. 5; compare lanes 4 through 6).

In this experiment we observe that a dorso-laterally placed ectopic notochord can induce motor neurons in an ectopic location within the ventral tube, and this coincides with the appearance of COUP-TFII transcripts (12). These results suggest that notochord-derived signals can induce COUP-TFII mRNA. In this report we provide evidence to clearly indicate that COUP-TFII mRNA is up-regulated by Shh. In addition, we have defined a novel target element within the COUP-TFII promoter that mediates most of this activity. Also, the low dose of Shh, namely 1 nM, which is capable of inducing this ShhRE-mediated activity, is in close agreement with this overall effect as observed by Jessell and co-workers (16) in neural explant assays..

0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	49	The identification of this ShhRE provides us with a valuable tool to study the various signaling pathways that are induced by Shh. Previously, it was reported by Ingham and his colleagues (17) that a binding site for the Ci (cubidus interruptus) protein is a consensus HhRE (GACCACCCA), since it mediates the activation of the ptc (patched) promoter by Shh. Ptc is a downstream target gene of Hh and is part of the putative membrane-bound Shh receptor complex (18, 19, 20). However, the exact mechanism of ptc activation via this Ci element remains to be determined. Interestingly, the ShhRE found on the COUP-TFII promoter bears very little similarity to that of the Drosophila Ci binding site. In our oligo competition experiments, we demonstrate that any changes in the core sequence (TACATAATGCGCCG) are deleterious to Shh-induced binding. Also, a transcription factor data bank analysis revealed very little information as to the exact identity of the factor(s) that may bind this element. The identification of this novel response element suggests that in higher vertebrates the pleiotropic effects of Shh can be mediated by multiple pathways, some of which may target the Gli (mammalian homolog of Ci) binding site and others may target novel elements such as the one in the COUP-TFII promoter..

0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	51	As shown in Fig. 5, the DNA-binding complexes in P19 nuclear extracts are induced by Shh. The precise mechanism for this increase in binding is not known. It is possible that Shh may simply modulate the activity of this factor(s) that binds to the ShhRE. In agreement with this possible modulatory role for Shh, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) has been implicated in the Hh-signaling pathway. In Drosophila, it is believed that PKA agonists can suppress signaling mediated by Hh. Also, localized loss of PKA -/- activity in a Drosophila imaginal disc can mimic Hh activity even in the absence of Hh (21, 22). Similar results have been obtained using a dominant negative form of PKA in the mouse dorsal central nervous system (23, 24). These observations have led to the popular belief that reversal of a PKA-repressed pathway is one of the major mechanisms of Hh activity in Drosophila and in mammals. However, we do not observe a significant decrease in our transient transfection assays when COS-1 cells are treated with both Shh and forskolin (90  microM) using the 3X ShhRE-tkCAT. Also, forskolin fails to decrease Shh-induced binding in an EMSA using radiolabeled ShhRE (data not shown). These results suggest that in higher vertebrates additional pathways that are independent of PKA may also be induced by Shh. The identification of COUP-TFII as a novel target gene and the characterization of a ShhRE within its promoter may allow for the unraveling of this complex pathway..

However, the expression of COUP-TFII transcripts and areas in which Shh exerts its signaling activity may be limited to a few regions within the developing embryo (1, 10)..

However, in the Shh null mice we can detect some COUP-TFII transcripts (F. Pereira, and M-J. Tsai, personal communication). This observation suggests that COUP-TFII is not exclusively regulated by Shh. These results are not surprising since COUP-TFII is expressed throughout mouse embryonic development in a wide variety of tissues (10, 11). Also, we and others have shown that COUP-TFs are downstream target genes of retinoic acid and that their expression is increased by treatment with both 9-cis and all-trans retinoic acid (13, 14)..

Activation of COUP-TFII, which is known to harbor a trans-repressor domain in its C-terminal 15 amino acids, may have important implications in neural tube patterning (26). Shh has been implicated in enabling the notochord-derived signals to repress the dorsalizing signals induced by BMP-2/4 from the roof plate and or the neural epithelium of the neural tube (7, 27). It has been reported that COUP-TFI can inhibit the BMP-4 promoter in fetal rat calvarial osteoblasts (28). It is possible that temporal induction of COUP-TFII expression by Shh may serve to mediate this very repression in specific regions that are fated to become motor neurons in the ventro-lateral region of the neural tube. In conclusion, our results provide a novel target gene (COUP-TFII) and a novel target element (ShhRE) that seem to mediate Shh-induced COUP-TFII expression in P19 mouse embryocarcinoma cells.

Conditioned media obtained from the appropriately transfected COS-1 cells were applied at a specific time point, and 40 h later total RNA was obtained using the Trizol (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) reagent. This method is a modification of the guanidinium-HCl method of RNA isolation (30). RNA was dissolved in 100% deionized formamide and used within a short period or stored in 70% ethanol for extended periods at -70 C. Ten micrograms of total RNA were reprecipitated and washed with 70% ethanol and redissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. This RNA was heated at 55 C for 15 min in loading buffer (35% formamide, 10% formaldehyde, 20 mM Na2HPO4, pH 6.8, and loading dye containing 0.25% xylene cyanol and 0.25% bromophenol blue). RNA was quick cooled on ice and loaded onto a 1% agarose gel containing 1 M formaldehyde in an SPC buffer (20 mM Na2HPO4, pH 6.8, and 2 mM EDTA). The gel was run in 1x SPC buffer and stained with ethidium bromide (0.01% solution in 1x SPC) for 20 min followed by destaining for 1 h. The separated RNA was blotted onto a Hybond N nylon membrane (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). A RNA ladder (6  microg) was run along with each gel and was used to estimate the size of the transcript. The membrane was UV-cross-linked (Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for 2 min and was dried in a gel dryer at 80 C. The membrane was prehybridized using the QuikHyb solution from Stratagene for 1 h and was hybridized with a radiolabeled 500-bp 5'-untranslated region fragment (31) of COUP-TFII for 2 h. Later, the membrane was washed twice with 2x saline sodium citrate (SSC) buffer and 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS. This was followed by two high-stringency washes using 0.1 x SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 C. The residual SDS was removed using a quick 2x SSC wash, and the membrane was exposed to a XOMAT-AR film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 6 to 12 h. The membrane was then stripped using 0.1x SSPE (sodium phosphate-EDTA), 1% SDS solution at 85 C for 15 min. It was then rehybridized with a specific 5' 1.2-kb GAPDH probe (32)..

RNA was dissolved in 100% deionized formamide and used within a short period or stored in 70% ethanol for extended periods at -70 C. Ten micrograms of total RNA were reprecipitated and washed with 70% ethanol and redissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. This RNA was heated at 55 C for 15 min in loading buffer (35% formamide, 10% formaldehyde, 20 mM Na2HPO4, pH 6.8, and loading dye containing 0.25% xylene cyanol and 0.25% bromophenol blue). RNA was quick cooled on ice and loaded onto a 1% agarose gel containing 1 M formaldehyde in an SPC buffer (20 mM Na2HPO4, pH 6.8, and 2 mM EDTA). The gel was run in 1x SPC buffer and stained with ethidium bromide (0.01% solution in 1x SPC) for 20 min followed by destaining for 1 h. The separated RNA was blotted onto a Hybond N nylon membrane (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). A RNA ladder (6  microg) was run along with each gel and was used to estimate the size of the transcript. The membrane was UV-cross-linked (Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for 2 min and was dried in a gel dryer at 80 C. The membrane was prehybridized using the QuikHyb solution from Stratagene for 1 h and was hybridized with a radiolabeled 500-bp 5'-untranslated region fragment (31) of COUP-TFII for 2 h. Later, the membrane was washed twice with 2x saline sodium citrate (SSC) buffer and 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS. This was followed by two high-stringency washes using 0.1 x SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 C. The residual SDS was removed using a quick 2x SSC wash, and the membrane was exposed to a XOMAT-AR film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 6 to 12 h. The membrane was then stripped using 0.1x SSPE (sodium phosphate-EDTA), 1% SDS solution at 85 C for 15 min. It was then rehybridized with a specific 5' 1.2-kb GAPDH probe (32)..

This element increases activity and confers glucocorticoid induction to a heterologous as well as the homologous promoters in differentiated hepatoma cells and is transactivated by HNF41, HNF47, HNF1 and HNF1ss in dedifferentiated hepatoma cells. A 240 bp sub-region conserves basal and hormone-induced enhancer activity. It contains HNF1, HNF4, HNF3 and C/EBP binding sites as shown by DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts and/or recombinant HNF1 and HNF41. Mutation analyses showed that the HNF1 site is essential for HNF1 transactivation and is required for full basal enhancer activity, as is the C/EBP site. Glucocorticoid response element consensus sites which overlap the C/EBP, HNF4 and HNF3 sites are crucial for optimal hormonal induction. We present a model that accounts for weak expression of HNF41 in the embryonic liver and strong expression in the newborn/adult liver via the binding sites identified in the enhancer..

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   HNF4, a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily (1), is one of the first liver-enriched transcription factors (LETF) to be expressed during the course of development. Indeed, transcripts are observed in the mouse at embryonic day (E)4.5 in primitive endoderm, at E5.5 in the extra-embryonic visceral endoderm and in embryonic tissues in the liver and gut primordia at around E8.5 (2). A somewhat earlier and overlapping expression pattern characterizes HNF3ss and HNF1ss, respectively, the only other LETF to have such precocious expression (3 to 6). Each of the three factors is essential for normal embryogenesis: targeted mutation of the corresponding genes causes an early embryonic lethal phenotype (3 to 7), due in the cases of HNF4 and HNF1ss to disruption of visceral endoderm function, essential for the progression of gastrulation (4,5,8). In addition, HNF4 is required for the expression of a number of essential liver functions of differentiated hepatocytes (9). Alteration of some of these functions may be involved in maturity-onset diabetes of the young 1 (MODY1), linked to HNF4 insufficiency (10,11). HNF4 mutations linked to MODY1 affect the coding region of the protein. However, mutations in regulatory regions of the gene may yet be identified (reviewed in 12), providing a strong impetus to locate and characterize these sequences. In view of the importance of HNF4 for execution of the hepatocyte differentiation program, as well as its early expression pattern, the search for regulators of the HNF4 gene should inform us of the factors that are critical not only for hepatocyte differentation and function, but for endoderm formation as well..

A series of up to 10 DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS) in adult liver chromatin, spread out over 15 kb of DNA upstream of the start of transcription of HNF41, the initially isolated isoform (1), implies that its regulation is complex (13,14). Zhong et al. (14) used a 7.5 kb fragment of DNA upstream of the transcription start site and its 5' deletions to analyze expression in transient transfection assays in hepatoma cells as well as in transgenic mice. While the long fragment and deletions down to  to 228 bp showed similar activity in transient expression assays, only the long fragment conferred appropriate activity to a reporter gene in transgenic mice. These results imply that the distal HS harbor important regulatory sites for HNF41 expression. Several splice variants of HNF4 have been described (reviewed in 12), so it is assumed that all of the HNF4 variants concern alternative splicing events within a single gene region. However, the most recently described of them, HNF47, contains a unique sequence encoding the N-terminal portion of the protein and the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), implying that it is transcribed from a separate promoter (15)..

The 700 bp enhancer was cloned in  to 34pZLUC (14).  to 6.8pZLUC is described in Zhong et al. (14). Constructs with the 700 bp enhancer and its sub-regions were checked by DNA sequencing. Standard transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate procedure as previously described (21) using 5  microg each of reporter plasmid and internal control plasmid RSVlacZ. Cells were harvested 64 h later. Where indicated, 1  microM dexamethasone (Dex) was added 48 h before harvest. In co-transfection experiments in C33 cells (15 or 6 x 105), test and control plasmids were used at 0.165  microg each and pBluescript plasmid was added to 3.3  microg total DNA per dish. In some experiments, FGC4 cells (5 x 106 cells in 150  microl of medium) were electroporated with a Bio-Rad gene pulser and capacitance extender (960  microF, 0.2 kV), using 5  microg each of test and control plasmid. In co-transfections, expression vectors for HNF1 (RSV-HNF1; 22), HNF1ss (RSV-vHNF1; 23), HNF41 (HNF4tag; 24), HNF47 (M.E.Torres-Padilla, C.Fougere-Deschatrette and M.C.Weiss, submitted for publication) and HNF3 (a kind gift of R.H.Costa, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL) were used. The expression vector promoter was kept constant by addition of appropriate vector DNA. CAT and luciferase activities were determined as described (25,26) and ss-galactosidase activity by the standard colorimetric method. CAT and luciferase activities were normalized to ss-galactosidase activity and calculated relative to that of pBLCAT5 or  to 34pZLUC, respectively..

Activity of two fragments covering sequences from  to 5 to  to 11 kb upstream of the HNF41 transcription start and cloned upstream of the tk promoter was examined in these cells and in dedifferentiated H5 and non-hepatic C33 cells (Fig. 1A). Both fragments exhibited strong enhancer activity, but only in FGC4 cells. The more active fragment was subdivided into three fragments and tested. Essentially full activity, again limited to FGC4 cells, was conserved by the proximal fragment, B1E5. Finally, B1E5 was divided into two fragments and full activity in FGC4 cells was retained by the more proximal fragment, B1E5B2. This fragment, covering one HS (13,14), therefore acts as a cell-specific enhancer and is referred to as the 700 bp enhancer..
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	26	Since we had observed that transcription of the endogenous HNF4 gene of rat hepatoma cells is induced by Dex treatment (data not shown), each of the fragments was tested for Dex inducibility (Fig. 1B). Dex induction was observed only in FGC4 (2 to 3-fold) and not in H5 cells and, with one exception, it was found only for the most active fragments. The only fragment with low basal activity that showed inducibility was B1E4, which covers HS V (13). This fragment has not yet been studied further..

The 5' deletion to  to 34 retained non-tissue-specific promoter activity (14). In FGC4 (Fig. 1C) the 700 bp enhancer, whatever its orientation, increased the activity of  to 34pZLUC 5-fold, while the relative activity of  to 6.8pZLUC was increased 11-fold. This last plasmid contains the 6.8 kb upstream of HNF41 (14). Moreover, Dex treatment increased the activity of the 700/ to 34pZLUC constructs 2-fold, which accounts totally for the Dex induction of  to 6.8pZLUC (Fig. 1C)..

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	29	A 240 bp region is sufficient for enhancer activity and Dex inducibility and is transactivated by HNF1 and HNF41 Deletions were performed in the 700 bp enhancer to delineate the sequences that are critical for basal and inducible expression (Fig. 2A). Concerning the 5' and 3' deletions, in BspEI and B1E5A2 basal activity was strongly reduced compared to that of the 700 bp enhancer and hormone inducibility was abolished. The sequences deleted between HpaI and DraI had a negative effect on both basal and induced activity because their loss led to increased activity. Further deletion from DraI to AvaI caused a strong decline in both basal and hormone-induced activity. An internal deletion, (BspEI to StuI), also strongly reduced both basal and induced activities compared to the 700 bp enhancer. Therefore, three adjacent blocks of sequence lying between the PvuII and DraI sites are important for full basal and hormone-induced activity of the 700 bp enhancer, with the most 5' one (PvuII to BspEI) being the most critical for the Dex response. Analysis of two central fragments, PvuII to DraI and BspEI to DraI, confirmed that an element required for hormone response is located between the PvuII and BspEI sites. None of the fragments shown in Figure 2A exhibited strong enhancer activity in dedifferentiated H5 cells in the absence or presence of Dex (data not shown)..
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	30	Because it is known that the HNF4 gene is subject to cross-regulation by HNF1 and to auto-regulation (24,39 to 42), several of the fragments were tested for transactivation by HNF1 and HNF41. The 700 bp enhancer is transactivated by both factors in H5 (Fig. 2A) and C33 (data not shown) cells. Analysis of deleted constructs in H5 cells (Fig. 2A) shows that the HNF4 response element is located between the PvuII and BspEI sites and the HNF1 element between the AvaI and DraI sites. In addition, in H5 cells the 700 bp enhancer is transactivated similarly by HNF41 and HNF47 and less efficiently by HNF1ss than HNF1 (Fig. 2B)..

Figure 3A shows four footprints (F1 to F4), revealed with nuclear extract from FGC4 and H5 cells. Due to the location of F1 very close to the labeled end of the probe, its 3'-limit is not clearly visible. However, using a probe labeled further downstream on the same strand we precisely located the 3'-end of F1 (data not shown). There is a surprising similarity between the footprints obtained with the two extracts. For F1 (Fig. 3A and data not shown) the H5 extract is clearly less active than that of FGC4 and for F2 a greater protection by FGC4 extract is evident only at the 3'-extremity of the footprint. As only F1 to F3 lie within the 240 bp enhancer region characterized above (see Fig. 3C), we mapped these three footprints on the opposite strand using FGC4 extract (Fig. 3B). The autoradiogram shows F2 and F3 at higher resolution. In addition, Figure 3A and B shows F1 as a particularly strong footprint on both strands. Positions and sequences of F1 to F3 are given in Figure 3C and D, along with sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the EMSA..

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	38	  In F1 a C/EBP binding site is essential for basal enhancer activity and overlaps with Dex-responsive sequences EMSA were performed with nuclear extracts from FGC4 and H5 cells treated or not with Dex and an oligonucleotide containing F1 (oligo F1) (Fig. 4A). In FGC4 extracts a complex pattern of six bands was observed, two of which (designated 1 and 3) were restricted to these extracts. The H5 extract showed strong bands corresponding to complexes 2 and 4 only after Dex treatment (even though Dex inducibility was restricted to FGC4 cells), while hormone treatment did not change the pattern in FGC4. Interestingly, three of the six bands observed in FGC4 were strongly represented in liver extract (Fig. 4B). Moreover, complexes 1 and 3 appeared common between liver and FGC4. In competition experiments oligos F1 and DEI, containing the C/EBP site of the albumin promoter, displaced the bands in the three types of extracts (Fig. 4C and data not shown). In contrast, binding sites for the other LETF or GR did not compete (Fig. 4C and data not shown). Therefore, C/EBP family proteins bind to F1. In agreement with this, a sequence homologous to the C/EBP binding site consensus (43) was found in the center of F1. The two bands specific to FGC4 and liver extracts were shown to contain C/EBP by supershift assays: a specific antibody displaced only bands 1 and 3 in FGC4 and liver extracts and had no effect in the H5 extract (Fig. 4D and data not shown). Consequently, we conclude that C/EBP binds to F1 in FGC4 cells and the liver but not in H5 cells..

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	41	  To determine whether C/EBP plays a role in enhancer activity, critical bases were mutated in the C/EBP consensus site (38) in the 700 bp enhancer. The activity of the mutant reporter plasmid (F1m1) was then tested in FGC4 cells. The mutant showed a low basal activity, reduced 6-fold compared to the wild-type (Fig. 5A, left). In addition, Dex inducibility was entirely destroyed by the mutation (Fig. 5A, right). The mutant sequence failed to bind proteins of FGC4 or H5 extracts, as shown by EMSA and DNase I footprint experiments (data not shown). However, three of the seven mutated nucleotides in the F1m1 mutant belong to a glucocorticoid response element half-site (half-GRE) consensus overlapping with the C/EBP consensus (data not shown). Consequently, the mutation could impair binding of GR linked to the hormone. We then performed two point mutations in the C/EBP consensus site that do not affect the half-GRE consensus but impair C/EBP binding as analyzed by competition experiments in EMSA (data not shown). This mutation diminished basal activity (mutant F1m2, Fig. 5A, left) but caused only a weak inhibition of the Dex effect (Fig. 5A, right). We conclude that the C/EBP binding site is required for full basal enhancer activity and overlaps with a half-GRE consensus site involved in hormone inducibility. These data indicate that C/EBP is involved in enhancer activity in FGC4 cells..

To examine the functional roles of these sites, we introduced point mutations in each of them in the 700 bp enhancer and tested the resulting plasmids for basal and Dex-induced activity in FGC4 cells. In F2 the HNF4 mutation (Fig. 5B) caused a slight reduction in basal activity (left) and a significant reduction in inducibility (right). A slight reduction in inducibility was obtained for the HNF3 mutation in F3 while the basal activity was not affected (Fig. 5C). However, these mutations reduced but did not abolish HNF41 and HNF3 binding as analyzed by competition experiments in EMSA (data not shown). Furthermore, the HNF4 consensus site is included in a GRE consensus site which is affected by the HNF4 mutation while the HNF3 mutation touches a half-GRE consensus site. These data show that GRE consensus sites intermingled with the LETF sites are required for maximal Dex inducibility of the 700 bp enhancer, as is the case for the C/EBP site in F1..

In F2 the HNF4 mutation (Fig. 5B) caused a slight reduction in basal activity (left) and a significant reduction in inducibility (right). A slight reduction in inducibility was obtained for the HNF3 mutation in F3 while the basal activity was not affected (Fig. 5C). However, these mutations reduced but did not abolish HNF41 and HNF3 binding as analyzed by competition experiments in EMSA (data not shown). Furthermore, the HNF4 consensus site is included in a GRE consensus site which is affected by the HNF4 mutation while the HNF3 mutation touches a half-GRE consensus site. These data show that GRE consensus sites intermingled with the LETF sites are required for maximal Dex inducibility of the 700 bp enhancer, as is the case for the C/EBP site in F1..

A computer search for putative HNF1 binding sites in the 700 bp sequence using a weighted matrix (44) revealed three sites with high scores. The most upstream contains the DraI site and the three last bases of the consensus (15 bp) were replaced by vector sequence in cloned fragments cut by DraI. The second HNF1 site is located a few base pairs downstream of the DraI site and the third lies 70 bp further downstream (data not shown). In DNase I footprinting experiments using purified recombinant truncated HNF1 protein (HNt) we demonstrated that the two most upstream consensus sites correspond to authentic HNF1 binding sites (BS1 and BS2, respectively; data not shown). Then we tested the recombinant HNF1 protein by EMSA using double-stranded oligonucleotides containing BS1, wild-type (oligo BS1) or mutated (oligo BS1m) in order to abolish HNF1 binding (27). A complex between HNt and labeled oligo BS1 formed which was competed by PE56 and oligo BS1, but not by oligo BS1m (Fig. 7A). From these experiments we conclude that BS1 binds HNF1, but with an efficiency  > 16-fold lower than the high affinity PE56 oligonucleotide. In the constructs 3' deleted at the DraI site, modified BS1 still binds to HNt but with a lower affinity (data not shown). In EMSA using FGC4 extracts the third consensus (BS3) proved also to bind HNF1..

We obtained two mutant reporter plasmids of which one (BS1m*) contains an insertion of two G residues within BS1 in addition to the expected mutation. As shown in Figure 7B, in H5 cells this mutant plasmid exhibited the same low basal activity as the B1E5B2 reporter plasmid but transactivation by co-transfected HNF1 was severely compromised, in spite of the continued presence of intact BS2 and BS3 sites. Moreover, activity of both mutant plasmids in FGC4 was strongly and similarly reduced compared to the wild-type (Fig. 7C). These results thus show that BS1 is required not only for transactivation by HNF1, but also for enhancer activity of the 700 bp region in differentiated hepatoma cells..

Fragments covering  to 5 to  to 11 kb upstream of the transcription start site have been tested upstream of the tk promoter and full activity can be localized to a fragment of 700 bp (700 bp enhancer) at around  to 6 kb, which corresponds to a HS of both liver and kidney chromatin (13,14). This fragment increases the activity of a minimal HNF41 promoter from which the HNF1 site (14) has been deleted. This result agrees with the requirement of upstream sequences up to  to 7 kb to obtain liver- and kidney-restricted activity of the HNF41 promoter in transgenic mice (14). Moreover, the 700 bp enhancer mediates glucocorticoid induction, but only in differentiated hepatoma cells. This agrees with the reported glucocorticoid induction of HNF4 expression (11,15). The 700 bp enhancer is thus implicated in physiological regulation of HNF41 activity..

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	67	The C/EBP site is the strongest footprint in the enhancer. Its mutation significantly reduces enhancer activity but only in cells that produce C/EBP, implying that this site responds specifically to binding of C/EBP. Previously we proposed that HNF4 regulates its own expression based on studies of stable transfectants (24,42). Our data here support such a direct auto-regulation mechanism because the enhancer core sequence contains a functional HNF4 response element. In addition, HNF3 transactivates the enhancer. However, while mutation of the HNF4 and HNF3 sites had only small effects, the introduced mutations impaired binding of the factors only partially. The HNF41 enhancer is strongly transactivated by HNF1 and more weakly by HNF1ss. Transactivation by HNF1 is mediated by a weak HNF1 binding site, which is also required for high basal activity of the enhancer. A similar functional role of weak HNF1 binding sites has been reported for the mouse phenylalanine hydroxylase gene enhancer (21). A functional HNF1 binding site in the HNF41 enhancer, in addition to the site described earlier in the promoter region (14), accords with earlier reports of cross-regulation between HNF4 and HNF1 (39 to 42). Based on the strong response to HNF1, we propose that this factor plays a critical role in enhancer activity..

Moreover, HNF41, but not HNF47, is induced by glucocorticoids in murine hepatic cells (15). Maximal Dex induction of the enhancer requires the F1 to F3 region where three imperfect GRE and five imperfect half-GRE consensus sites were found, some overlapping with the F1 to F3 footprints (see Fig. 8A). Although competition EMSAs using GRE failed to provide evidence for binding of GR, the presence of GRE consensus sites and responsiveness to Dex imply that GR binds to the enhancer. Indeed, mutations introduced into LETF binding sites that affect GRE whole sites or half-sites compromised Dex induction, implying that these sites are functional. Moreover, induction of the 700 bp enhancer was restricted to differentiated hepatoma cells, implying that a liver-specific protein(s) is required for the glucocorticoid effect. Indeed, the LETF can synergize with GR to achieve glucocorticoid induction of the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) (45 to 47) and the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) genes (48). A similar situation appears to exist for the HNF41 enhancer..

However, probes that do not distinguish between the HNF41 and HNF47 isoforms were used for analysis of early embryos. Recent work from our laboratory has revealed that expression of the HNF41 isoform is strong in the liver only at the end of fetal life and at birth, whereas the HNF47 isoform is the predominant form of HNF4 in embryonic liver (M.E.Torres-Padilla, C.Fougere-Deschatrette and M.C.Weiss, submitted for publication). The dramatic activation of HNF41 that occurs just before birth could be assured, on the one hand, by C/EBP, whose expression is also activated at birth (49), and, on the other, by glucocorticoids.

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	4	The DNA-bending protein TF1 is the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPO1-encoded homolog of the bacterial HU proteins and the Escherichia coli integration host factor. We recently proposed that TF1, which binds with high affinity (Kd was ~3 nM) to preferred sites within the hydroxymethyluracil (hmU)-containing phage genome, identifies its binding sites based on sequence-dependent DNA flexibility. Here, we show that two hmU-A base pair steps coinciding with two previously proposed sites of DNA distortion are critical for complex formation. The affinity of TF1 is reduced 10-fold when both of these hmU-A base pair steps are replaced with A-hmU, G-C, or C-G steps; only modest changes in affinity result when substitutions are made at other base pairs of the TF1 binding site. Replacement of all hmU residues with thymine decreases the affinity of TF1 greatly; remarkably, the high affinity is restored when the two hmU-A base pair steps corresponding to previously suggested sites of distortion are reintroduced into otherwise T-containing DNA. T-DNA constructs with 3-base bulges spaced apart by 9 base pairs of duplex also generate nM affinity of TF1. We suggest that twin hmU-A base pair steps located at the proposed sites of distortion are key to target site selection by TF1 and that recognition is based largely, if not entirely, on sequence-dependent DNA flexibility..

For one phage-encoded protein, the DNA-binding and -bending protein TF1, this discrimination is essentially absolute: the high affinity of TF1 (Kd order of magnitude nM) for preferred sites within the hmU-containing phage genome is greatly reduced for the corresponding T-containing DNA (3, 4). We recently showed that the affinity of TF1 for hmU-DNA is matched in T-containing DNA constructs that contain sets of two consecutive mismatches separated by 9 bp of duplex, indicating that hmU-content and appropriately placed flexible loops contribute similarly to complex formation. We proposed, therefore, that DNA in a complex with TF1 is distorted at two sites that are separated by 9 bp of duplex DNA, sites corresponding to two hmU-A base pair steps, and that TF1 identifies its target sites through recognition of sequence-dependent DNA flexibility (5). Here we examine the requirement for hmU residues across a 37-mer DNA duplex representing a preferred binding site within the phage genome (4) and specifically evaluate sequence requirements at the two inferred sites of DNA distortion..

Because of the ability of TF1 to form nested complexes on longer DNA fragments, the length of the DNA constructs was chosen to accommodate only one TF1 dimer (5). The affinity of TF1 for the 37-mer hmU-containing duplex (Kd was ~3 nM; Fig. 1A) was reduced 10-fold upon replacement of the two hmU-A base pair steps corresponding to the potential sites of distortion with A-hmU, G-C, or C-G steps (Figs. 1 and 2, panels B). Altering the sequence at the center of the binding site (Figs. 1 and 2, panels C) or on the flanks, distal to the proposed sites of bending (Figs. 1 and 2, panels D), did not significantly affect complex formation. The observed sequence specificity at proposed sites of distortion is consistent with a direct participation of hmU-A base pair steps in complex formation and DNA bending. Fig. 1. Sequences of 37-mer oligonucleotides. A, the sequence of the top strand corresponding to a preferred binding site within the SPO1 genome is shown, with hmU-A base pair steps that correspond to proposed sites of distortion in boldface.

Remarkably, TF1 was found to have essentially undiminished affinity for DNA in which the two hmU-A base pair steps are completely surrounded by T-containing DNA (Kd = 4 nM; Fig. 3, construct Th7/6, and Fig. 4, A and B). We note also that the affinity of TF1 for hmU-DNA and for the Th7/Th6 construct was the same at room temperature and at 4  degrees C (Figs. 3 and 5 and data not shown).

Improved complex formation relative to perfect duplex T-DNA would also be expected for T-DNA constructs in which the energetic cost of bending is lessened through the incorporation of bulge-loops, i.e. with nucleotides that are formally unopposed on the complementary strand (Fig. 5). Constructs with sets of 1- or 2-nt bulges combined with one mismatched base pair positioned 9 bp apart indeed generated high affinity for TF1 (Fig. 5B); note that sets of 2-nt loops (one mismatch) generated suboptimal binding compared with sets of 4-nt loops (two consecutive mismatches). The high affinity of TF1 was fully restored for DNA constructs with sets of 2- or 3-nt bulges with suboptimal binding for DNA with a pair of 1-nt bulges (Fig. 5C). Replacing the T-containing top strand of bulge constructs with the corresponding hmU-containing strand did not affect complex formation (data not shown). Bulge-loops are considered to generate directed kinks in the helix axis (8, 9). Consistent with the presence of such kinks, we observed a reduction in electrophoretic mobility of bulged DNA constructs, the magnitude of which depended on the size of the bulge (data not shown). The mobility of protein-DNA complexes was similar irrespective of the nature of the DNA construct..

At the tip of the DNA-binding arms, TF1 contains a Phe residue at position 61 in place of the Arg found in all other members of this protein family. TF1(F61R) has reduced preference for hmU-DNA over T-DNA (15) but was seen to retain high affinity for hmU-DNA (Kd = 9.6  plus or minus  0.7 nM). Substituting Phe-61 with Tyr had little effect on affinity (Kd = 6.8  plus or minus  0.9 nM). Replacing Phe-61 with a polar, uncharged residue (Ser or Gln) significantly reduces both DNA binding affinity and site-selectivity (15). Notably, the affinity for hmU-DNA of both TF1(F61S) (Kd = 236  plus or minus  19 nM) and TF1(F61Q) (Kd = 685  plus or minus  48 nM) increased more than 5-fold for T-DNA with 2 3-base bulges (Kd = 36  plus or minus  2 and 90  plus or minus  7 nM, respectively; Fig. 5). This is in contrast to wild-type TF1 that bound hmU-DNA and bulge-DNA constructs (1+2, 1+3, 0+2, and 0+3) with approximately the same affinity (Fig. 5). T-DNA with sets of 4-nt loops, which also reproduces the affinity of wild-type TF1 for hmU-DNA (Fig. 5A and Ref. 5), did not significantly enhance complex formation by TF1(F61S) (Kd was ~200 nM) or TF1(F61Q) (Kd was ~570 nM) beyond that observed with hmU-DNA. Apparently hmU content and flexible loops in T-DNA contribute similarly to complex formation for these TF1 mutant proteins, which are deficient in binding and bending of hmU-DNA (15, 16), whereas DNA with a static kink generates an increase in affinity..

For this mode of target site selection, the prediction would be for the sequence at the sites of distortion to significantly affect complex formation. This prediction appears to be borne out both in terms of preferred base pair steps in the context of hmU-DNA (Figs. 1 and 2) but particularly by the significant effect of hmU-A base pair steps in a T-containing surrounding sequence (Figs. 3 and 4). We propose that hmU content confers a site-specific flexibility on the DNA duplex that is recognized by TF1. hmU-A base pair steps that are situated at presumptive sites of DNA bending make the principal contributions to complex formation with TF1. hmU residues at other positions that generate measurable, yet suboptimal affinities, presumably do so either due to longer range effects on DNA flexure or because of alternative placement of TF1. An effect of hmU residues on the deformability of the double helix is corroborated by the increased affinity observed for other members of the family of type II DNA-binding proteins, HU and IHF, and for the unrelated eukaryotic protein, HMG1 (17). Changes in complex formation by both major and minor groove-binding proteins and antibiotics induced by introduction of other modified bases have also been interpreted in terms of effects on DNA deformability by exocyclic substituents (18-20)..

Indeed, similar results have been previously reported for HU (27). We note that T-DNA constructs with pairs of suitably placed 4-nt loops or 3-nt bulge-loops generate the same affinity for wild-type TF1. However, different structures and energetics of deformation are indicated by the significantly higher affinity for bulge constructs of the TF1 mutant proteins TF1(F61S) and TF1(F61Q), which are impaired in DNA binding and bending. These observations are consistent with a static kink introduced by bulge-loops compared with a looser more flexible structure imposed by symmetric loops (8, 9, 24, 28); we suggest that pre-bent DNA bulge-loop constructs also permit complex formation with certain TF1 mutant proteins, whereas binding and bending of DNA with sets of 4-nt loops (or hmU content) require a protein-mediated introduction and stabilization of DNA kinks..

If TF1, like IHF, employs a totally conserved Pro residue to intercalate between specific base pairs of the binding site (14), then the deficiency of TF1(F61S) and TF1(F61Q) in DNA binding and bending may reside in their inability to stabilize a severely bent DNA conformation. Phe-61 contributes to the striking preference of TF1 for hmU-DNA over T-DNA (15). TF1(F61R) also has high affinity for hmU-DNA but a reduced preference for hmU-DNA over T-DNA (15). In addition, IHF (which has higher affinity for a specific binding site in hmU-DNA compared with T-DNA (17)) relies heavily on indirect readout to recognize its binding sites (14). If TF1 and IHF engage their DNA targets in an isomorphous fashion, the preference for hmU-DNA characteristic of TF1 may not be due to specific interactions between Phe-61 and hmU residues of the TF1 binding site. Rather, the inability of TF1 to stabilize a T-DNA duplex that is severely kinked through intercalation of Pro residues may be alleviated by the more pliable hmU-DNA. On the other hand, the possibility that TF1 does use Phe-61 directly for inducing DNA kinks at two hmU-A base pair steps remains to be established or disproved by direct structure determination..

Overexpression of COUP-TF I in 3T3 fibroblasts resulted in reduction of stable contact formation between neurites and transfected cells. Additionally, COUP-TF I enhanced retinoic acid response element-dependent reporter gene expression in 3T3 fibroblasts, indicating that COUP-TF I can modulate transcriptional activation in these cells. Our data suggest that COUP-TF transcription factors are involved in the regulation of cell surface molecules during neurogenesis..

Among the best characterized members of the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors are the receptors for retinoids, thyroid hormones, steroid hormones, and glucocorticoids, whose importance during neurogenesis is well described (for review, see Beato(1989); Evans and Arriza(1989); McEwen et al.(1991); and Linney(1992)). Hormone receptors activate or repress gene transcription through binding to cis-acting hormone response elements (HRE)()(Green and Chambon, 1988; Beato, 1989). Besides the ligand-dependent transcription factors, the hormone receptor superfamily comprises several orphan receptors for which ligands are not known (for review, see Evans(1988) and Green and Chambon(1988)). Orphan receptors, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) homologues, have been isolated from Drosophila (Mlodzik et al., 1990), sea urchin (Chan et al., 1992), zebrafish (Fjose et al., 1993), Xenopus (Matharu and Sweeney, 1992), chick (Lutz et al., 1994), and mammals (Miyajima et al., 1988; Wang et al., 1989; Richie et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1991; Ladias and Karathanasis, 1991). One possible function of COUP-TF transcription factors is to regulate the activity of ligand-activated hormone receptors through heterodimer formation or competition for specific response elements (Cooney et al., 1992, 1993; Tran et al., 1992)..

The role of COUP-TF orphan receptors in neurogenesis is virtually unknown. In Drosophila, the expression of COUP-TF homologue seven-up is required for development of specific subset of photoreceptor neurons during eye development (Mlodzik et al., 1990). In chick (Lutz et al., 1994) and mouse (Jonk et al., 1994; Lu et al., 1994; Qiu et al., 1994), COUP-TFs are expressed in a complex spatial and temporal pattern during development of the nervous system..

During development, inhibitory regions regulate the formation of neuronal pathways and connections (Tosney and Landmesser, 1984; Davies et al., 1990). Several factors responsible for neurite outgrowth inhibition have been characterized (Caroni and Schwab, 1988; Cox et al., 1990; Davies et al., 1990; Raper and Kapfhammer, 1990; Luo et al., 1993). We developed a screening system for cloning inhibitory molecules after transfection of a cDNA library into ``substrate'' cells, which are subsequently cocultured with neuronal cells and screened for functional expression of neurite outgrowth inhibition. This approach allows isolation of cDNAs for surface molecules, which cause direct inhibition of neurite outgrowth, as well as cDNAs for factors involved in regulating the expression of molecules, which inhibit or facilitate neurite outgrowth. This screening system enabled us to isolate a rat homologue of orphan receptor COUP-TF I, whose overexpression results in decreased contact stability between neurites and substrate cells. These data suggest the possible involvement of COUP-TF I in the regulation of neurite contacts and cell aggregation..

The first strand synthesis reaction was labeled using [P]dCTP (5  microCi,  > 3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) to facilitate tracing of the DNA. First strand cDNA was hybridized to embryonic day 17 poly(A) RNA (200  microg) in sealed ampules (total volume, 100  microl, buffer 0.5 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 0.2% SDS) for 18 h at 70  degrees C. The hybridization mix was diluted to a final molarity of 0.08 M sodium phosphate, loaded onto a DNA grade hydroxylapatite column (4 ml (volume), Bio-Rad), and washed extensively with 0.08 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). Single-stranded cDNAs were eluted in 10 ml of 0.15 M sodium phosphate buffer. Column fractions (0.5 ml) exhibiting radioactivity above background were pooled, and the cDNAs were concentrated by butanol extraction followed by chromatography in STE buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA) on a Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Single-stranded cDNAs were mixed with 100  microg of poly(A) RNA from embryonic day 17 for the second cycle of hybridization. After the second cycle, first strand cDNAs were hybridized with 5  microg of the original Poly(A) RNA isolated from postnatal day 5, adult, and injured rats nervous systems, and the resulting DNA/RNA hybrids were used as template for second strand synthesis with RNaseH and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Life Technologies, Inc.). Blunt ends were created with T4 DNA polymerase, and the HindIII adapter (5`-AGCTTGGCACGAG-3`, 3`-ACCGTGCTC-5`) was ligated to the cDNA. Longer cDNAs ( > 700 bp) were isolated by digestion with NotI followed by size selection on a Sephacryl S 400 column (Pharmacia) and were subsequently cloned between the HindIII and NotI restriction sites of the expression vector pRcCMV (Invitrogen). The library was divided into 20 aliquots and used to transform E. coli DH5 cells (MAX Efficiency, Life Technologies, Inc.). Each aliquot yielded 5-8 10 colonies, which were combined and grown for large scale plasmid isolation (plasmid maxi kit, Qiagen).

Briefly, the extraction buffer contained 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 450 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, and protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mM), leupeptin (0.5  microg/ml), pepstatin (0.7  microg/ml), aprotinin (1  microg/ml), and bestatin (40  microg/ml). Sonicated extracts were cleared by centrifugation for 5 min. Binding conditions for the EMSA were 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 1 mM spermidine, 5 mM MgCl, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 9% glycerol, 0.8  microg of poly(dI-dC), 50,000 cpm of the P-labeled oligonucleotide, and 10  microg of cell extract. After incubation for 15 min at 25  degrees C, DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. Three different batches of extracts were used in EMSA analyses, and no batch differences were observed..

The cDNA library in pRcCMV expression vector was transfected into NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, and, after 3 weeks of antibiotic selection, several clones that had less contacts with neurites were isolated. These clones were propagated, and the transfected cDNAs were isolated using polymerase chain reaction and retested for neurite outgrowth inhibition. Sequence analysis revealed that one cDNA is the rat homologue of human orphan receptor COUP-TF I lacking 40 amino acids of the transactivation domain localized near the amino terminus of the DNA binding domain (COUP-TF I). Full-length COUP-TF I cDNA was isolated by high stringency screening of the brain cDNA library cloned into ZAPII vector (Stratagene). The rCOUP-TF I cDNA encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 45.8 kilodaltons (Genbank accession number, U10995) and is 98% identical to the human COUP-TF I at the amino acid level with 95% identity at the nucleotide level..

Since the effects of COUP-TF I depend on the HRE sequence, we analyzed two natural and one synthetic HRE: -RARE, a direct repeat with a 5-bp spacer that is activated by RAR and is not inhibited by COUP-TF I (Tran et al., 1992); CRBP I-RARE, a direct repeat with a 2-bp spacer that is optimally activated by RARRXR heterodimers but not by RXR homodimers (Hermann et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1992); and DR-1, a direct repeat that contains a 1-bp spacer and has a high affinity for COUP-TF I (Kadowaki et al., 1992) and RXRs (Mangelsdorf et al., 1990, 1991). Our results demonstrated that the pattern of protein-DNA complexes is changed in COUP-TF I overexpressing cells compared with controls (Fig. 1B). A unique DNA-protein complex (Fig. 1B, arrow) was detected in extracts made from COUP-TF I overexpressing cells. Antibodies (developed in our laboratory) against COUP-TF I supershifted the complex (data not shown), verifying the presence of COUP-TF I in the complex..

Analyses of neurite contact stability were performed with fibroblast clones overexpressing COUP-TF I. Fibroblasts transfected with the pRcCMV vector only and naive fibroblasts were used as controls. There is a general increase in the number of contacts over the course of the experimental period. This increase was not different for naive control fibroblasts or fibroblasts transfected with the expression vector (205  plus or minus  64% versus 160  plus or minus  37%, respectively, p  >  0.05). However, fibroblasts transfected with COUP-TF I (clones 5, 8, and 9) exhibited a significantly (p  <  0.05) lower increase in contact number (51  plus or minus  14%, 18  plus or minus  20%, 38  plus or minus  27%, respectively, Fig. 2) indicative of lower contact stability. While differences in level of expression of COUP-TF I were apparent in clones 5, 8, and 9 (Fig. 1A, lanes5, 7, and 9, respectively), contact stability was not dependent upon the level of expression of COUP-TF I cDNA (p  >  0.05). Neuroblastoma-glioma NG108-15 cells have rapidly growing neurites with large growth cones and filopodia. After contact with control fibroblasts, growth cones maintain their form (Fig. 3, CMVpanel). In contrast, the processes of NG108-15 cells exhibit retraction or become very small after contact with COUP-TF I-expressing cells, indicative of growth cone collapse and contact instability (Fig. 3, COUPpanel). The increased number of contacts in these cultures comes from other NG108-15 cells in the vicinity of the fibroblasts. Since the differentiated NG108-15 cells observed have an equal probability to establish and maintain contacts with fibroblasts, the test determines the stability of cell-cell contact..

0.24508433.7797489.html.plaintext.txt	46	Members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily interact in a complex manner and stimulate or repress gene expression, depending upon the type and number of factors present and also the context of the gene promoter (Cooney et al., 1992, 1993). We have shown that overexpression of the orphan receptor, COUP-TF I, can alter cell-cell interaction in fibroblasts and block neuronal differentiation of PCC7 cells (Neuman et al., 1995). Expression of COUP-TF I in fibroblasts is correlated with detectable alterations of normal cell behaviors, presumably associated with alteration or modification of the expression of cell surface proteins. The exact nature of this change is unknown since no differences were detected in comparisons of isolated membrane proteins from control and COUP-TF I-expressing cells, nor was there any indication of involvement of secretory factors.()Discerning the mechanism by which COUP-TF I altered surface properties was further hampered due to a lack of characterization of fibroblasts with regard to members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily, which are endogenously expressed and represent potential heterodimerization partners. However, data from transient CAT assays indicated that COUP-TF I induced transcriptional activity of -RARE-coupled reporter gene constructs. Together, these data are consistent with a model in which COUP-TF I interacts with other nuclear hormone receptors, causing changes in gene expression. Several scenarios are possible, including COUP-TF I homodimers binding to retinoic acid response elements, or COUP-TF I/retinoic acid receptor heterodimer formation (Tran et al., 1992) with subsequent alteration of gene expression. Retinoic acid alters expression of genes that promote cell growth and attachment, i.e. laminin B1 (Vasios et al., 1991), and is also important in the regulation of hox genes (Linney, 1992), which have been shown to interact with promoters of cell adhesion molecules, i.e. N-CAM and cytotactin (Jones et al., 1992a, 1992b, 1993). Our data are consistent with a model in which perturbation of a variety of processes, including differentiation, aggregation, and cell-cell interaction, is regulated by expression of COUP-TF I..

0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	4	COUP-TF II is an orphan nuclear receptor that has no known ligand in the `classical sense'. COUP-TF interacts with the corepressors N-CoR, SMRT and RIP13, and silences transcription by active repression and trans-repression. Forced expression of the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF II in mouse C2 myogenic cells has been demonstrated to inhibit morphological differentiation, and to repress the expression of: (i) the myoD gene family which encodes myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins; and (ii) the cell cycle regulator, p21Waf-1/Cip-1. In the present study, we show that COUP-TF II efficiently inhibits the myoD-mediated myogenic conversion of pluripotential C3H10T1/2 cells by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Furthermore, repression of MyoD-dependent transcription by COUP-TF II occurs in the absence of the nuclear receptor cognate binding motif. The inhibition of MyoD-mediated trans-activation involves the direct binding of the DNA binding domain/C-region and hinge/D-regions [i.e. amino acid (aa) residues 78-213] of COUP-TF II to the N-terminal activation domain of MyoD. Over-expression of the cofactor p300, which functions as a coactivator of myoD-mediated transcription, alleviated repression by COUP-TF II. Further binding analysis demonstrated that COUP-TF II interacted with the N-terminal 149 aa residues of p300 which encoded the receptor interaction domain of the coactivator. Finally we observed that COUP-TF II, MyoD and p300 interact in a competitive manner, and that increasing amounts of COUP-TF II have the ability to reduce the interaction between myoD and p300 invitro. The experiments presented herein suggest thatCOUP-TF II post-transcriptionally regulates myoD activity/function, and that crosstalk between orphan nuclear receptors and the myogenic bHLH proteins has functional consequences for differentiation..

0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	6	The process of skeletal muscle differentiation involves the activation and induction of a large array of muscle-specific genes, and exit from the cell cycle. The myoD gene family encodes myogenic specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins that activate and control this process (reviewed in 1-3). MyoD plays a dual role during myogenesis, activating both muscle specific gene transcription and promoting cell cycle exit by inducing the expression of p21Cip-1/Waf-1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases and cellular proliferation (4-6). Transactivation by MyoD involves: (i) the bHLH domain, that is involved in both DNA binding and dimerisation; (ii) the heterodimerisation of MyoD with the ubiquitously expressed E2A gene products, E12 and E47 (7); (iii) the binding of MyoD-E2A heterodimers to specific E-box motifs (CANNTG) in muscle-specific enhancers (reviewed in 1-3); and (iv) the recruitment of the cofactors p300 and PCAF (8-10). The cofactors p300 and PCAF are critical coactivators for MyoD during myogenic commitment and differentiation. The N-terminal acid-rich activation domain of MyoD directly interacts with p300 and recruits PCAF to form a ternary multimeric complex on promoter elements (8,11). These events lead to hyper-acetylated and transcriptionally-permissive chromatin. Moreover, p300 and PCAF coactivate myoD-mediated trans-activation of the p21 gene, and are necessary for MyoD-mediated cell cyle arrest (11)..

During embryogenesis, COUP-TF II is expressed in the developing CNS in a spatio-temporal manner (18,19), and in the dermatomial region of the somite at 10 days post coitum, which will give rise to the axial skeletal and tongue muscle (20). COUP-TF proteins are highly expressed in many other developing organs and the expression level decreases with completion of differentiation, suggesting that COUP-TF is involved in organogenesis (21,22).

0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	14	COUP-TF isoforms I and II have been demonstrated to: (i) repress hormonal trans-activation of target genes by the nuclear receptor family (23-26); (ii) repress trans-activation by the potent GAL4VP16 chimera (16); (iii) interact with TFIIB; and (iv) negatively regulate the transcription of many other genes(e.g. Apolipoprotein AI gene) (21,27-29). Inhibition of trans-cription by COUP-TF II has been shown to be mediated by two main mechanisms, active repression and transrepression (30). Active repression by COUP-TF involves direct binding and competition for the occupancy of a common response element (31). Transrepression involves inhibition of transcription by COUP-TF II in the absence of its cognate binding motif, or independent of nucleic acid binding (30). Interestingly, we (16) and Achatz et al. (30) have demonstrated that the DNA binding domain (DBD)/C-region of COUP-TF II is necessary for transrepression. The molecular mechanism underlying COUP-TF II transrepression is unclear; however, it has been suggested that direct protein-protein interactions between COUP-TF and essential cofactors may be involved. Whether COUP-TF II directly regulates the transcription of the bHLH regulators is unclear. Furthermore, the fact that COUP-TF II represses transcription in the presence and absence of its cognate binding motif raises the scenario that COUP-TF II may control MyoD activity or the formation of the functional MyoD ternary complex..
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	15	Active repression by COUP-TF II is mediated by the nuclear corepressors (i.e. N-CoR/RIP13 and SMRT/TRAC-2) (16,32-35). Corepressors actively repress transcription by: (i) interacting with Sin3A/B and recruiting histone deacetylases (i.e. HDAc-1 or Rpd3) which actively promote chromatin condensation via hypo-acetylation of the chromatin (36-39); and (ii) binding key components of the basal transcriptional machinery (i.e. TFIIB, TAFII32 and TAFII70) (40). In the present study, we demonstrate that that repression of MyoD-mediated transactivation by COUP-TF II involves direct binding to MyoD and p300..

Moreover, preliminary evidence suggests that COUP-TF II directly regulates the transcription of the bHLH/contractile gene families and/or the cell cycle regulators (P.B. and G.M., unpublished data). However, the fact that COUP-TF II represses transcription in the presence and absence of its cognate binding motif, and interacts with the corepressors N-CoR and SMRT, raises the scenario that COUP-TF II may control MyoD activity or function by post-transcriptional mechanisms, which include transrepression..

In this system, transient transfection of an EMSV-MyoD expression vector under the control of a moloney sarcoma virus promoter leads to the phenotypic/myogenic conversion of these cells as scored by immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody directed against a muscle-specific marker. The antibody is against the fast isoform of the major thick filament protein, skeletal MHC. MHC is associated with the contractile phenotype and is expressed during the process of muscle differentiation. Utilisation of an EMSV-driven MyoD expression vector, which is essentially refactory to repression by COUP-TF II, assured that any observed affects of COUP-TF II on phenotypic conversion were independent of myoD down-regulation, and mediated by post-transcriptional events. We demonstrated that the identical moloney sarcoma virus promoter linked to the CAT reporter in the same vector was not affected/regulated by COUP-TF II expression. We cotransfected increasing amounts of either pSG5, the SV40 expression vector alone, or pSG5-COUP-TF II with EMSV-CAT.

After immunostaining, it was found that the ABCD and CDE regions were sufficient to inhibit myogenic conversion (Fig. 1B, panels e and f). In contrast, the AB region of COUP-TF II failed to ablate the MyoD-mediated acquisition of the contractile phenotype (Fig. 1B, panel d).

To determine if COUP-TF II also interacts with p300 in vivo, we utilised the mammalian two-hybrid assay. In this assay, the GAL4 DBD-p300 domain fusion chimeras, GAL4-p300-aa 1-149, -p300-aa 595-1240, and -p300-aa 1030-2414 were independently cotransfected in JEG-3 cells with either full-length VP16-COUP-TF II, VP16-COUP-TF II AB or VP16-COUP-TF II CDE. The capacity of the GAL-p300 and VP16-COUP-TF II fusion products to physically interact in vivo was then assessed by their ability to trans-activate a CAT reporter gene placed downstream of GAL4 binding sites linked to the E1b promoter. It was found that, like other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, full-length COUP-TF II strongly interacts (~20-fold) with only the N-terminal RID of p300 (aa 1-149) (Fig. 5B). In comparison, with the nuclear receptor RXR[gamma] (in the presence of ligand), the interaction of the N-terminal region of p300 with full-length COUP-TFII, is stronger [~5-fold; data not shown, and similar to that reported by Chakravarti et al. (43)]. It was also found that the RID of p300 interacted efficiently with the C-terminal region of COUP-TF II which encodes the CD and E domains [i.e. DBD, hinge and putative ligand binding domain (LBD)]. In contrast, the AB region of COUP-TF II did not interact with the RID of p300 (Fig. 5B)..

(B) COUP-TF II interacts with the RID of p300 in vivo. JEG-3 cells were transiently transfected with the G5e1bCAT reporter construct and expression vectors encoding either GAL4-p300-aa 1-149, GAL4-p300-aa 595-1240, GAL4-p300-aa 1030-2414, VP16-COUP-TF II full-length, VP16-COUP-TF II AB or VP16-COUP-TF II CDE as indicated (+). After 48 h on 10% charcoal stripped medium, cells were harvested and assayed for CAT activity. Results shown are mean  plus or minus  standard deviation and were derived from at least three independent experiments. In each case, fold activation is relative to GAL4-p300 chimera/VP160 CAT activity, which is arbitrarily set at 1.0. (C) The CD region of COUP-TF II, which spans aa 78-213, interacts with the N-terminal 149 aa of p300 in vivo. JEG-3 cells were transiently transfected with the 3 mg G5e1bCAT reporter construct, 1 mg GAL4-p300-aa1-149 and 1 mg of the VP16-COUP-TF II chimeras as indicated (+). The results are presented as the mean  plus or minus  standard deviation and were derived from at least three independent experiments. In each case, fold activation is relative to GAL4-p300-aa 1-149/VP160 CAT activity, which is arbitarily set at 1.0. (D) Direct binding between the CD region of COUP-TF II and full-length p300 in vitro. p300 was radiolabelled with [35S]methionine by in vitro transcription/translation and assayed for its ability to interact with glutathione-immobilised GST, GST-COUP-TF II, GST-COUP-TF II AB, GST-COUP-TF II ABCD, GST-COUP-TF II CD, GST-COUP-TF II CDE and GST-COUP-TF II DE. The cofactor p300 directly interacts with the COUP-TF II CD region in vivo and in vitro.

It was found that the CD region of COUP-TF II, which encodes the DBD and hinge (i.e. aa 78-213), was sufficient to interact with the RID of p300. Interestingly, the VP16-COUP-TF II chimeras 1/2 and 1/3, which contain only part of the DBD (i.e. from aa 134), were not able to interact with the RID of p300, suggesting that the entire DBD is required for binding..

Equal quantities of glutathione agarose-immobilised GST (negative control) and GST-COUP-TF II full-length and various sub-domains (GST-COUP-TF II AB, GST-COUP-TF II ABCD, GST-COUP-TF II CD, GST-COUP-TF II CDE and GST-COUP-TF II DE) were incubated with in vitro 35S-radiolabelled full-length p300. The resulting pulldown clearly showed a direct interaction between full-length COUP-TF II and in vitro translated p300 (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, the CD region of COUP-TF II, spanning aa 78-213, is required for the interaction with p300 (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, this is the same region that interacts with MyoD. It should be noted that the ABCD and CDE regions of COUP-TF II are also sufficient to repress the MyoD-dependent conversion of C3H10T1/2 cells and that the DBD of COUP-TF II (aa 79-144) is essential for the repression of trans-activation in the absence of the cognate binding motif and nucleic acid binding..

We observed that increasing amounts of radiolabelled COUP-TF II CDE reduced the ability of a fixed amount of 35S-labelled p300 to interact with GST-MyoD.

0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	67	The regulation of myogenesis (i.e. muscle differentiation) is intimately controlled by a group of muscle specific bHLH proteins encoded by the myoD gene family (myoD, myogenin, myf-5, MRF-4) (reviewed in 1-3). The products of the myoD gene family are involved in a variety of protein-protein interactions with many factors that mediate transcription [e.g. E12 and E47, TFIIB; 7,44], control the cell cycle (e.g. RB; 45), and regulate chromatin accessibility and architecture (p300 and PCAF; 11). These protein-protein interactions regulate cellular proliferation and activate myogenic specific transcription that encodes the contractile phenotype. Insights into the process of myogenesis have been provided by the myoD gene family of transcription factors, because they function at the nexus of command circuits that control the mutually exclusive events of division and differentiation..

Our work suggested that repression of MyoD-mediated trans-activation and myogenic conversion by COUP-TF II involves direct interactions with MyoD and its coactivator, p300. Furthermore, the study provides another line of evidence in a biological context which demonstrates that COUP-TF II-mediated repression of MyoD-dependent trans-activation occurs in the absence of the orphan receptor cognate binding motif. This observation strengthens the view that trans-repression by COUP-TF II has a functional role during mammalian muscle differentiation. Finally, it demonstrates that direct crosstalk between the orphan nuclear receptor and bHLH pathways has functional consequences for the regulation of differentiation and phenotypic acquisition. This mode of action and crosstalk between two central regulatory components may turn out to be utilised in other pathways of mammalian differentiation..

0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	72	Specifically, our study showed that COUP-TF II could repress MyoD-mediated myogenic conversion of pluripotential 10T1/2 cells, when myoD expression was driven by a viral promoter refractory to COUP-TF II action. This immunochemical analysis suggested that the CDE region (but not the N-terminal AB region) of COUP-TF II was necessary for the repression of myoD-mediated myogenic conversion. In particular, the C and D regions of the orphan receptor, between aa residues 78 and 213, which encode the DBD and hinge region, respectively, were specifically involved in these events. We observed that a MyoD-dependent reporter gene driven by four multimerised MyoD binding sites (from the MCK-enhancer), cloned upstream of the herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter, was specifically inhibited by COUP-TF II expression. Our study suggested that one of the mechanisms involved in this process of repression was the direct interaction between MyoD and COUP-TF II. Additional in vitro experiments demonstrated that the interaction was mediated by the acid-rich N-terminal activation domain of MyoD (which also mediates p300 binding) and the CD region of COUP-TF II. Furthermore, COUP-TF II interacted with the N-terminal RID (aa 1-149) of the cofactor p300. This is perhaps not surprising, since many other classical ligand activated nuclear receptors (e.g. RAR, TR, RXR, etc.) interact with the coactivator p300 (42). However, the fact that the DBD (C-region) and hinge/D-region of COUP-TF II mediate the interaction to p300 and MyoD is novel, and perhaps suprising. With respect to the in vitro and in vivo requirement of the COUP-TF II DBD and hinge region (aa 79-213) as a dimerisation interface for myoD and p300, it should be mentioned that this domain contains the DR and T box motifs, which have been implicated as dimerisation interfaces in RXR (and other nuclear receptors). Furthermore, they are highly homologous to the similar motifs found in RXR, which is expected, since COUP-TF II and RXR belong to the same nuclear receptor sub-family (47,48). The DR box has been strongly implicated in the heterodimerisation of TR and RAR with RXR. The DR boxes in RXR[gamma] and COUP-TF II are highly homologous. Similarly, the T-box sequence that forms a third helix in RXR, and is implicated in homo- and heterodimerisation, is very similar in COUP-TF II and RXR (49-53). Recently, COUP-TF II and SpI have been demonstrated to synergistically regulate the transcription of the HIV type I LTR (54). In support of our observations, they demonstrated that the in vitro and in vivo physical interaction with SpI is mediated by the DBD of COUP-TF. Furthermore, the Octamer transcription factors are recruited by the C-region (DBD) of the glucocorticoid receptor (55)..

The generation of a lacZ knock-in allele in the COUP-TFII locus in mice allows us to use X-gal staining to follow the expression of COUP-TFII in the developing stomach. We found COUP-TFII is expressed in the mesenchyme and the epithelium of the developing stomach. Conditional ablation of floxed COUP-TFII by Nkx3-2Cre recombinase in the gastric mesenchyme results in dysmorphogenesis of the developing stomach manifested by major patterning defects in posteriorization and radial patterning. The epithelial outgrowth, the expansion of the circular smooth muscle layer and enteric neurons as well as the posteriorization of the stomach resemble phenotypes exhibited by inhibition of hedgehog signaling pathways. Using organ cultures and cyclopamine treatment, we showed downregulation of COUP-TFII level in the stomach, suggesting COUP-TFII as a target of hedgehog signaling in the stomach. Our results are consistent with a functional link between hedgehog proteins and COUP-TFII, factors that are vital for epithelial-mesenchymal interactions..

0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	6	   Introduction TOP SUMMARY Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion REFERENCES   Gut development depends upon crosstalk between endoderm and splanchnic mesenchyme cell layers along the anteroposterior axis, resulting in the subdivision of the gut into foregut, midgut and hindgut (Kedinger et al., 1998b; Kedinger et al., 1998a; De Santa Barbara et al., 2002). The stomach becomes specified at the caudal end of foregut and emerges as a bulge of the developing GI tract (Kaufman and Bard, 1999). The stomach then undergoes progressive remodeling and differentiation in a regionally specific fashion. The detailed genetic and molecular pathways that direct gastric organogenesis are still unknown, but it is clear that patterning of the GI tract requires elaborate cellular communication between the epithelium and mesenchyme cell layers (Fukuda and Yasugi, 2002)..
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	7	Sonic hedgehog (Shh) patterns a variety of embryonic tissues, including the fore-stomach epithelium by signaling to the mesenchyme prior to organ regionalization (Chiang et al., 1996). Shh-null mice exhibit inappropriate expression of alkaline-phosphatase (EAP) in the epithelium of the hind-stomach (Ramalho-Santos et al., 2000), which is consistent with the stomach epithelium acquiring an intestinal or `posteriorized' character. Conversely, the stomach of the activin receptor IIA and B compound mutant (ActRIIA/B mutant; Acvr2a/Acvr2b to Mouse Genome Informatics) exhibits posterior extension of the fore-stomach epithelium with expansion of Shh expression (Kim et al., 2000), a process referred to as `anteriorization'. These data suggest that Shh expression in the fore-stomach acts to induce and/or maintain non-intestinal character, resulting in the development of gastric epithelium (Ramalho-Santos et al., 2000)..

Two members have been identified in mice, COUP-TFI (Nr2f1 to Mouse Genome Informatics) and COUP-TFII (Nr2f2 to Mouse Genome Informatics). The temporal and spatial expression pattern of COUP-TFII in mesenchyme led us to hypothesize that COUP-TFII plays a role in mesenchymal-epithelial interactions during organogenesis (Tsai and Tsai, 1997). In the developing neural tube, Shh has been shown to regulate COUP-TFII expression during the differentiation of motoneurons (Lutz et al., 1994). We have also identified a 5'-regulatory element that mediates Shh stimulation of COUP-TFII expression (Krishnan et al., 1997a; Krishnan et al., 1997b). COUP-TFII is likely to be a downstream target of Shh signaling, and the requirement for Shh in gastric organogenesis led us to infer that COUP-TFII may play a role in stomach development..

The first loxP site was inserted into BglI site of 7.2 kb BamHI-SalI fragment and the NsiI site on the 2.6 kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment was modified with XhoI linker. These four genomic fragments were reconstructed, and XhoI site on the 2.6 kb EcoRI-BamHI region was modified with linker containing ClaI site at the 3' end. pNeoTKLoxP, a positive-negative selection cassette, was modified and ligated with lacZ from pDP46.21. This NeoTKLoxP-lacZ construct was inserted into XhoI-ClaI linker at 3'-UTR. 5'-SalI site of NeoTKLoxP-lacZ was destroyed by ligation with XhoI, and ClaI site and NotI site were blunt-end-ligated after fill-in reaction. Targeting construct consists of 4 kb 5'-arm, 6.5 kb floxed COUP-TFII locus, 8.5 kb NeoTKLoxP-lacZ and 2 kb 3'-arm, a total size of 24 kb was linearized with NotI at the 3' end. Homologous recombination was performed in AB1.2 cells (Qiu et al., 1997) and ES cell clones were screened by two rounds of Southern blot analysis. Correctly targeted clones were first identified by screening XbaI digest with 5'-external and 3'-external probes (5'-ext and 3'-ext, respectively) and subsequently transfected with a Cre recombinase expression vector followed by screening HindIII digests with a 5'-internal probe (5'-int) and XbaI digest with a 3'-external probe. Chimeric animals were generated by microinjection and germline transmission was achieved by crossing with C57Bl/6 wild-type female. Thereafter, mutant mice carrying floxed allele were maintained in 129/B6 mixed background. Specific primers were designed for floxed COUP-TFII genotyping by PCR. The primer sequences were NT1 5'-CAGTCGCCTCTCCTTCTCCTTCTCC-3', NT2 5'-CATCCGGGATATGTTACTGTCCGG-3', NT3A 5'-TTCTGGTCTTCACCCACCGGTACC-3' and NT6A 5'-TGGGGAAGCTAAGTGTTGTAGTGATTCC-3'.

This targeting vector was introduced into ES cells together with Cre recombinase. Upon recombination between the first and the last LoxP sites, COUP-TFII was deleted and the expression of lacZ reporter, inserted into the 5' untranslated region of COUP-TFII locus, was activated. The ES cells were subsequently injected into blastocysts to generate lacZ knock-in alleles in mice. lacZ gene expression is under the control of COUP-TFII promoter and its expression recapitulates the expression of the endogenous COUP-TFII gene. Using this lacZ knock-in allele, we examined the expression pattern of COUP-TFII during gut development..

Generation of the lacZ knock-in allele and generation of floxed COUP-TFII allele. Using homologous recombination, a targeting construct containing nuclear lacZ, Neo/TK and LoxP sites were inserted into the genomic COUP-TFII locus, generating a targeted allele in ES cells. Treatment with Cre recombinase and FIAU selection resulted in a lacZ knock-in allele in which lacZ gene expression was controlled by the endogenous COUP-TFII promoter when recombination took place between the first and the third loxP sites of the targeted allele. In addition, floxed COUP-TFII ES clones that retains COUP-TFII locus but lacks selection markers were generated when recombination took place between the second and the third loxP sites.

0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	21	  At embryonic day (E) 12.5, X-gal staining was detected in both the epithelium and mesenchyme of the stomach. Brief staining of cryostat sections revealed that mesenchymal cells adjacent to the endoderm had higher expression of COUP-TFII than did distal mesenchymal cells, suggesting that a potential diffusible molecule, secreted from the epithelium might regulate COUP-TFII expression in the mesenchyme (Fig. 1B). At postnatal day 3, COUP-TFII/lacZ was detected throughout the stomach (Fig. 1C), and was sharply downregulated in duodenum (red arrowhead indicates junction between stomach and duodenum). COUP-TFII/lacZ was also expressed in the glandular epithelium of adult stomach. Adult glandular epithelium forms tubular structures, each of which is referred to as a zymogenic unit, which can be subdivided into four regions; a surface pit, an isthmus, a neck and a base that is located proximal to the sub mucosa (Karam and Leblond, 1993). Strong lacZ staining was evident at the base, and much lower at surface pit layer (Fig. 1D). To ensure COUP-TFII is also expressed in the parietal cells, we used DBA lectin for immunostaining. As shown in Fig. 1D, X-gal and lectin-positive green cells colocalized, indicating that COUP-TFII is expressed in the parietal cells of the Zymogenic unit. The expression pattern of COUP-TFII in the Zymogenic unit mimics the reported expression pattern of Shh in mouse stomach (van den Brink et al., 2001). Thus, COUP-TFII is abundantly expressed from an early developmental stage in both epithelium and mesenchyme of the stomach in parallel with Shh..

The targeting vector depicted in Fig. 1A, was introduced into ES cells. After excision of the Neo-TK cassette by Cre-based recombination, ES cells harboring the conditional allele were generated as depicted in Fig. 1A and used to generate floxed COUP-TFII mice. An Nkx3-2Cre mouse line was also generated (K.M., W.E.Z. and R.J.S., unpublished), which was crossed with the floxed COUP-TFII mice. As lacZ is only turned on in cells with COUP-TFII locus recombined or deleted, X-gal staining can be used as a marker for successful COUP-TFII recombined or deleted cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, X-gal staining of an E12.5 stomach from Nkx3-2Cre/+; COUP-TFIIflox/+ embryo demonstrates that COUP-TFII was ablated specifically in the gastric mesenchyme (Fig. 2C). This is expected because X-gal staining of lacZ knock-in mice is detected only in the stomach primordium (Fig. 2A) which is similar to Nkx3-2-Cre expression at E9.5, as demonstrated by the product of intercrossing the Nkx3-2Cre with ROSA26 reporter strain (Fig. 2B)..

Moreover, submucosal extension of -smooth muscle actin positive cells in the mutant fore-stomach (Fig. 3F, white arrows) indicated precocious differentiation of smooth muscle cells. To further demonstrate that the smooth muscle layer in the conditional mutant stomach is disorganized, semi-thin sections (Fig. 3I,J) and the ultrastructure (data not shown) of the stomachs from E15.5 embryos were examined. Again, circular smooth muscle layer of the conditional mutant stomach is disorganized (Fig. 3J) in comparison with the controls (Fig. 3I) at E15.5 as revealed by semi-thin sections. However, cellular defects, other than the disorganization of cell layers, have not been observed (data not shown). Immunostaining for PGP9.5, an enteric neuron marker, showed an increased number of positively stained cells in the conditional mutant mice (Fig. 3L). To ensure there is expansion of enteric neurons in the mutant stomach, an additional neuronal marker, TUJ1 (neuronal class III tubulin-ss) was employed in immunostaining. An increase of TUJ1-positive cells is shown in the conditional mutant (Fig. 3N) in comparison with the littermate control (Fig. 3M). Taken together, conditional ablation of COUP-TFII in the mesenchyme resulted in at least two patterning abnormalities, epithelium outgrowth and expansion of circular smooth muscle and enteric neuron, both radial-patterning defects of the stomach.

Detailed histological examination reveals abnormalities in both the epithelium and mesenchyme. The glandular epithelium was thicker in mutants when compared with controls (Fig. 4E-H). In control mice, the epithelium was thickest at the pyloric region (to the left of Fig. 4E), and the thickness of the epithelium progressively decreased anteriorly (towards the right). By contrast, the epithelium of conditional mutant mice remained thick even in more anterior regions (Fig. 4F). The mesenchyme of the conditional mutant mice was also thickened.

The radial and AP patterning defects elicited by the COUP-TFII-null mutants bear resemblance to the dysmorphogenesis of the stomach in Shh-null mutant mice (Ramalho-Santos et al., 2000). Because of this similarity, we asked if COUP-TFII expression is altered in the Shh-null mutant. Whole-mount in situ hybridization showed that COUP-TFII expression in the caudal region of the stomach of the Shh-null mutant is downregulated in comparison with the control littermate. However, the expression of COUP-TFII in other regions of the stomach is only slightly downregulated (Fig. 9A,B). An anterior shifting of the caudal margin of COUP-TFII expression at the gastro-duodenal junction (indicated by broken lines; presumptive gastro-duodenal junction is indicated by arrowheads based on morphology and location of the dorsal mesogastrium) was evident in the Shh-null mutant.

Explants dissected from E10.5 lacZ knock-in embryos were cultured for 48 hours in the presence of increasing amounts of cyclopamine. Whole-mount X-gal staining of COUP-TFII illustrated a significant dose-dependent reduction of COUP-TFII/lacZ expression, especially in the mesenchyme between lung bud and fore-stomach (indicated by arrowheads) (Fig. 9C-F). At 1  microM of cyclopamine, a slight reduction of COUP-TFII mRNA, as represented by X-gal staining, was detected in the stomach explants from E11.5 embryos. At 5  microM and 10  microM of cyclopamine, the reduction of X-gal staining was more pronounced in the stomach when compared with the controls (Fig. 9E,F), while COUP-TFII mRNA was not affected in lung explants (not shown). The downregulation of COUP-TFII expression when Hh signaling is inhibited by cyclopamine substantiates the notion that Hh signaling regulates COUP-TFII expression in the stomach..

It is apparent that COUP-TFII is expressed in both the mesenchyme and the epithelium of the developing stomach. The graded mesenchymal expression profile, with highest levels in mesenchyme subjacent to the epithelium, suggests a diffusible molecule secreted by the epithelium may regulate the expression of COUP-TFII. COUP-TFII is also expressed in the glandular epithelium of the stomach, with highest expression in the base where the zymogenic cells are localized, but is not expressed in the surface pit cells. The expression patterns in the zymogenic unit resemble that of Shh (van den Brink et al., 2001). Taken together of the above findings, we speculate that Shh might regulate COUP-TFII in the stomach in a similar manner as previously shown in the motoneurons (Krishnan et al., 1997a)..

At E12.5, it is already apparent that the circular smooth muscles layers and the enteric neurons layers are expanded and disorganized in the conditional mutants. These defects persist at later stages of development. Although COUP-TFII in the epithelial compartment has not been deleted, the epithelium is considerably thicker in comparison with the control littermates, indicating signals from the mesenchyme are required for appropriate epithelium growth. The defects display by the COUP-TFII conditional mutants indicate that COUP-TFII is essential for radial patterning of the developing stomach and these defects are not seen in the compound heterozygote of Nkx3.2 and COUP-TFII. Instead, the inappropriate differentiation of the smooth muscles cells and enteric neurons in the mesenchyme has been shown when Hh signaling is disrupted by treatment with cyclopamine (Sukegawa et al., 2000; van den Brink et al., 2001). Shh is believed to be the epithelial signal that inhibits the gut mesenchyme to differentiate into smooth cells and the neural crest cells to differentiate into enteric neurons. Our findings indicate that COUP-TFII participates in the negative regulation of differentiation of smooth muscle cells and enteric neurons in the gut mesenchyme. COUP-TFII can either serve as a downstream target of Hh to mediate its negative function in the gut mesenchyme or exert its effect in a pathway parallel to Hh to regulate mesenchymal differentiation..

The anterior shift of the limited ridge that divides the fore- and hind-stomach, the reduced size of the fore-stomach, the expansion of the hind-stomach and the expansion of EAP expression into the hind-stomach are all consistent with disruption of the AP axis patterning in the stomach. However, the differentiation of the epithelium of the fore- and hind-stomach in the adult mutant remains unchanged; with all the molecular markers analyzed, even the mutant stomach is posteriorized. The posteriorization and ectopic extended expression of EAP in the hind-stomach of the conditional mutant have been demonstrated in the Shh-null mutant mice (Ramalho-Santos et al., 2000). The striking similarity of the phenotypes exhibited by conditional COUP-TFII-null mutants and animals, chick and mouse, when Hh signaling is disrupted further implicates that Hh and COUP-TFII act in the same and/or parallel pathways..

Indeed, the downregulation of COUP-TFII expression in the mesenchyme of the stomach is more pronounced in the explants treated with cyclopamine, supporting the notion that COUP-TFII is a downstream target of Hh signaling. In addition, Shh signaling can directly activate COUP-TFII expression and Shh-N activates COUP-TFII expression in P19 cells without de novo protein synthesis (Krishnan et al., 1997a; Krishnan et al., 1997b). Furthermore, analysis of the COUP-TFII promoter has identified an ShhRE that is distinct from the defined Gli-binding site (Krishnan et al., 1997a). Thus, all the above results indicate that COUP-TFII mediates Hh signaling in the stomach. Taken together, our results established that COUP-TFII is essential for radial and AP patterning of the stomach. Restriction of anterior Shh expression and attenuation of Shh action in the epithelium of the COUP-TFII conditional mutant, in turn, suggests a potential role for COUP-TFII in the stimulation or maintenance of Shh expression..

The Hoxa5-null mutant phenotype provides evidence for mesenchyme-mediated regulation of Shh expression in the developing stomach (Aubin et al., 2002). Similarly in chick, it was suggested that adjacent mesenchyme regulates Shh expression (Narita et al., 1998). In our study, COUP-TFII was ablated in the mesenchyme and the observed dysmorphogenesis suggests that COUP-TFII potentially affects such mesenchymal factor(s). One such candidate, Bmp4, which belongs to the TGFss superfamily, is expressed in the mesenchyme of developing murine stomach, while the chick ortholog has been demonstrated to play a role in gizzard patterning. Bmp4 is important for mesoderm development, but because of early lethality in Bmp4-null mutants, no specific role for Bmp4 in gastric development has been elucidated (Winnier et al., 1995). Interestingly, it has been shown that COUP-TFII binds to the mouse Bmp4 promoter and regulates Bmp4 promoter activity in transient transfection assays (Feng et al., 1995), suggesting COUP-TFII might function through BMP signaling. Another member of TGFss super family, activin, governs embryonic axial patterning, and restricts Shh expression in Hensen's node (Monsoro-Burq and Le Douarin, 2001). Furthermore, the expansion of Shh expression domain within the stomach of Acvr2a/Acvr2b mutant mice indicates a restriction of Shh in the foregut that is potentially regulated by TGFss/Bmp signaling. As Acvr2 is able to interact with BMPs (Kim et al., 2000), mesenchymal expressed Bmp4 may restrict Shh expression. Alternatively, it is possible that COUP-TFII may modulate the expression of activin/activin receptor themselves. Enhanced activin signaling may restrict the expression domain of Shh to the anterior border and perturb the epithelial growth, as seen in the conditional mutant stomach. Further analysis of TGFss/Bmp/activin signaling in the COUP-TFII conditional mutant stomach may shed light on which mesenchymal factor(s) that regulate Shh expression are affected by the absence of COUP-TFII..

A diverse family of long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons possesses chromodomains in their integrases (IN), suggesting that the chromodomains may control integration. The LTR-retrotransposon Tf1 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is highly active and possesses a chromodomain in the COOH terminus of its IN. To test this chromodomain for a role in integration, recombinant INs with and without the chromodomain were assayed for activity in in vitro reactions. The full-length IN had integration activity with oligonucleotide substrates that modeled both the insertion reaction and a reverse reaction known as disintegration. The INs of retroviruses possess an additional activity termed 3' processing that must remove 2-3 nucleotides from the 3' ends of the viral cDNA before insertion can occur. These additional nucleotides are added during reverse transcription because of the position of the minus strand primer downstream of the LTR. The position of the primer for Tf1 suggests no nucleotides are added 3' of the LTR. It was therefore surprising that Tf1 IN was capable of 3' cleavage. The most unexpected result reported here was that the IN lacking the chromodomain had significantly higher activity and substantially reduced substrate specificity. These results reveal that both the activity and specificity of enzymes can be modulated by their chromodomains..

Both types of elements encode Gag, protease, reverse transcriptase, and IN proteins and both depend on IN to insert their cDNA into the genome of a host cell. The LTRs, positioned at the ends of the cDNA, are subdivided into an upstream segment, U3, a central region, R, and a downstream segment, U5. A large number of biochemical studies with purified IN have characterized the chemistry of insertion (10-12). The INs of retroviruses have two activities that are necessary for the integration of the viral cDNA. At first, 2 or 3 nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the LTRs. This site-specific nucleolytic cleavage or "3' processing reaction" is required to position the "CA" dinucleotides at the 3' ends of the cDNA. The CA dinucleotides are conserved among all retroviruses and their position at the 3' ends of the cDNA is required for the second step of retrovirus integration, the "strand transfer reaction." During this second step, the 3' hydroxyls of the terminal "A" act as nucleophiles in a pair of transesterification reactions that cleave the phosphodiester bonds in the target DNA and simultaneously make a covalent bond between the 3' ends of the viral DNA and the 5' ends of the target DNA..

Expression of Tf1 from a high copy plasmid results in the formation of virus-like particles, the reverse transcription of the Tf1 mRNA, and the integration of the cDNA into intergenic sequences (19-21). A novel mechanism of self-priming initiates minus strand reverse transcription from the upstream LTR (22).

Briefly, the IN-coding DNA segment of Tf1 was amplified by PCR. The resulting fragment was flanked with SalI sites that were introduced into the BamHI site of pET15B and sequenced. The NH2 terminus of the Tf1 IN was predicted based on the amino terminus of the IN from a closely related element, Ty3 (24). The NH2 terminus of the recombinant Tf1 IN started with the sequence TDDFK- and the COOH terminus ended with the sequence -NNLNI. The resulting protein was 477 residues long and was fused at its amino terminus to a 21-residue peptide containing the His6 tag and the thrombin cleavage site. The plasmid expressing CH-, pHL2469, generated by a similar method. The CH-, coding DNA segment was amplified by PCR with the primers HL1167 and HL1168, using the Pfu Turbo thermostable DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The DNA generated was cleaved with NdeI and BamHI, cloned into the vector pET15b, and sequenced. The CH- protein had the same amino terminus as the full-length IN but ended with the sequence -RHNSE. Altogether CH- was 406 + 21 (tag) residues long. Both plasmids were introduced into the strain BL21. The bacteria were grown in LB broth supplemented with 100  microg/ml of carbenicillin. The culture temperature was 32  degrees C and the cells were grown until they reached an A600 of about 0.6. Induction was performed with 1 mM isopropyl 1-thio--D-galactopyranoside for an additional period of 3 h at 32 degrees C. The cells were harvested, and the pellets were stored at -80  degrees C..

After a thorough mixing, the solutions were kept for 15 min on ice followed by the addition of more NaCl to a final concentration of 0.5 M. Then, the solutions were sonicated on ice, followed by the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v), and gentle mixing. We have found that the presence of this detergent is critical to dissociate the recombinant INs off the bacterial DNA (data not shown). The insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation for 1 h in the Beckman SW28 rotor at 26,000 rpm and the clear yellowish supernatants were subjected to affinity purification..

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	37	The model substrate designed to measure disintegration activity is shown in Fig. 2A. The 5' end of the target DNA was labeled with 32P. The reaction results in a concerted cleavage-ligation where the donor DNA is excised and the disrupted target is repaired. This results in the production of a 63-nt product labeled with 32P at its 5' end. Because of its size, the 63-nt product could be readily distinguished from the initial species labeled with 32P, the 20-nt substrate. Separate substrates were designed that mimicked either the U3 or U5 ends of the Tf1 LTR. The IN and CH- proteins produced substantial amounts of the 63-nt product using either the U3 or U5 substrates (Fig. 2B). We tested whether the disintegration substrates as designed for Tf1 IN could be recognized by another IN, that of HIV-1. Interestingly, HIV-1 IN is at least as active with the U3 and U5 substrates as the two Tf1 INs (Fig. 2B, right panel). This is despite the low homology between the Tf1 and HIV-1 sequences at the ends of their donor DNAs..

Initially, we used double-stranded oligonucleotides with blunt ends that terminated with the CA dinucleotide (Fig. 5A). The oligonucleotide with the 3' CA was labeled at its 5' end with 32P.

The lengths of these products varied because the integration into the acceptor DNA was relatively random. However, it was apparent for both IN and CH- that with the U5 substrate there were preferred positions. Interestingly, a significant fraction of the extended products were longer than twice the size of the 24-nt substrate and products as long as 70-mers were observed. This indicates that both versions of Tf1 INs were capable of three or more integration events in which products of the first round of integration served as substrates for further integration events. To our knowledge, such multiple round integrations have not been reported for other INs..

The primer for the minus strand of Tf1 is positioned adjacent to the LTR so it is predicted that no processing activity is required (28, 29). However, sequences of Tf1 cDNA extracted from particles revealed the surprising result that 85% of the 3' ends had one or more untemplated nucleotides.4 Because these nucleotides are added to the 3' ends after the CA dinucleotide, they are expected to block integration. We therefore speculated that Tf1 IN would have a processing activity that would remove these nucleotides to expose the CA dinucleotides and allow integration..

The 3' end extensions were either in the form of a single-stranded overhang (Ov) beyond the CA or they were base paired in the form of a blunt end (Bl).

The processing activity of IN produced the 24-nt sequence as the dominant product from the substrates with "tt," "at," "ttt," and "ttttt" as single-stranded extensions. In the one case of a substrate with a Bl end ("at"), IN generated the 24-nt species along with several other smaller products. These additional products are seen to a lesser extent with the other substrates and are likely because of nonspecific nuclease activity of IN. This type of nonspecific activity is observed with other INs (30). It is reported that a variety of INs possess an intrinsic DNA hydrolysis or alcoholysis activity that is responsible for nonspecific nuclease activity similar to what we observed (31)..

However, CH- generated substantially more products of strand transfer than IN. The levels of these strand transfer products greater than 24 nt were quantified. The activity of CH- with all substrates was significantly higher than that of IN. For example, the activities with the tt-Ov was 57% and with at-Ov was 38% relative to that produced with the pre-processed substrate. The comparable figures for IN were 11 and 15%, respectively. Because the increase in strand transfer requires enhanced 3' end processing, these data indicate that the 3' end processing activity of CH- is higher than that of IN..

Compared with the processing activity of HIV-1 IN with this substrate, the Tf1 proteins exhibited very little activity. This indicates that in addition to the CA dinucleotide, the Tf1 proteins recognize sequence in the U5 substrate specific for Tf1.

We tested whether the IN of Tf1 had this same requirement for CA and whether the chromodomain contributed to this specificity. IN and CH- were tested for whether each of the last three nucleotides of the LTRs, ACA was necessary for strand transfer (Fig. 9). The substrates were based on the U3 double-stranded donor used in Figs. 7 and 8 that lacked extensions 3' of the ACA. Thus, no 3' processing was required. Single, double, and triple substitutions were made in the ACA to test the dependence on this triplet. All the modifications introduced in the sequence led to a dramatic reduction of the strand transfer activity of IN. In sharp contrast to IN, CH- was capable of strand transfer with most of the substituted substrates. Except for the substrate in which all three terminal nucleotides were flipped (tgt), CH- had greater than 10% of the activity observed with the unsubstituted substrate. The most striking difference between CH- and IN was with the substrate with a -1 transition (AtA). CH- retained 50% of the activity observed with the ACA terminus, whereas the full-length IN had just 1% activity.

It provides a highly sensitive assay for the cleavage-ligation activity of IN. The disintegration assay developed here for Tf1 IN was used to optimize the reaction conditions. The increased activities of Tf1 IN with low concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 3A) were similar to what was observed with retroviral INs (26, 33). Because magnesium is thought to be the important divalent metal in vivo, the preference Tf1 IN had for manganese might be the result of structural defects in the recombinant protein. However, the preference for manganese could be a common property of INs as the INs of HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus also exhibit strong preferences for manganese over magnesium in vitro (26, 33). The ability of HIV-IN to react efficiently with the Tf1 substrate (Fig. 2) suggested that the disintegration activity of HIV-1 IN had little sequence specificity. This is consistent with data from several studies indicating that beyond the requirement for the CA, the disintegration activity of retroviral INs is not sequence specific (25, 34-36)..

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	88	  In one respect, the processing activity was quite unexpected. It was thought that the 3' end processing activity of retroviruses and LTR-retrotransposons is required only in the cases where the priming of minus strand reverse transcription adds nucleotides beyond the conserved CA. For Tf1, the 3' end of the minus strand primer is immediately adjacent to the U5 sequence of the upstream LTR (28, 29). As a result, no extensions and no processing were thought to occur. However, recent analyses of Tf1 cDNA extracted from particles revealed that 85% of the U3 and U5 ends terminated with nontemplated nucleotides.4 The processing activity of IN observed here could in theory remove these 3' extensions and allow the bulk of the cDNA to participate in integration. This model raises the question why would nontemplated nucleotides be added just so they could be removed by IN. One possibility is that the nontemplated nucleotides could prevent aberrant annealing of the 3' end to sequences in the opposite LTR and its subsequent extension. As a result, the nontemplated nucleotides would protect the completed cDNA until IN initiates 3' processing. Another possibility is that the nontemplated nucleotides could protect the conserved CA from attack by nonspecific 3' exonucleases..

Nevertheless, most other LTR-retrotransposons such as Ty1 have minus strand primers immediately adjacent to the U5 sequence of their LTR and are not thought to have processing (39). The finding that Tf1 IN has processing activity brings into question the predicted lack of processing activity in the INs of the other LTR-retrotransposons. Approximately 25% of Ty1 cDNA terminates with nontemplated nucleotides (40). The cDNA with the nontemplated additions could participate in integration only if the IN has processing activity. However, analyses of Ty1 IN failed to detect processing activity (41, 42)..

In vitro experiments show that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase possesses terminal transferase activity that adds nontemplated nucleotides to the 3' end of the nascent DNA (43-45). A time course of reverse transcription during HIV-1 infection identified a prominent species of cDNA that had one nucleotide extra on the 3' end of the plus strand (46). This led the authors to propose that the extra nucleotide was the result of nontemplated addition and that the 3' processing activity of IN removed it..

Although removing 15% of IN might be expected to reduce activity substantially, the deletion of the chromodomain resulted in a intriguing increase in the disintegration and strand transfer activities. CH- also had greater 3' processing activity than IN, assuming that the greater amounts of strand transfer products generated were all derived from processed oligonucleotides. Evidence supporting this assumption was that oligonucleotides with the blocking nucleotide (dd)c 3' of the CA were just as efficiently converted into products of strand transfer by CH- as oligonucleotides without the (dd)c block (Fig. 8). These data indicate that the chromodomain of Tf1 IN negatively modulates the IN activities..

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	98	In addition to its role in limiting integration activity, the chromodomain had a significant impact in restricting the sequence at the 3' end of the donor DNA that could function in strand transfer. Only when the chromodomain was present was there a strict requirement for the ACA at the 3' end of the donor DNA (Fig. 9). The strong specificity of the intact IN is in contrast to the IN of Ty1, which in similar types of assays can tolerate many alterations in the 3' end of the donor DNA (42). However, INs of retroviruses, such as HIV-1, lack chromodomains and yet exhibit strict requirements for the sequences at the 3' end of the donor DNA (35, 37). Thus, the chromodomain is not the only means for INs to achieve this strict requirement for the CA at the 3' end of donor oligonucleotides. Therefore, it appears that in the case of Tf1 IN, the chromodomain evolved independently as a means of restricting donor sequences..

Although there are several examples of chromodomains that interact directly with histone H3, the lack of histone proteins in our assays indicates such an interaction is not required for the restrictive properties of the Tf1 chromodomain. Functional analyses of several chromodomains recently revealed an unexpected diversity of interaction targets such as DNA and RNA (7). It is possible that the chromodomain of Tf1 restricts IN activity through interactions with the donor DNA. Regardless of the mode of inhibition, there is the interesting possibility that in vivo, the inhibition is regulated. One intriguing hypothesis is that the chromodomain does interact with histone H3 and it is this interaction at the target site that relieves the inhibitory function of the chromodomain. The chromodomain of HP1 forms an organized cluster of strands and helices in response to its interaction with the NH2 terminus of H3 (32, 47). This dramatic reorganization is consistent with a role in regulating integration..

The restrictive role of the chromodomain identified here may very well be true for the other chromodomain containing INs. In addition to INs, chromodomains have been identified in several other enzymes. The H3 lysine 9-specific histone methyltransferase Su(var)3-9, the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors, CHD, the DNA methyltransferase CMT, and the histone acetylase CDY, are all enzymes that contain chromodomains (7).

High concentrations of salt or the introduction of amino acid substitutions have been necessary to solubilize individual domains of INs. A number of structures have been determined for each of the three domains of the INs from the retroviruses HIV-1, simian immunodeficiency virus, avian sarcoma virus, and Rous sarcoma virus (18). However, the lack of a structure for an intact IN makes it difficult to model the spatial relationships between the three domains. During the purification of Tf1 IN it became clear that this IN was substantially more soluble than other integrases previously studied. It is possible that this solubility will lead to the first crystal structure of a full-length IN. This would serve as a significant leap in understanding the structures of INs in general and more specifically, of HIV-1 IN. A structure of an intact IN would substantially facilitate the design and development of new drugs against HIV IN and, thus, contribute to the ongoing fight against AIDS..

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor I (COUP-TFI) is an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that comprises key regulators of many biological functions, such as embryonic development, metabolism, homeostasis, and reproduction. Although COUP-TFI can both actively silence gene transcription and antagonize the functions of various other nuclear receptors, the COUP-TFI orphan receptor also acts as a transcriptional activator in certain contexts. Moreover, COUP-TFI has recently been shown to serve as an accessory factor for some ligand-bound nuclear receptors, suggesting that it may modulate, both negatively and positively, a wide range of hormonal responses. In the absence of any identified cognate ligand, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of COUP-TFI activity remain unclear. The elucidation of several putative phosphorylation sites for MAPKs, PKC, and casein kinase II within the sequence of this orphan receptor led us to investigate phosphorylation events regulating the various COUP-TFI functions. After showing that COUP-TFI is phosphorylated in vivo, we provide evidence that in vivo inhibition of either MAPK or PKC signaling pathway leads to a specific and pronounced decrease in COUP-TFI-dependent transcriptional activation of the vitronectin gene promoter. Focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying the MAPK- and PKC-mediated regulation of COUP-TFI activity, we show that COUP-TFI can be directly targeted by PKC and MAPK. These phosphorylation events differentially modulate COUP-TFI functions: PKC-mediated phosphorylation enhances COUP-TFI affinity for DNA and MAPK-mediated phosphorylation positively regulates the transactivation function of COUP-TFI, possibly through enhancing specific coactivator recruitment. These data provide evidence that COUP-TFI is likely to integrate distinct signaling pathways and raise the possibility that multiple extracellular signals influence biological processes controlled by COUP-TFI..

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   THE NUCLEAR RECEPTOR superfamily encompasses many ligand-activated transcription factors in addition to also a large number of proteins whose ligands are unknown and which are thus termed orphan receptors (1, 2). These receptors play crucial roles both as transcriptional activators and repressors, and are regulators of a wide range of biological functions including development, metabolism and reproduction. Among nuclear orphan receptors, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors (COUP-TFs) are encoded by distinct genes sharing an exceptionally high degree of sequence homology (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). The expression patterns of COUP-TFs have been extensively studied in several divergent species and appear to be relatively similar, suggesting a conservation of COUP-TF function throughout evolution. Although each COUP-TF has its own distinct expression pattern during embryonic development and in adult mice, these patterns are often overlapping and both genes are widely expressed in the developing central nervous system (8, 11, 12, 13). These findings suggest a functional redundancy among COUP-TFs, which are classically considered to act as key factors during neurogenesis. Overexpression of COUP-TFs and gene disruption experiments performed in Drosophila, Xenopus, and mouse, define a major role of these orphan receptors in the formation of the anterior brain in tetrapods, in the patterning of the eye in the fly, and in the modulation of axogenesis and cranial neural crest cell behavior in mammals, respectively (3, 9, 14, 15, 16). The recent finding that COUP-TFI function is required for cortical layer IV cell survival through correct guidance and connection of axons from mouse thalamic neurons supports the hypothesis that COUP-TFI functions in the transcriptional control of axon guidance cues (17). Aside from neuronal expression patterns, COUP-TFs show overlapping, yet distinct, expression patterns in many tissues during development, suggesting their involvement in organogenesis (8, 13). Consistent with a role for these nuclear receptors accessory to neurogenesis, recent data show that COUP-TFII is involved in angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, and heart development (16, 18)..

A functional cross-talk between COUP-TFs and retinoid-signaling pathways during development has been proposed, based on the comprehensively documented antagonistic effects of COUP-TFs on retinoid-dependent gene expression, and the observation that COUP-TF genes are themselves targeted by retinoids (7, 8, 15, 27, 28). However, recent data indicate that the orphan receptors can also serve as accessory factors for some ligand-bound nuclear receptors such as GR, ER, and RAR (29, 30, 31). In some specific promoter contexts, COUP-TFs are thus able to enhance the ligand-induced transactivation function of these various receptors, suggesting that COUP-TFs may be required for effectively establishing the cues for certain genetic responses after exposure of the cell to a ligand. In this respect, it is not surprising that common phenotypes, such as similar bone fusions, are generated in COUP-TFI-/- and RAR1-/-/RARss-/- independent knockout experiments (16, 32). The recent finding that COUP-TFI is required for the induction of growth inhibition and apoptosis by retinoic acid in cancer cells further substantiates a positive interaction between COUP-TFs and retinoid receptors in vivo (31)..

As an example, ER can activate transcription after phosphorylation, independent of supplemented E2 (33, 34, 35, 36, 37). In a similar manner, many other ligand-regulated nuclear receptors are either activated or repressed through phosphorylation events (33, 34), and these regulatory mechanisms seem relevant also to the orphan receptors such as Nur77/NGFI-B, HNF-4 or ROR (38, 39, 40, 41). Although COUP-TFs were cloned more than 10 yr ago, a ligand has yet to be elucidated or characterized, suggesting that COUP-TFs could be true orphan nuclear receptors. The presence of several putative phosphorylation sites for MAPKs, PKC, and casein kinase II (CKII), within its sequence led us to postulate that COUP-TFI could be targeted by cellular kinases. In this report, we demonstrate that COUP-TFI can be directly phosphorylated by PKC and MAPK, these phosphorylation events differently modulating COUP-TFI functions. COUP-TFI is thus likely to be regulated by extracellular signals transduced through distinct phosphorylation pathways..

Figure 1 demonstrates that the ability of COUP-TFI to activate this promoter is not restricted to P19 cells considering the observation of the similar induction in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1A). To delineate the promoter sequences involved in this phenomenon as well as the mode of activation by COUP-TFI, we mutated individually or in combination the two consensus (TGACCC) half-binding sites for nuclear receptors present in the mouse promoter referred to as NR1 and NR2 (Fig. 1B). Whereas the NR2 half-site could generate a direct repeat with a 3-bp spacer (DR-3) when combined to the degenerated TGACTT sequence located downstream of the NR2 site, no TGACCC-related sequence could be found in the vicinity of the NR1 sequence (Fig. 1B). Thereby, both consensus half-sites could organize a DR-66 element stably interacting with COUP-TFI dimers. When cotransfected in COS-7 cells with a COUP-TFI expression vector, the promoter in which the NR1 site was mutated was activated at a much lower level compared with its wt counterpart (Fig. 1C). Mutation of the NR2 site moderately reduced COUP-TFI-induced activation (Fig. 1C). The double NR1/NR2 mutant did not show a greater reduction of COUP-TFI-induced activity compared with the single NR1 mutant (Fig. 1C). These data strongly suggest that the NR1 site prevails over the NR2 site for COUP-TFI activation of the Vn promoter in COS-7 cells. Because COS cells are known to overproduce proteins encoded by transfected vectors, the relatively high amounts of COUP-TFI expressed in COS-7 cells could have attenuated the impact of the mutations introduced in the Vn gene promoter. Based on this observation, we transfected P19 cells with the different mutants to verify their ability to be activated by COUP-TFI (Fig. 1C). In this cellular context, both NR1 and NR2 mutations reduced COUP-TFI activation by 50%. When combined, the NR1 and NR2 mutations resulted in a loss of COUP-TFI activation by 78% (Fig. 1C), suggesting that binding to both sites is required for COUP-TFI transactivation in P19 cells. Consistent with the transfection data indicating that the NR1 site is involved in the Vn gene promoter regulation, we observed that COUP-TFI could effectively interact as a dimer (as suggested by the position of the protein/DNA complex) with the NR1 half-site in EMSA experiments (Fig. 1D). Although COUP-TFI was able to interact with the NR1-containing oligonucleotide, it conferred low affinity for this element judged by the observation that cold NR1 is a poor competitor compared with the high affinity DR1 binding element (Fig. 1D). These experiments clearly indicate that COUP-TFI could transactivate the mouse Vn gene promoter through direct binding to at least one low affinity site including the NR1 sequence, and possibly to a second site composed of the NR2 element. However, the residual activation by COUP-TFI observed with the double mutant suggests that other undetected binding-sites could be recognized by the orphan receptor, or that part of the COUP-TFI activity could be unrelated to DNA binding as previously shown in other contexts (43)..

The consensus phosphorylation sites were defined as S/TXXD/E for CKII (44), S/TXR/K for PKC (45), and PX1-2S/TP for the three distinct MAPK pathways identified in mammalian cells (46). These pathways include members of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/p44MAPK and ERK2/p42MAPK, the Jun NH2-terminal kinase and the p38 kinase (47, 48, 49). The three putative MAPK phosphorylation sites identified within the human COUP-TFI sequence were found to be highly conserved throughout evolution (8), and were clustered in the amino-terminal A/B domain (Fig. 2A). The putative CKII and PKC phosphorylation sites, some of which were also evolutionarily conserved (8), were in contrast distributed throughout the COUP-TFI sequence (Fig. 2A). The DNA binding domain (DBD) contained exclusively PKC target sites, whereas the A/B and the putative ligand binding domain (LBD) of the receptor displayed both CKII and PKC potential target sequences (Fig. 2A). The presence of several putative phosphorylation sites for various cellular kinases in the human COUP-TFI sequence raises the possibility that, similar to posttranslational modifications described for several nuclear receptors, COUP-TFI could be a phosphoprotein in vivo, whose activity may be regulated by specific phosphorylation events. To test this hypothesis, we cloned the human COUP-TFI cDNA encoding residues 57 to 423 in frame with the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) coding sequence of the mammalian expression vector pBC/GST. After mutation of the PKA site present in the GST sequence, the recombinant vector was transfected in COS-7 cells. 32P-Labeled orthophosphate was then added to label phosphoproteins in vivo. Cell extracts were purified on glutathione-agarose beads and analyzed in SDS-PAGE. The positions of GST and GST::COUP-TFI were determined by western blotting with an anti-GST antibody (data not shown). Results indicate that both GST and GST::COUP-TFI had been labeled in vivo (Fig. 2B). Although a slight incorporation of 32P was observed for GST, the GST::COUP-TFI fusion protein was approximately 90 times more radioactive than free GST, indicating that COUP-TFI is indeed a phosphoprotein in vivo..

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	24	  Multiple Phosphorylation Pathways Regulate COUP-TFI-Mediated Transcriptional Activation of the Vn Gene Promoter The functional relevance of phosphorylation events for the regulation of COUP-TFI activity was first assessed by using specific inhibitors for the three above described kinases in transfection experiments (Fig. 3). COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the COUP-TFI-dependent reporter gene Vn-luciferase (Luc) (containing the wt Vn gene promoter sequence, see Fig. 1), in the presence or absence of increasing amounts of human COUP-TFI expression vector. Cells were treated, or not treated, with DRB (5-6-dichloro-1-ss-D ribofuranosyl benzimidazole), a CKII inhibitor (Fig. 3A), or the p42MAPK/p44MAPK signaling pathway-specific inhibitor PD980059, or the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (Fig. 3B). Consistent with our previous results, cotransfection with increasing amounts of COUP-TFI expression plasmid led to a dose-dependent induction of reporter gene activity. Neither the basal nor the stimulated transcriptional activity of the reporter gene was modified by treatment of the cells with DRB (Fig. 3A). The expression level of COUP-TFI was also unaffected by this treatment (data not shown, see Fig. 5A). Based on these experiments defining that inhibition of the CKII pathway in vivo does not affect COUP-TFI-mediated transcriptional activation, it seems unlikely that this kinase regulates COUP-TFI function. Whereas basal activity was not altered, treatment of the cells with PD980059 led to a significant decrease (76% inhibition of the activation) in reporter gene activity observed in the presence of 50 ng of COUP-TFI expression vector (Fig. 3B). As assessed by Western blotting, this inhibition was not due to a decrease in nuclear receptor expression (data not shown, see Fig. 5B). The inhibitory effect of the specific MAPK inhibitor on the induction of the Vn gene promoter by COUP-TFI was not restricted to COS-7 cells as similar results were obtained in experiments utilizing P19 cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3B, treating cotransfected COS-7 cells with GF 109203X in the absence of expression vector did not influence basal activity. In contrast, GF 109203X induced a marked reduction (60% inhibition of the activation) in the reporter gene activity observed in the presence of 50 ng of COUP-TFI expression vector (Fig. 3B). Concurrent with the previous observation, the inhibition of COUP-TFI- induced reporter gene activity was not due to a reduced expression of COUP-TFI in COS-7 cells treated with GF 109203X (data not shown, see Fig. 5C). Thus, the blocking of either the p42MAPK/p44MAPK or the PKC signaling pathway results in a strong inhibition of the COUP-TFI-dependent transcription, suggesting that COUP-TFI function may be positively regulated by these kinases in vivo..

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	33	  To determine the functional requirement of the phosphorylation-mediated regulation of COUP-TFI activity, similar cotransfection experiments were performed using expression vectors encoding truncated COUP-TFI receptors (Fig. 3B). The COUP-TFI 57 to 423 protein is truncated at the amino-terminal region of the A/B domain, lacking a putative CKII and PKC phosphorylation sequence (S7), as well as two amino-terminal (T51 and T54) MAPK phosphorylation sites. In addition to these four sites, the COUP-TFI 84 to 423 protein, which is deleted of almost the entire A/B domain (86 first amino acids), is devoid of the third putative MAPK phosphorylation site (T63) and of a CKII phosphorylation site (T66). Western blotting showed that all the three constructs were efficiently expressed in COS-7 and displayed similar expression levels (Fig. 3B, right panel). Independent of the amount of expression vector used, COUP-TFI 57 to 423 was able to stimulate the reporter gene activity to a similar extent to that observed with the equivalent dose of wild-type (wt) COUP-TFI expression vector (Fig. 3B). Moreover, both PD980059 and GF 109203X efficiently counteracted the reporter gene activation mediated by 50 ng of COUP-TFI 57 to 423 expression vector. This observation suggests that the region spanning residues 1 to 56 of COUP-TFI, including one PKC and two MAPK potential phosphorylation sites, is dispensable for transactivation and is not involved in the regulation of COUP-TFI activity by the PKC and MAPK pathways. Cotransfection of COS-7 cells with increasing amounts of COUP-TFI 84 to 423 expression vector resulted in a weak stimulation of the reporter gene (Fig. 3B). Experiments run in P19 cells gave similar results (data not shown). These data suggest that residues 57 to 83 play a crucial role, directly or indirectly, in the COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation, and raise the possibility that the third (T63) MAPK phosphorylation site could be a hierarchal requisite for COUP-TFI activity and for the MAPK-mediated regulation of the nuclear receptor functions. This was, to some extent, confirmed by the observation that PD980059 is significantly less efficient in inhibiting the COUP-TFI 84 to 423-mediated transcriptional activation than it is in decreasing COUP-TFI 57 to 423-induced activation (Fig. 3B). Indeed, the inhibition of COUP-TFI 84 to 423 and COUP-TFI 57 to 423 activity due to PD980059 was 58% and 89%, respectively. The residual effect of PD980059 on COUP-TFI 84 to 423-mediated transactivation suggests the involvement of an additional nonconsensus MAPK phosphorylation site located between residues 84 to 423, or that MAPK indirectly modulates COUP-TFI activity. Finally, in cells cotransfected with 50 ng of COUP-TFI 84 to 423 expression vector, treatment with GF 109203X reduced the reporter gene activity to the basal level (Fig. 3B). This last result implies that the potential phosphorylation site(s) targeted by PKC are located outside of the A/B domain (i.e. between residues 84 and 423). All together, these findings strongly suggest that COUP-TFI activity is positively regulated by phosphorylation events in vivo, events that may be mediated by the p42MAPK/p44MAPK and PKC pathways..

In this study, COUP-TFI was expressed in COS-7 cells and whole-cell extracts (WCEs) from either untransfected or COUP-TFI-expressing cells were treated in vitro with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP). As shown in Fig. 4A, incubation of untreated WCEs from COUP-TFI-expressing cells with labeled double-stranded DR1 oligonucleotide led to the formation of a complex species shifted in EMSA experiments as a single band (indicated by an arrowhead). Supershifting experiments with anti-COUP-TFI antibody reduced the electrophoretic mobility of the retarded complex, confirming the presence of COUP-TFI in this complex. In vitro treatment of the WCEs prepared from COUP-TFI-expressing cells with CIP buffer alone or CIP buffer and phosphate had no effect on the intensity of the shifted band, showing that neither of the compounds affected the binding of COUP-TFI to DNA elements. In contrast, treatment of WCEs with CIP strongly decreased the intensity of the shifted band, providing evidence for a CIP-mediated decrease in the formation of the COUP-TFI/DR1 complex. The hypothesis that CIP-mediated dephosphorylation of COUP-TFI inhibited nuclear receptor binding to specific DNA elements was further substantiated by the observation that addition of phosphate to the dephosphorylation mixture abolished the effect of the CIP..

COS-7 cells were transfected with COUP-TFI expression vector, and subsequently treated or untreated with increasing amounts of the different kinase inhibitors described above. WCEs from untransfected or COUP-TFI-expressing cells were then incubated with the labeled double-stranded NR1 oligonucleotide. Neither the vehicle alone nor any of the tested concentrations of DRB significantly modified the intensity of the specific shifted band (Fig. 5A). As assessed by Western blotting, the amounts of DRB did not affect the expression of COUP-TFI in COS-7 cells (Fig. 5A, lower panel). Similar results were obtained using the selective p42MAPK/p44MAPK inhibitor PD980059 (Fig. 5B). Conversely, treating the transfected cells with the selective PKC inhibitor GF 109203X did influence binding of COUP-TFI to specific DNA elements (Fig. 5C). Indeed, treatment of the cells with increasing amounts of PKC inhibitor led to a pronounced and gradual decrease in the intensity of the specific shifted band (Fig. 5C). This reduction of COUP-TFI binding to DNA was not due to a decreased expression of the nuclear receptor in the treated cells, as revealed by Western blotting (Fig. 5C, lower panel). Similar results were obtained with the three kinase inhibitors using the DR1 oligonucleotide as a probe (data not shown). These observations clearly indicate that the specific inhibition of the PKC pathway significantly reduces COUP-TFI binding to distinct response elements, raising the possibility that PKC can positively regulate the DNA binding activity of COUP-TFI in vivo..

The GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 423 fusion protein was incubated in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of purified PKC. In all reactions, -32P ATP was used as a donor of phosphate and PKC-mediated phosphorylation was monitored by the incorporation of 32P. As expected, no 32P incorporation was detected when GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 423 was treated in the absence of purified kinase. In contrast, incubation of GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 423 with increasing amounts of PKC allowed a dose-dependent incorporation of 32P, leading to the gradual appearance of a band of the expected molecular weight (indicated by an arrowhead). Because the GST moiety was not phosphorylated by purified PKC (data not shown, see Fig. 7B), these data show that PKC directly and specifically phosphorylates COUP-TFI at one or more target sites located between residues 57 and 423 in vitro..

In the first set of experiments, increasing amounts of unphosphorylated or in vitro phosphorylated GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 423 fusion protein were incubated with labeled double-stranded DR1 oligonucleotides (Fig. 6B). Independent of the amount of GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 423 fusion protein used, the intensity of the specific shifted band was consistently higher for the phosphorylated protein than for its unphosphorylated counterpart (Fig. 6B, upper panel). The intensity of the shifted band was quantified by phosphoimaging and normalized with that of the corresponding free probe. Results were expressed in % of bound/free probe, with the binding of 20 ng of phosphorylated GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 423 fusion protein to the DR1 oligonucleotide being normalized to 100%. This analysis confirmed that the DNA binding ability of the phosphorylated fusion protein was more than 2-fold greater than that of the unphosphorylated protein (Fig. 6B, lower panel)..
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	53	Because these data suggested that phosphorylation of COUP-TFI modulated the affinity of the receptor for DNA, we designed gel shift experiments to calculate the dissociation constant (Kd) of PKC-phosphorylated vs. unphosphorylated COUP-TFI 57 to 423 association with DNA. Ten nanograms of recombinant protein were incubated with increasing amounts of DR-1 probe (Fig. 6C). After electrophoresis, the bound probe and the free probe were quantified with a phosphoimager using Fujifilm FLA-300 and Image Gauge 3.45 software. The ratio of bound/free probes was plotted against the bound probe concentration, allowing the calculation of the Kd for COUP-TFI/DNA interactions. Linear transformation clearly revealed the existence of two different protein species that differed in their ability to bind DNA in the PKC-modified sample, thus generating a kink in the curve. In the specific experiment shown in Fig. 6C, unphosphorylated COUP-TFI had a Kd value of 1.8 nM, and PKC-modified COUP-TFI had Kd values of 0.87 and 2.0 nM, suggesting that when the phosphorylated form of COUP-TF interacts with DNA, it binds with the lowest Kd value. Such experiments were replicated several times with different preparations of GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 423 protein. The average Kd calculated from these experiments was 2.23  plus or minus  0.33 nM (n = 6) for unphosphorylated COUP-TI and 0.724  plus or minus  0.1 nM (n = 5) for PKC-phosphorylated COUP-TI. These data clearly demonstrate that COUP-TFI can be directly targeted by PKC in vitro, and that PKC-mediated phosphorylation enhances the affinity of the nuclear receptor for DNA by approximately 3-fold..

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	55	Enhancement of COUP-TFI DNA Binding Activity by PKC Is a Direct Mechanism that Is Likely to Be Mediated by Phosphorylation within the DBD Having demonstrated that COUP-TFI 57 to 423 is a substrate for PKC in vitro and that phosphorylation enhances the binding of the nuclear receptor to DNA, it was of interest to determine whether the PKC-mediated phosphorylation events affected DNA binding function directly or indirectly (i.e. via the dimerization function). The potential effects of PKC-mediated phosphorylation on the ability of the GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 423 fusion protein to retain 35S methionine-labeled in vitro translated COUP-TFI were determined by GST pull-down assays (Fig. 7A). Bacterially expressed GST and GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 423 fusion proteins were treated in vitro in the absence or in the presence of purified PKC before incubation with 35S methionine-labeled COUP-TFI-programmed lysate. As depicted in Fig. 7A, the unphosphorylated GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 423 fusion protein retained a significant amount of 35S methionine-labeled COUP-TFI when compared with the input lane, showing that phosphorylation is not required for dimerization of the nuclear receptor. In vitro phosphorylation of the GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 423 fusion protein by purified PKC did not affect the amount of labeled COUP-TFI retained by the fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Fig. 7A). The PKC-induced enhancement of DNA binding is therefore unlikely to result from an increase in the ability of COUP-TFI to homodimerize. To further delineate the mechanism of this PKC-mediated regulation, we aimed to map the functional domain(s) of COUP-TFI that were targeted by PKC in vitro. COUP-TFI functional domain mapping was assessed by using various truncated bacterially expressed GST::COUP-TFI fusion proteins (Fig. 7B). Glutathione-agarose beads containing either GST, GST::COUP-TFI 1 to 57, GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 153 or GST::COUP-TFI 153 to 423 fusion proteins were incubated with purified PKC in the presence of -32P ATP (Fig. 7B). The GST moiety and the GST::COUP-TFI 153 to 423 fusion protein were not phosphorylated by the purified PKC. In contrast, incorporation of 32P was observed when the GST::COUP-TFI 1 to 57 and the GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 153 fusion proteins were incubated with the purified PKC, but not when the kinase was omitted in the reaction mixture (data not shown). The positions of the specific bands corresponding to the phosphorylated GST::COUP-TFI 1 to 57 and GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 153 were assessed by Coomassie Brilliant blue staining (data not shown) and are indicated by an open and gray arrowhead, respectively (Fig. 7B). We can therefore conclude that multiple functional domains of COUP-TFI are selectively phosphorylated by PKC in vitro. Consistent with the result that PKC positively regulates the DNA binding activity of COUP-TFI without affecting its dimerization function, we provide evidence that the DBD of COUP-TFI, but not its LBD, is directly targeted by PKC. Mass spectrometry confirmed the effect of PKC on the phosphorylation status of the DBD and allowed to specifically identify the modified amino acid residues (Fig. 7C). Phosphorylation of S94 or S113 could not be detected in these experiments, but mass spectrometry data showed definitively that T121 was phosphorylated by PKC. Mass spectrometry data indicated a posttranslational modified peptide at position mass 927.44 (116-NLTYTCR-124). The spectra showed an additional peak +80 Da at 1007.5 indicating a phosphorylation modification at the T121 position. The presence of both peaks at m/z = 927.44 and 1007.4 indicates that both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated COUP-TFI are present after PKC action, which is consistent with what we observed in gel-shift experiments. These data demonstrate that T121 is a target for PKC in vitro..

To investigate this hypothesis further, we performed in vitro phosphorylation assays to determine which functional domain(s) of COUP-TFI could be targeted by the purified MAPK (ERK2/p42MAPK) in vitro. As shown in Fig. 8, the GST::COUP-TFI 1 to 57 (open arrowhead) and GST::COUP-TFI 57 to 153 (gray arrowhead) fusion proteins were labeled, whereas the GST::COUP-TFI 153 to 423 protein did not incorporate 32P in the presence of purified MAPK. These data clearly show that purified ERK2/p42MAPK directly targets COUP-TFI in vitro, through at least two distinct phosphorylation sites located between residues 1 to 57 and 57 to 153, respectively. In light of our previous results, it was particularly tempting to speculate that the third putative MAPK phosphorylation site (T63) identified within the C-terminal region of the A/B domain of COUP-TFI could be involved in the regulation of COUP-TFI activity by the MAPK (p42MAPK/p44MAPK) signaling pathway in vivo..

Transfection experiments performed in COS-7 cells revealed that neither the deletion of the A/B domain of COUP-TFI (i.e. deletion of residues 1 to 84, encompassing the three conserved putative MAPK target sites), nor treatment of cells expressing the full-length COUP-TFI with the selective MAPK inhibitor modified the subcellular distribution of the nuclear receptor (data not shown). Distinct sets of experiments demonstrated that in vivo inhibition of the MAPK pathway (see Fig. 5B) and in vitro phosphorylation by purified MAPK (data not shown) did not affect the DNA binding activity of COUP-TFI, which is specifically targeted by PKC. Our next objective was to determine whether MAPK-mediated phosphorylation could directly regulate the transactivation function of COUP-TFI. Based on the results obtained using COS-7 cells (Fig. 3B) and P19 cells (data not shown) showing that COUP-TFI-dependent transcription was inhibited by deletion of the A/B domain (i.e. deletion of residues 1 to 84) while remaining unaffected by deletion of the N-terminal region spanning amino acids 1 to 57, we postulated that the third consensus phosphorylation site (T63) identified within the sequence of COUP-TFI could be targeted by the MAPK pathway in vivo. This putative MAPK phosphorylation site was therefore inactivated through replacement of the conserved threonine residue to a nonphosphorylatable alanine residue. The ability of the mutated COUP-TFI receptor to activate the Vn gene promoter was assessed by cotransfection experiments performed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 9A) and P19 cells (Fig. 9B). Cotransfection of increasing amounts of wtCOUP-TFI expression vector led to a dose-dependent increase in the Vn-Luc reporter gene activity in COS-7 cells (Fig. 9A) and P19 cells (Fig. 9B). Moreover, in both cellular contexts, treatment with PD980059 significantly inhibited COUP-TFI-dependent transcription (Fig. 9, A and B). As shown in Fig. 9A, mutation of the third putative MAPK phosphorylation site has no effect on the transcriptional activation of the Vn-Luc reporter gene mediated by COUP-TFI in COS-7 cells (Fig. 9A). Furthermore, mutating the third putative MAPK phosphorylation site did not prevent the inhibitory effect of the MAPK inhibitor (Fig. 9A). This was in sharp contrast to the results obtained in P19 cells. Indeed, in this cellular context, mutation of the third MAPK phosphorylation site resulted in a significant decrease in the transactivation of the Vn gene promoter by COUP-TFI (Fig. 9B). Furthermore, consistent with the involvement of the third MAPK phosphorylation site in the positive regulation of COUP-TFI transactivation function by the MAPK pathway in P19 cells, mutation of the conserved T63 residue completely abolished the effect of the selective p42MAPK/p44MAPK pathway inhibitor on the COUP-TFI-dependent transcription (Fig. 9B). All together, these data demonstrate that the MAPK pathway positively regulates COUP-TFI transactivation function in the context of the Vn gene promoter in a cell-specific manner. While this regulation is likely to be mediated through direct phosphorylation of the third evolutionarily conserved MAPK target site of COUP-TFI by the p42MAPK/p44MAPK signaling pathway in P19 cells, this phosphorylation site does not seem to be involved in the modulation of COUP-TFI transcriptional activity in COS-7 cells..

Most, if not all, nuclear receptors studied to date are phosphoproteins whose functions are regulated by phosphorylation. Indeed, apart from their participation in conventional hormone-dependent activation process, phosphorylation-mediated ligand-independent regulation of nuclear receptors activity has been well documented (33, 34). Despite these findings, such a mechanism may not be ubiquitous; indeed, the GR appears to be refractory to activation in the absence of its cognate ligand. This mode of action seems to be relevant for most other steroid/thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors as well as for various orphan receptors (33, 38, 39, 40, 41). The identification of several putative phosphorylation sites for CKII, PKC, and MAPK, led us to study the potential involvement of these signaling pathways in the regulation of COUP-TFI function. Our data first show that COUP-TFI is a phosphoprotein in vivo. Despite the observation that human COUP-TFI sequence contains eight putative target sites for CKII, our data strongly suggest that this kinase is unlikely to regulate the nuclear receptor activity, in the cellular and promoter contexts considered. In contrast, we provide evidence for the involvement of both PKC and MAPK (p42MAPK/p44MAPK) transduction pathways in the modulation of COUP-TFI functions in vivo..

In this study, we provide data that clearly show that PKC directly targets COUP-TFI in vitro and enhances its binding to various response elements. Precedents for both positive and negative regulations of DNA binding by phosphorylation exist for numerous nuclear receptors, including ER, GR, RAR, TR2, TRss1, Nur77/NGFI-B, and HNF-4. These regulatory mechanisms are not yet fully understood and highly complex, as they involve a wide range of protein kinases with target sites located within, nearby, or far from the DBD. While phosphorylation-mediated by PKA enhances GR binding to DNA (51), this kinase has been shown to inhibit binding of HNF-4 in vitro and in vivo (40). Consistent with the involvement of the A-box in the high affinity DNA binding of HNF-4 (52), phosphorylation at a consensus PKA-dependent site located within this region results in a modification of the receptor binding to DNA (40). Similarly, phosphorylation of NGFI-B within its A-box also decreases DNA binding (38, 39). In both cases, the reduction of DNA binding of the receptor is likely to reflect a local effect: phosphorylations occurring nearby to the DBD could either induce a local conformational change impairing DNA recognition, inhibit protein/DNA contacts by steric hindrance, or electrostatically hinder interactions between the phosphate groups of the protein and the similarly charged phosphate backbone of the DNA. In contrast, phosphorylation of TR2, a variant of the thyroid hormone receptor, within a unique carboxy-terminal region mediated by CKII decreases its binding to DNA via a mechanism that is likely to involve a phosphorylation-induced change in the overall conformation of the protein (53). A similar mechanism, which is likely to underlie the positive regulation exerted by CKII on the binding of ER to its response element, involves phosphorylation events occurring at an amino acid residue located within the amino-terminal A/B domain of the receptor, resulting in intramolecular interactions affecting the DNA binding domain and its function (54, 55). In addition to these direct mechanisms, indirect phosphorylation-mediated regulations of DNA binding have also been reported; these are often due to a modulation of the dimerization interface of the nuclear receptors by phosphorylation events. For example, phosphorylation of TRss1 enhances TRss1/RXR heterodimerization, leading to an increase in DNA binding (56, 57). Such an indirect regulation of DNA binding is also relevant for RAR/RXR heterodimers where PKC-mediated phosphorylation event at a serine residue located in the T-box of RAR prevents heterodimerization (58, 59). Based on the finding that the T-box of RAR engages dimerization contacts with the DBD of RXR (60), phosphorylation occurring within this region may introduce strong conformational constraints on the dimerization interface, thus impairing heterodimerization and subsequent DNA binding (58, 59). While PKC has been shown to down-regulate DNA binding for members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, both through direct and indirect mechanisms, there is, to our knowledge, no evidence for PKC-mediated positive effects on the DNA binding of any member of this superfamily. In this report, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of COUP-TFI by PKC increases the affinity of the orphan receptor for specific DNA elements. Moreover, we show that the enhancement of DNA binding does not result from a modification of the ability of COUP-TFI to homodimerize, but rather appears to be a direct mechanism. Consistent with this idea, the DBD of COUP-TFI is targeted by PKC in vitro, whereas the LBD, which contains the major homodimerization surface (61), is not. Mass spectrometry analysis allowed us to ascertain that T121 is a target for PKC, whereas no other modifications were detected. Although the region spanning amino acids 1 to 57 also contains at least one target site for PKC, our data demonstrate that the amino-terminal A/B domain of the nuclear receptor is dispensable for DNA binding and its phosphorylation-dependent regulation. We propose that COUP-TFI binding to DNA is positively and directly regulated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation targeting T121 within the DNA binding domain of the receptor..

While having no effect on nuclear translocation or DNA binding function, inhibition of the p42MAPK/p44MAPK pathway in vivo strongly inhibits the COUP-TFI-mediated transcriptional activation of the Vn gene promoter. Moreover, we showed that ERK2/p42MAPK directly targets COUP-TFI at distinct phosphorylation sites in vitro. While the LBD is not phosphorylated by MAPK, at least one target site is present in the amino-terminal region of the A/B domain (i.e. amino acids 1 to 57) of COUP-TFI. The functional relevance of this phosphorylation event in vivo remains unclear because the deletion of the amino-terminal region to residue 57 does not affect the subcellular distribution, DNA binding activity and transactivation function of the receptor, or the MAPK-mediated regulation of the COUP-TFI-dependent transcription. Other phosphorylation sites, located between residues 57 and 153, are directly targeted by ERK2/p42MAPK in vitro, and the ERK2-mediated phosphorylation event that might specifically target T63 in vivo is shown here to play an active role in cell-specific transcriptional activation by COUP-TFI. Such a modulation by MAPK-mediated phosphorylation could result from modifications in coactivator recruitment as previously reported for various nuclear receptors. Indeed, ERss can be activated by the Ras-dependent MAPK pathway in the absence of its cognate ligand via direct phosphorylation within the A/B domain (62, 63). Recent studies have shown that phosphorylation of MAPK target sites located in the AF-1 region stimulates ligand- and AF-2-independent interaction between ERss and SRC-1, thus allowing for ligand-independent activation of ERss (63). In addition to ERss, several authors have reported observations of functional cross-talk between growth factors and ER signaling pathways, both in the absence and presence of ligand (64, 65, 66, 67, 68). Consistent with the requirement of the AF-1 region for the activation of the apo-form ER in response to growth factors, one serine residue S118 located in the A/B domain of ER is directly targeted by the MAPK in response to EGF, and these phosphorylation events increase the AF-1 activity (66, 67, 68). The mechanism underlying this enhancement has recently been elucidated and involves the MAPK-dependent recruitment of the coactivator p68 by the AF-1 region of ER (69). In addition to these local effects, the MAPK pathway can, by intramolecular communication between different nuclear receptor domains, positively or negatively regulate coactivator binding by domains that are distinct from the ones targeted by specific phosphorylation events (70, 71). For example, phosphorylation of a serine residue located within the hinge region of SF-1 is required for maximal interaction of its LBD with the coactivator GRIP-1, results in the ligand-independent activation of SF-1 (71). Similarly, MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of a single amino acid residue in the A/B domain of PPAR alters the overall conformation of the apo-form receptor in a way that impairs ligand binding, thereby indirectly preventing the recruitment of coactivators such as SRC-1 (70). Thus, interdomain communication allows phosphorylation events targeting the amino-terminal A/B domain of PPAR to regulate independent properties of the LBD. This regulatory mechanism is involved in the MAPK-mediated inhibition of PPAR ligand-dependent transactivation function in response to various growth factors and cytokines, and has important repercussions on PPAR activity in vivo (70, 72, 73). Taken together, these results show that MAPK-mediated phosphorylation events play crucial roles in the modulation of nuclear receptor/coactivator interactions, a regulatory mechanism that, according to recent data, may also be relevant to nuclear receptor/corepressor interactions (74, 75). Further experiments will tell if ERK2 can modify COUP-TFI/coactivator interactions..

After IPTG induction, cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was discarded; the pellet was resuspended in NETN buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 100 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 0.5% Nonidet P-40; 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF); 10  microg/ml aprotinin; 10  microg/ml leupeptin; 10  microg/ml pepstatin], and sonicated twice for 30 sec. The suspension was then centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm and the soluble fraction, containing the GST fusion proteins, was incubated overnight at 4 C with 100  microl of glutathione-agarose beads prepared and stored in NETN buffer. The beads were washed twice with NETN buffer and a fraction of each sample was loaded onto an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Coomassie Brilliant blue staining. The bead-bound GST fusion proteins were collected by centrifugation and directly used for the in vitro phosphorylation and pull-down assays. For EMSA, the fusion proteins were eluted from the beads by competition with reduced glutathione. Briefly, the GST fusion proteins bound to beads were incubated in 10  microl of elution buffer (Tris-HCl 100 mM, pH 8; NaCl 120 mM; 50 mM reduced glutathione) at 4 C for 30 min. After centrifugation, a fraction of the eluted proteins was loaded onto an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Coomassie Brilliant blue staining, while remaining eluted proteins were phosphorylated in vitro and submitted to EMSA..

We demonstrated, using CD34+ TF1ss cells, which express an interleukin (IL)-15R/ss/c receptor, that within the hybrid receptor, the GM-CSFRss chain inhibits the IL-15 to triggered c/JAK3-specific signaling controlling TF1ss cell proliferation. However, the c chain is part of a functional GM-CSFR, activating GM-CSF to dependent STAT5 nuclear translocation and the proliferation of TF1ss cells. The hybrid receptor is functional in normal hematopoietic progenitors in which both subunits control STAT5 activation. Finally, the parental TF1 cell line, which lacks the IL-15Rss chain, nevertheless expresses both a functional hybrid receptor that controls JAK3 phosphorylation and a novel IL-15/c/TRAF2 complex that triggers nuclear factor B activation. The lineage-dependent distribution and function of these receptors suggest that they are involved in hematopoiesis because they modify transduction pathways that play a major role in the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors..

0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	7	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   The development of hematopoietic cells is controlled by hematopoietic growth factors, cytokines and chemokines produced in the bone marrow (BM)* by accessory cells and T lymphocytes (1, 2), and by several other mechanisms (3). Hematopoietic factors constitute a complex network, in which each cytokine may act at various stages: for example, myeloid growth factors such as G-CSF and GM-CSF may also affect the lymphoid compartment (4, 5). GM-CSF inhibits the expansion of the NK cell progenitor population from unprimed BM CD34+ cells, and the generation and functioning of NK cells both in vivo and in vitro (5, 6). IL-15, the most powerful factor inducing the differentiation of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells into CD56+/CD3- NK cells in vivo (7), may also cause a large increase in the number of long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) when added to the IL-3/SCF/Flt3-L combination (8). Transgenic mice carrying a mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of the common gamma chain (c), or lacking the signaling kinase JAK3, both of which are necessary for IL-15 to mediated signaling, have very low lymphocyte counts and display dysregulated myelopoiesis (9, 10). Moreover, the erythroid burst-forming cells of these mice have a larger than normal fraction of hematopoietic precursors with the CD34+/c- phenotype (11). These data suggest that there is cross talk between myeloid growth factors and IL-15, which may regulate the balance between the myeloid and lymphoid lineages during hematopoietic differentiation. This regulation may operate at the level of signal transduction because IL-15 and GM-CSF share signaling pathways (JAK2/STAT5 and NF-B) heavily involved in the control of hematopoiesis (12 to 16). Alternatively, the cross talk between these two cytokines may involve direct interactions between their receptor subunits, as suggested by the fact that GM-CSF almost totally inhibits IL-2 binding to IL-2/IL-15Rss/c in the M07sb CD34+ hematopoietic cell line (17). We investigated whether this cross talk resulted from a physical interaction between the two receptors, possibly involving the c chain and the GM-CSFRss chain. Indeed, these two subunits identify two families of cytokines, one with the c chain (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-13, IL-15, and IL-21; references 7 and 18) and the other, with the GM-CSFRss chain (IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF; reference 19)..

TF1 and TF1ss cells have the potential to display proerythroid differentiation whereas M07Sb cells display promegakaryocytic differentiation. NK-L is a functional human cytolytic NK cell line that is dependent on rIL-2. Raji is a B cell line (IL-15R/c) that does not depend on growth factors for its proliferation. The growth characteristics and phenotypes of these cells have been reported elsewhere (21 to 25). Cells were maintained in RPMI medium (Eurobio) supplemented with 10% FCS (ATGC Biotechnologie), 2 mM glutamine, 1% antibiotics (GIBCO BRL), 10 ng/ml rIL-15, or rGM-CSF (R and D Systems) at 37 degrees C, under an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air.

For the double staining of c and GM-CSFRss chains, human MPB and CB CD34+ cells, the leukemic cell lines (TF1, TF1ss, and M07sb), and MS9 cells were washed and permeabilized by incubation with ORTHOpermeafix (Ortho Diagnostic Systems Inc.) for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were then stained with anti-c (TUGh4) mAb and with the biotinylated anti to GM-CSFRss secondary mAb, and were then incubated at room temperature with Alexa Fluor594-GAR and streptavidin-Alexa Fluor594 (Molecular Probes). The extent of association between the two chains was assessed using the colocalization option of Methamorphe Software (Universal Imagine). We also used confocal microscopy to evaluate production of the activated transcription factor, pSTAT5, in TF1ss and M07sb cells. Cells were starved of growth factors overnight and were then stimulated with rGM-CSF, as described above. Some samples were pretreated with anti to IL-15ss/c or anti to GM-CSFRss mAbs. Cells were then permeabilized and indirect immunofluorescence assessed by means of antibodies recognizing the phosphorylated form of the transcription factor STAT5 (pSTAT5). Samples were washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor488-GARa antibody. Nuclei were stained with 2  microg/ml propidium iodide (PI, red staining). All antibodies were dissolved in PBS supplemented with 10 mg/ml BSA to block nonspecific binding. The stained cells were washed with PBS, centrifuged in a Cytospin 3 (Shandon) onto glass slides, and mounted under a coverslip in Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes) mounting medium. The slides were analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy, using a Leica TCS Confocal System..

In TF1 and TF1ss cells (Fig. 1 C, panels b1 and b2), we observed similar yellow staining of the membrane/submembrane compartment and spotted yellow staining in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the hybrid receptor was taken up by some of the cells. This punctate distribution of the c/GM-CSFRss complex in the cytoplasms was the predominant staining pattern in M07sb cells (Fig. 1 C, panel b3). No colocalization was observed in human MS9 myofibroblasts (Fig. 1 C, panel c). The specificity of c and GM-CSFRss chain colocalization was further confirmed by the lack of colocalization of the c chain and the IL-6R subunit gp130 (Fig. 1 C, panel d) or the ss1 integrin (Fig. 1 C, panel e) in normal CB CD34+ cells. Computerized quantification of the extent to which the c chain and the GM-CSFRss chain were colocalized in normal and leukemic CD34+ cells showed that 74.9% (MPB CD34+), 66.3% (TF1ss), 50.2% (TF1), and 58.3% (M07sb) of the GM-CSFRss chain colocalized with the c chain, whereas 94.1% (MPB CD34+), 99.6% (TF1ss), 82.1% (TF1), and 93.6% (M07sb) of the c chain colocalized with the GM-CSFRss chain.

We analyzed the effects of anti to IL-15Rss/c mAbs on the signal transduction activated by rGM-CSF (Fig. 4 A). Densitometric analysis revealed that rGM-CSF (at a concentration of 10 ng/ml) doubled the phosphorylation of JAK2 and quadrupled that of STAT5 in TF1ss cells in a 15-min period. In experiments with anti to IL-15Rss/c mAbs, the specific JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P31 or the irrelevant anti-gp130 mAb, we observed no significant inhibition of either pathway, which demonstrated that neither of the two chains of the IL-15R affected these steps of GM-CSF signaling. The effects of rGM-CSF and IL-15Rss/c mAbs on the localization of pSTAT5 were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4 B). Cells were stained for pSTAT5 (green staining) and with propidium iodide (specific for nuclei; red staining); superimposition of the two stains gave a yellow coloration. In basal culture conditions, all cells displayed green staining of the cytoplasm, indicating the presence of pSTAT5 protein in this compartment.

The absence of proliferation in IL-15R/c-positive TF1 cells in response to IL-15 has been attributed to the lack of the IL-15Rss subunit (23), which is indispensable for IL-15 binding and c chain signaling (7). However, it has recently been reported that the IL-15R chain may transduce a signal in the absence of links with any other receptor subunit (12), leading to NF-B activation via the cytoplasmic interaction of this molecule with the signaling molecule TRAF2. We therefore investigated the possible presence of a functional IL-15R/c receptor in TF1 cells. Analysis of total lysates showed that the TF1 and TF1ss cell lines expressed the c chain (64 kD) and at least two IL-15R isoforms, 58 and 38 kD in size (Fig. 5 A). The two cell lines were then incubated with an anti-c mAb for immunoprecipitation. The c membrane was reprobed with the anti-c mAb. A strong specific signal was identified at 64 kD. In contrast, two major bands, 58 and 38 kD in size, were identified if the membrane was reprobed with anti to IL-15R mAb. Thus, in both TF1 and TF1ss cells, the c chain is physically associated with the two IL-15R isoforms..

After immunoprecipitation with an anti-TRAF2 antibody, reprobing of the TRAF2 membranes with mAbs recognizing the IL-15R and c chains resulted in the detection of specific 58 and 64 kD bands, respectively, indicating that TRAF2 is physically associated with the IL-15R 58 kD standard isoform and the c chain..

Reprobing the membranes with an anti to ss-actin mAb identified a band of similar intensity at 42 kD in each sample, indicating that the gel had been evenly loaded in terms of amount of protein. We also showed by confocal microscopy that rIL-15, but not rIL-7, induced the translocation to the nucleus of the p65 NF-B subunit (unpublished data). These data indicate that, in TF1 cells, the IL-15R chain is functional and able to activate the NF-B factor. Moreover, not only does its association with the c chain not interfere with NF-B activation, it also probably renders the c chain functional even in the absence of the IL-15Rss chain, as shown by the induction of JAK3 phosphorylation by rIL-15..

This receptor was also found in CD34+ hematopoietic cell lines with proerythroid (TF1, TF1ss) or promegakaryocytic (M07sb) differentiation potentials and in CBPr CD34+/CD56- precursors, but not in the cytolytic NK-L cell line, normal NK cells or nonhematopoietic human cells, even though all these cells produce both chains. The hybrid receptor is functional and mediates signal transduction by both the IL-15 and GM-CSF pathways. Indeed, the results obtained with an anti-GM-CSFRss mAb suggested that, in TF1ss cells, the GM-CSFRss chain replaces the c chain, inhibiting its specific signaling (phosphorylation of JAK3), but that this chain cooperates with the IL-15Rss chain, facilitating the IL-15 to dependent activation of other JAK/STAT pathways (JAK1, JAK2, STAT5, and STAT6) and controlling the proliferation of these cells. In contrast, an anti-c mAb inhibited the GM-CSF to dependent proliferation of TF1ss cells treated with the recombinant cytokine or cocultured with human stromal hematopoietic cells secreting GM-CSF. This suggests that the hybrid receptor may have important effects in vivo, interfering in the interactions between CD34+ cells and stromal cells that play a major role in the control of both normal and pathological hematopoiesis (1, 2). In addition, anti to IL-15Rss/c mAbs, and the specific JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P31, inhibited the nuclear translocation of STAT5 induced by rGM-CSF but did not inhibit the phosphorylation of STAT5. These effects on STAT5 were also observed in M07Sb cells. Our observation that the c subunit of the hybrid receptor controls the GM-CSF to dependent nuclear translocation of pSTAT5 rather than STAT5 phosphorylation is consistent with recent results showing that the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT proteins are regulated independently (31, 32). Indeed, in human keratinocytes, which express a type II IL-4R, IL-4 induces the phosphorylation of STAT3, but not its nuclear translocation (31), whereas the prolactin receptor (PRLR) regulates STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation by means of two independent pathways (32). With PRLR, the number of phosphorylated tyrosines on the receptor itself seems to play a critical role in the activation of a cellular component that controls the number of STAT5 complexes in the cytoplasm, by controlling the entry of these complexes into the nucleus (32). Moreover, STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding via the IL-2Rss chain requires receptor phosphotyrosines (33), whereas similar events mediated by the G-CSFR are independent of receptor phosphotyrosines (34). Thus, the structural organization of some receptors and the subsequent activation of particular signaling pathways may affect the translocation of STAT protein to the nucleus..

The distribution of this receptor in cells of various lineages and functions suggests that it is involved in the development of hematopoiesis, probably affecting engagement in myeloid, rather than lymphoid, lineages. Indeed, the inhibition of c/JAK3 signaling by the GM-CSFRss chain should be interpreted in light of the inhibition of lymphocyte maturation and myelopoiesis dysregulation observed in mice and humans bearing c or JAK3 deletions or mutations (9 to 11)..

For instance, CD34+ cells may express GM-CSF transcripts (3) and a biologically active IL-15 that controls expression of the c chain, but is not competent for inducing the spontaneous differentiation of these cells into NK cells (20). Thus, IL-15 and GM-CSF may contribute, by means of the hybrid receptor, to the autocrine/paracrine cross talk that controls the development of hematopoietic cells (3), perhaps by inhibiting the spontaneous engagement of these cells in the lymphoid lineage.

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	2	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs) are orphan receptors that belong to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor (TR) superfamily and can repress the transcriptional activity of several target genes; however, the precise mechanism of this repression is unknown. Transfection of a Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to the putative ligand-binding domain of COUP-TFI (Gal4-COUP-TFI) significantly represses the basal transcriptional activity of a reporter gene containing Gal4-binding sites. Cotransfection of COUP-TFI can relieve the Gal4-COUP-TFI repression in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, COUP-TFI35, which lacks the repressor domain (the C-terminal 35 amino acids), fails to relieve this repression. This finding suggests that the repressor domain of COUP-TFI may squelch a limiting amount of corepressor in HeLa cells. In addition, increasing concentrations of TRss also can relieve the COUP-TFI repression in a hormone-sensitive manner. Similarly, overexpression of increasing concentration of COUP-TFI, but not COUP-TFI35, can squelch the silencing activity of the unliganded TRss. Collectively, these results indicate that COUP-TFI and TRss share a common corepressor(s) for their silencing activity. To determine which corepressor is involved in the COUP-TF-silencing activity, we used a yeast two-hybrid and in vitro GST pull-down assays to demonstrate that COUP-TFI can interact with the fragment of N-CoR (nuclear receptor-corepressor) encoding amino acids 921-2453 and the fragments of SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoic acid receptor and TR) encoding amino acids 29 to 564 and 565-1289, respectively. Interestingly, the fragment of SMRT encoding amino acids 1192 to 1495, which strongly interacts with TRss, interacts very weakly with COUP-TFI. Furthermore, overexpression of N-CoR or SMRT potentiates the silencing activity of COUP-TFI and can relieve the COUP-TFI-mediated squelching of Gal4-COUP-TFI activity. Therefore, our studies indicate that N-CoR and SMRT act as corepressors for the COUP-TFI silencing activity..

Transfection of a Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to the putative ligand-binding domain of COUP-TFI (Gal4-COUP-TFI) significantly represses the basal transcriptional activity of a reporter gene containing Gal4-binding sites. Cotransfection of COUP-TFI can relieve the Gal4-COUP-TFI repression in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, COUP-TFI35, which lacks the repressor domain (the C-terminal 35 amino acids), fails to relieve this repression. This finding suggests that the repressor domain of COUP-TFI may squelch a limiting amount of corepressor in HeLa cells. In addition, increasing concentrations of TRss also can relieve the COUP-TFI repression in a hormone-sensitive manner. Similarly, overexpression of increasing concentration of COUP-TFI, but not COUP-TFI35, can squelch the silencing activity of the unliganded TRss. Collectively, these results indicate that COUP-TFI and TRss share a common corepressor(s) for their silencing activity. To determine which corepressor is involved in the COUP-TF-silencing activity, we used a yeast two-hybrid and in vitro GST pull-down assays to demonstrate that COUP-TFI can interact with the fragment of N-CoR (nuclear receptor-corepressor) encoding amino acids 921-2453 and the fragments of SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoic acid receptor and TR) encoding amino acids 29 to 564 and 565-1289, respectively.

Thyroid hormone (TR) and retinoic acid receptors (RAR) bind to cognate DNA response elements and repress basal promoter activity in the absence of ligand (3, 4, 5). The region important for repression may represent a unique interaction surface for contacting a particular target within the basal transcriptional machinery. Highly charged regions are a common feature of other repression motifs. These charged regions consist of basic residues (6) or acidic residues (7, 8). In contrast to these well-defined small repression motifs, the homologous repression regions of TR and RAR are large and appear to include multiple regions within the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) and hinge regions. Many interacting proteins have been identified and proposed to be important for mediating the repressor function. The identified molecular targets of repressors can be categorized into three groups (9): basal transcription factors, activators, and coregulators, such as coactivators and corepressors..

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	6	Silencing activity of unliganded TR and RAR requires limiting factors termed corepressors (5). Recently, two corepressors that bind to unliganded TR and RAR have been cloned using a yeast two-hybrid screen: N-CoR (nuclear receptor-corepressor) (10, 11) and SMRT (silencing mediator for RAR and TR) (12, 13, 14, 15). Binding of these corepressors is necessary for unliganded receptors to silence the activity of target promoters. Prevailing evidence suggests that binding of hormone changes the conformation of the receptors, which results in the release of the corepressor and recruitment of coactivators, thereby abolishing their silencing activity. These two corepressors exhibit significant sequence homologies in their receptor-interacting domains, suggesting the existence of a corepressor gene family. COUP-TFs (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors) belong to the steroid receptor superfamily and are classified as orphan receptors because their ligand has yet to be defined. There are two COUP-TF genes in mammals, COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII. COUP-TFs have been implicated in neurogenesis, organogenesis, and cell fate determination (16, 17, 18, 19). COUP-TFs can form stable homodimers and bind to a variety of hormone response elements recognized by other members of the steroid receptor superfamily, such as RAR, retinoid X receptor (RXR), TR, vitamin D receptor (VDR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4. COUP-TFs can thereby inhibit transcriptional activities of these receptors on both consensus and natural response elements (17, 20). Four mechanisms have been proposed to address COUP-TF s ability to inhibit the transactivation function of other members of the steroid receptor superfamily. First, COUP-TFs repress the hormone-dependent transactivation of target genes by VDR, TR, and RAR through direct competition for occupancy of their response elements (21, 22, 23). Second, COUP-TFs heterodimerize with RXR to reduce the available concentration of RXR for heterodimerization with TR, VDR, RAR, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and thus indirectly interfere with these receptors to transactivate their target genes (21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27). Third, COUP-TFs can tether to DNA via LBD-LBD interactions with TR, RAR, and RXR to transrepress their activities (27). Finally, COUP-TFs have been shown to repress basal and activator-dependent transcriptional activities of various promoters when their binding site is placed upstream or downstream of these promoters (27). The silencing domain in COUP-TFs was localized to the C terminus of the putative LBD, which can be transferred to the heterologous Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD). Activators that can be repressed by COUP-TFs include acidic (Gal4-RII), glutamine-rich (Gal4-ftzQ), proline-rich (Gal4-CTF1P), and Ser/Thr-rich (Gal4-ZenST) transactivators (27). Because COUP-TF can repress such a diverse group of transactivators, it is unlikely that COUP-TF s repression is through direct quenching of these transactivators or by interfering with their respective targets. It is rather likely that COUP-TFs interact with a common target, a putative corepressor(s) that mediates their repression..

To repress transcription, it is generally believed that the COUP-TFI interacts with the basal transcriptional machinery either directly or indirectly through other cofactor molecules. To determine whether a cofactor(s) is required for this repressor activity, we carried out transfection experiments. Transfection of a Gal4 DBD fused to the COUP-TFI (amino acid 184 to 423) cDNA, designated as Gal4-COUP-TFI, significantly repressed basal promoter activity of the 17 mer x 4-thymidine kinase promoter-linked luciferase reporter DNA as shown previously (Fig. 1). This repression activity can be reversed by the exogenously expressed LBD of COUP-TFI (184 to 423), which does not bind to the reporter construct, in a dose-dependent manner. The observed release of repression cannot be attributed to the nonspecific effect of overexpression of COUP-TFI on Gal DNA-binding activity because overexpression of COUP-TFI had little effect on the basal promoter activity when cotransfected with the Gal4 DBD alone (27). In contrast, COUP-TFI mutant, COUP-TFI35 (amino acid 184 to 388), which does not contain a repressor domain, cannot reverse Gal4-COUP-TFI-mediated repression. Overexpression of COUP-TFI or COUP-TFI35 does not affect the basal promoter activity of Gal4 (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that a limiting factor, termed corepressor(s), is required for the activity of COUP-TFI-mediated repression.

Similarly, Horlein et al. (10) have cloned another TR-interacting protein, N-CoR, which has sequence similarity to SMRT. Both N-CoR and SMRT have been identified as corepressors for TR and RAR. We asked whether these two corepressors can function as corepressors for COUP-TFI. First, we examined whether COUP-TFI can interact specifically with these authentic corepressors. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we confirmed that these corepressors can interact with TRss in a hormone-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, a fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 921-2453 and fragments of SMRT encoding amino acids 565-1495 and 1192 to 1495 can interact with TRss in a hormone-dependent manner as previously described (10, 12, 14). It should be pointed out that, to our surprise, a larger fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190-2453, which contains a fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 921-2453, cannot interact with TRss in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Although the reason for this discrepancy is not clear at present, it is possible that the N-terminal repression domain of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190 to 920 is very potent and overrides the activation function of Gal4 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. This notion is further supported by our observation that a fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190-2453 can interact with TRss in vitro (data not shown)..

We first demonstrated that no interaction between Gal4 DBD-COUP-TFI (amino acids 184 to 423) fusion and Gal4 activation domain (AD) (empty vector) was shown as a negative control (lane 1 in Fig. 4C). In contrast, as a positive control, we showed a strong interaction between Gal4 DBD-COUP-TFI and Gal4 AD-TFIIB (lane 7 in Fig. 4C). We then examined the interaction of various deletion fragments of N-CoR or SMRT with COUP-TFI (Fig. 4C). In a yeast two-hybrid assay system, the interaction of COUP-TFI with N-CoR or SMRT was detected when COUP-TFI was bound to DNA response element. In the absence of DNA response element, no interaction was observed (data not shown). A fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 921-2453 strongly interacts with COUP-TFI; however, a fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190-2453 does not interact with COUP-TFI in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Similar to the TRss interaction study (Fig. 4B), the repression domains of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190 to 920 may interfere with the Gal4 activation domain function in a yeast two-hybrid assay; thus, a fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190-2453 is not able to activate ss-galactosidase activity of the reporter. However, both N-CoR fragments encoding amino acids 190-2453 and 921-2453 were found to interact with COUP-TFI in an in vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay because these in vitro interactions are presumably not influenced by the repressor function of N-CoR. Thus, a fragment of COUP-TFI encoding amino acids 56 to 423 can interact specifically with N-CoR in yeast and in vitro. On the other hand, fragments of SMRT encoding amino acids 29 to 564 and 565-1495 strongly interact with COUP-TFI (Fig. 4C). In contrast, a fragment of SMRT encoding amino acids 1192 to 1495, which interacts well with TR, interacts only weakly with COUP-TFI in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that the COUP-TFI-interacting domain of SMRT is located mainly at amino acids 29 to 564 and 565-1191. These interaction data in yeast are further supported by the in vitro protein-protein interactions as shown in Fig. 5B. Both fragments of SMRT encoding amino acids 29 to 564 and 565-1289 are able to interact with GST-COUP-TFI, whereas a fragment of SMRT encoding amino acids 1192 to 1495 fails to interact with GST-COUP-TFI..

Since COUP-TFI has been shown to interact with TFIIB in vitro (29, 30), it is proposed that COUP-TFI can interact with TFIIB in a nonproductive manner to interfere with the basal transcription. However, many coactivators and corepressors have been identified as positive and negative cofactors in the transcriptional control of target genes by members of the steroid/TR superfamily (15, 31). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that some of the cofactors may also be involved in gene-silencing mechanisms of orphan receptors, such as COUP-TFI. Initial evidence for mediators of nuclear receptor transactivation came from the finding that transiently transfecting increasing amounts of an ER-expressing plasmid into cultured cells results in a bell-shaped curve of transcriptional activation and was attributed to the squelching of a coactivator(s) by the excessive amounts of estrogen receptor (32). By analogy with that, we demonstrated that a putative corepressor(s) may be involved in COUP-TFI-mediated basal repression because overexpression of COUP-TFI, but not COUP-TFI35 (which has lost its repression domain), can squelch the repression activity of Gal4-COUP-TFI. Previously, we showed that a 15-amino-acid deletion from the C terminus (Gal4-COUP-TF15) had little effect on Gal4-COUP-TF activity, whereas a 25-amino-acid (Gal4-COUP-TF25) or a 35-amino-acid (Gal4-COUP-TF35) deletion largely impaired its active repression function (27). Therefore, these data suggested that the C-terminal border of the major active repression function of COUP-TF is located within amino acids 408 and 398, and it is this region that may interact with the corepressor(s). In addition, the repressor domain of COUP-TFI may directly target the basal transcriptional machinery..

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	51	To examine whether a corepressor(s) can be shared between TRss and COUP-TFI, squelching experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 2, unliganded but not liganded TRss can squelch the basal repression of Gal4-COUP-TFI. The evidence that the TR mutant, TR168 to 456 (V174A/D177A) (28), which does not interact with the putative corepressors, cannot squelch the basal repression of Gal4-COUP-TFI further supports the notion that common corepressors may be involved in basal repression between TRss and COUP-TFI. Furthermore, overexpression of COUP-TFI, but not COUP-TFI35, can squelch the basal repression activity of Gal4-TRss, also suggesting that common corepressors can function for both COUP-TFI and TRss. Theoretically, the target of transcriptional interference may be either a basal transcription factor(s) or a corepressor(s). Transfection of COUP-TFI or TRss did not change the basal transcription of a PRE-tk-luciferase reporter lacking a proper response element (data not shown), suggesting that squelchers are unlikely to interfere directly with the function of any basal transcriptional machinery. Therefore, the target(s) of interference between COUP-TF and TRss is likely to be one or more transcriptional corepressor protein(s)..
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	52	Because COUP-TFI can form homodimers by itself or form heterodimers with TRss (27), it is possible that the squelchers can form non-DNA-binding heterodimers with the repressors used in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 (Gal4-COUP-TFI/COUP-TFI for Fig. 1, Gal4-COUP-TFI/TRss for Fig. 2, and Gal4-TRss/COUP-TFI for Fig. 3). If this is the case, inhibition of repressor activity may be due to inhibition of DNA binding rather than to squelching of a limiting corepressor(s). However, several lines of evidence suggest that this is not the case. First, both COUP-TFI and TRss have the ability to bind specifically to corepressors. Second, a mutant form of TRss (TR168 to 456 (V174A/D177A)), which loses its ability to interact with corepressor but retains its intact dimerization domain, is not able to inhibit the repression activity of Gal4-COUP-TFI. Third, COUP-TF mutant (COUP-TFI35), which loses its ability in silencing, also loses its ability to squelch repressor activity of TRss. Finally and most importantly, we have demonstrated directly that both N-CoR and SMRT can mediate repressor activity of COUP-TFI (Fig. 6) and reverse the self-squelching activity (Fig. 7). Therefore, inhibition of repression activity by squelchers in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 indeed results from squelching of a limiting corepressor(s)..

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	54	Because squelching experiments showed that COUP-TFI may share a corepressor(s) with TRss, we examined protein-protein interaction between COUP-TFI and N-CoR or SMRT in a yeast two-hybrid assay and in in vitro GST pull-down assays as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The amino acid 921-2453 fragment of N-CoR interacts with COUP-TFI. This result is consistent with what has been observed in TR interaction studies (10, 33). Interaction between COUP-TFI and the amino acid 190-2453 fragment of N-CoR was not detected in a yeast two-hybrid assay, but was detected in an in vitro GST pull-down assay. This discrepancy is likely due to the potent repressor domain of the N-terminal portion of N-CoR, which suppresses the Gal4 activation function, resulting in interference with ss-galactosidase expression. Consistent with this interpretation, Seol et al. (33) also recently demonstrated that the repressor domain of N-CoR strongly interferes with the mammalian two-hybrid assay to study the protein-protein interaction between N-CoR and TR or RAR. On the other hand, the amino acid 29 to 564 and amino acid 565-1289, but not amino acid 1192 to 1495, fragments of SMRT strongly interact with COUP-TF in yeast and in vitro assays. Based on these data, we concluded that there are at least two COUP-TFI-interacting domains within the SMRT molecules. The lack of interaction between COUP-TFI and SMRT (1192 to 1495) is surprising because this region interacts very strongly with TRss. Thus, different repressors may interact differentially with SMRT. Finally, the corepressor-interacting region in COUP-TFI is localized in the extreme C terminus, which is quite different from the region of TR and RAR where hinge and N-terminal portions of LBD are involved in this interaction. Thus, repression function of COUP-TFs may act in a different way from that of TR and RAR (Fig. 8)..

Taken together, these data suggest that different nuclear receptors, utilizing different amino acid sequences, repress transcription by interacting with different region of N-CoR or SMRT as shown in Fig. 8..

This integrating role may be similar to what is observed with cAMP response element-binding protein CBP and the related protein p300. CBP plays a role in integrating cAMP second messenger and nuclear hormone receptor signal transduction pathways. Of interest, ORCA/p62 shares a small region of homology with CBP, suggesting a potential similarity in their mechanism of action. However, based on their data, ORCA/p62 does not bind directly to COUP-TFII-binding sites and COUP-TFII/ORCA complex is not detected in gel retardation assays. Therefore, it is possible that ORCA/p62 may function directly or indirectly by phosphorylating COUP-TFII or ORCA/p62 may overcome the function of a specific COUP-TFII-associated corepressor. Because ORCA/p62 can convert COUP-TFII into a transcriptional activator in a ligand-independent manner in mammalian cells, it is possible that COUP-TFI can also be activated by a coactivator(s) in a ligand-independent manner. Our preliminary data showed that overexpression of hSRC-1a (36), which is a general coactivator for members of steroid receptors, cannot relieve the repressor activity of Gal4-COUP-TFI in HeLa cells (data not shown)..

Therefore, orphan receptors such as COUP-TFI and RevErb A can function as a repressor in vivo by utilizing corepressors that are common for members of the TR and RAR subfamily..

His+ colonies exhibiting ss-galactosidase activity using the filter lift assay were further characterized. ss-Galactosidase activity was determined using chlorophenol red ss-D galactopyranoside as described (38). To recover the library plasmids, total DNA from yeast was isolated and used to transform Escherichia coli (HB101) which lacks leu2 gene. Transformants were identified on minimal medium lacking leucine and containing ampicillin. To ensure that the correct cDNAs were identified, library plasmids isolated were retransformed into y190 containing pAS1cyh2-TR168 to 456, and ss-galactosidase activity was determined. The specificity of the interaction of cor 10.1 (SMRT 1192 to 1495), one of the 12 positive clones, with TR was determined by mating y190 containing pGAD10-cor 10.1 with the strain y187 containing either pAS1-SNF, pAS1-cdk2, pAS1-p53, or pAS1-lamin.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II, COUP-TFII, is a member of the orphan nuclear receptor transcription factor family. Genetic ablation of COUP-TFII results in early embryonic lethality and demonstrates that this gene is required for cardiac and vascular development. Expression of COUP-TFII persists throughout postnatal life in various tissues including the female reproductive tract. However, the physiological function of COUP-TFII in female reproduction has not been extensively analyzed. Here, we provide phenotypic evidences that haploinsufficiency of COUP-TFII in mice demonstrates an important role of COUP-TFII for normal female reproduction. COUP-TFII +/ to  females show significantly reduced fecundity, irregular estrus cycles, delayed puberty, and retarded postnatal growth. Analysis of the reduced fertility revealed that although ovarian function was normal with respect to ovulation, the ovaries have reduced ability to synthesize progesterone in response to exogenous gonadotropins. This reduction is due to the reduction of the expression of steroidogenic enzymes important for progesterone synthesis and the reduction of vascularization in COUP-TFII heterozygotes. Analysis of uterine function demonstrated a reduced response to an experimentally induced decidual cell reaction indicating that the ability of the uterus to support embryo implantation was reduced. Taken together, our data show global impact of gene dosage effects of COUP-TFII on female postnatal life and indicates requirement of COUP-TFII in normal female reproduction, in particular for uterine endometrial functions during the periimplantation period..

Two highly conserved COUP-TF genes, COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII, have been identified in mammals (1). Biochemical studies showed that these proteins bind promiscuously to direct repeat motifs, with preference of DR1 sequences and can negatively or positively regulate a large number of genes (2). The expression patterns of COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII are distinctly different. COUP-TFI is expressed at high levels in the neural system, whereas COUP-TFII is expressed in the mesenchyme of developing organs (3). Consistent with their expression pattern, deletion of the COUP-TFI in mice results in perinatal lethality with mutants exhibiting neuronal deficits (4, 5, 6). COUP-TFII null mutant mice die before embryonic d 10.5 with angiogenic and cardiogenic defects (7). The embryo lethal phenotype of COUP-TFII impeded the analysis of the role of this transcription factor in the adult physiology; however, COUP-TFII +/ to  mice exhibit several phenotypes. The analysis of the haploinsufficiency phenotype of the COUP-TFII +/ to  may shed light on the role of this orphan nuclear receptor in the adult..

Upon analyzing the mating patterns of COUP-TFII +/ to  mice, we found that the COUP-TFII +/ to  females have reduced reproductive function. COUP-TFII +/ to  female mice exhibited reduced fecundity characterized by reduced litter size, and genotype-dependent reduction in growth in the progeny. Because normal female reproduction requires functional coordination throughout female hypothalamo-hypophyeal-ovarian endocrine axis, as well as an endocrinological link between ovary and uterus, subtle defects in multiple organs of this axis, could significantly alter the normal reproduction. Therefore, we investigated the ovarian and uterine physiology of the COUP-TFII +/ to  mice to determine the cause of this reduction in female fecundity..

Analysis of ovarian function was conducted by challenging COUP-TFII +/ to  and control mice with a superovulatory regimen of gonadotropins and assaying the ability of the ovary to ovulate and produce ovarian steroids. The COUP-TFII +/ to  mouse showed normal ovulation of oocytes but demonstrated a reduced capability for synthesizing sex steroid hormones. This reduction is due to the reduction of the expression of steroidogenic enzymes important for P4 synthesis and the reduction of vascularization in COUP-TFII heterozygotes. Analysis of uterine function in the COUP-TFII +/ to  mice was accomplished by assaying the response of the uterus to an endocrine induction of the decidual reaction. COUP-TFII +/ to  showed a reduced decidual cell reaction in response to the artificial stimulation, indicating a defect in endometrial function. Analysis of the expression of COUP-TFII +/ to  in the endometrium demonstrated steroid hormone-dependent changes in expression of COUP-TFII in the uterine endometrial stroma. This analysis demonstrates that COUP-TFII is important in the regulation of ovarian and uterine function and indicates that COUP-TFII is required for normal female reproductive functions..

Although the first litter did not show significant difference between COUP-TFII +/+ and COUP-TFII +/ to  females, the second and third litter from the COUP-TFII +/ to  females showed a significant decrease in litter size in contrast to the slight increase in COUP-TFII +/+ control. This result indicates that the heterozygous females exhibit abnormal fertility with increase in age..

COUP-TFII +/ to  females exhibited slightly delayed vaginal opening at 30.6 d after birth, as compared with 27.9 d after birth in wild-type females (Table 2).

Part of this phenotype may be due to expression of COUP-TFII in the uterus because previous analysis has shown COUP-TFII is expressed in the adult female endometrium (8). However, to determine where else COUP-TFII may be acting, the expression of COUP-TFII in the female reproductive axis was assessed. This was accomplished using a genetically engineered mouse in which the LacZ reporter had been knocked into the COUP-TFII gene (9). This mouse allows for the rapid and sensitive assay of the expression pattern of COUP-TFII. Histological sections from hypothalamus, pituitaries, ovaries, and uteri from COUP-TFII-LacZ mice were analyzed by X-gal staining. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 3. COUP-TFII expression, as seen by X-gal staining, was found in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) (Fig. 3A), whereas no specific staining was detected in the pituitary gland (Fig. 3B). In the adult ovary, strong staining was found in the theca cells, the layer surrounding the granulosa cells of ovarian follicles, but not detected in the granulosa cells. Weaker staining was detected in mesenchymal cells surrounding the corpus luteum (Fig. 3C). To ensure that the X-gal staining faithfully recapitulated the endogenous COUP-TFII expression, we used COUP-TFII-specific antibody in immunostaining to assess the expression of COUP-TFII in the ovaries. Again, strong staining was found in the theca cells, weak staining in the corpus luteum, and no detectable staining in the granulosa cells (Fig. 3D). The patterns of COUP-TFII expression using immunostaining are virtually identical with that shown using X-gal staining. Thus, X-gal staining could be used as an alternative assays to assess endogenous COUP-TFII expression patterns..

Therefore, the reduction in fertility in the COUP-TFII +/ to  may be due to deficiencies in any of these three organs. To determine whether the cause of the reduced fertilely may be due to a reduction in ovarian function, ovarian function was assayed by determining the ability of the ovaries to respond to a superovulatory regimen of hormones and determining the number of oocytes ovulated, as well as the production of progesterone after superovulation, as well as during pregnancy.

Theca cells are responsible for synthesizing precursor C19 steroids in the preovulatory follicle in response to LH, and granulosa cells aromatize the precursor steroids in vivo under the regulation of FSH (10). In the corpus luteum, however, large luteal cells that are believed to be derived from the granulosa cells are capable of synthesizing P4 from circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (10).

A defect in the ability of the endometrium to undergo decidualization may greatly affect reproductive performance. To assay the ability of the uterus to undergo decidualization, independent of hypothalamus and ovarian function, COUP-TFII +/ to  and COUP-TFII +/+ mice were challenged with artificial decidual stimulus. This stimulus consisted of administering a mechanical trauma, a burred needle scratch, to the uterus of ovariectomized mice treated with exogenous E2 and P4. In each animal, the left horn was given the mechanical trauma after hormonal treatment, whereas the right horn was not traumatized and could serve as a control. After the experiments, wet weight of each horn was determined and the ratio of scratched vs. control horn was calculated. As shown in Fig. 6, uterus from COUP-TFII +/ to  female mice exhibited significantly reduced decidual cell reaction when compared with COUP-TFII +/+ mouse uteri. This above analysis indicates that the reduced fertility in COUP-TFII +/ to  mice may be in part due to a reduced ability of the endometrial stroma to undergo the necessary differentiation to support embryo implantation..

COUP-TFII mice did not demonstrate impairment in ovulation but did show impairment in the ability of P4 production. The reduced capability to synthesize P4 in response to exogenous gonadotropin suggests potential defects in the ovarian function of COUP-TFII +/ to . Theca cells in the ovaries are responsible for synthesizing precursor C19 steroids in the preovulatory follicle in response to LH, and granulosa cells aromatize the precursor steroids in vivo under the regulation of FSH (11). In the corpus luteum, however, large luteal cells that are believed to be derived from the granulosa cells are capable of synthesizing P4 from circulating LDL (11). Thus, vascularization of corpus luteum upon ovulation is considered to be important to supply the luteal cells with the substrates to synthesize P4. The high expression of COUP-TFII in the theca cells, but not in granulosa cells, suggests COUP-TFII might be involved in a steroidogenic pathway, or it might have a significant role during vascularization of the corpus luteum. Here, we showed that vascularization as measured by PECAM immunostaining is perturbed in COUP-TFII +/ to  mice as compared with the controls. This might lead to inefficient delivery of LDL to the large luteal cells resulting in the reduced ability of the corpus luteum to synthesize P4. In addition, we also show that the expression levels of mRNA of CYP11a1, HSD3b1, and StAR are significantly reduced in the COUP-TFII+/ to  female mice. All of these genes are important for the biosynthesis of P4. Thus, the reduction in the expression of these genes will directly contribute to the observable reduced P4 levels in the COUP-TFII+/ to  female mice, and the decrease in circulating P4 in pregnant COUP-TFII +/ to  females might result in the reduced ability of the uterus to support pregnancy..

Consistent with the notion that P4 is required for decidualization in human endometrium, decidual cell reaction was absent in PRKO female mice (16). One of the potential key genes that are regulated by P4 is Indian hedgehog (IHH) (8), a well-known morphogen. Hedgehog signaling is known to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation during embryonic development (19). The fact that IHH is expressed at preimplantation endometrial epithelial cells and its expression is rapidly induced by P4 (8) further implicates its role in mediating PR function. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that COUP-TFII is regulated by hedgehog signaling (20). One of the intriguing possibilities is that P4 regulates IHH in the luminal epithelium, priming stroma cells for decidualization. COUP-TFII, a downstream target of IHH could mediate IHH signaling in the endometrium during periimplantation (8). Importantly, both IHH and COUP-TFII had been implicated in angiogenesis (7, 21). It is our speculation that during artificially induced decidualization or repeated remodeling of endometrium after first conception, normal vascularization is moderately, but functionally significantly affected by COUP-TFII.

We have solved the x-ray crystal structure of the HNF4 ligand binding domain, which adopts a canonical fold. Two conformational states are present within each homodimer: an open form with  helix 12 (12) extended and collinear with 10 and a closed form with 12 folded against the body of the domain. Although the protein was crystallized without added ligands, the ligand binding pockets of both closed and open forms contain fatty acids. The carboxylic acid headgroup of the fatty acid ion pairs with the guanidinium group of Arg226 at one end of the ligand binding pocket, while the aliphatic chain fills a long, narrow channel that is lined with hydrophobic residues. These findings suggest that fatty acids are endogenous ligands for HNF4 and establish a framework for understanding how HNF4 activity is enhanced by ligand binding and diminished by MODY1 mutations.

0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	6	Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate such diverse physiological processes as reproduction, development, and metabolism. Ligand binding induces conformational changes that coordinately dissociates corepressors and recruits coactivators to enhance transcriptional activity (1, 2). Physiologically relevant ligands, which are known for less than half of the 48 nuclear receptors encoded by the human genome, include the steroid hormones, retinoids, thyroid hormone, vitamin D3, and fatty acids. HNF4 is considered to be an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily because its endogenous ligand is not known (3). Originally identified in liver, HNF4 is also present in kidney, gut, and pancreatic islets. It functions in transcriptional cascades, downstream of TGF--activated SMAD signaling and GATA and HNF3/forkhead family transcription factors and upstream of the HNF1/POU homeodomain transcription factor. In addition to HNF1, the many target genes for HNF4 in liver include coagulation factors and proteins involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and transport. Selective targets present in kidney and intestine include erythropoietin and intestinal fatty acid binding protein, respectively. Targeted disruption of Hnf4 in mice leads to defective gastrulation, underscoring an important role for HNF4 in the developing gut (4). In humans, the clinically apparent phenotype associated with Hnf4 mutations is a Mendelian form of diabetes mellitus associated with abnormalities in lipoprotein and lipid concentrations (5, 6)..

0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	8	Positional cloning methods revealed the relationship between HNF4 and an atypical form of diabetes referred to as maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY1) (5). Mutations in at least six distinct genes have been linked to MODY (7). Although MODY1 is rare ( < 20 families have been identified) (5, 8, 9), the associated phenotype is instructive. Like other forms of MODY, MODY1 is characterized by autosomal-dominant inheritance, early onset ( < 25 years of age), and abnormal pancreatic  cell function. Because reduced  cell function leads to insulin deficiency, it is reasonable to conclude that HNF4 activity is tightly coupled with insulin synthesis and secretion. Since nuclear receptors are an established and valuable class of drug targets, it follows that selective agonists for HNF4 might be useful as new therapeutic strategies for improving insulin secretion in MODY patients and potentially others with more prevalent forms of type 2 diabetes. To learn more about how HNF4 functions in health and disease, and as an important step in drug discovery, we have crystallized the ligand binding domain (LBD)1 of HNF4 and solved its three-dimensional structure. HNF4 forms an antiparallel, three-layered  helical sandwich akin to other nuclear receptor LBDs. The serendipitous presence of a tightly associated fatty acid in the binding pocket reveals potential mechanisms for ligand binding.

The His6 affinity tag was removed with bovine thrombin (10 units/ml), and the protein was further purified by ion exchange chromatography (Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography). Crystals were obtained at room temperature by the vapor diffusion method in 10  microl of sitting drops containing equal volumes of protein (25 mg/ml) and crystallization buffer (0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 8.0), 0.7 M ammonium acetate, 16% MPD (2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol), and 10 mM dithiothreitol)..

Oscillation images were collected every 1 degrees , and the data were integrated and scaled using the DENZO HKL software package (10). The structure was determined using MAD phasing of SeMet-substituted protein. The expected bijvoet and dispersive differences (11) based on six bound seleniums in a monomer (250 residues) were 5.90 and 3.64%, respectively. The program SOLVE (12) found 20 of 24 possible selenium sites. The phases were improved by 4-fold averaging and solvent flattening utilizing the programs MLPHARE and DM in the CCP4 suite (13). The model was built using O (14) and refined with CNS (15), applying restrained 4-fold non-crystallographic symmetry, overall B-factor corrections, and bulk solvent corrections (Table I)..

The excess electron density, present in all molecules of the asymmetric unit, resembled a small molecule associated with the guanidinium group of Arg226. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and time of flight mass spectrometric analyses of HNF4 revealed, in addition to the expected parent ion for the expressed protein, the presence of non-covalently associated saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (data not shown). To confirm the identities of the lipids and quantify relative amounts, purified HNF4 solutions were submitted for fatty acid analysis by GC. Recombinant rat HNF4-(133-382) contained a mixture of fatty acids, including 16:0, 17:0 cyclo, 18:17c, and 14:0 (Fig. 2). Similar sets of fatty acids bound a longer form of rat HNF4 containing the entire carboxyl-terminal F domain (residues 133-455, data not shown) and the LBD of human HNF4 (residues 140-382), which differs from the rat domain at seven positions (Fig. 2). These findings demonstrate that both human and rat proteins associate spontaneously with endogenous fatty acids and that the F domain does not influence binding..

The results are plotted as percentages of total and sorted according to relative abundance in bacteria. 12:0, 14:0, and 16:0 are saturated lauric, myristic, and palmitic acids, respectively; 16:17c is monounsaturated palmitoleic acid, cyclo refers to a cyclopropyl group, 2OH and 3OH have hydroxyl groups at the 2 or 3 positions, respectively, and iso has an extra methyl group on the penultimate carbon.

The bacterial fatty acids present in greatest abundance also bound HNF4, although there appears to be a degree of selectivity. For example, the fatty acids 16:0, 18:17c, 16:1 iso/14:0 3OH, and 19:0 cyclo 8c are present in greater relative abundance in the bacteria than associated with human or rat HNF4 (Fig. 2) (16:1 iso and 14:0 3OH are not distinguished by GC). In contrast, fatty acids 17:0 cyclo, 16:1 7c/15 iso 2OH, 15 iso 3OH, and 10:0 were bound to the protein in higher relative abundance than their presence in E. coli. Other fatty acids such as 18:17c and 14:0 were neither selected for nor against (Fig. 2). Therefore, although a wide range of fatty acids were found within its ligand binding pocket, HNF4 appears to exhibit selectivity toward a subset of those found in bacteria. Future experiments with mammalian tissues are required to determine which fatty acids bind under relevant conditions and whether the capacity of HNF4 to serve as a fatty acid sensor has physiological or pathological ramifications..

The lipid carboxyl group was readily identified next to the side chain of Arg226 and the methylene chain could be built to C12. Density beyond that point was weak, indicating that the remainder of the chain is either flexible or occupies multiple conformations. The cavity has an internal volume of 370 A3, calculated by the program Voidoo (18), which is almost entirely occupied by fatty acid. While this volume is within the normal range for nuclear receptor LBDs, the elongated, relatively linear shape of the pocket is atypical. Both oxygens of the fatty acid head group are ion-paired with the guanidinium group of Arg226, and one oxygen forms additional hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH of Gly237 and side chain OH of Ser181 (Fig. 3, A and B). Residues that line the internal surface of the ligand binding pocket are largely hydrophobic, including those arising from 3 (Ile175, Val178, Cys179, Met182), 5 (Leu219, Leu220, Ala223), 1 (Leu234, Leu236), 2 (Val242), loop 2/7 (Leu249), 7 (Met252, Val255, Ser256, Ile259), and 10 (Met342, Gln345, Ile346, Ile349) (Fig. 3B).

This is due in part to Phe313 in RXR, which points inward and directs bound 9-cis-retinoic acid upward toward 5 (19). The corresponding residue in HNF4 is Ala223, which, presumably because of the decreased bulk of the side chain, allows the fatty acid ligand to curl downwards toward 7. It is thus particularly interesting to note that F313A substitution in RXR leads to constitutive activation, due to the spontaneous binding of an endogenous fatty acid as we have seen for wild-type HNF4 (19). The fatty acid in the binding pocket of RXR F313A adopts a U shape, and density is interpretable out to the C18 position. In contrast, the side chains from residues Met182 and Met342 fill the upper portion of the HNF4 ligand binding pocket to prevent the fatty acid from looping around to form a U, and we don't see density past the C12 position.

In the first, referred to as the open state, 12 is fully extended and contiguous and collinear with 10 (Fig. 1). The second molecule of each homodimer adopts a closed conformation, with 12 situated against the body of the LBD. The conformation of the "open" state is fixed by crystal packing between two open forms at an axis of symmetry. In the closed state, residues Leu360, Leu361, Met364, and Leu365 form a hydrophobic face on 12 that interacts with a corresponding hydrophobic surface on the body of the domain created by residues from 3 (Met182, Lys183, Leu186, Leu187, Leu189, and Val190) and 4 (Leu211, Ala215, Gly216, and Leu219). Residues Gln362 and Glu363 help to anchor 12 through hydrogen bonds with Lys350 in 10 and Arg212 in 4, respectively. Since fatty acid ligands similarly occupy the ligand binding pockets of molecules in open and closed conformations, the structural rearrangement does not appear to be required for ligand-mediated activation as has been proposed for other nuclear receptors (17, 20, 21). It is possible that to lock the domain in its closed and active state, both ligand and coactivator must be bound, but since our structure lacks coactivator, it does not test this hypothesis..

The side chain of Val255 (in 7) points into the ligand binding cavity where it participates in ligand recognition. While questions have been raised about functional consequences of the V255M substitution (24), the structure suggests that a methionine side chain at this position would partially occlude the ligand binding cavity and potentially alter binding affinity or specificity. Contact between Val255 and backbone atoms of 10 in the vicinity of Met342 is also predicted to stabilize the protein fold. Therefore, the V255M substitution might also decrease protein stability and reduce its concentration in cells or ability to homodimerize. Side chains from the other two MODY1-associated residues, Glu276 (amino terminus of 8) and Arg324 (9/10 loop), form an ionic interaction, and Glu276 forms a second ionic interaction with Arg317 (also in the 9/10 loop). Neither of these residues is involved directly in ligand binding, but mutations in them may influence dimerization. While the residues themselves are not at the dimer interface, the 9/10 loops of two molecules interact with each other.

The presence of a fatty acid in its ligand binding pocket is especially noteworthy and should help resolve the controversy surrounding putative ligands for HNF4. From a structural point of view, the fatty acid appears to be an ideally suited ligand for HNF4. The carboxylic acid headgroup of the fatty acid ion pairs with the guanidinium group of Arg226 of the protein to fix the orientation, while the aliphatic portion of the fatty acid occupies a long narrow pocket that is lined with hydrophobic side chains. Considering this mode of binding, it is not obvious how more complex ligands might bind HNF4. It is thus reasonable to presume that fatty acids or related molecules might be the endogenous ligands for HNF4. The high apparent affinity of recombinant HNF4 for fatty acids suggests a similar situation for the native protein in mammalian cells, providing a mechanism for HNF4 to function as a biosensor for fatty acids within the cell. The structural features of fatty acid binding to HNF4 provide a useful starting point for identifying potential pharmacophores, but the search may prove all the more challenging due to the kinetics of ligand binding.     ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

While the initial phase relies solely on cellular transcription factors, the subsequent phase is activated by the viral Tat transactivator. We have previously reported that the subsequent phase of viral gene transcription can be repressed by the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF)-interacting protein 2 (CTIP2) in human microglial cells [O. Rohr, D. Lecestre, S. Chasserot-Golaz, C. Marban, D. Avram, D. Aunis, M. Leid and E. Schaeffer (2003), J. Virol., 77, 5415 to 5427]. Here, we demonstrate that CTIP proteins also repress the initial phase of HIV-1 gene transcription, mainly supported by the cellular transcription factors Sp1 and COUP-TF in microglial cells. We report that CTIP2 represses Sp1- and COUP-TF-mediated activation of HIV-1 gene transcription and viral replication as a result of physical interactions with COUP-TF and Sp1 in microglial nuclei. Using laser confocal microscopy CTIP2 was found to colocalize with Sp1, COUP-TF and the heterochromatin-associated protein Hp1, which is mainly detected in transcriptionally repressed heterochromatic region. Moreover, we describe that CTIP2 can be recruited to the HIV-1 promoter via its association with Sp1 bound to the GC-box sequences of the long terminal repeat (LTR). Since our findings demonstrate that CTIP2 interacts with the HIV-1 proximal promoter, it is likely that CTIP2 promotes HIV-1 gene silencing by forcing transcriptionally repressed heterochromatic environment to the viral LTR region..

Viral gene transcription is characterized by two temporally distinct phases. The initial phase occurs immediately after integration and relies solely on cellular transcription factors. Most of the transcripts cannot elongate efficiently and terminate rapidly after initiation. However, a few transcripts elongate throughout the genome, resulting in transcription and expression of the viral transactivator Tat. The subsequent phase of transcription occurs when enough Tat protein has accumulated. Tat binds to TAR, recruits pTEFb complex and dramatically stimulates HIV-1 gene transcription [reviewed in (8,9)]..

0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	10	We have previously studied some of the cellular transcription factors that impact HIV-1 gene transcription in microglial cells. Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor I (COUP-TFI)/Ear3, Arp1/COUP-TFII and Ear2/COUP-TFIII proteins are the three members of the COUP-TF orphan nuclear receptors superfamily. We have described that the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TFI/Ear3 (10,11) is expressed in numerous human CNS cell lineages, including microglial cells. COUP-TFI is an activator of HIV-1 gene transcription in oligodendrocytes (12), microglia (13) and T lymphocytes (14). Moreover, we have revealed the importance of functional interactions between the nuclear factor for interleukin 6 (NF-Il6), Sp1 and COUP-TFI in the regulation of the initial phase of HIV-1 gene transcription in brain cells (15). The transcription factor Sp1 is one of the crucial cellular proteins for efficient HIV-1 gene transcription (16 to 18). A number of studies have reported that Sp1 can serve as an anchor for indirect binding of other transcription factors to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) region. In all cell types, an interaction between Sp1 and Tat is required for optimal HIV-enhancer activation (19). Moreover, Sp1 is able to recruit the Cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb to the LTR, which helps to bypass a requirement for TAR/Tat and promotes processive transcription without Tat (20). In microglial cells, the main HIV-1 target cells in the brain (6), Sp1 anchors COUP-TF (13) and NF-IL6 (15) to the three GC-boxes adjacent to the viral CATA box. The CATA box is used instead of the TATAA box for optimal HIV-1 gene transcription and replication (21). We have shown that Sp1 and COUP-TF interact and cooperate in the transcriptional activation of HIV-1 gene transcription (13). Moreover, COUP-TF can substitute to Sp1 association with the viral Tat protein to restore Tat function and HIV-1 replication in microglial cells (22). These results highlight the key roles of Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins in HIV-1 expression in microglial cells..

Recent results support the selective contribution of these proteins in the development and function of the nervous and immune systems (24). We recently described that the nuclear cofactor CTIP2 inhibits the subsequent phase of HIV-1 gene transcription and viral replication by relocating the viral transactivator Tat protein to transcriptionally inactive regions of chromatin via Hp1 (25). In the present work, CTIP2 overexpression leads to the repression of HIV-1 replication. In contrast, CTIP1 was unable to affect Tat function. Using confocal microscopy to visualize Tat subcellular distribution in the presence of each CTIP proteins, we found that CTIP2, but not CTIP1, leads to the disruption of Tat nuclear localization and to its recruitment within CTIP2-induced nuclear ball-like structures. In addition, we showed that CTIP2 and Hp1 associate with Tat to form a three-protein complex. These findings suggest that the inhibition of HIV-1 expression by CTIP2 correlates with the recruitment of Tat within CTIP2-induced structures and its relocalization within inactive regions of chromatin..

0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	15	Here, we report that CTIP proteins repress HIV-1 gene transcription via the proximal LTR region which binds Sp1 and COUP-TF transactivators. Since COUP-TF and Sp1 cellular transcription factors are two of the major contributors to HIV-1 gene transcription in microglial cells, we have postulated that Sp1- and COUP-TF-mediated LTR-driven activation may be impaired by CTIP1 and CTIP2. We report here that both CTIP1 and CTIP2 repress Sp1- and COUP-TF-mediated stimulation of HIV-1 gene expression. Since the CTIP2 repressive activity is much stronger than the CTIP1-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 replication, we focused our study on CTIP2. CTIP2-mediated repression of Sp1 and COUP-TF functions results from direct physical interactions of these cellular transcription factors with CTIP2. Association with CTIP2 forces Sp1 and COUP-TF relocation to CTIP2-induced subnuclear structures containing the heterochromatin-associated protein Hp1. Moreover, CTIP2 can be recruited to the HIV-1 promoter by a physical association with Sp1 bound to the GC-box regions of the LTR. Since Sp1 or COUP-TF transcription factors are necessary for the Tat function in microglial cells (22), CTIP2-mediated repression of COUP-TF and Sp1 functions may largely contribute to the previously described CTIP2-mediated impairment of Tat activity and viral replication in microglial cells (25)..

To delineate the LTR region responsible for CTIP1- and CTIP2-mediated HIV-1 gene transcriptional repression, microglial cells were transfected with a 5' deleted pLTR-CAT reporter plasmid in the presence or absence of CTIP1 and CTIP2 expression vectors. Deletion of the 5' region downstream of the two proximal GC-box sequences did not affect CTIP1 and CTIP2 ability to repress LTR-driven CAT activity (Figure 1, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that CTIP proteins repressive function can be mediated by the proximal region of the LTR encompassing two GC-box sequences, the CATA sequence (21) and the TAR region. We have previously observed that the cellular transcription factors, Sp1 and Sp3, are directly bound to the LTR GC-box sequences in microglial cells (13). Moreover, the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF is indirectly anchored to this region via its association with Sp1 (13). We have largely described that Sp1 and COUP-TF transcription factors are two of the major contributors to the initial phase of HIV-1 gene transcription in microglial cells (9,13,22). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that CTIP repressive activity may result from impairment of endogenous Sp1 and COUP-TF protein functions..

Microglial cells were transfected with pLTR-CAT plasmid together with the vectors expressing COUP-TF (Figure 2A) or Sp1 (Figure 2B) proteins and with increasing amounts of HA-CTIP1 or Flag-CTIP2 expression vectors. The two proteins were able to repress COUP-TF- and Sp1-mediated stimulations of CAT activity. As a control, we performed western blot experiments, indicating that COUP-TF and Sp1 expressions were not downregulated but slightly upregulated by the cofactors. Since overexpression of COUP-TF and Sp1 stimulates HIV-1 gene expression, this modest upregulation could not be responsible for the CTIPs repressive function. To correlate CTIP1 and CTIP2 repressive activity on LTR-driven transcription to the level of HIV-1 replication, we studied their impacts on Sp1- and COUP-TF-mediated stimulations of viral replication. Cells were transfected with HIV-1 pNL4-3 and COUP-TF (Figure 2C) or Sp1 (Figure 2D) expression vectors in the presence of increasing amounts of CTIP1 or CTIP2 expression vectors. The level of viral replication was investigated by quantifying p24 Gag expression in the culture supernatants 2 days after transfection. While both CTIP1 and CTIP2 inhibited COUP-TF (Figure 2C) and Sp1 (Figure 2D) activation of HIV-1 NL4-3 replication, the strongest repression was observed with CTIP2 (Figure 2C and D, lanes 6 to 8), indicating that the repressing activity of CTIP2 on HIV-1 replication cannot be explained only by its previously described capacity to repress the viral Tat protein (25). These results strongly suggest that CTIP1 and CTIP2 repress the initial phase of HIV-1 gene transcription through direct or indirect interactions with endogenous Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins..

The full-length as well as deletion mutants starting at position 350, 610 and 717 did mediate interaction with GST-COUP-TF (Figure 3B, lane 6) and GST-Sp1 (Figure 3B, lane 3) but not with the control GST protein (Figure 3B, lanes 2 and 5). These results show that CTIP2 is able to interact with Sp1 and COUP-TF via its C-terminal zinc finger domain region. We have previously shown that CTIP2 harbors two independent interaction domains with the viral Tat protein (25). This prompted us to determine whether an additional interaction interface was located in the N-terminal or the central region of CTIP2. To this end, GST pull-down experiments were performed with additional deletion constructs. As expected, the deletion mutant 350 to 716 was not able to interact with COUP-TF and Sp1, confirming that the C-terminal region of CTIP2 containing residues 717 to 813 mediates binding to these transcription factors. However, the 1 to 354 and the 145 to 434 constructs appeared to be able to restore interactions, suggesting that the central region of CTIP2 located between the residues 145 and 354 might be sufficient for COUP-TF and Sp1 association..

As previously described (25), anti-Flag immunostaining of Flag-CTIP2 revealed the formation of CTIP2-induced nuclear ball-like structures in microglial cells nuclei (Figure 4A, images 3, 8 and 13). Flag-CTIP2 appeared as concentrated at the periphery but absent within the structures. Interestingly, observations of RFP-CTIP2 (Figure 4B, images 1 and 5) fusion protein revealed the presence of CTIP2 at the periphery but also within the previously described nuclear structures, suggesting that the Flag epitopes within these ball-like structures were probably not accessible to the anti-Flag antibodies. To control the nuclear location of RFP-CTIP2 expression, cells were transfected with RFP-CTIP2 and GFP-Lamin B expression vectors. As previously described (25), CTIP2-induced nuclear structures were located in the nucleus of microglial cells (C. Marban and O. Rohr, unpublished data). In the absence of CTIP2, endogenous COUP-TF and Sp1 proteins were expressed in the nucleoplasm with a speckled and diffused staining pattern (images 1 and 6). Moreover, in the presence of Flag-CTIP2, these transcription factors were at least partially located to CTIP2-induced nuclear structures (Figure 4A, images 2 and 7). Endogenous Sp1 (Figure 4A, images 9 and 10) and COUP-TF (Figure 4A, images 4 and 5) proteins colocalized with CTIP2 at the periphery of the immunostained structures. Up to 87 and 70% of endogenous COUP-TF and Sp1 proteins colocalized with CTIP2, respectively. No staining was observed inside the ball-like structures. We have reported that CTIP2 relocates the viral Tat transactivator to the heterochromatin-associated protein Hp1 (25). Endogenous Hp1 exhibited a diffused and speckled nuclear distribution in the absence of CTIP2 (Figure 4A, image 11). To visualize the presence of Hp1 in CTIP2-induced structures in the absence of Tat, we performed immunodetection of endogenous Hp1 in microglial cells expressing Flag-CTIP2. As shown in Figure 4A (images 14 and 15), endogenous Hp1 colocalized with CTIP2, suggesting that endogenous COUP-TF, Sp1 and Hp1 proteins are relocated to the same CTIP2-induced nuclear structures. To address whether COUP-TF and Sp1 also colocalized with CTIP2 inside the ball-like structures, we performed immunodetection of the endogenous COUP-TF protein with other different polyclonal antibodies (kindly provided by J. E. Mertz) in the presence of RFP-CTIP2 and GFP-Sp1 fusion proteins. As shown in Figure 4B (image 2), endogenous COUP-TF was observed inside the structures, confirming that the epitope accessibility to the antibodies is determinant to COUP-TF immunodetection. Since RFP-CTIP2 was expressed in ball-like structures (Figure 4B, images 1 and 5), GFP-Sp1 expressed alone was localized in the nucleoplasm with a diffused staining pattern (Figure 4B, image 6). Moreover, in the presence of RFP-CTIP2, GFP-Sp1 is relocated to CTIP2-induced structures (Figure 4B, image 3). COUP-TF and GFP-Sp1 relocation was not restricted to the periphery of the CTIP2-induced nuclear structures, since they were also detected inside the structures as shown by the presence of white staining resulting from colocalized red, blue and green staining (Figure 4B, image 4). Thus, endogenous Sp1 proteins were probably relocated within the heterochromatic structures too. However, they remained unaccessible to the currently used antibodies (Figure 4A, images 7 and 9). These results strongly suggest that the cellular transcription factors, Sp1 and COUP-TF, associate with CTIP2 in microglial cells..

To test whether Sp1, COUP-TF, CTIP2 and Hp1 are present in the same complex, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments on microglial nuclear extracts expressing or not the Flag-CTIP2 protein (Figure 5A). Anti-Flag western blot immunodetections performed on anti-COUP-TF (lanes 3 and 4), anti-Sp1 (lanes 6 and 7) and anti-Hp1 (lanes 9 and 10) immunoprecipitated nuclear extracts indicated that CTIP2 interacted with COUP-TF (lane 4), Sp1 (lane 7) and Hp1 (lane 10) in microglial cells. As a control, experiments performed on CTIP2 non-expressing extracts (lanes 3, 6 and 9) or on non-immune serum (NIS) immunoprecipitated nuclear extracts (lanes 2, 5 and 8) confirmed the specificity of the Flag immunodetection and the specificity of the COUP-TF, Sp1 and Hp1 immunoprecipitation experiments, respectively. Thus, CTIP2 may be able to recruit a protein complex, including the three proteins in the nucleus of microglial cells. To address how CTIP2 links COUP-TF and Sp1 to Hp1, we performed competition pull-down assays (Figure 5B). GST-COUP-TF and GST-Sp1 fusion proteins were incubated with both 35S-labeled CTIP2 145 to 434 and CTIP2 717 to 813 in the presence of increasing amounts of 35S-Hp1. Results clearly show that CTIP2 145 to 434 remained bound to GST-COUP-TF and GST-Sp1, while CTIP2 717 to 813 was displaced by Hp1. This displacement increased the amount of GST fusion proteins available for the CTIP2 145 to 434 binding. Hp1 competed for COUP-TF and Sp1 binding to the C-terminal domain of CTIP2. These findings indicate that the 145 to 434 region of CTIP2 has a stronger binding affinity for COUP-TF and Sp1 than the 717 to 813 domain, which preferentially binds Hp1. Thus, CTIP2 may link COUP-TF and Sp1 bound to the 145 to 434 domain and Hp1 bound to the 717 to 813 domain. To precisely examine the formation of a ternary complex between Sp1, COUP-TF and CTIP2, we performed GST pull-down experiments of mixed 35S-labeled-Sp1 and -COUP-TF proteins with GST-CTIP2. As shown in Figure 5C, Sp1 and COUP-TF interacted together with CTIP2. Moreover, addition of increasing amounts of 145 to 434 CTIP2 or COUP-TF proteins did not compete each other for Sp1 binding (Figure 5D). Thus, COUP-TF and CTIP2 do not compete for Sp1 binding in vitro. Taken together, those findings strongly suggest the formation of a ternary complex occurring between Sp1, COUP-TF and CTIP2..

0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	64	  CTIP2 is anchored to the HIV-1 LTR by direct interactions with Sp1 bound to the LTR proximal region CTIP proteins are DNA-binding proteins, which bind a consensus sequence related to the canonical GC-box (33). Moreover, we have previously described that COUP-TF activates HIV-1 transcription by direct protein to protein interactions with Sp1 bound to the proximal region of HIV-1 LTR (13). The association of CTIP2 with Sp1 and COUP-TF (Figure 5) led us to examine how CTIP2 interacts with the HIV-1 LTR to promote viral repression. To do that, we performed EMSA experiments with pure Sp1 proteins and bacterially produced GST-CTIP2 and GST-COUP-TF proteins that were incubated with a 32P-labeled probe corresponding to the three Sp1 binding sites (GC-box) of the HIV-1 LTR proximal region. As expected, Sp1 bound to the probe to form a shifted nucleoproteic complex (Figure 6A, lanes 1 and 7). Interestingly, addition of GST-CTIP2 (lane 2) or GST-COUP (lane 3) but not GST (lane 4) separately promoted the formation of supershifted complexes, indicating that, as previously reported for COUP-TF (13), CTIP2 was anchored to the LTR by a physical interaction with Sp1. As a control, GST-COUP-TF and GST-CTIP2 proteins, incubated alone, were unable to directly interact with the probe (lanes 5 and 6). To confirm whether COUP-TF, CTIP2 and Sp1 form a ternary complex, we performed additional gel shift experiments in which increasing amounts of CTIP2 proteins were added to the binary Sp1/COUP-TF complex (lanes 9 and 10). As shown, the shifted complex formed by COUP-TF and Sp1 bound to the template (lane 8) was supershifted by increasing the amount of CTIP2 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the intensity of the supershifted complexes also increased with CTIP2 quantity. Those findings are in favor of the formation of a ternary complex anchored to the HIV-1 Sp1 binding sites. To precisely examine this complex, the mixed three proteins were incubated with their respective antibody. EMSA experiments demonstrated that the complex observed in the presence of the three proteins (Figure 6A, lane 10 and Figure 6B, lane 1) was supershifted by the antibodies directed against CTIP2 (Figure 6B, lane 2) and COUP-TF (Figure 6B, lane 3) but not by non-immune serum (Figure 6B, lane 5) confirming the presence of the two proteins in the complex. Moreover, incubation of the mixed three proteins with the anti-Sp1 antibodies (Figure 6B, lane 4) inhibited the formation of the nucleoprotein complex. Thus, impairing Sp1 binding to the proxixmal region of the HIV-1 LTR results in the total abolition of the CTIP2 and COUP-TF ability to bind this region of the viral promoter. These results confirm that both CTIP2 and COUP-TF interact with Sp1 bound to the LTR in vitro. Previously published EMSA experiments performed with nuclear extracts of microglial cells have revealed that this region of the viral promoter binds the cellular transcription factors, Sp1 and Sp3, in microglial cells (13). EMSA experiments performed with nuclear extracts of microglial cells expressing CTIP2 could not allow us to observe CTIP2 indirect binding to the LTR (C. Marban and O. Rohr, unpublished data). To bypass this technical issue and to address whether CTIP2 interacts with the viral promoter in vivo, ChIP assays were conducted on TZM-bl cells, which contain a chromatin-integrated LTR, and on transiently transfected HEK 293T cells. Although the nature and/or the extent of chromatin formation on transiently transfected templates likely differ from that of chromosomal genes, previous reports have validated ChIP studies in transiently transfected cells (34,35). The amplified proximal LTR region includes the three Sp1 binding sites but not the previously described COUP-TF binding site (12). As expected, in the absence of CTIP2, both endogenous Sp1 and COUP-TF interact with the proximal LTR region in chromatin-integrated (Figure 6C) and transiently transfected contexts (Figure 6D, left panel). Moreover, the presence of CTIP2 did not abolish Sp1 and COUP-TF recruitment (Figure 6C, row 2 and Figure 6D, left panel row 3) in agreement with the in vitro results described above. However, in the presence of CTIP2, a lesser extent of template was immunoprecipitated with the antibodies directed against Sp1 and COUP-TF in the context of the integrated LTR (Figure 6C, row 2). The same observations were made with the antibodies directed against Sp1 in the transiently transfected LTR context (Figure 6D, left panel). As shown in Figure 6C and D (left panel), CTIP2 interacted with the proximal region of the viral promoter. In addition, mutation of the Sp1 binding sites abolished the interaction of Sp1, COUP-TF and CTIP2 with this region of the viral LTR (Figure 6D, right panel). Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that the Sp1-mediated recruitment of CTIP2 to the LTR occurs in a cellular context. We could not detect Hp1 interactions with the proximal region of the LTR in the absence of CTIP2, suggesting that CTIP2 significantly increase the recruitment of Hp1 to the HIV-1 proximal promoter (Figure 6D, left panel). In addition, mutation of the Sp1 binding sites also abolished CTIP2-mediated recruitment of Hp1 (Figure 6D, right panel). Since Hp1 associates with heterochromatic regions, it is likely that CTIP2 promotes transcriptionally repressed heterochromatic environment to the viral LTR region..

EMSA experiments demonstrated that the complex observed in the presence of the three proteins (Figure 6A, lane 10 and Figure 6B, lane 1) was supershifted by the antibodies directed against CTIP2 (Figure 6B, lane 2) and COUP-TF (Figure 6B, lane 3) but not by non-immune serum (Figure 6B, lane 5) confirming the presence of the two proteins in the complex. Moreover, incubation of the mixed three proteins with the anti-Sp1 antibodies (Figure 6B, lane 4) inhibited the formation of the nucleoprotein complex. Thus, impairing Sp1 binding to the proxixmal region of the HIV-1 LTR results in the total abolition of the CTIP2 and COUP-TF ability to bind this region of the viral promoter. These results confirm that both CTIP2 and COUP-TF interact with Sp1 bound to the LTR in vitro. Previously published EMSA experiments performed with nuclear extracts of microglial cells have revealed that this region of the viral promoter binds the cellular transcription factors, Sp1 and Sp3, in microglial cells (13). EMSA experiments performed with nuclear extracts of microglial cells expressing CTIP2 could not allow us to observe CTIP2 indirect binding to the LTR (C. Marban and O. Rohr, unpublished data). To bypass this technical issue and to address whether CTIP2 interacts with the viral promoter in vivo, ChIP assays were conducted on TZM-bl cells, which contain a chromatin-integrated LTR, and on transiently transfected HEK 293T cells. Although the nature and/or the extent of chromatin formation on transiently transfected templates likely differ from that of chromosomal genes, previous reports have validated ChIP studies in transiently transfected cells (34,35). The amplified proximal LTR region includes the three Sp1 binding sites but not the previously described COUP-TF binding site (12). As expected, in the absence of CTIP2, both endogenous Sp1 and COUP-TF interact with the proximal LTR region in chromatin-integrated (Figure 6C) and transiently transfected contexts (Figure 6D, left panel). Moreover, the presence of CTIP2 did not abolish Sp1 and COUP-TF recruitment (Figure 6C, row 2 and Figure 6D, left panel row 3) in agreement with the in vitro results described above. However, in the presence of CTIP2, a lesser extent of template was immunoprecipitated with the antibodies directed against Sp1 and COUP-TF in the context of the integrated LTR (Figure 6C, row 2). The same observations were made with the antibodies directed against Sp1 in the transiently transfected LTR context (Figure 6D, left panel). As shown in Figure 6C and D (left panel), CTIP2 interacted with the proximal region of the viral promoter. In addition, mutation of the Sp1 binding sites abolished the interaction of Sp1, COUP-TF and CTIP2 with this region of the viral LTR (Figure 6D, right panel). Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that the Sp1-mediated recruitment of CTIP2 to the LTR occurs in a cellular context. We could not detect Hp1 interactions with the proximal region of the LTR in the absence of CTIP2, suggesting that CTIP2 significantly increase the recruitment of Hp1 to the HIV-1 proximal promoter (Figure 6D, left panel). In addition, mutation of the Sp1 binding sites also abolished CTIP2-mediated recruitment of Hp1 (Figure 6D, right panel). Since Hp1 associates with heterochromatic regions, it is likely that CTIP2 promotes transcriptionally repressed heterochromatic environment to the viral LTR region..

To decipher the mechanism whereby CTIP2 alters COUP-TF and Sp1 functions, we examined whether these proteins interact in vitro and in cells. GST pull-down experiments revealed that CTIP2 associates with the N-terminal region of COUP-TF and with the C-terminal region of Sp1 in vitro. In this way, CTIP2 presents two interfaces for Sp1 and COUP-TF interactions. COUP-TF and Sp1 proteins bind the central and the C-terminal region of CTIP2 in vitro. These results are consistent with the previously reported interface domains of Arp1 (COUP-TFII) with CTIP1 (23). Confocal microscopy observations of COUP-TF and Sp1 location in the presence or absence of CTIP2 reveal that CTIP2 colocalizes with COUP-TF and Sp1 within nuclear ball-like structures. Moreover, the heterochromatin-associated protein Hp1 is also present in these structures. There are three Hp1 protein family members in mammals, Hp1, Hp1ss and Hp1. The Hp1 isoform is mainly detected in transcriptionally repressed heterochromatic region (36). Thus, the colocalization of CTIP2 with endogenous Sp1, COUP-TF and Hp1 proteins as reported here strongly suggests that these proteins are relocated to transcriptionally inactive regions of heterochromatin in microglial cells.

Since Hp1, Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins associate with CTIP2 in microglial cells, we address their respective interaction interfaces in vitro. Our findings show that the central zinc finger domain of CTIP2 may preferentially bind Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins, while the C-terminal region may bind to Hp1. In the presence of the viral Tat transactivator, CTIP2 also associates with Hp1 via its C-terminal region. Taken together, these findings suggest a permanent association of CTIP2 with Hp1 via its C-terminal region. The central domain of CTIP2 may be reserved for the interactions with the functionally repressed transcription factors. Our observations indicate that COUP-TF and Sp1 could bind together to CTIP2 and that COUP-TF and CTIP2 do not compete for Sp1 binding. Those findings suggest the formation of a ternary complex, including COUP-TF, Sp1 and CTIP2 proteins. Thereby, CTIP2 links these transcriptional activators to transcriptionally repressed heterochromatic region. CTIP1 and CTIP2 proteins have been described as sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (33). The core-binding site identified in this study is highly related to the canonical GC-box sequence. Since Sp1 anchors COUP-TF to the GC-box sequence of the viral LTR region (12), we addressed how CTIP2 interacts with the HIV-1 promoter. Our findings demonstrate that CTIP2 is not able to directly bind the three viral GC-box sequences in vitro. CTIP2 is recruited to the HIV-1 LTR via its association with Sp1 bound to this region. Moreover, CTIP2 is not in competition with COUP-TF for Sp1-mediated anchorage to the viral promoter, indicating that the three proteins are linked together to the LTR in vitro.

We show that Sp1 anchors CTIP2 and COUP-TF to the HIV-1 LTR and that Sp1 binding to the GC-box sequence is necessary for CTIP2 recruitment to this region. Nevertheless, since Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins are not accessible to their related antibodies in the CTIP2-induced nuclear structures, one wonders whether the observation of reduced binding to the LTR may result from protein sequestration and/or chromatin environment. ChIP experiments also indicate that CTIP2 promotes Hp1 recruitment to the LTR encompassing the Sp1 binding sequences. Mutation of the Sp1 binding sites abolished this recruitment. Taken together, these results suggest that the Sp1-mediated anchorage of CTIP2 to the HIV-1 LTR region may recruit a large complex that promotes Hp1 association, heterochromatin environment and viral gene transcriptional silencing. In Jurkat cells, CTIP2 associates with the histone deacetylase SirT1 in a large complex. CTIP2-mediated recruitment of SirT1 to promoter template results in a deacetylation of the bound histones H3 and H4 and in a transcriptional repression (35).

In agreement with these observations, CTIP2 is still able to repress LTR-driven transcriptional activity of a LTR deleted downstream of the GC-box sequences. Recruitment of CTIP1 to the template by a COUP-TF family member has been found to result in a transcriptional repression of a reporter gene harboring a COUP-TF binding site (23). In the context of the HIV-1 promoter, deletion of the previously described COUP-TF binding site did not impact CTIP2 repressive function. Moreover, EMSA and ChIP experiments demonstrate that CTIP2 interacts with the proximal region of the LTR excluding the COUP-TF binding sequence. Taken together, these findings indicate that the COUP-TF binding sequence, located downstream to the GC-box region, might not be implicated in the CTIP2 repressive functions. As widely reported, deletion of the LTR GC-box region results in a drastic ( > 90%) reduction of the LTR-driven transcriptional activity (13 to 15,22).

No antiretroviral drugs that are currently available can inhibit transcription of HIV RNA from the integrated HIV proviral DNA in infected cells. Nevertheless, HDAC inhibitors are able to induce quiescent provirus, suggesting that derepression of heterochromatin structures may force viral expression from latently infected reservoirs (41,42). Thus, investigation on factors that may promote heterochromatin structures to the viral gene promoter, such as CTIP2, appears crucial for understanding these phenomena and for the development of new anti-HIV strategies. At this stage, further studies will be necessary to precisely examine the CTIP2-associated enzymatic activities that promote transcriptional silencing. In addition, since our investigations were restricted to the transcriptional step of the viral life cycle, it cannot be excluded that CTIP2 also counteracts other critical steps necessary to optimal viral replication. This possibility needs further clarification..

The transcription factor hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is an orphan nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism in the liver, intestine, and endocrine pancreas. Inheritance of a single null allele of HNF4 causes diabetes in humans. Here we demonstrate that AMPK directly phosphorylates HNF4 and represses its transcriptional activity. AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of HNF4 on serine 304 had a 2-fold effect, reducing the ability of the transcription factor to form homodimers and bind DNA and increasing its degradation rate in vivo. These results demonstrate that HNF4 is a downstream target of AMPK and raise the possibility that one of the effects of AMPK activation is reduced expression of HNF4 target genes..

0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The transcription factor HNF41 (NR2A1), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, plays a key role in regulating the expression of metabolic genes in multiple tissues including the liver, intestine, kidney, and endocrine pancreas (for review see Ref. 1). In humans, a nonsense mutation in a single allele of the HNF4 gene causes an inherited form of diabetes known as maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) (for a review see Ref. 2). This syndrome is characterized by insufficient insulin secretion (3, 4), indicating a significant defect in pancreatic function. Surprisingly, there is not a major deficit in liver function, despite the important role of HNF4 in hepatic gene expression (5). These observations suggest that HNF4 regulates pancreatic genes involved in glucose sensing and/or insulin production. This hypothesis is supported by experiments demonstrating that HNF4 regulates expression of genes encoding enzymes of glucose metabolism and insulin secretion (6 to 8). Because MODY1 patients have a single null allele that does not produce a dominant-negative acting protein (9), the physiological abnormalities in these patients must be caused by a relatively mild (50%) decrease in the amount of HNF4 protein. Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that any modification of HNF4 that causes a reduction in its transcriptional activity could have significant effects on pancreatic function..
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	7	HNF4 has also been shown recently to play an important role in the regulation of hepatic glucose output, a key component of the maintenance of plasma glucose levels. Yoon et al. (10) recently demonstrated that the transcriptional regulation of gene for the key gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by cAMP was mediated by the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1 acting through HNF4. These findings suggest that HNF4 may play a role in the transcriptional response of the liver to metabolic hormones and that factors regulating the activity of HNF4 could have an effect on hepatic glucose output..

In yeast, the SNF1 complex is a nuclear protein that regulates expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism and is activated by phosphorylation when glucose is removed from the growth medium (12). In mammalian cells, AMPK acts as a fuel sensor that monitors AMP and ATP levels. It is activated by high AMP:ATP ratios during states of low energy charge. Once activated, the enzyme reduces the activity of ATP-consuming anabolic pathways and increases the activity of catabolic ATP-producing pathways, acting to reestablish normal cellular energy balance (for review see Ref. 13). Depending on the tissue, a variety of physiological circumstances can cause AMPK activation including hypoglycemia (14), ischemia (15), heat shock (16), and exercise (17 to 19). AMPK activation has been associated with several key aspects of metabolism including exercise-induced glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation in muscle (17, 20, 21), reduced lipid (22, 23) and glucose synthesis in liver (12, 24), and altered glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the endocrine pancreas (14, 25)..

Kinase activity is regulated allosterically by AMP binding and also by direct phosphorylation mediated by an uncharacterized AMP-sensitive protein kinase. A potential role of AMPK in the nucleus is suggested by several observations. The first is the similarity of the mammalian kinase to the yeast SNF1 transcriptional regulator, as described above. Second, AMPK heterotrimers containing the 2 subunit isoform are preferentially found in the nucleus (31). In addition, AMPK has been shown to phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivator p300 and to regulate its ability to mediate nuclear receptor transcriptional activity (32)..

The S304A and S304D mutants were introduced into pH4c-WT using the Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and confirmed by DNA sequencing, to produce the plasmids pH4c-304A and pH4c-304D. The pH4c series plasmids were used in experiments presented in Figs. 1, 2B, 3A,3D,4A, and 5. For experiments designed to examine HNF4 protein stability (Fig. 4, B and C), full-length N-terminal FLAG-tagged wild-type, 304A, and 304D cDNA sequences were cloned into the tetracycline-regulated vector, pTRE-shuttle2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), to form pH4i-WT, pH4i-304A, and pH4i-304D. GFP-HNF4 protein was expressed from a pCDNA3.1 vector containing an N-terminal fusion of the EGFP coding sequences (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) fused to the full-length HNF4 cDNA. GST-HNF4 protein was produced from a pET23a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) containing an N-terminal fusion of glutathione S-transferase sequences and the full-length HNF4 cDNA. The pET.HNF4/A to D plasmids contain PCR-amplified subfragments of HNF4 (Fig. 1C) as His and T7 tag N-terminal fusions in the pET28a vector. The same subfragments were also cloned into the pCMV-Tag2b plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for expression in eukaryotic cells. The HNF4-responsive reporter plasmid pL854 contains promoter sequences from the human apoCIII gene ( to 854 to +22) linked to luciferase in the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The -galactosidase plasmid contains a CMV-driven -galactosidase gene..

To determine whether any of these sites were targets for AMPK phosphorylation, they were each mutated to alanine and examined in an in vitro phosphorylation assay. None of the mutants abolished phosphorylation by AMPK (data not shown), indicating that there are multiple AMPK phosphorylation sites on HNF4. To examine phosphorylation of individual segments of the protein independently, four overlapping fragments of HNF4 were generated from subclones of the HNF4 cDNA (Fig. 1C). When in vitro AMPK assays were conducted, all four subfragments were phosphorylated to some degree (Fig. 1D) and showed the expected enhancement of phosphorylation in the presence of AMP (an allosteric activator of the kinase). However, when the results were normalized to the total amount of protein in the assay, the HNF4/C fragment (containing the Ser-304 site) showed the highest degree of AMP-dependent phosphorylation (data not shown). A significant amount of phosphorylation was also observed with the HNF4/A fragment. The HNF4/A fragment contains one of the three potential consensus sites for AMPK (Fig. 1B).

As presented in Fig. 2A, mutation of serine 304 completely abolished phosphorylation of the C fragment. Although the Ser-304 site is also present in the D fragment (Fig 1C), it does not appear to be a good substrate for the kinase in this context as this fragment is phosphorylated to a much lower degree than the C fragment (Fig. 1D). When the S304A mutation was examined quantitatively in the context of the full-length protein, it reduced phosphorylation by 50% (Fig. 2B). Together, these results suggest that S304A is a phosphorylation site for AMPK in vitro and that additional sites are present in both the N and C termini of protein..

In vivo phosphorylation labeling was carried out with these transfected cells in the presence or absence of AICAR.

The wild-type HNF4/C fragment was phosphorylated during the labeling reaction, and the treatment of the cells with AICAR caused an 2-fold increase of phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). This phosphorylation was completely absent when the S304A version of the fragment was used, indicating that Ser-304 is phosphorylated in vivo by AMPK. In vivo phosphorylation experiments using the full-length HNF4 protein showed the same degree of phosphorylation for the wild-type and Ser-304 mutant protein (data not shown). This may be due to a combination of high basal phosphorylation of HNF4 by multiple kinases in vivo (36, 37) and the likelihood that there are additional AMPK phosphorylation sites on HNF4 (Fig. 1D)..

The effect of phosphorylation at Ser-304 on the ability of HNF4 to form functional homodimers and bind to DNA was examined in a gel mobility shift assay with wild-type and the phosphomimetic S304D versions of HNF4 proteins synthesized by in vitro translation. Both the wild-type and S304A version of HNF4 bound to an HNF4-response element derived from the human apoCIII promoter (Fig. 3A, 2nd and 3rd lanes). However, the S304D mutant HNF4 showed a dramatically reduced ability to bind to DNA despite similar amounts of protein present in the reaction (Fig. 3A, 4th lane). Gel mobility shift experiments using HNF4 protein that was phosphorylated by AMPK in vitro showed only a mild reduction in DNA binding activity (data not shown). The effect of phosphorylation on the ability of HNF4 to bind DNA would be less pronounced than the S304D mutation if less than 100% of the HNF4 protein is phosphorylated in the in vitro kinase reaction. Although the efficiency of these reactions is unknown, it is likely that only a fraction of the HNF4 molecules become phosphorylated at Ser-304 leaving the non-phosphorylated protein free to form dimers and bind DNA. In addition, it is also possible that dimers composed of one phosphorylated and one non-phosphorylated HNF4 molecule are competent to bind DNA..

The activation of AMPK by AICAR addition induced the appearance of degradation fragments from the wild-type but not the phosphorylation-defective S304A protein (Fig. 4A). These findings indicate that phosphorylation of HNF4 on serine 304 increased the proteolytic degradation of the protein. In addition, these results strongly support the conclusion that AMPK phosphorylates HNF4 on serine 304 in vivo. To measure the rate of degradation of wild-type and mutant HNF4 proteins, a tetracycline-regulated expression system was used to transiently express wild-type and 304 mutant HNF4 in transfected CHO cells. 18 h post-transfection, HNF4 expression was specifically extinguished by the addition of doxycycline, and the amount of HNF4 protein remaining in the cells was determined at regular intervals over the following 8 h. The results (Fig. 4, B and C) demonstrate that the phosphomimetic S304D mutant protein was degraded more rapidly then either the wild-type or S304A proteins. Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo results suggest that phosphorylation of HNF4 at Ser-304 has two effects on HNF4: to reduce its ability to form functional dimers, and to reduce the stability of HNF4 in vivo..

0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	49	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Here we report that the transcription factor HNF4 is a novel substrate of AMP-activated protein kinase. Given the central role of AMPK in mediating the response to changes in cellular energy balance and the fact that HNF4 regulates genes involved in energy metabolism, these findings suggest a mechanism for how the expression of a specific set of metabolic genes might be linked to cellular energy status. Although we have not directly demonstrated that AMPK regulates HNF4-mediated gene expression in vivo, a previous study reported that activation of AMPK activity in primary liver cells correlated with reduced expression of HNF4 target genes (33). Our findings offer a potential mechanistic explanation for the relationship between HNF4 target gene down-regulation and AMPK activation. The kinase phosphorylates HNF4 on serine 304 (Figs. 1 and 2), which causes a reduction in the ability of HNF4 to form dimers and bind DNA (Fig. 3). In vivo, addition of a negative charge to this residue, by substitution with an aspartic acid residue, reduced the ability of HNF4 to activate transcription from a cotransfected HNF4-dependent reporter (Fig. 5)..
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	50	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Here we report that the transcription factor HNF4 is a novel substrate of AMP-activated protein kinase. Given the central role of AMPK in mediating the response to changes in cellular energy balance and the fact that HNF4 regulates genes involved in energy metabolism, these findings suggest a mechanism for how the expression of a specific set of metabolic genes might be linked to cellular energy status. Although we have not directly demonstrated that AMPK regulates HNF4-mediated gene expression in vivo, a previous study reported that activation of AMPK activity in primary liver cells correlated with reduced expression of HNF4 target genes (33). Our findings offer a potential mechanistic explanation for the relationship between HNF4 target gene down-regulation and AMPK activation. The kinase phosphorylates HNF4 on serine 304 (Figs. 1 and 2), which causes a reduction in the ability of HNF4 to form dimers and bind DNA (Fig. 3). In vivo, addition of a negative charge to this residue, by substitution with an aspartic acid residue, reduced the ability of HNF4 to activate transcription from a cotransfected HNF4-dependent reporter (Fig. 5)..
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	51	In addition to the effects on HNF4 dimerization and DNA binding, phosphorylation of HNF4 on Ser-304, or conversion of Ser-304 to an aspartic acid, also caused an increase in the degradation rate and a reduction in the amount of HNF4 protein (Fig. 3D and Fig. 4). Our results are consistent with previous findings showing that activation of AMPK in primary hepatocytes resulted in a reduction in the amount of endogenous HNF4 (33). Taken together, our findings suggest a model in which one of the branches of the AMPK signaling pathway results in the phosphorylation of HNF4 on serine 304, leading to both a reduction in the amount and activity of HNF4 and a subsequent reduction in the expression of HNF4 target genes..
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	52	Although the work reported here is focused on the phosphorylation of the serine 304 residue in HNF4, it is clear that this is not the only site on HNF4 that is phosphorylated by AMPK. The HNF4/A fragment from the N-terminal half of the protein was strongly phosphorylated in vitro on a site that we were not able to map. This site (or sites) may be responsible for the remaining phosphorylation of the full-length protein that occurs when the Ser-304 residue is mutated to alanine (Fig. 2B). We are currently mapping the AMPK site in the N terminus of HNF4 so that we can determine their functional significance. In addition to the regulation of HNF4 activity that we describe here, it has been reported previously that HNF4 DNA binding activity is repressed by protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of residues in the DNA binding domain (37). It has also been reported that phosphorylation of HNF4 on tyrosine residues affected its transcriptional activity and sub-nuclear localization (39). These findings, together with those reported here, suggest that that HNF4 is a highly regulated transcription factor and that multiple signaling pathways influence its activity..

0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	54	An interesting question concerning the phosphorylation of HNF4 by AMPK in vivo is the cellular location in which it occurs. HNF4 is strongly associated with the nucleus, whereas most of the known AMPK substrates are cytoplasmic enzymes. Although it is possible that HNF4 is also phosphorylated by in the cytoplasm, the most appealing compartment for the interaction would be the nucleus. Several observations support this possibility. First, specific isoforms of the kinase have been reported to be present in the nucleus (31, 40). Second, other transcriptional components have been reported to be potential substrates of the kinase; the co-activator p300 (32) and the carbohydrate-response transcription factor ChREBP (41). Finally, the yeast homolog of mammalian AMPK, SNF-1, is present in the nucleus (for review see Ref. 13) and is associated with chromatin, possibly in a gene-specific pattern (42). Together these observations suggest the intriguing possibility that at least some version of mammalian AMPK may be a component of the transcriptional complex on specific genes that are regulated by cellular energy balance..

In the endocrine pancreas, reduction of HNF4 activity would be predicted to have significant effect on the ability of the islet to secrete the appropriate amount of insulin. This possibility is illustrated by the phenotype of MODY1 patients who have only one normal allele of the HNF4 gene and presumably a reduced amount of active HNF4 protein (3). These patients have a defective insulin secretion in response that appears to be a primary effect of reduced HNF4 levels in pancreatic -cells (4, 43). Consistent with the apparent role of HNF4 in pancreatic physiology are the observations that HNF4 regulates a variety of -cell genes involved in glucose sensing and insulin secretion (6 to 8)..

It is likely that the -cell senses glucose concentration as fluctuations in the amount of intracellular ATP generated by glucose oxidation. The insulin secretory machinery gauges the amount of insulin to secrete by sensing these ATP level fluctuations (for review see Ref. 44). It is possible that the changes in cellular energy balance in -cells that occur in normal physiology have an effect on HNF4 phosphorylation and activity and that fluctuation in HNF4 activity are part of the normal physiological regulation of the islet. Consistent with this possibility is the observation that low glucose levels induce AMPK activity in cell lines derived from pancreatic -cells and the suggestion that changes in kinase activity are involved in insulin secretion (25). Alternatively, it is possible that AMPK-mediated changes in HNF4 activity are relevant in pathological conditions where AMPK is aberrantly activated and HNF4 activity is suppressed below normal levels. This situation could potentially result in a physiological circumstance analogous to the MODY1 phenotype..

It has been understood for many years that HNF4 plays an important role in the liver, regulating genes involved in lipid (45), amino acid (46, 47), and glucose metabolism (48, 49) and the coagulation cascade (50). It has been reported recently that HNF4 plays a key role in the induction of hepatic gluconeogenesis by mediating the transcriptional effects of the co-activator PGC1 (10). On the other hand, the reduction of HNF4 levels due to haploinsufficiency in MODY1 patients did not cause major liver abnormalities (5, 51), although changes in amounts of some liver-derived serum proteins were observed (52)..

0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	4	   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   The nuclear receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4 is involved in a transcriptional network and plays an important role in pancreatic ss-cells. Mutations in the HNF4 gene are correlated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young 1. HNF4 isoforms result from both alternative splicing and alternate usage of promoters P1 and P2. It has recently been reported that HNF4 transcription is driven almost exclusively by the P2 promoter in pancreatic islets. We observed that transcripts from both P1 and P2 promoters were expressed in human pancreatic ss-cells and in the pancreatic ss-cell lines RIN m5F and HIT-T15. Expression of HNF4 proteins originating from the P1 promoter was confirmed by immunodetection. Due to the presence of the activation function module AF-1, HNF4 isoforms originating from the P1 promoter exhibit stronger transcriptional activities and recruit coactivators more efficiently than isoforms driven by the P2 promoter. Conversely, activities of isoforms produced by both promoters were similarly repressed by the corepressor small heterodimer partner. These behaviors were observed on the promoter of HNF1 that is required for ss-cell function. Our results highlight that expression of P1 promoter-driven isoforms is important in the control of pancreatic ss-cell function..

0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	6	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   HEPATOCYTE NUCLEAR FACTOR (HNF) 4 is an orphan nuclear receptor (nuclear receptor 2A1, NR2A1) that activates the expression of genes involved in the transport and metabolism of many nutrients including lipids and glucose (1, 2). HNF4 is required for normal hepatic function (3). It also plays an important role in pancreatic ss-cells: HNF4 directly activates the insulin gene promoter (4) and is required for glucose-induced insulin secretion (5). Mutations in HNF4 gene are correlated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young 1, characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, early onset (usually before the age of 25 yr), and impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion due to dysfunction of pancreatic ss-cells (6). HNF4 is involved, together with other transcription factors including HNF1, in a complex transcription factor network that is thought to be crucial for the function of pancreatic ss-cells (7, 8, 9)..

0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	8	In mammals, HNF4 is encoded by two different genes: HNF4 and HNF4 (10). The HNF4 gene potentially encodes nine distinct isoforms. Their structure and nomenclature are presented in Ref. 1 . HNF4 isoforms result from both alternate promoter usage and alternative splicing. As shown in Fig. 1A, promoter P1 initiates transcripts that contain exon 1A (isoforms 1 to 6), whereas promoter P2 initiates transcripts that contain exon 1D (isoforms 7 to 9; Refs. 11 and 12). Isoforms 2 and 8 are the alternatively spliced variants of isoforms 1 and 7, respectively. They contain a 30-bp insert in their 3' sequence (Fig. 1, A and B). Compared with these four isoforms, isoforms 3 and 9, which have a completely different 3' sequence, are much less expressed, whereas isoforms 4 to 6 are very poorly expressed or have not yet been identified in vivo (1, 13). The expression of HNF4 isoforms varies with development, differentiation, and tissue origin (1, 14, 15, 16). The expression of HNF4 mainly initiates at the P1 promoter in adult liver and kidney (15). Recently, two different groups documented the expression of transcripts of the P2 promoter in insulinoma INS-1 cells, as well as in mouse and human pancreatic islets, but did not detect transcripts of the P1 promoter, leading to the conclusion that HNF4 transcription is driven almost exclusively by the P2 promoter in the endocrine pancreas (11, 12, 17). Strongly contrasting with these data, we observed that HNF4 transcripts initiated at the P1 promoter are substantially expressed, alongside P2 promoter transcripts, in human pancreatic ss-cells and in the rodent pancreatic ss-cell lines RIN m5F and HIT-T15. Only HNF4 isoforms initiated at the P1 promoter contain the activation function module AF-1, which is encoded by exon 1A. The AF-1 plays a key role in HNF4 transcriptional potential and in the recruitment of coactivators that are essential for HNF4 function (18, 19, 20). We show that lack of the AF-1 in HNF4 isoforms initiated at the P2 promoter markedly decreases both the transcriptional potential and interaction with several coactivators. Conversely, lack of the AF-1 does not affect the repression of HNF4 activity by small heterodimer partner (SHP). This finding highlights the functional consequences of expression of the HNF4 P1 promoter transcripts in pancreatic ss-cells..

Plasmid pcDNA3 human HNF42 Y6D/F19D was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis from pcDNA3 human HNF42 F19D (20). The human HNF48 cDNA was obtained by PCR using human HNF42 cDNA as PCR matrix. The sense primer encompassed the sequence +1/+49 of exon 1D (11) and a sequence hybridizing to the first 23 nucleotides of exon 2, which is common to both 2 and 8 HNF4 isoforms. The antisense primer hybridized to sequence 1412 to 1433 of HNF42 cDNA, taking adenosine of the ATG codon of initiation methionine as position 1 (27).

Expression of P1 and P2 promoter transcripts was analyzed by RT-PCR. Promoter P2 transcripts were selectively amplified with a sense primer hybridizing to exon 1D and an antisense primer hybridizing to exon 5 (primers d and b in Fig. 1, A and B, and Table 1). Transcripts from promoter P1 were selectively amplified with the sense primer a hybridizing with exon 1A and primer b (Fig. 1, A and B, and Table 1). As expected from data obtained with pancreatic islets and INS-1 cells (11, 12, 17), we detected transcripts from promoter P2 in human islets, isolated human pancreatic ss-cells, and RIN m5F and HIT-T15 insulinoma cells (Fig. 1C). In exocrine pancreas, the band corresponding to promoter P2 transcripts was barely detectable (Fig. 1C, lane 4), although the band of ss-actin had an intensity similar to that obtained from endocrine cells (Fig. 1G). Interestingly, promoter P1 transcripts from human islets and isolated human pancreatic ss-cells yielded highly visible bands, indicating that HNF4 promoter P1 transcripts are substantially expressed in human endocrine pancreas (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Reproducible data were obtained from five different donors. Similar results were obtained with RIN m5F and HIT-T15 RNA (Fig. 1D, lanes 5 and 6). Again, in human exocrine pancreas, promoter P1 transcripts were expressed at very low levels (Fig. 1D, lane 4). Two other groups did not detect P1 promoter transcripts in pancreatic islets and INS-1 cells (11, 12, 17), but the following controls confirmed the accuracy of our results showing expression of the P1 promoter transcripts. First, we checked the specificity of amplification of P1 promoter transcripts with the a+b primer set: cloned HNF42 yielded a highly visible band, but no band could be detected with cloned HNF48 (Fig. 1H, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). Second, using cloned HNF42 and HNF48, we verified that primer sets a+b and d+b exhibited similar amplification efficiency (data not shown). Third, using human pancreatic islets, we made sure that the band obtained for P1 transcripts did not result from a genomic or plasmidic contamination during RNA isolation or reverse transcription: no amplicon could be detected when the step of reverse transcription of RNAs was performed in the absence of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Fig. 1I). Conversely, use of another set of primers (h and g), designed to specifically amplify exon 1A and 2, yielded with RNAs from human islets a band that was not obtained when reverse transcription was omitted (Fig. 1J), thus confirming that transcripts of the HNF4 P1 promoter are readily expressed in endocrine pancreas..

Conversely, use of another set of primers (h and g), designed to specifically amplify exon 1A and 2, yielded with RNAs from human islets a band that was not obtained when reverse transcription was omitted (Fig. 1J), thus confirming that transcripts of the HNF4 P1 promoter are readily expressed in endocrine pancreas..

In addition, when analyzing transcripts from the P1 promoter, we failed to detect a band of 612 bp, the expected size of amplicons of transcripts containing exon 1B (Fig. 1D).

Because this antibody is not suitable in Western blot assays (Ryffel, G. U., personal communication), HNF4 expression was studied in EMSA performed with the HNF4 response element of the HNF1 promoter (HNF1 probe). The specificity of the H4/55 monoclonal antibody was confirmed using in vitro-synthesized HNF42 and HNF48: it supershifted the complex formed with HNF42 but not that formed with HNF48 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 6). Conversely, complexes formed with both HNF4 isoforms could be supershifted by the 455 antiserum raised against their identical carboxy-terminal sequence (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 5). Nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells, which predominantly express HNF41 and 2, yielded a complex that could be supershifted by both the 455 antiserum and the H4/55 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 to 7). Pancreatic ss-cells express much lower amounts of HNF4 than HepG2 cells (32), which compelled us to use 4-fold higher amounts of HIT-T15 nuclear proteins than HepG2 nuclear proteins. This accounts for the unspecific background observed when analyzing the former material (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 to 4). Nevertheless, with HIT-T15 nuclear extracts, we could easily detect a retarded band (Fig. 2B, lane 1) corresponding to a complex mainly formed with HNF4: this complex exhibited the same electrophoretic mobility as that yielded by HNF4 proteins from HepG2 cells; it could be supershifted by the 455 antiserum (Fig. 2B, lane 2) but could not be obtained using a mutated HNF1 probe that is unable to bind HNF4 (data not shown). Addition of the H4/55 monoclonal antibody resulted in a concomitant decrease in the retarded band and formation of a strong supershifted band that could not be obtained by an antibody raised against an irrelevant peptide sequence, the Xpress tag (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). This result unambiguously shows endogenous expression of HNF41 and/or -2 proteins and confirms that HNF4 P1 promoter transcripts are readily expressed in the pancreatic ss-cell line HIT-T15. This cell line also expresses HNF4, which, when complexed with DNA, comigrates with complexes formed between DNA and HNF41 and -2 (33). HNF4 is not recognized by the 455 and H4/55 antibodies; this could account for the partial supershift observed in lanes 2 and 3, as previously observed with nuclear extracts of intestinal villi and crypts (33)..

0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	39	  Weak transcriptional potentials of HNF48 produced from the P2 promoter in pancreatic ss-cells HNF41 and -2, whose transcripts include exon 1A, contain the activation function AF-1 module at their amino-terminal end (Fig. 3A). This module includes structural motifs characteristic of acidic activators and plays a key role in the transcriptional potential of HNF4 isoforms 1 and 2 (18;19). The amino-terminal sequence of HNF47 and -8, encoded by exon 1D, does not contain these motifs and seems to lack an activation function AF-1 module. We addressed the consequences of this sequence difference on the HNF4 transcriptional potential in pancreatic ss-cell lines, by comparing the transcriptional activities of HNF4 isoforms 2 and 8 in RIN m5F and HIT-T15 insulinoma cells. To better define the effect of lack of the AF-1 on the HNF4 transcriptional potential in these cells, we also analyzed the activity of HNF42 Y6D/F19D, which has a mutated AF-1 module (Fig. 3A). The mutated residues are crucial for the AF-1 function in hepatoma HepG2 cells (18) and in embryonal kidney HEK 293T cells (Eeckhoute, J., unpublished results). In RIN m5F cells, the HNF1 promoter was activated 6.3-fold by HNF42 but only 4.8-fold by HNF48 and 4.2-fold by HNF42 Y6D/F19D (Fig. 3B). In HIT-T15 cells, only HNF42 activated the HNF1 promoter (Fig. 3C). The differences in transactivation were not due to low expression of HNF48 or HNF42 Y6D/F19D (Fig. 3D). These results support the hypothesis that the lower transcriptional activity of HNF48 is due to lack of a AF-1 module..

To circumvent technical difficulties due to cotransfection of multiple expression plasmids in pancreatic cells and to avoid interference with endogenous HNF4 and HNF4, this study was carried out in HeLa cells. When p300 was not overexpressed, the HNF1 promoter was activated 5.3-fold by HNF42 but only 2.6-fold by HNF48 and HNF42 Y6D/F19D (Fig. 5A). The marked difference in transactivation potentials of HNF4 isoforms 2 and 8 was not due to a difference in expression of the proteins (Fig. 5C). The coactivator p300 had no effect on the activity of the HNF1 promoter in the absence of HNF4 but enhanced the transcriptional potential of HNF42 2-fold vs. only 1.4-fold and 1.2-fold for HNF48 and HNF42 Y6D/F19D, respectively (Fig. 5A). Therefore, when the AF-1 module was either lacking or mutated, both the physical interaction and the functional cooperation between p300 and HNF4 were decreased.

But until now, HNF4 expression was not documented in human pancreatic ss-cells. In our study on human islets and isolated pancreatic ss-cells, we observed that transcripts of the P1 promoter were significantly expressed, as were those of the P2 promoter. This indicates that HNF4 expression does not exclusively initiate at the P2 promoter in human pancreatic ss-cells. Similar results were observed in the rat RIN m5F and hamster HIT-T15 pancreatic ss-cell lines. Several controls confirmed the accuracy of our results. Importantly, we confirmed expression of P1 transcripts in the pancreatic ss-cell line HIT-T15 by immunodetecting HNF4 proteins containing the amino-terminal sequence encoded by exon 1A. Lack of detection of promoter P1 transcripts in islets by Ferrer s group (12, 17) may be explained by a low amplification efficiency of the P1 promoter transcripts. This may account for the weak intensity they obtained for the exon 1A+2 band in liver, relative to that of exon 1D+2 band in islets (Fig. 2b in Ref. 17), although isoforms 1 and 2 are by far more abundant in liver than isoforms 7 and 8 in islets. In concordance with the considerable difference in expression (32), primers amplifying exons 8 to 10 contained in the four isoforms 1, 2, 7 and 8 yielded bands of much stronger intensity for isoforms 1 + 2 in liver than for isoforms 7 + 8 in islets (Fig. 1c in Ref. 17)..

This may account for the weak intensity they obtained for the exon 1A+2 band in liver, relative to that of exon 1D+2 band in islets (Fig. 2b in Ref. 17), although isoforms 1 and 2 are by far more abundant in liver than isoforms 7 and 8 in islets. In concordance with the considerable difference in expression (32), primers amplifying exons 8 to 10 contained in the four isoforms 1, 2, 7 and 8 yielded bands of much stronger intensity for isoforms 1 + 2 in liver than for isoforms 7 + 8 in islets (Fig. 1c in Ref. 17)..

This suggests that promoter P1 transcription may be important for normal pancreatic ss-cell function. In addition, a HNF42 clone was isolated from a human pancreatic islet cDNA library, also arguing for the expression of HNF4 P1 promoter transcripts in endocrine pancreas (Furuta, H., and G.

Our functional studies showed that the transcriptional potential of HNF42 was significantly stronger than that of isoform 8 in models of pancreatic ss-cells. Interestingly, these results were obtained on the promoter of HNF1, which plays a crucial role in these cells (7, 9, 43, 44). Because HNF1 expression is regulated by HNF4 in pancreatic ss-cells (5, 45), we suggest that expression of the HNF4 P1 promoter producing isoforms 1 and 2 is most probably of major importance in pancreatic ss-cells. From our data obtained with HNF42 containing a mutated AF-1, we can infer that the difference in transcriptional potential between isoforms 2 and 8 was due to the lack of the AF-1 module in the latter isoform..

Interaction with p300 was studied using a fragment (amino acids 340 to 528) that interacts with both the HNF4 AF-1 and AF-2 (20). Despite interaction through the AF-2, we observed a marked decrease in binding of HNF4 lacking the AF-1, thus highlighting the substantial contribution of AF-1 to the interaction with p300. Consistent with this result, we observed that p300 enhanced the transcriptional potential of isoform 2 more efficiently than that of isoform 8 and HNF42 with a mutated AF-1. Interestingly, the AF-1 module is also required for the synergistic action of p300 and GRIP-1 to enhance the HNF4 transcriptional activity (42)..

0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	60	In contrast to these coactivators, the corepressor SHP interacted similarly with HNF42 and 8 and repressed their transcriptional activity to similar extents. This strongly suggests that SHP-mediated recruitment of transcriptional inhibitor(s) is not AF-1 dependent. Silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), another HNF4 corepressor (46), was shown to interact similarly with HNF41 and HNF47 (42). It appears therefore that the HNF4 AF-1 interacts only with coactivators whereas the AF-2 interacts with both coactivators and corepressors in a mutually exclusive fashion. Because the balance between coactivators and corepressors is crucial for HNF4 transcriptional activity (38, 46), lack of the AF-1 in isoforms 7 and 8 most probably results in a shift toward a lower ability to recruit coactivators and a subsequent lower coactivator-mediated enhancement of HNF4 transcriptional potential. SHP is highly expressed in human pancreatic islets (Moerman, E., unpublished results) and may serve as an important checkpoint to balance the activity of the transcriptional network of pancreatic ss-cells (7, 8). In these cells in which the HNF4 AF-2 has a high probability to be occupied by SHP, the transcriptional activity of isoforms containing the AF-1 may be more efficiently enhanced by coactivators. Thus, even if the AF-1-dependent cofactor-mediated modulations of HNF4 transcriptional activity observed in this study and in Ref. 42 remain to be shown in pancreatic ss-cells, our results strongly argue for an essential role of the promoter P1-driven HNF4 isoforms in these cells..

0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	62	A cross-regulatory loop between HNF1 and HNF4 has been evidenced in pancreatic ss-cells, as reviewed in Refs. 8 and 9 . In the model proposed by Ferrer (9), activation of the HNF1 promoter by HNF4 is crucial to maintain HNF1 expression above the threshold level required to hold the HNF1/HNF4 circuit in the switch-ON state and, consequently, to avoid ss-cell dysfunction and development of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (9). Expression of the HNF4 P1 promoter transcripts in pancreatic ss-cells is probably crucial to maintain this circuit in the switch-ON state. Indeed, HNF4 is expressed at a limiting amount in ss-cells, and, among isoforms 1, 2, 7, 8, and , only the first two contain the AF-1 module, which confers a stronger transcriptional potential and leads to a more efficient recruitment of coactivators. Thus, expression of isoforms 1 and 2 is likely of crucial importance in the transcriptional network controlling pancreatic islet function..

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Nuclear receptors (NR) activate transcription by interacting with several different coactivator complexes, primarily via LXXLL motifs (NR boxes) of the coactivator that bind a common region in the ligand binding domain of nuclear receptors (activation function-2, AF to 2) in a ligand-dependent fashion. However, how nuclear receptors distinguish between different sets of coactivators remains a mystery, as does the mechanism by which orphan receptors such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) activate transcription. In this study, we show that HNF4 interacts with a complex containing vitamin D receptor (VDR)-interacting proteins (DRIPs) in the absence of exogenously added ligand. However, whereas a full-length DRIP205 construct enhanced the activation by HNF4 in vivo, it did not interact well with the HNF4 ligand binding domain in vitro. In investigating this discrepancy, we found that the polyamine spermine significantly enhanced the interaction between HNF4 and full-length DRIP205 in an AF-2, NR-box-dependent manner. Spermine also enhanced the interaction of DRIP205 with the VDR even in the presence of its ligand, but decreased the interaction of both HNF4 and VDR with the p160 coactivator glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GR1P1). We also found that GR1P1 and DRIP205 synergistically activated HNF4-mediated transcription and that a specific inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, -difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), decreased the ability of HNF4 to activate transcription in vivo. These results lead us to propose a model in which polyamines may facilitate the switch between different coactivator complexes binding to NRs..

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   NUCLEAR RECEPTORS (NRs) comprise a family of transcription factors that play a role in nearly every aspect of growth, development, and disease processes (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 2). The best characterized members of the family, such as the steroid and thyroid hormone and vitamins A and D receptors, are known to regulate transcription by binding their cognate lipophilic ligands and subsequently undergoing a conformational change that alters their ability to interact with coregulatory proteins. These coregulatory proteins typically consist of complexes that either repress (corepressors) or activate (coactivators) transcription. The coactivator complexes can be crudely divided into complexes that either contain histone acetyl transferase (HAT) activity [e.g. the p160-p300/CBP-PCAF complexes] or ones that do not [e.g. the vitamin D receptor (VDR)-interating protein (DRIP)/thyroid hormone receptor associated protein (TRAP)/ARC/mediator complexes]. We and others have proposed previously that nuclear receptors interact first with the coactivator complexes that contain HAT activity, allowing for acetylation and hence decondensation of the chromatin, and that subsequently the other coactivator complexes bind the receptors and interact with the basal transcription machinery to initiate transcription (reviewed in Refs. 3, 4, 5, 6)..
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	6	An increasing amount of evidence indicates that both types of coactivators interact with the activation function-2 (AF-2) region of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the NRs via LXXLL motifs (NR interaction regions or NR boxes). p160 family members glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) and steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC1) bind the AF-2 and help recruit p300/CBP, which has also been found to bind via the AF-2. DRIP205 (also known as TRAP220, RB18A, PBP, TRIP2), a component of the DRIP/TRAP complex, also interacts with the AF-2 via LXXLL motifs (6, 7, 8). However, what is not clear is how a given nuclear receptor makes the switch from the p160/p300 complex to the DRIP complex. Whereas the switch from corepressor to coactivator binding is apparently made by a conformational change in the receptor upon ligand binding, both types of coactivators bind liganded receptor and bind principally via the AF-2. This suggests that perhaps a change not in the receptor but in the coactivators is required to make the switch from one complex to another. However, what might cause that switch is completely unknown at this point..

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	8	In an attempt to answer some of these questions, we examined the interaction between an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4, NR2A1) and the DRIP complex. HNF4 is a somewhat unusual receptor in that it activates transcription in a constitutive fashion (i.e. in the absence of exogenously added ligand). HNF4, a highly conserved member of the superfamily, is critical to early development and is directly linked to several human diseases including diabetes and hemophilia (reviewed in Ref. 9). Whereas an endogenous ligand has not yet been definitively identified for HNF4 (10, 11), we and others (12, 13, 14, 15, 16) have shown that HNF4 interacts with coactivators GRIP1 and p300/CBP in the absence of added ligand and that transactivation by HNF4 is completely dependent upon the AF-2..

The results indicate that the HNF4 LBD pulled down a complex that was similar but not identical with that pulled down by the VDR LBD in the presence of its ligand, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3; Fig. 2A, top, compare lane 4 with lane 2]. Immunoblot analysis indicated that DRIP205, DRIP130, and, to a lesser extent, DRIP150 were present in the HNF4 complex (Fig. 2A, bottom panels, lane 4). Transient cotransfection analyses verified that the interaction with the DRIP complex is a functional one. Transfected DRIP205 wild type (DRIP205.wt) stimulated the ability of HNF41 to activate a reporter gene in the absence of added ligand 4.7-fold (Fig. 2B, compare lane 4 with lane 3). Removal of the region C terminal to the LBD, the F domain, resulted in a greater degree of stimulation by DRIP205 (6.1-fold; lanes 7 and 8), just as was found previously for GRIP1 and CBP (12). The AF-2 was required for the stimulation by DRIP205.wt, as it was for all other transactivation activity (lanes 5 and 6)..

We found that under these conditions the DRIP205.wt could indeed interact with the HNF4 LBD but that the addition of the cell extracts was not required for the effect, only the addition of the extract buffer (data not shown). Because the most unusual components of the nuclear extraction buffer were the positively charged polyamines spermine and spermidine, we tested them in the pull-down assay. We found that physiological concentrations of spermine (1 mM) markedly enhanced the interaction between 35S-labeled DRIP205.wt and the HNF4 LBD, from 1.5% to 22%, but had only a negligible affect on background binding to the GST control (Fig. 3B, compare arrow in lane 5 with lane 3, and lane 4 with lane 2). Less spermine (0.1 mM) resulted in less binding (3.5%), indicating a dose effect (lane 7). Interestingly, truncated 35S-labeled DRIP205 products present in the lysate bound relatively well to the HNF4 LBD, irrespective of the addition of spermine (lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, bracket). Similar effects were observed with spermidine although to a lesser degree (data not shown)..

We found that physiological concentrations of spermine (1 mM) markedly enhanced the interaction between 35S-labeled DRIP205.wt and the HNF4 LBD, from 1.5% to 22%, but had only a negligible affect on background binding to the GST control (Fig. 3B, compare arrow in lane 5 with lane 3, and lane 4 with lane 2). Less spermine (0.1 mM) resulted in less binding (3.5%), indicating a dose effect (lane 7). Interestingly, truncated 35S-labeled DRIP205 products present in the lysate bound relatively well to the HNF4 LBD, irrespective of the addition of spermine (lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, bracket). Similar effects were observed with spermidine although to a lesser degree (data not shown)..
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	26	In investigating the nature of the effect of spermine on the HNF4-DRIP205 interaction, we found several properties that suggest that the effect is a specific one. For example, spermine did not enhance binding of DRIP205.wt to a GST HNF4 fusion construct lacking the AF-2 (C360), indicating that the AF-2 is required (Fig. 4A, top panel, compare lane 6 with lane 3). Spermine also only marginally affected the ability of the HNF4 LBD to interact with another protein, namely 35S-labeled HNF41 (Fig. 4A, bottom panel, compare lane 7 with lane 4; 1.4-fold effect vs. an 8.3-fold effect on binding DRIP205), and this effect did not require the presence of the AF-2 (compare lane 6 with lane 3). The effect of spermine also required the presence of the NR boxes of DRIP205 as pull-downs with the full-length DRIP205 containing mutations in the two NR boxes (DRIP205.mut) were not affected by the addition of spermine (Fig. 4B, middle panel, compare lane 7 with lane 4). Likewise, interaction with a small region of DRIP205, which encompasses just the NR boxes (DRIP205.box), was not greatly affected by the addition of spermine (compare lane 7 with lane 4, bottom panel). These results indicate that whereas the effect of spermine was dependent on the presence of the AF-2 and the NR boxes, it was not due to an increased interaction between just these two regions. This is not surprising in that spermine is a charged molecule and the AF-2-NR box interaction is primarily a hydrophobic one..

Because other coactivators have been found to interact with the DNA binding domain (DBD) of nuclear receptors (23, 24), we sought to determine whether DRIP205 might also interact with the HNF4 DBD and whether that interaction was affected by the addition of spermine. Whereas the HNF4 DBD bound remarkably well to both the wt DRIP205 (67%) and the DRIP205 containing the mutated NR boxes (54.5%; Fig. 4B, top and middle panels, lane 3), spermine greatly decreased both of those interactions (lane 6). In contrast, the isolated DRIP205 NR box did not bind well to the HNF4 DBD either in the absence or presence of spermine (bottom panel, lanes 3 and 6). Whereas it is possible that the decrease in binding of the full-length DRIP205 to the HNF4 DBD is not related to the increased in binding to the LBD, it is equally possible that the two effects are related. For example, spermine could induce a conformational change in DRIP205.wt that causes a decrease in the interaction with the HNF4 DBD and an increase in the interaction with the LBD, perhaps as a result of increased access to the NR boxes. Such a conformational change could also explain why the HNF4 LBD binds the truncated DRIP205 products better than the full-length DRIP205 and why that binding is not affected by spermine to in the truncated products, the NR boxes may already be fully accessible (Fig. 3B)..

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	41	In Vivo Evidence of a Role for Polyamines in Activated Transcription To determine whether the effects of spermine seen in vitro also played a role in vivo, the transient transfection assay was performed in the presence of a specific inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, -difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), which is known to decrease the levels of intracellular polyamines such as spermidine and spermine by blocking the activity of ornithine decarboxylase (Ref. 25 and Fig. 6A). A 24-h treatment with DFMO reduced the intracellular levels of both spermidine and spermine in the 293T cells (to 37% and 77%, respectively; Fig. 6B), and decreased the HNF41-mediated transcription by nearly 50% (Fig. 6C, top, compare lane 3 with lane 1 and lane 4 with lane 2). The effect on the HNF41-mediated transcription appeared to be specific in that DFMO slightly increased the level of background transcription from the reporter construct but did not decrease the HNF41 protein levels as evidenced by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6C, bottom, compare lane 3 with lane 2). Because the addition of polyamines to a gel shift reaction decreased the ability of HNF41 to bind DNA in vitro (Seidel, S., and F. M. Sladek, unpublished data), it is unlikely that the decrease in HNF4-mediated transcription in the DFMO-treated cells is due to a decrease in DNA binding. Rather, the results suggest that blocking synthesis of polyamines such as spermine specifically decreased the ability of HNF41 to activate transcription..

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	46	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   In the current study, we show for the first time that the orphan receptor HNF4 interacts with a complex containing DRIP proteins in vitro and responds to DRIP205 in vivo in the absence of exogenously added ligand (Fig. 2). We also show that full-length in vitro-translated DRIP205.wt does not interact well with the HNF4 LBD unless the polyamine spermine is added to the reaction (Fig. 3). The enhancement by spermine appears to be specific in that it was dependent on the presence of the AF-2 of HNF4 and the NR boxes of DRIP205 (Fig. 4). Spermine also enhanced the interaction of DRIP205 with the VDR LBD but decreased the interaction with the HNF4 DBD (Fig. 4). An in vivo role for spermine in activated transcription was observed when the specific inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, DFMO, decreased HNF41-mediated transcription but not basal transcription (Fig. 6). Finally, spermine decreased the interaction of both HNF4 and VDR with coactivator GRIP1, and GRIP1 synergized with DRIP205 in vivo to activate HNF4-mediated transcription (Fig. 5). We and others (5, 6, 7, 26, 27) have proposed previously that the p160 and p300 coactivators and the DRIP complex act in a sequential fashion. Our current work supports that model and allows us to propose a mechanism by which this might occur to namely, that polyamines may play a role in switching from one coactivator complex to the other (Fig. 7)..

Perhaps one of the most intriguing, if elusive, roles of polyamines is in the regulation of gene expression. Polyamines are implicated in the formation of higher order chromosomal fibers, facilitating condensation of chromatin fragments and interacting specifically with nucleosome core particles and DNA (31). Whereas this would suggest that an increase in polyamine levels would globally repress transcription, in fact it results in an increase in expression of many genes (32), suggesting that polyamines regulate gene expression by additional mechanisms.

Our data also show that the polyamine spermine can decrease the binding of at least two different nuclear receptors to GRIP1 (Fig. 5A) and can increase the binding to DRIP205 (Figs. 3 and 4), suggesting that polyamines may play a role in that switch. Support for that role in vivo is observed when blocking the biosynthesis of polyamines resulted in a decrease in HNF4-mediated transcription (Fig. 6). If polyamines were acting at the level of chromatin only, and not at the level of coactivators, then one would expect a decrease in polyamine levels to decondense the chromatin and result in an increase, not a decrease, in transcription. Therefore, the in vivo as well as the in vitro results suggest that polyamines may play a role in transcription activation other than altering the state of the chromatin. However, it must be noted that other interpretations of the in vivo data are possible and that additional experiments are required to definitively prove that polyamines modulate the synergy between GRIP1 and DRIP205 in vivo..

One is how do polyamines affect binding of coactivators to activators? Whereas the mechanism is not known, our results suggest that it is not due to a simple enhancement of the interaction between the AF-2 of the nuclear receptors and the NR boxes of DRIP205 (Fig. 4). Rather, because truncated DRIP205 products bound the HNF4 LBD equally well in the presence and absence of spermine (Fig. 3), we favor a model in which polyamines induce a conformational change in DRIP205 that exposes otherwise buried NR boxes. There is at least one example already of a conformational change in a coactivator that is important for its function (33). Another important question is where do the polyamines come from? Most of the polyamines in the cell are not free but are bound to negatively charged molecules such as chromatin (28, 29, 30). Because others have shown that the hyperacetylation of histones inhibits the ability of polyamines to condense the chromatin (31), it is possible that acetylation of histones by coactivators such as p300 or p300/CBP-associated factor may also cause a release of polyamines from the chromatin. If this were the case, then upon activator binding DNA and recruiting a HAT-containing coactivator complex, there would be an increase in the local polyamine concentration that could then mediate the switch from the HAT-containing complex to the DRIP complex. Some evidence already exists that polyamine levels can affect histone acetylation by influencing the action of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases (32). Finally, an attractive feature of the model is that it could apply not only to nuclear receptors but to any transcriptional activator that recruits both HAT-containing coactivators and the DRIP/TRAP/ARC/mediator complex, of which there are several examples (4, 7)..

Finally, an attractive feature of the model is that it could apply not only to nuclear receptors but to any transcriptional activator that recruits both HAT-containing coactivators and the DRIP/TRAP/ARC/mediator complex, of which there are several examples (4, 7)..

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	3	Hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is a transcription factor whose expression is crucial for mouse embryonic development, for liver-specific gene expression and for the prevention of one form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young. Its domain structure has been defined previously and is similar to other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. A repressor domain has now been localised to a region of 14 amino acids (residues 428-441) near the C-terminus of HNF4 and is sufficient by itself to repress the activity of the activation function 2 (AF2) domain. Multiple mutations within this repressor domain enhance activity. Interestingly, this repressor domain shares homology with a repressor domain in the progesterone receptor. In a detailed mutagenesis study of the AF2 core, we demonstrate that L 366, which is conserved in the AF2 core between HNF4 and a number of orphan nuclear receptors, is essential for the full activity of the AF2 domain. Furthermore, a double mutation of E 363 and L 366 suggests that these residues might act in a cooperative manner..

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	7	Extensive work carried out on nuclear receptors (e.g. oestrogen and retinoic acid receptors) has shown that they have a modular structure, with distinct regions carrying out specific functions (2). The N-terminal region (A/B) contains an activation function 1 (AF1) whose activity can be cell-type as well as promoter-context specific (3). A highly conserved zinc finger domain, required for DNA binding, is present in region C, with region D acting as a hinge (2). The C-terminal half of these receptors contains a long hydrophobic domain (region E), which encodes various functions. These include receptor dimerisation, ligand binding and a ligand-dependent activation function 2 (AF2) (2). The AF2 domain contains a core region of seven amino acids [Phi][Phi][KHgr]a[Phi][Phi]a/L (where `[Phi]' is a hydrophobic residue, `[KHgr]' any residue, `a' an acidic residue and L = leucine) which is critical for activation and is conserved in many nuclear receptors (4). The extreme C-terminal region of these receptors (region F) varies in length between receptors and its function is unknown. In HNF4, this region is extended and contains a proline-rich domain (1)..

There are a number of isoforms generated by alternative splicing (5). For example, the HNF4[alpha] gene in humans encodes three isoforms, [alpha]1, [alpha] 2 and [alpha]4. There is, in addition, a distinct [gamma] subtype encoded by the HNF4[gamma] gene (5). The rat HNF4 isoforms 1-455 and 1-465 are equivalent to human [alpha]1 and [alpha]2 respectively (1,6). In Xenopus laevis, HNF4 is encoded by two distinct ([alpha] and [beta]) genes (7)..

In the regulation of the factor IX gene, point mutations which disrupt an HNF4 binding site result in haemophilia B (9,10). Recently, heterozygotes carrying mutations in the HNF4[alpha] allele were linked to one form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY1) (11). HNF4 is also involved in the regulation of a number of genes required for both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as well as erythropoiesis (1,12). These genes include apolipoprotein CIII, pyruvate kinase, [alpha]1-antitrypsin and erythropoietin..

To monitor transfection efficiency, the internal control plasmid pGLtkLUC (16) was used. The plasmid pGAL4 1-147 (17) contains the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the yeast GAL4 protein driven by the immediate-early human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The GAL4-HNF4 full-length fusion constructs, and all C-terminal deletion constructs of HNF4 were constructed by PCR amplification of the appropriate fragment of HNF4 derived from the plasmid, pCB6HNF4 (16), using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene).

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	27	Analysis of the amino acid sequence of rat HNF4 identified a consensus amino acid sequence ([Phi][Phi][KHgr]a[Phi][Phi]a/L, amino acid residues 360-366) found in a number of orphan and ligand nuclear receptors (Fig. 1). This conserved sequence, known as the activation function 2 (AF2) core, is known to form an amphipathic [alpha]-helix required for ligand-dependent activation of nuclear receptors, e.g. RAR[gamma] (18). The sequence alignment (Fig. 1) revealed that the Leu at position 366 (the last residue in the AF2 core) in HNF4 is conserved in a number of orphan receptors (Fig. 1, underlined L), whereas an acidic residue (an E or D) is found at the corresponding position in a number of nuclear receptors with known ligands. In addition, the extreme C-terminal region of HNF4, specifically amino acids 400-447, is rich in proline residues and was previously proposed to contain a proline-rich activation domain (1)..

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	30	In order to determine if the proline-rich region contained an activation domain, and establish the role of the conserved amino acid sequence between 360 and 366, GAL4-HNF4 fusion proteins were constructed with successive 15 amino acid deletions from the C-terminus of HNF4 up to residue 366 (Fig. 2A). Unexpectedly, deletions up to residue 381 produced fusion proteins with higher activities than the full-length fusion protein in both HeLa and HepG2 cells (Fig. 2B, F 1-440 to F 1-380). For example, the activity of deletion F 1-410 was three and half times that of the full-length fusion protein in HeLa cells. However, when amino acids 366-380 were deleted (Fig. 2B, F 1-365) the activity decreased to 12% of full-length fusion protein. These results suggested there was a repressor domain spanning residues 380-455. However, there was no evidence of a proline-rich activation domain between residues 400 and 447 as previously suggested (1). The fact that transactivation was reduced to near background level when residues 366-380 were deleted suggested that Leu 366, conserved in a number of orphan receptors and the last residue in the consensus sequence [Phi][Phi][KHgr]a[Phi][Phi]a/L (Fig. 1), is important. To exclude the possibility that the increased activities of the C-terminal deletion fusions was due to higher levels of protein expression in some constructs than others, a gel mobility shift assay was carried out as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in Figure 3, gel shifted fusion complexes of all constructs were present in comparable amounts, with insufficient variation in yield to account for the difference in activity observed in Figure 2. Thus, no further gel shift analysis of protein levels was carried out on further constructs in this report..

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	32	To identify the critical residue(s) in the region between residues 359 and 380, fusion proteins with deletions at three amino acid intervals between residues 359 and 380 were constructed and tested in the transient transfection assay in HeLa cells (Fig. 4). Deleting amino acids 369-380 had no effect on the activity of the C-terminal activation domain (Fig. 4B, compare F 1-380 and F 1-368). Deleting the next three amino acids, 366-368, resulted in a significant decrease in activity to background level (Fig. 4B, F 1-365). Two further deletions, F 1-362 and F 1-359, also had background activity. We conclude that the region between amino acids 365 and 368 is critical for transactivation. Leu (L) 366 is the last amino acid residue in the proposed amphipathic [alpha]-helix formed by the AF2 core (Fig, 1; 18) and thus may be an important residue..

All mutations at L366 resulted in decreased activity compared to wild type GAL4-DBD-HNF4 fusion protein or native HNF4 (Fig. 5B and D). In the context of native HNF4 (Fig. 5D), the activity of mutant L 366 I (which of all the mutants differed least in activity from the wild-type), was still statistically significantly different (P  <  0.01) from wild-type in a z value test (Materials and Methods). When the activities of mutants 366 A and Q were compared to that of mutant 366 I, they were also found to be statistically significantly different(P  <  0.01 in both cases).

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	37	Position 4 (E 363 in HNF4) of the consensus AF2 core is an acidic residue in both orphan and nuclear receptors with known ligands (Fig. 1). From the crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of RAR[gamma] bound to all-trans retinoic acid, this position is critical for the formation of a salt bridge between helix 4 and 12 (18), essential for AF2 activity. Thus, we investigated the point mutant 363 E->A in HNF4 in the context of both a GAL4-HNF4 fusion protein (Fig. 5B) and in native HNF4 (Fig. 5D). Transactivation was statistically significantly lower than that of the wild-type fusion protein in both cases (P  <  0.001 and P  <  0.0001, respectively). These results indicate that the E at 363 is also important for full transactivation..

Unexpectedly, the activity of the double mutant was comparable to that of the single mutants at either position (Fig. 5B, F E363A/L366A compared to F L366A or F E363A), suggesting that E363 and L366 may act cooperatively in regulating the activity of the AF2 domain. The AF2 activity of HNF4 is regulated by a repressor domain near the C-terminus.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	39	A repressor domain near the C-terminus of the progesterone receptor (PR) was recently shown to inhibit the activity of PR in the absence of progesterone (19). Alignment of the PR repressor domain sequence (residues 917-928) with the entire HNF4 protein sequence identified a potential 12 amino acid long sequence homology (Fig. 6A, boxed region) near the C-terminus of HNF4 (residues 430-441). This potential repressor region showed 40% identity to the sequence of the repressor domain of PR, which is also near its C-terminus. This homology and our previous results defining a repressor domain between residues 380 and 455 (see above), prompted us to investigate the effect of fusing a short region of HNF4 containing residues 430-441 downstream of a high activity C-terminal deletion mutant. Thus, when a 14-long peptide (residues 428-441) of HNF4 was fused in-frame downstream of GAL4-HNF4 1-372 (Fig. 6B), its activity was reduced from 300 to 22% of the full-length fusion protein [Fig. 6C, compare F 1-372+428-441 to F 1-455 (P  <  0.001)]. This suggested the peptide 428-441 may function as a repressor domain in isolation..

Two constructs with multiple point mutations (a run of five or six alanine residues) in the proposed repressor domain (Fig. 6A) were constructed (Fig. 7A). The activity of the N-terminal mutant [YKLLPG->AAAAAA, (427-432)] increased 2.3 times when compared to the wild-type full-length fusion (Fig. 7B). The C-terminal mutation [ITTIV->AAAAA, (434-438)] showed an increase in activity which was 3.5 times that of the wild-type full-length fusion protein (Fig. 7B). Both mutants are significantly different from wild-type (P  <  0.01). These results confirm the presence of a repressor domain between amino acids 428 and 441..

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	45	In this report we have studied the C-terminal activation region of HNF4, concentrating our attention on two short regions. These are firstly, the well-known AF2 core, which is conserved in nuclear receptors (4) and secondly, a novel short repressor domain. These regions were studied either by deletion analysis or by site-directed mutagenesis of HNF4 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Cotransfection of such fusion constructs with a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter plasmid containing upstream GAL4 binding sites into either HeLa or HepG2 cells transiently, was used to study the activities of the deleted or mutated constructs (Materials and Methods)..

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	47	Previous studies of the C-terminal activation domain of HNF4 suggested that the AF2 core (residues 360-366) was important for activity (12-14). Furthermore, a mutation of L366->E, in an HNF4 deletion fusion construct (amino acids 128-370) suggested that residue 366 was important for the activity of the AF2 domain (14). However, this result is preliminary because it was studied on a HNF4 deletion construct which lacked three essential domains, the N-terminal AF1 domain, the DNA binding domain and the C-terminal repressor domain (see below). It is arguable that the results might not be typical of intact HNF4. Another potential criticism of a previous study (14) is that the conclusions as to the importance of particular amino acid residues of the AF2 core particular were based on studies of a single point mutant at each position, 363 and 366, which might not be representative had other mutants been studied. Here we set out to study multiple mutations at position 366 of the AF2 core and to study a double mutant involving both positions 363 and 366 to gain further insight into the role of the AF2 core..

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	49	The results of successive C-terminal deletions (Fig. 2) and fine deletion mapping (Fig. 4) initially suggested that L366 might be important for the activity of the C-terminal AF2 domain. Therefore, four different point mutations (L->A, D, Q or I) were constructed to definitively assess the role of L 366 in both full-length HNF4 (Fig. 5C and D) and GAL4 full-length HNF4 fusion constructs (Fig. 5A and B). All mutations decreased the transactivation activity, indicating that Leu 366 is required for full activity. However, in contrast to a previous report where the activity of a mutant at 366 was reduced to [sim]5% of wild-type, we detected activities varying from [sim]35 to 75% of wild-type. This suggested, surprisingly, that transactivation activity is not absolutely dependent on Leu 366, even although it is conserved in a number of orphan receptors (Fig. 1). Other residues e.g. A, D, Q and I were clearly functional at least in our transient transactivation assay. This result is not an artefact of the fusion of intact HNF4 to the GAL4 DNA binding domain, since essentially similar quantitative results were obtained irrespective of whether full-length HNF4, or full-length HNF4 fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain, were studied (compare Fig. 5B and D). However, the fact that a conservative amino acid substitution 366 (L->I) showed the highest activity in our assay ([sim]60-70%), whereas non-conservative amino acid substitutions 366 (L->A, D, Q) showed lower activities (35-60%) still argues for the functional importance of Leu at 366 (Fig. 5)..

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	51	E363 is also highly conserved between HNF4 and all nuclear receptors with known ligands, although it is substituted by a D in some orphan receptors (Fig. 1). E363 was selected for mutation because it is known to be involved in the formation of a salt-bridge and is critical for transactivation in RAR[gamma] (18). Mutation of E363->A in HNF4 here (Fig. 5) indicated that this residue, like residue 366, was required for full activity. Our result at this position differed from a previous report (where activity was reduced to  < 5% of wild-type; 14) in that significant residual activity was observed (between 50 and 70% of wild-type; Fig. 5C and D) depending on whether with the full-length HNF4 construct or the GAL4 full-length HNF4 fusion construct was used in the transactivation assay. We attribute this difference to the fact that full-length HNF4 was used in our studies, whereas HNF4 deletion constructs were used in the previous report (14)..
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	52	It is significant that a double mutant of 363 and 366 also retained [sim]50% activity in our assay (Fig. 5). The fact that the double mutant failed to demonstrate an additive effect over and above that of the two point mutants assayed separately is consistent with E363 and L366 cooperating to regulate the activity of the AF2 domain. These experiments illustrates both the importance of E363 and L366 of the AF2 core, yet also demonstrate the core is partly redundant at least in our transactivation assay. It remains possible that the redundancy observed in the mutations studied here results from a compensatory effect of the AF1 domain, which is known to transactivate (14) and is present in our full-length HNF4 constructs..
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	53	Our initial C-terminal deletion experiments suggested the presence of a repressor activity within residues 380-455 (Fig. 2B, and previously proposed to lie between residues 371 and 455; 14). By aligning the amino acid sequence of the PR repressor domain (19) with the entire HNF4 sequence, a short region (residues 430-441) showing 40% identity to a previously characterised repressor domain in PR was localised in HNF4 (Fig. 6A). This presumptive repressor domain was first shown to confer repressor activity by itself (Fig. 6C). Thus, when a short peptide from amino acid 428 to 441 containing the HNF4 repressor domain was fused in-frame downstream of a high activity C-terminal deletion fusion construct, transactivation was severely inhibited, decreasing from >300 to 22%. This is unlikely to be the result of decreased protein expression of this particular fusion construct, since a gel shift analysis of a panel of deletion constructs all showed reasonably similar levels of protein expression (Fig. 3) This implied that the peptide containing amino acids 428-441 was sufficient, by itself, to act as a repressor. Further evidence for this repressor domain came from a study of two constructs with multiple point mutations (Fig. 7C)..

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	55	It is interesting to note that in the experiment where the isolated repressor domain was fused to F 1-372 (Fig. 6B), the AF2 core was intact; hence an activity closer to the that of the full-length fusion (100%) might have been expected, whereas an activity of 22% was observed (Fig. 6C). This suggests the repressor domain had a more potent inhibitory effect when fused closer to the AF2 core, than if it were in its normal location. Perhaps the close proximity of the repressor domain to the AF2 core may restrict the accessibility of potential coactivator proteins to the AF2 core, either by binding a corepressor protein or simply by masking critical residues in the AF2 core. In the case of the PR repressor domain, the repressor domain was shown to mediate its function through an unknown corepressor (19). Experiments in an attempt to determine if the HNF4 repressor domain functioned through a corepressor were unfortunately inconclusive (data not shown)..

An attractive, but speculative mechanism might involve the phosphorylation of threonine residues in the sequence ITTI (residues 434-437). A corepressor might bind to the repressor domain in the phosphorylated state and dissociate in the dephosphorylated state. Thus mutations which disrupt these threonine residues would prevent phosphorylation, thus preventing repression and thereby enhancing the activity of HNF4..

We have localised this repressor domain to within amino acid residues 428-441 of HNF4, and showed it was necessary and sufficient for repressor activity in transient transfection studies in HeLa cells. Furthermore, multiple point mutations within this repressor domain in the context of the full-length HNF4 fusion construct abolished repressor activity.

Tangential migration has been shown to contribute significantly to the generation of neuronal diversity in the mammalian telencephalon. GABAergic interneurons are the best-characterized neurons that migrate tangentially, from the ventral telencephalon, dorsally into the cortex. However, the molecular mechanisms and nature of these migratory pathways are only just beginning to be unravelled. In this study we have first identified a novel dorsal-to-ventral migratory route, in which cells migrate from the interganglionic sulcus, located in the basal telencephalon between the lateral and medial ganglionic eminences, towards the pre-optic area and anterior hypothalamus in the diencephalon. Next, with the help of transplantations and gain-of-function studies in organotypic cultures, we have shown that COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII are expressed in distinct and non-overlapping migratory routes. Ectopic expression of COUP-TFs induces an increased rate of cell migration and cell dispersal, suggesting roles in cellular adhesion and migration processes. Moreover, cells follow a distinct migratory path, dorsal versus ventral, which is dependent on the expression of COUP-TFI or COUP-TFII, suggesting an intrinsic role of COUP-TFs in guiding migrating neurons towards their target regions. Therefore, we propose that COUP-TFs are directly involved in tangential cell migration in the developing brain, through the regulation of short- and long-range guidance cues..

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	7	   Introduction TOP SUMMARY Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion Conclusions REFERENCES   It is well recognized that both radial and tangential migration contribute significantly to neuronal diversity within the telencephalon (reviewed by Marin and Rubenstein, 2003). Projection neurons originate in the ventricular zone of the cortical anlage (pallium) and migrate radially to form the developing cortex, while GABAergic interneurons originate in restricted regions of the ventricular zone of the subcortical telencephalon (subpallium) and migrate tangentially to reach their final destination, in defined telencephalic regions. Within the subpallium, the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) appears to be the major source of cortical interneurons (Anderson et al., 2001; Jimenez et al., 2002; Marin et al., 2000; Wichterle et al., 2001). Furthermore, it has been shown in vivo that neurons that derive from the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) and the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) contribute to the generation of projection neurons in the striatum and GABAergic interneurons in the cortex, respectively (Nery et al., 2002; Wichterle et al., 2001). Although there is an overlap in the structures populated by neurons originating from all three ganglionic eminences (GEs), the nuclei derived from the progeny of each eminence are distinct and can vary in their neurochemical profiles (Nery et al., 2002). As a further source of cellular diversity, the anterior entopeduncular area, which is located between the MGE and the hypothalamus, contributes to the generation of oligodendrocytes in the cortex and hippocampus (He et al., 2001). Therefore, interneurons and oligodendrocytes appear to follow a mainly ventral-to-dorsal migratory route before reaching their target tissues, and it is not known whether these cells can also migrate in a dorsal-to-ventral direction. The identification of other migratory pathways, such as the gangliothalamic body connecting the GEs with the thalamus (Letinic and Kostovic, 1997; Rakic and Sidman, 1969), and the rostral migratory stream between the LGE and the olfactory bulb (Altman, 1969; Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, 1994; Luskin, 1993), makes it plausible that the GEs generate neurons directed to other embryonic brain regions besides the dorsal telencephalon..
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	8	   Introduction TOP SUMMARY Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion Conclusions REFERENCES   It is well recognized that both radial and tangential migration contribute significantly to neuronal diversity within the telencephalon (reviewed by Marin and Rubenstein, 2003). Projection neurons originate in the ventricular zone of the cortical anlage (pallium) and migrate radially to form the developing cortex, while GABAergic interneurons originate in restricted regions of the ventricular zone of the subcortical telencephalon (subpallium) and migrate tangentially to reach their final destination, in defined telencephalic regions. Within the subpallium, the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) appears to be the major source of cortical interneurons (Anderson et al., 2001; Jimenez et al., 2002; Marin et al., 2000; Wichterle et al., 2001). Furthermore, it has been shown in vivo that neurons that derive from the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) and the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) contribute to the generation of projection neurons in the striatum and GABAergic interneurons in the cortex, respectively (Nery et al., 2002; Wichterle et al., 2001).

Contact guidance relies on a permissive environment, on which gradients of diffusible guidance molecules can be superimposed, to achieve directional migration. However, the distribution and molecular nature of short- and long-range molecules, and the substratum that interneurons use in their migration towards the cortex, are poorly understood. Motogenic factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor and the neurotrophin molecules BDNF and NT4, have been shown to influence the numbers of cells migrating away from the subpallium (Polleux et al., 2002; Powell et al., 2001). Guidance molecules with repulsive and attractive activities are likely to be involved in guiding migrating cells from the subpallium to the pallium, and within the subpallium (Marin et al., 2003; Wichterle et al., 2003). For the substratum, one report has shown that blocking the function of the TAG1 adhesion molecule results in a marked reduction in GABAergic neurons in the cortex (Denaxa et al., 2001). However, in Tag1 mutant mice, there is no major alteration in the tangential migration of interneurons (Marin and Rubenstein, 2003), and treatment of cortical slices with phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), an enzyme that cleaves GPI-anchored proteins, such as TAG1, does not alter interneuron migration (Tanaka et al., 2003). Therefore, nothing is known about the nature of short-range guidance contact cues involved in tangential migration..

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	11	The nuclear orphan receptor COUP-TFI favours migration of neurons through an integrin-dependent mechanism in cell cultures (Adam et al., 2000). Overexpression of COUP-TFI in retinoic-acid-treated neuronal aggregates coated with different cell substrata, such as polylysine, laminin or fibronectin, results in a higher rate of migration compared with controls, whereas overexpression of a mutated form of COUP-TFI has no effects on cell migration. Moreover, increased levels of vitronectin, an extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule involved in neurite extension, motor neuron differentiation and possibly neuronal migration, are detected both in aggregate and monolayer cell cultures after overexpression of COUP-TFI. This, and the data that show that COUP-TFI stimulates transcription from the vitronectin promoter in vitro, strongly suggests a role of COUP-TFI in the regulation of ECM synthesis during the process of neuronal migration. Although COUP-TFI has been shown to be involved in cortical regionalization and axon pathfinding in the developing telencephalon (Zhou et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2001), its role in promoting cell migration in vivo has not been established so far..

Moreover, expression of COUP-TFI in the cortex co-localizes with the GABAergic marker calbindin, suggesting that a subpopulation of COUP-TFI-positive cells in the cortex are GABAergic interneurons. With the help of transplantation and tracing techniques in organotypic slice cultures, we first show the presence of a dorsal-to-ventral migratory pathway that originates in the region of the interganglionic sulcus. We then demonstrate that COUP-TFI is expressed in the basal telencephalon in neurons not only migrating dorsally towards the cortex, but also ventrally towards the pre-optic area (POa) and the hypothalamus. Finally, by ectopic expression of COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII in the GEs, we show an increased rate of migrating cells. While COUP-TFI appears to control dorsal and ventral migration in the basal telencephalon, COUP-TFII is more specific in modulating tangential migration into the intermediate zone of the cortex, suggesting distinct functions of COUP-TFs in regulating cell migration in the developing forebrain..

To test this hypothesis, we used an antibody against calbindin that labels a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons. At E13.5, the majority of calbindin-positive cells co-labelled with COUP-TFI-positive cells in the neocortex and piriform cortex (Fig. 2A,B), but not with COUP-TFII-positive cells (Fig. 2D,E). Similar results were obtained with an anti-GABA antibody (data not shown). Thus, in the marginal zone of the cortex, GABAergic neurons are positive for COUP-TFI and negative for COUP-TFII. To assess whether COUP-TFII-positive cells in the marginal zone were rather Cajal-Retzius cells, we used an antibody against reelin. All COUP-TFII-positive cells co-expressed reelin (Fig. 2F), whereas no COUP-TFI-positive cells were positive for reelin in the cortex (Fig. 2C). At E13.5 and E15.5 co-localization of COUP-TFII and reelin was also detected in the caudomedial wall of the telencephalic vesicles (Fig. 2G,H), which has been recently described as one of the sources of Cajal-Retzius cells (Takiguchi-Hayashi et al., 2004). This is not the case for COUP-TFI, in which no co-expression of COUP-TFI and reelin has ever been detected in this region (Fig. 2I)..

It is now well established that the GEs are the major source of most neocortical interneurons (reviewed by Corbin et al., 2001; Marin and Rubenstein, 2001). Therefore, to assess whether COUP-TFI-positive cells located in the basal telencephalon are interneurons migrating to the cortex, a series of grafts from the GEs of E13.5 GFP-expressing transgenic brain slices were homotopically transplanted into wild-type E13.5 brains (n=27) (Fig. 3A); expression of COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII was subsequently monitored in adjacent sections of the same slices. An example of an MLGE graft is shown in Fig. 3B, which demonstrates the fate of fluorescent cells after 60 hours of incubation, at which point GFP-positive cells were distributed in the mantle layer of the basal telencephalon and in various layers of the cortex. High magnification of the lateral and medial cortex showed that GFP-positive cells were present in the marginal and intermediate zones (Fig. 3C,F). Interestingly, some GFP-positive cells were also present in deeper layers, with a radial orientation towards the surface of the cortex (arrows in Fig. 3C-E). These cells were previously reported to migrate from the marginal zone to the ventricular zone before moving radially, to take up their positions in the cortical anlage (Nadarajah et al., 2002). After double labelling with anti-COUP-TFI, 75% of the GFP-positive cells (n=250) were also positive for COUP-TFI, including the ventricle-directed cells (Fig. 3E). Adjacent sections of the same grafted brain slices showed no co-localization of COUP-TFII and GFP (Fig. 3H). This is in agreement with the observation that COUP-TFII-positive cells in the cortex are non-GABAergic, and therefore do not originate from the basal telencephalon. Thus, our data confirm that COUP-TFI in the cortex is expressed in GABAergic interneurons originating from the subpallium, whereas COUP-TFII expression has a pallial origin..

In some grafts, GFP-positive cells were also identified in the POa (Fig. 4B), suggesting that cells deriving from the interganglionic region migrate in various directions: dorsally, laterally and ventrally. By double labelling GFP-positive cells with anti-COUP-TFI and anti-COUP-TFII antibodies, we found double-positive cells for COUP-TFI, but not for COUP-TFII, in this ventral migratory path (Fig. 4C,D). This suggests that a subpopulation of COUP-TFI-positive cells located in the POa/anterior hypothalamus might originate from the GEs. Furthermore, some of these migrating cells were neurons, as demonstrated by the double staining of GFP with the neuronal marker Tuj1 (Fig. 4E-E''). Finally, a subpopulation of COUP-TFI-positive cells in the ventral stream was positive for GABA (Fig. 4F), suggesting that some ventrally migrating cells are GABAergic interneurons..

GFP-positive cells located ventrally with respect to the injected side showed a leading process and co-labelled with COUP-TFI, but not with COUP-TFII (Fig. 4H, and data not shown).

To address this issue, we set up a functional assay in E13.5 brain slice cultures, in which we ectopically expressed COUP-TFI in the GEs at different dorso-ventral and antero-posterior locations. The migrating cells were followed after 60 hours of incubation. On one side, and as a control, we injected a construct expressing GFP under the control of a CMV promoter, while on the contralateral side, we injected a construct expressing COUP-TFI followed by an IRES-GFP sequence. In this way, we could follow the fate of the injected cells by following GFP fluorescence in the same slices (Fig. 6A). The histogram in Fig. 6B shows the average value of GFP-positive cells in the cortex and POa, expressed as a percentage of the total number of positive cells (for control 2838 cells, and for COUP-TFI 2318 cells; n=25; see also Materials and methods for details). In all the cases examined, the COUP-TFI-injected sides showed a statistically significant increase in the number of cells in the cortex, compared with the control side (Fig. 6B-D). Ventral migration was observed only in caudal sections in which the constructs were focally injected into the subventricular zone of the MLGE region (Fig. 6A). In controls, 24% and 17% of GFP-positive cells were scored on average in the cortex and in the POa, respectively (Fig. 6B), whereas the non-migrating cells were maintained in compact clusters next to the injection site. The injection of a CMV-COUP-TFI-IRES-GFP construct into the contralateral side of the same slices resulted in GFP-positive cells that were more dispersed in the mantle layer (arrowheads in Fig. 6D), and that were still in the process of migrating dorsally towards the marginal zone of the cortex and ventrally towards the POa (arrows in Fig. 6D). Moreover, a higher number of GFP-positive cells were scored in the cortex and in the POa (72% and 46%, respectively), compared with the control side. Thus, in the presence of higher levels of COUP-TFI, injected cells showed significantly increased spreading and migrating, compared with the normal situation (Fig. 6B), suggesting that COUP-TFI modulates cell migration in the basal telencephalon..

The control CMV-GFP- and CMV-COUP-TFII-IRES-GFP-expressing constructs were injected into the subventricular zone of the striatum on opposite sides of E13.5 brain slices (n=10) (Fig. 7A). The histogram in Fig. 7B shows that in the presence of ectopic expression of COUP-TFII, the average number of GFP-positive cells found in the cortex (60%, of a total number of 467 cells) was significantly higher than in the control situation (32%, of a total number of 875 cells). An example of an injection performed in the whole striatum is shown in Fig. 7C,D. As expected, a high number of GFP-positive cells migrated out of the injection point into the marginal and intermediate zones of the neocortex. After injection of the COUP-TFII-expressing construct, a statistically significant increase in the GFP-positive cells was found uniquely in the intermediate layer of the neocortex, and no GFP-positive cells were ever identified in the marginal zone (arrowheads and asterisk in Fig. 7D, respectively). However, and by contrast to previous experiments, no GFP-positive cells were ever located ventrally in the POa region, even if we focally injected the construct into the MLGE region (data not shown).

As this path originates from the interganglionic region at specific caudal levels, it is very likely that it has been missed in other studies using similar approaches (Anderson et al., 2001; Jimenez et al., 2002; Lavdas et al., 1999; Wichterle et al., 2001). The novelty of this path is twofold: first, cells migrate tangentially from dorsal to ventral, along the subventricular zone of the MGE, i.e. in opposite directions with respect to the MGE-derived cortical interneurons; and second, these cells exit the basal telencephalon and migrate into the basal diencephalon. These cells are different from the gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons, which originate in the olfactory placode and migrate along the vomeronasal nerve fibres until they reach the POa and hypothalamus (Wray et al., 1994; Yoshida et al., 1995). Migration of GABAergic neurons from the GEs to the dorsal thalamus has been observed in human brains; however, rodent embryos did not reveal a similar migratory pathway (Letinic and Rakic, 2001). With the help of retroviral cell tracing, Marin and collaborators (Marin et al., 2000) have shown that cells emanating from the MGE and the adjacent POa/anterior entopeduncular area express the transcription factor Nkx2.1 and migrate to the developing striatum, where they differentiate into local circuit neurons. It would be interesting to find out whether Nkx2.1 is also involved in the opposite migratory path described in this report..

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	59	Furthermore, we have shown that cells originating from the CGE migrate via different streams into the basal diencephalon, and in particular into the hypothalamus (Fig. 5B). As opposed to the MLGE transplant, in which the stream of ventrally migrating cells is quite compact, cells migrating out of the CGE take a medial and latero-ventral route. We do not know the fate of these ventrally migrating cells. In-vivo ultrasound-guided labelling or transplantation (Nery et al., 2002; Wichterle et al., 2001), in which total cortices are manipulated in toto and characterized at later stages, would help us to understand the final destinies of these migrating cells..
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	60	Is the basal telencephalon only chemorepulsive? Transplantation experiments and co-culture assays have shown that the POa and hypothalamic regions prevent interneurons from migrating in a ventral direction by secreting repulsive molecules that are responsible for the dorsal migration of interneurons towards the cortex (Marin et al., 2003; Wichterle et al., 2003). However, the cues mediating this action have not been identified yet. Here, we show that cells originating from more dorsal and caudal regions are capable of migrating ventrally towards the POa/anterior hypothalamus. How do we reconcile these different results? First, the previous studies showed that the majority of interneurons that originated from the MGE avoided migrating in ventral directions. This is what is expected for a circumscribed graft in a section where the two GEs are well separated (Marin et al., 2003) (data not shown). However, the dorsal-to-ventral cell migration that we describe in this report originates from a restricted region, the interganglionic sulcus, at more caudal levels. It is plausible that in order to follow the migration that originates in the MGE and LGE, this region was not included in other studies. Therefore, we hypothesize that cells originating from different rostrocaudal levels can have different responses to the same environment by expressing position-dependent receptors. Accordingly, COUP-TFs are not expressed in ventrally migrating cells at more rostral levels, where the two GEs are well separated (data not shown). Thus, the POa and hypothalamus can have different roles, repulsion versus attraction, according to the type of cells they encounter..
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	61	A novel role for COUP-TFs in neuronal migration in the developing forebrain COUP-TFs are orphan nuclear receptors of the steroid/thyroid superfamily shown to be involved in neurogenesis, axogenesis and neural differentiation (Park et al., 2003). In the cortex, COUP-TFI is mainly known for its role in regionalization and in guidance of thalamocortical projections (Zhou et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2001), whereas COUP-TFII is a fundamental player in angiogenesis and heart development (Pereira et al., 1999). In this report, we have provided the first insights into the functional roles of COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII in neuronal migration in vivo. In a previous report, it was shown that COUP-TFI could regulate cell adhesion mechanisms required for the differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells (Adam et al., 2000). Because of the substrates on which cells were plated, it was suggested that COUP-TFI could modify the synthesis of ECM molecules, making cells autonomous for migration and spreading. Our expression data in vivo and our functional data in organotypic cultures support these results in a context in which cell migration assumes a fundamental role in achieving neuronal diversity. By using these different approaches, we have first shown expression of COUP-TFs in highly motile neurons, such as GABAergic and reelin-positive cells (Fig. 2); we have then confirmed the co-localization of COUP-TFI in migrating neurons in a series of grafting experiments (Figs 3, 4, 5); and finally, we have directly demonstrated a role of COUP-TFs in modulating cell migration in a gain-of-function approach (Figs 6, 7). Our data also demonstrate that COUP-TFs can control directional migration. Indeed, cells expressing higher levels of COUP-TFs (and thus GFP) not only tend to spread and lose their aspect of aggregates, but also follow specific migratory pathways (dorsal and/or ventral) that are intrinsic to cells expressing COUP-TFs (Fig. 6, Fig. 7D)..
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	62	Therefore, we hypothesize a dual role for COUP-TFs. First, they should regulate short-range cues, such as ECM and/or adhesive molecules, and in this way modulate the neighbouring environment. Changes in a permissive environment would allow random dispersion of migratory cells. Indeed, in the absence of COUP-TFI, GABAergic cells do migrate into the cortex, although in a less organised fashion than in the normal situation (M.S., unpublished). Therefore, we favour the hypothesis that COUP-TFI is involved in modulating cell migration, more than inducing cells to initiate migration..

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	64	Second, we propose that COUP-TFs control diffusible guidance molecules, and/or their receptors, involved in cell migration. Indeed, ectopic expression of COUP-TFI led to the correct directional migration of the targeted cells, i.e. dorsal into the cortex and ventral into the POa (Fig. 6D), suggesting that cells over- or mis-expressing COUP-TFI were able to respond to COUP-TFI-dependent guidance cues. More striking is the behaviour of MGE-migrating cells after mis-expression of COUP-TFII. In this case, neurons that were committed to migrate into the marginal and intermediate layers of the neocortex (see control in Fig. 7C) migrated at higher rates solely into the intermediate layer, avoiding specifically the marginal layer (Fig. 7D), suggesting that COUP-TFII regulates guidance cues required for migration into the intermediate zone of the neocortex. This behaviour is in accordance with the COUP-TFII expression pattern and the grafting experiments described in this study. Indeed, COUP-TFII-positive cells in the marginal zone are Cajal-Retzius cells, as seen by the co-expression with reelin, and it is now well established that Cajal-Retzius cells originate exclusively from the pallium (Hevner et al., 2003; Meyer et al., 1999; Takiguchi-Hayashi et al., 2004)..

COUP-TFI has previously been reported to be required in axon guidance in the telencephalon and romboencephalon (Qiu et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 1999). Here, we show that COUP-TFs are involved in modulating the rates and directions of tangentially migrating cells from the basal telencephalon to the cortex, and from the basal telencephalon to the basal diencephalon. Interestingly, the cells follow a migratory path that is dependent on the expression of COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII, suggesting an intrinsic role for COUP-TFs in guiding migrating cells towards their target region.

0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) is involved in the final steps of aldosterone biosynthesis and expressed exclusively in the adrenal zona glomerulosa cells. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we demonstrate that COUP-TFI binds to the  to 129/ to 114 element (Ad5) of human CYP11B2 promoter. Transient transfection in H295R adrenal cells demonstrated that COUP-TFI enhanced CYP11B2 reporter activity. However, the reporter construct with mutated Ad5 sequences showed reduced basal and COUP-TFI-enhanced activity, suggesting that binding of COUP-TFI to Ad5 is important for CYP11B2 transactivation. To elucidate molecular mechanisms of COUP-TFI-mediated activity, we subsequently screened for COUP-TFI-interacting proteins from a human adrenal cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system and identified Ubc9 and PIAS1, which have small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1) conjugase and ligase activities, respectively. The coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed that COUP-TFI forms a complex with Ubc9 and PIAS1 in mammalian cells. Immunohistochemistry showed that Ubc9 and PIAS1 are markedly expressed in rat adrenal glomerulosa cells. Coexpression of Ubc9 and PIAS1 synergistically enhanced the COUP-TFI-mediated CYP11B2 reporter activity, indicating that both proteins function as coactivators of COUP-TFI. However, sumoylation-defective mutants, Ubc9 (C93S) and PIAS1 (C351S), continued to function as coactivators of COUP-TFI, indicating that sumoylation activity are separable from coactivator ability. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that ectopically expressed COUP-TFI, Ubc9, and PIAS1 were recruited to an endogenous CYP11B2 promoter. Moreover, reduction of Ubc9 or PIAS1 protein levels by small interfering RNA inhibited the CYP11B2 transactivation by COUP-TFI. Our data support a physiological role of Ubc9 and PIAS1 as transcriptional coactivators in COUP-TFI-mediated CYP11B2 transcription..

0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	7	The trans-acting factors that regulate CYP11B2 expression remain poorly defined. The orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1),1 is shown to play a crucial regulator of most steroid hydroxylase genes, including CYP17 and CYP11B1 (5, 6). However, SF-1 actually represses rather than activates expression of hCYP11B2 (7 to 9). In addition, other transcription factors that are expressed in the adrenal cortex include the NGFI-B family of orphan nuclear receptors, such as Nurr1, NGFI-B, and NOR-1. The NGFI-B family receptors are highly expressed in the adrenal zona glomerulosa cells as well as in aldosterone-producing adenomas (8, 10, 11). These three nuclear receptors are rapidly induced early response genes that enhance transcription by binding to a consensus sequence, named NBRE-1, as well as an Ad5 element of the hCYP11B2 promoter. In addition, CREB and ATF-1 enhance transcription of the hCYP11B2 gene by binding to a CRE (9, 12, 13). Our previous data (12) showed that human adrenocortical H295R nuclear proteins containing chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs) were bound to the  to 129/ to 114 sequence, designated as the Ad5 element of the hCYP11B2 promoter by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The COUP-TFI was originally identified as an activator of the chicken ovalbumin gene (14, 15); however, COUP-TFs mostly function as transcriptional repressor of many target genes. COUP-TFs inhibit the transcription of other nuclear receptor such as retinoic acid receptor and thyroid hormone receptor (14). Furthermore, COUP-TFI represses basal transcriptional activity by active repression utilizing transcriptional corepressors, such as N-CoR and SMRT (16). We and other investigators have previously demonstrated that COUP-TFI and SF-1 regulate the bovine CYP17 expression in a mutually exclusive manner (17, 18). We have previously reported that COUP-TFI is expressed in the normal adrenal cortex and that expression levels of COUP-TFI is inversely correlated with those of CYP17, but correlated with those of N-CoR in adrenal cortical adenomas (18 to 23)..

The SUMO post-translationally modifies many proteins with roles in diverse processes, including regulation of transcription, chromatin structure, and DNA repair (25 to 30). The SUMO modification has not been generally associated with increased protein degradation. Rather, similar to non-proteolytic roles of ubiquitin, SUMO modification regulates protein localization and activity. The SUMO E1-activating, E2-conjugating enzymes, and E3-ligase are involved in the sumoylation machinery. In contrast to the ubiquitin system where dozens of E2 enzymes have been identified, Ubc9 is the only known SUMO-E2-conjugating enzyme. Several SUMO-E3 ligases have been identified that promote transfer of SUMO from E2 to specific substrates. To date, three unrelated proteins have been suggested to have SUMO-E3 ligase activity; the protein inhibitors of activated STAT1 (PIAS1) proteins (31 to 33), RanBP2 (34, 35), and polycomb group protein Pc2 (36). The present study described that both Ubc9 and PIAS1 can function as transcriptional coactivators of COUP-TFI for the hCYP11B2 gene transcription in a sumoylation-independent manner. These proteins are shown to form a complex in the nucleus and exhibit a very unique localization in the adrenal zona glomerulosa cells.

Several other constructs, including pG-BKT7-Ubc9, pGADT7-Ubc9, pcDNA3.1/His-Ubc9, pcDNA3.1/His-Ubc9 (C93S), pcDNA3.1/His-Ubc9-(1 to 58), and pAS1cyh2-TR-(168 to 456) were described previously (16, 24). pGBT9-Ad4BP/SF-1, pGBT9-DAX-1, and p3xFLAG-CMV10-PIAS1 were generous gifts by Professor Ken-ichirou Morohashi (National Institute for Basic Biology, Japan). pGL3-Basic-human CYP11B2 ( to 1521/+2), pGL3-Basic-human CYP11B2 mutAd5, pGL2-wtAd5, pGL2-m5Ad5, and pGL2-m7Ad5 were described previously (7, 8). pGADT7-PIAS1-(5 to 651) was first identified as a COUP-TFI-interacting protein from human adrenocortical adenoma cDNA library. Several PIAS1 fragments, such as PIAS1-(1 to 651), -(1 to 150), -(1 to 300), -(1 to 405), -(301 to 651), -(406 to 651), and -(5 to 73/564 to 651), were subcloned into pGADT7 vector using a PCR amplification with primers containing oligonucleotide linkers of restriction enzyme sites (Fig. 1B). Mutagenesis of PIAS1 was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the mutant PIAS1 (C351S) was generated. pEGFP-PIAS1 and pEGFP-PIAS1 (C351S) were generated utilizing PCR amplifications from pGADT7-PIAS1 and pGADT7-PIAS1 (C351S), respectively..

A, the COUP-TFI fragments shown were cloned into the pGBKT7 expression vector as described under "Experimental Procedures." Based on other nuclear hormone receptors as a reference, the sequence from amino acids 1 to 85, 86 to 149, 150 to 183 and 184 to 423 have been designated domains A/B, C, D and E/F, respectively. (B) The PIAS1 fragments shown were cloned into the pGADT7, pEGFP, and pcDNA3.1/His expression vectors as described under "Experimental Procedures." The N terminus of PIAS1 contains NR box, a coactivator motif that interacts with nuclear receptors, whereas the C terminus of PIAS1 contains two CoRNR motifs, the corepressor of which interacts with nuclear receptors. In the middle of the PIAS1 proteins, the RING finger domain, which is necessary for SUMO-1 ligase activity, is localized..

A human adrenocortical adenoma cDNA library was prepared as shown previously (24). Yeast strain AH109 containing pGBKT7-COUP-TFI-(55 to 423) was transformed with a human adrenocortical adenoma cDNA library in pGADT7 (Clontech) and plated on synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan, adenine, leucine, and histidine. His+ and Ade+ colonies exhibiting -galactosidase activity by filter lift assay were further characterized according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). -Galactosidase activity was determined with chlorophenol red -D-galactopyranoside as described previously (16, 24). To recover the library plasmids, total DNA from the yeast was isolated with a ZymoprepTM yeast plasmid Miniprep kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA) and used to transform Escherichia coli (HB101) in the presence of ampicillin. To ensure that the correct cDNAs were identified, the library plasmids isolated were transformed into Y187 containing pGBKT7-COUP-TFI-(55 to 423), and -galactosidase activity was determined. The specificity of the interaction of #2 to 3 (PIAS1-(5 to 651)) and #2 to 4 (Ubc9-(1 to 158)), both part of the 20 positive clones, with COUP-TFI was determined by mating with Y187, which contains pGBKT7-lamin (Clontech). The -galactosidase activities of these diploids were examined by the filter lift and chlorophenol red -D-galactopyranoside methods. The sequence of the #2 to 3 and #2 to 4 clones was identical to the GenBankTM-submitted sequence of PIAS1 and Ubc9, respectively. The yeast two-hybrid system was also used to determine protein-protein interaction between COUP-TFI/COUP-TFII/Ad4BP/DAX-1/TR and these clones..

Both Gal4 DBD-COUP-TFI encoding amino acids 86 to 183 and amino acids 150 to 183 strongly interacted with the full-length PIAS1, suggesting that the DNA-binding domain and hinge regions of COUP-TFI were necessary to interact with Ubc9. In contrast, the C-terminal fragments of PIAS1 encoding amino acids 301 to 651 and amino acids 406 to 651 strongly interacted with COUP-TFI, whereas PIAS1 fragments encoding amino acids 1 to 150, 1 to 300, 1 to 405, and 5 to 73/564 to 651 showed minimal interaction with COUP-TFI. Although the N and C termini of PIAS1 contain nuclear receptor-interacting domains, named nuclear receptor box (NR box), and CoRNR motifs, respectively, these domains are not involved in the interaction with COUP-TFI. Taken together with the interaction data described above, the most C-terminal fragments of PIAS1 encoding amino acids 406 to 563 interacted with DNA binding and hinge regions of COUP-TFI in yeast..

COS-1 cells were transfected with Xpress-tagged Ubc9 (pcDNA3.1/His-Ubc9), FLAG-tagged PIAS1 (p3xFLAG-CMV-10-PIAS1), and RSV-promoter-driven COUP-TFI expression vectors (pRSV-COUP-TFI).

In addition, expression of both EGFP-tagged PIAS1 (C351S) and DsRed-COUP-TFI was colocalized in the nucleus (Fig. 3, E to G), indicating that presence of sumoylation activity did not affect nuclear localization of COUP-TFI..

Because Ubc9 and PIAS1 were cloned from a human adrenocortical adenoma cDNA library, we confirmed that these mRNAs were expressed in normal human adrenal cortex (Fig. 4). Ubc9 mRNA is widely distributed in many endocrine tissues, and the expression profile of Ubc9 is similar to that of COUP-TFI as shown previously (24).

Strikingly, both Ubc9 and PIAS1 are exclusively expressed in the nuclei of zona glomerulosa cells of adult rat adrenal cortex (Fig. 5, B and C), whereas COUP-TFI is expressed in the nuclei of all three zones of adrenocortical cells (Fig. 5A). In addition, these expression profiles are shown to be developmentally regulated. At 2 weeks after birth, Ubc9 is expressed in all three zones of the adrenal cortex, and expression of Ubc9 gradually becomes localized in the zona glomerulosa cells as development progresses at 3 weeks after birth (data not shown). At 8 weeks after birth, Ubc9 is specifically expressed in zona glomerulosa cells and slightly expressed in the interstitial stromal cells of zona fasciculata and reticularis (Fig. 5B). These expression profiles of Ubc9 were not altered between male and female rat adrenal glands (data not shown). These results indicate that both Ubc9 and PIAS1 are mainly expressed in the nuclei of adrenal glomerulosa cells, where aldosterone is exclusively synthesized..

To define more precisely the DNA-protein interactions occurring within this region, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) was performed using a synthetic 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe encompassing this sequence and nuclear extract derived from H295R cell line (Fig. 6A).

We observed displacement at lower levels of the cold probe, which was 10-fold displaced in about one-half of the radiolabeled binding (data not shown). These data indicate that these three complexes represent specific protein-DNA interactions.

A, a series of oligonucleotides containing progressive 2-bp mutations across the Ad5 sequence (m1 to m9) was radiolabeled and used in EMSA. The positions of the mutations relative to the wild-type sequence (wt) are indicated at the top of the figure. EMSA was performed using H295R nuclear extract (top panel) or in vitro synthesized SF-1, COUP-TFI, or COUP-TFII (lower panels). The positions of the specific DNA-protein complexes are indicated by arrows. The boxed sequence at the top of the figure indicates the core recognition motif. Neither COUP-TFI nor SF-1 can bind to the m5 Ad5 sequence, whereas SF-1, but not COUP-TFI, can bind to the m7 Ad5 sequence. B, effects of introduction of two kinds of mutations of the CYP11B2 Ad5 element on the COUP-TFI-mediated transcription. H295R cells were transiently transfected with 0.93  microg of total DNA, including 30 ng of COUP-TFI, 0.3  microg of Ubc9, 0.3  microg of PIAS1, and 0.3  microg of each reporter DNA (wtAd5, mtAd5, or m7Ad5). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were harvested, and the extracts were assayed for luciferase activity. Assays were performed in three separate experiments, each with triplicate samples..

As described previously (Figs. 7 and 8), overexpression of COUP-TFI activated human CYP11B2 reporter activities by 6-fold (lane 3 in Fig. 10A). Cotransfection of siRNA of two sets of Ubc9 (Ubc9a (lane 5) and Ubc9b (lane 6) in Fig. 10A) or two sets of PIAS1 (PIAS1a (lane 7) and PIAS1b (lane 8) in Fig. 10A), but not negative control (lane 4 in Fig. 10A), effectively reduced the endogenous levels of Ubc9 or PIAS1 proteins but had no effect on the -tubulin protein level seen in Western blot (Fig. 10B). Reduction of endogenous Ubc9 or PIAS1 protein level decreased the COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation by 30 to 50%. These findings indicate that endogenous Ubc9 and PIAS1 normally function as transcriptional coactivators for the COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation..

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to test whether Ubc9 and PIAS1 are recruited to the endogenous CYP11B2 gene promoter in H295R cells.

0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	68	Ubc9 and PIAS1 Function as Transcriptional Coactivators of COUP-TFI in CYP11B2 Transcription Both Ubc9 and PIAS1 meet all the criteria for transcriptional coactivator proteins in the modulation of COUP-TFI transcriptional properties. First, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, Ubc9 and PIAS1 specifically interacted with COUP-TFI in yeast and mammalian cells. The Ubc9 was previously shown to interact with the C-terminal putative ligand-binding domain of COUP-TFI-(388 to 403) that is described as a transcriptional repressor domain (24). The present study showed that PIAS1 interacted with the DNA-binding domain and hinge region of COUP-TFI-(86 to 183). Coimmunoprecipitation and subcellular localization experiments showed that Ubc9 and PIAS1 are colocalized with COUP-TFI in transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that Ubc9 and PIAS1 specifically interact with COUP-TFI and form a complex in mammalian cells. Second, overexpression of Ubc9 or PIAS1 had no effect on the reporter activities in the absence of transfected COU-TFI (Fig. 8A). However, Ubc9 or PIAS1 potentiated the transactivation mediated by COUP-TFI. Subsequently, coexpression of the Ubc9 or PIAS1 deletion mutant, Ubc9-(1 to 58) or PIAS1-(1 to 150), which impairs COUP-TFI binding, did not affect the transactivation mediated by COUP-TFI, indicating that interaction of COUP-TFI with Ubc9 or PIAS1 is required for COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation. In addition, coexpression of Ubc9 and PIAS1 synergistically enhanced the COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation. Third, reduction of endogenous Ubc9 or PIAS1 by small interfering RNA decreased COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation of the human CYP11B2 promoter activity, indicating that endogenous Ubc9 and PIAS1 normally contributes to COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation. Fourth, ChIP assays clearly showed that COUP-TFI, Ubc9, and PIAS1 were recruited to a native COUP-TFI-regulated CYP11B2 promoter, demonstrating a functional coupling between COUP-TFI and Ubc9-PIAS1 in vivo. Therefore, Ubc9 and PIAS1 possess all the characteristics expected for transcriptional coactivator proteins of COUP-TF in vivo..
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	69	To confirm further that Ubc9 and PIAS1 are coactivators of COUP-TFI, we ruled out several other possible ways in which these proteins might enhance COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation. First, as SUMO-1 conjugation plays an important role in protein modification, the effects of Ubc9 and PIAS1 on COUP-TFI transactivation might be the result of effects of Ubc9 and PIAS1 on COUP-TFI protein concentrations. Our preliminary experiments showed that overexpression of Ubc9 or PIAS1 did not alter COUP-TFI protein concentration in H295R cells (data not shown). Second, it was also possible that overexpression of Ubc9 or PIAS1 increases the concentrations of some coactivators or decreases the concentrations of some corepressors, which have been shown to interact with COUP-TFI, but the results showed that overexpression of these proteins did not alter the protein concentrations of SRC-1, GRIP-1, or SMRT in the cells (data not shown). Because these experiments were performed by transient transfection, we are not able to conclude unequivocally that Ubc9 and PIAS1 have no effects on these coregulator concentrations, and further investigation is required. Third, another possibility is that overexpression of Ubc9 or PIAS1 increased the DNA-binding affinity of COUP-TFI. To exclude the possibility, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays to determine whether bacterially or in vitro transcription-translated Ubc9 or PIAS1 proteins affect the binding of COUP-TFI to its response element DNA (Ad5) of the human CYP11B2 promoter region. The results showed that Ubc9 or PIAS1 have no effects on COUP-TFI binding to the Ad5 element (data not shown). Fourth, it has been proposed that SUMO-1 conjugation targets proteins to different cellular localizations. SF-1 can be directed into nuclear speckles and sequestered from the nucleolus in the presence of SUMO-1, thus resulting in transcriptional repression (39). It is therefore possible that coexpression of Ubc9 and PIAS1 alters subcellular localization of COUP-TFI. However, based on the subcellular localization data (Fig. 3), localization of COUP-TFI continues to be in the nucleus without re-localization. Taken together with the above-mentioned findings, Ubc9 and PIAS1 clearly function as novel coactivators of COUP-TFI in vivo. However, detailed molecular mechanisms are largely unknown and further investigation is required..

However, it is possible that ectopically produced Ubc9 and PIAS1 regulate COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation through not only sumoylation of COUP-TFI but also conjugation of SUMO-1 to one or more other cellular factors involved in transcriptional regulation. Recent data have raised the intriguing possibility that SUMO modification may have a specific impact on the ability of some transcription factors to function synergistically (27, 40, 41). Previous studies of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) had identified a region referred to as a synergy control motif, mutation of which led to a selective increase in the activity of the GR from promoters bearing multiple, but not single sites. The synergy control motif contains a consensus SUMO acceptor site, and recent data have shown that this is, in fact, the major site of addition of SUMO in the GR. Considerable numbers of transcription factors, including GR (41 to 44), androgen receptor (32, 33, 45 to 51), progesterone receptor (47, 52), mineralocorticoid receptor (53, 54), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (55), and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) (39, 56), are modulated by SUMO-1 attachment, and SUMO-modified transcription factors mostly resulted in attenuation of transcription. Recent studies demonstrated that one of the molecular mechanisms of sumoylation-mediated repression is protein modified by SUMO-1 recruited histone deacetylases and transcriptional corepressors, thus repressing transcription (29, 38, 57 to 59). However, there are also opposite examples of SUMO-modified proteins, which lead to transcriptional activation rather than repression. Transcriptional coactivators, such as SRC-1 and GRIP1, are shown to be modified by SUMO-1, thus resulting in enhanced transcriptional coactivator capacities (60, 61). Therefore, sumoylation does not necessarily induce transcriptional repression depending on the substrates. The molecular mechanisms that could explain how SUMO modification affects transcriptional regulation are largely unknown..

Ang II treatment rapidly induces levels of mRNA and protein of Nurr1/NGFI-B, thereby transactivating hCYP11B2 gene (8, 9). Both Nurr1 and NGFI-B markedly increased transcription of hCYP11B2 through binding to the NBRE-1 and Ad5 sites, which are unique to hCYP11B2. Buholzer et al.

Therefore, the COUP-TFI-Ubc9-PIAS1 complexes shed new light in controlling the long term capacity of the adrenal gland to produce aldosterone. In addition, these studies provide new mechanisms through which COUP-TFI can act as a transcriptional activator through the novel interaction with Ubc9 and PIAS1..

0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	1	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   2-Macroglobulin (2M) is a serine protease inhibitor and cytokine inactivator associated with inflammation and tissue remodeling. The gene encoding this protein is selectively induced in the rat corpus luteum by the luteotropic hormone and cytokine, PRL. The promoter of the 2M gene contains two regulatory regions that bind a diverse set of transcription factors and confer functional activity in ovarian granulosa-luteal cells. The PRL response element (PRLRE) binds PRL-activated (tyrosine-phosphorylated) signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat 5b and Stat 5a). 5'-Deletion of the Stat-binding sites or mutation of either one or both of these sites within the context of the intact promoter abolished PRL inducibility of 2M promoter-reporter constructs in granulosa-luteal cells. Cotransfection with a vector expressing a dominant negative, truncated form of Stat 5b abolished PRL-induced activation of 2M transgenes. 5'-Deletion of the Stat-binding sites abolished all promoter-reporter activity in response to PRL. Internal deletion of a second functional domain 3' of the PRLRE also abolished PRL inducibility and markedly reduced basal activity, indicating that functional interactions between these two regions might occur. The 3'-region was shown to bind orphan members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF) and has been called the orphan receptor response element (ORRE). When site-specific mutations were made in either the SF-1-binding site or the two COUP-TF direct repeat (DR1 and DR2) binding sites in the context of the intact promoter, specific changes in the functional activity of this novel region of the 2M promoter were observed. Mutation of the SF-1 site drastically reduced basal activity of the 2M promoter. Mutation of the COUP-TF sites caused the basal activity of the 2M promoter to increase markedly. Neither mutation altered the PRL inducibility of these constructs. Lastly, differentiation of cultured granulosa cells was required for functional activity of both the PRLRE and the ORRE. Collectively, these results document for the first time that Stat 5b, SF-1, and COUP-TF each exert specific effects on the function of the 2M promoter: basal activity is controlled by the balance of SF-1 (positive) and COUP-TF (negative) activities and PRL inducibility is mediated by activation of Stat 5b. These results add 2M to the list of nonsteroidal genes regulated by SF-1 in the gonads and provide the first evidence that COUP-TF has a specific role in regulating ovarian gene activity. In addition, the ORRE and PRLRE act independently of, rather than synergistically with, each other to regulate basal and PRL-induced expression of 2M in ovarian luteal cells..

0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	3	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Tissue-specific expression of genes is dependent on the cellular set of transcription factors as well as the selective activation of these factors by hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. One transcription factor that dictates ovarian (gonadal) development is steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (1). SF-1 binds as a monomer to (CA)AGGTCA-like motifs and interacts with other factors to regulate the expression of most steroid hydroxylase genes (2, 3, 4, 5). During the development of preovulatory follicles and in granulosa cells in culture, FSH induces expression of two steroid hydroxylase genes encoding aromatase (CYP19; Ref. 6) and P450scc (CYP11A; Ref. 7). SF-1 also regulates the expression of genes encoding peptides, including Mullerian Inhibiting Substance (8) and oxytocin (9). Thus, SF-1 appears to play a critical role in regulating genes expressed in differentiated granulosa cells in response to FSH (6)..

0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	5	When granulosa cells luteinize, they respond to a different set of extracellular signals, one of which is the cytokine PRL. In the ovary (10, 11, 12), as in other target tissues (13, 14, 15), PRL activates the JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway. One gene that is selectively regulated by PRL in luteal cells encodes 2-macroglobulin (2M), a large tetrameric protein that traps and inactivates proteases and cytokines. The inducibility of this gene by interleukin-6 (IL-6) in rat liver (16) and by PRL in rat luteal cells (11) has provided a unique opportunity to delineate the cellular signaling mechanisms used by each cytokine to control the tissue-specific expression of this gene. In previous analyses, we have shown that Stat 5 is activated by PRL and binds to specific -activating sequences (GAS) sites present in the promoter of the 2M gene and originally referred to as the IL-6 response element (IL6-RE) based on the activation of this gene by IL-6 in rat liver (16). Because a luciferase reporter construct containing 1.2 kb of the 2M promoter showed high basal activity when transfected into differentiated granulosa cells in the absence of PRL, we sought to identify additional factors involved in regulating the promoter of this gene and the extent to which the high basal as well as PRL inducibility were dependent on hormone-induced differentiation of granulosa cells in culture (10)..

When the sequence of this region was examined, we noted that it contained putative binding sites for SF-1 and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF). Like SF-1, COUP-TF is a member of the orphan nuclear receptor superfamily (17, 18). However, unlike SF-1, it is presumed to be expressed ubiquitously and has been shown to exhibit complex interactions by binding, as a heterodimer, other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (19). COUP-TF homodimers bind to a wide spectrum of response elements containing, as a core half-site, the A/GGGTCA motif, the spacing and orientation of which determine the relative binding affinity of COUP-TF (19). Recent evidence indicates that Stat proteins may interact functionally with other transcription factors and coregulatory molecules, including members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (20, 21, 22, 23, 24). Based on the close juxtaposition and functional activities of the PRL response element (PRLRE) and the putative orphan receptor-binding sites, it seemed reasonable to predict that factors binding to these regions might interact to control maximal expression of the 2M gene in granulosa-luteal cells..

The functional activities of the Stat-binding sites and the orphan receptor-binding sites were analyzed by generating site-specific mutations in the context of the intact promoter and transfecting differentiated granulosa cells with specific intact and mutant promoter-luciferase reporter constructs.

The 1.2-kb 2M-luciferase construct, as well as the deletion constructs, were transiently transfected into differentiated granulosa cells that had been cultured with FSH and testosterone for 48 h. After 4 h, granulosa cells were treated with or without PRL for 6 h. Luciferase activity was measured, normalized to the amount of protein present in the sample, and then expressed as activity/ microg protein. Constructs with 5'-deletions to -371 and -209 bp retained both PRL inducibility and high basal activity (Fig. 1). Deletion of the Stat-binding sites reduced basal activity and abolished PRL- inducible activity (Fig. 1). Deletion of a 109-bp region 3' of the PRLRE (-209) reduced basal activity to that seen with the minimal -48-bp 2M promoter and abolished PRL inducibility. These results indicated that the PRLRE as well as the 109-bp region immediately downstream of the PRLRE might interact functionally to confer maximal promoter activity in granulosa cells..

Because activated (phosphorylated) Stat proteins bind DNA whereas the nonphosphorylated Stats do not, the activated factors are readily detected in EMSAs. Accordingly, whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared from differentiated granulosa cells before or 15 min after PRL treatment, incubated with labeled 2M GAS2 probe, and resolved by electrophoresis. One slow migrating protein/DNA complex was formed with the WCE from PRL-treated cells but was not observed in WCE prepared from untreated cells (Fig. 3A, arrow). To identify the Stat factor(s) present in the slow migrating complex, WCEs were preincubated with antibodies to either Stat 5a or Stat 5b. The PRL-induced complex was partially supershifted by the Stat 5a antibody, as shown previously (10). A specific Stat 5b antibody resulted in retardation of the entire PRL-induced protein/DNA complex (Fig. 3A, asterisk) as was observed in extracts isolated from PRL-stimulated corpora lutea (11).

For this we cotransfected into differentiated granulosa cells vectors expressing either wild-type Stat 5b or a truncated, splice variant form of Stat 5b (Stat 5b-40C) that has been shown to act in a dominant negative fashion to suppress Stat 5b function in other cells (25, 26). A reporter construct containing four copies of the proximal Stat-binding site ligated to the minimal 2M promoter-luciferase gene (4XGAS 2M) was chosen as the reporter construct since in previous studies (10, 16) it has been shown to exhibit a greater response to PRL treatment than the intact 2M promoter. When wild-type Stat 5b expression vectors were cotransfected with the 4XGAS 2M luciferase construct, the PRL-induced response was similar to cells cotransfected with the empty vector (Fig. 4), indicating that endogenous amounts of Stat 5b were already in excess. In contrast, PRL-induced activation of the promoter-reporter construct was significantly repressed by cotransfection of the vector expressing the truncated variant of Stat 5b (Fig. 4). These data indicate that PRL induction of 2M in differentiated granulosa cells is dependent on activation of Stat 5b and that the truncated splice-variant of Stat 5b can act as a dominant negative factor in granulosa cells as it does in other cells (25, 26)..

Since identical complexes were observed with either WCE (data not shown), only the results obtained with WCE not exposed to PRL are presented (Fig. 5B). As shown, two major protein/DNA complexes were formed. The slower migrating complex, designated complex A, consists of two bands (thin arrow); the faster migrating complex is designated complex B (thick arrow). Formation of both these complexes was inhibited by the addition of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled ORRE oligonucleotide, indicating that each of these complexes contains a protein(s) capable of binding to the probe. When a 20-bp oligonucleotide encompassing a consensus COUP-TF-binding site (Materials and Methods) was added to the reaction, the formation of complex A but not complex B was abolished (Fig. 5B).

A 50 mer oligonucleotide spanning the ORRE was used as a labeled probe and incubated with WCE obtained from untreated and PRL-treated granulosa cells. Since identical complexes were observed with either WCE (data not shown), only the results obtained with WCE not exposed to PRL are presented (Fig. 5B). As shown, two major protein/DNA complexes were formed. The slower migrating complex, designated complex A, consists of two bands (thin arrow); the faster migrating complex is designated complex B (thick arrow). Formation of both these complexes was inhibited by the addition of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled ORRE oligonucleotide, indicating that each of these complexes contains a protein(s) capable of binding to the probe. When a 20-bp oligonucleotide encompassing a consensus COUP-TF-binding site (Materials and Methods) was added to the reaction, the formation of complex A but not complex B was abolished (Fig. 5B). When oligonucleotides spanning either the putative COUP-TF-binding DR1 or DR2 regions (Materials and Methods) of the 2M promoter were added, neither altered the formation of complex A or complex B at the 100-fold molar excess.

The absence of SF-1 binding was expected. However the absence of COUP-TF was unexpected because both DR1 and DR2 sites were intact. Thus mutation of the SF-1 site altered not only the binding of SF-1 but also that of COUP-TF. When labeled M2 was incubated with in vitro translated COUP-TF, the binding of COUP-TF was markedly diminished compared with the intact ORRE (data not shown). Based on these observations, we concluded that the SF-1 site of the 2M promoter appeared to enhance, stabilize, or directly bind COUP-TF..

When the SF-1 mutant M2 oligonucleotide was used at 100-, 500-, and 1000-fold molar excess, no reduction in the binding of SF-1 was observed. However, M2 did compete for the binding of COUP-TF (thin arrow), albeit less effectively than unlabeled ORRE. A 1000-fold molar excess of M2 was required to achieve the same inhibition as a 100-fold molar excess of the intact ORRE (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that mutation of the SF-1 site reduces the affinity or stability but does not completely prevent the binding of COUP-TF to the 2M promoter..

In addition, both exhibit tissue-specific effects as indicated by the phenotypes of mutant mice lacking SF-1 (1) or COUP-TFI/II (Refs. 17, 29 ; and Y. Qu, F. A. Pereira, S. Y. Tsai, and M.-J. Tsai, personal communication). To analyze the functional roles of SF-1 and COUP-TF in regulating activation of the 2M promoter, specific mutations that abolished the binding of SF-1 or COUP-TF (Fig. 6) were generated within the -3712M promoter-reporter construct using PCR- directed mutagenesis techniques (Materials and Methods). These constructs were then transfected into differentiated granulosa cells. After 4 h, cells were treated with/without PRL for 6 h. Luciferase activity was measured, normalized to the amount of protein present in the sample, and then expressed as activity/ microg protein. As expected, PRL induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in luciferase activity from the intact -371 2M promoter-reporter construct (Fig. 7). Mutation of the SF-1 site (mSF-1) that prevents SF-1 binding and reduces the affinity of COUP-TF binding (Fig. 6A/B) markedly decreased basal activity of the reporter gene but did not prevent the 3-fold increase in response to PRL (Fig. 7). In contrast, the COUP-TF mutant (mCOUPTF) construct that retains an intact SF-1 binding site but fails to bind COUP-TF showed a 5-fold increase in basal promoter activity. Although the fold increase by PRL was somewhat reduced, an effect of PRL was observed. When both the SF-1 and the COUP-TF sites (mSF-mCOUPTF) were mutated, basal and PRL-stimulated luciferase activities were similar to that of the intact promoter-reporter construct. Collectively, these data document that within the ORRE of the 2M promoter, SF-1 acts as a positive regulator whereas COUP-TF acts as a repressor of transcriptional activation. Combined with the data from the EMSAs, these results indicate that although mutation of the SF-1 site decreases the affinity of COUP-TF binding to the 2M promoter, COUP-TF binds this region (albeit with reduced affinity) and retains potent repressor activity. Thus, both of these nuclear receptors appear to control the basal activity of the 2M promoter in granulosa-luteal cells but do not markedly alter the response to PRL..

Specifically, FSH has been shown to regulate the expression of numerous genes in granulosa cells that contain SF-1 binding sites. The list of genes includes aromatase (6), P450scc (7), MIS (8), and, more recently, the receptor for PRL (31). This latter observation indicated that not only the basal activity of 2M promoter, but also the PRL inducibility of 2M gene might be dependent on several aspects of FSH-mediated differentiation of granulosa cells. Therefore, we analyzed and compared both basal and PRL- induced expression of 2M in immature granulosa cells and in cells differentiated in the presence of FSH and T. The expression of the endogenous 2M gene has been compared with the activity of 2M promoter-luciferase-reported constructs transfected into similar immature and differentiated cells. Furthermore, the expression of the endogenous gene and the transgene has been related to the expression of PRL receptors (PRLRs), activation of Stat 5, and the relative levels of SF-1 and COUP-TF..

As shown in Fig. 8B, basal luciferase activity of the -371 2M promoter-reporter construct was low in undifferentiated granulosa cells and was not increased by the addition of PRL. In contrast, basal luciferase activity was 10-fold higher in the differentiated cells, and PRL induced a further 2- to 3-fold increase in activity. The marked differences in the activity of the transgene in these two stages of granulosa cell differentiation were not related to transfection efficiency since an SV40 enhancer-promoter construct gave similar activity (20,000 mean light units  plus or minus  SEM per  microg protein) when transfected into each culture. Based on these observations that FSH- and T-induced differentiation altered both basal and PRL-regulated activities, we sought to determine what changes in the PRL-response system or in the ratio of SF-1 and COUP-TF might account for these marked differences..

Specific primers to the long and the short form of the PRLRs were used in an RT-PCR assay using RNA isolated from uncultured cells, undifferentiated granulosa cells (-FSH/T, 24 h), and differentiated cells (+FSH/T, 48 h). The amplified receptor mRNA products were normalized to the endogenous ribosomal L19-amplified band (Fig. 9B). The long form of the PRLR was detected at significant levels in immature granulosa cells before culture. However, in the absence of hormone, the levels of PRLR decreased progressively at 24 and 48 h of culture (Fig. 9B). In contrast, cells cultured with FSH/T for 48 h expressed 5-fold more message for the long PRLR and exhibited detectable amounts of the short form of the receptor (Fig. 9B). These data indicate that the ability of PRL to induce 2M in these differentiated cells is related, in part, to the induction-maintenance of PRLR in these cells. However, since PRL does not induce 2M in immature cells that also express the long form of the PRLR, additional factors regulating either the PRL-signaling cascade or the A-kinase system must be regulated by FSH/T as the granulosa cells differentiate..

In this study we have identified and functionally characterized the interactions of two regions of the 2M promoter. One region contains a PRLRE that is comprised of two Stat factor-binding sites and binds both Stat 5a and Stat 5b (Refs. 10, 11 and results herein). The other region contains an ORRE that binds the orphan nuclear receptors SF-1 (2, 3, 4) and COUP-TF (17, 18).

0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	87	When the studies described herein were originally initiated, we had shown that Stat 5a was expressed in rat granulosa cells, activated by PRL, and bound to the PRLRE of the 2M promoter. We have extended these observations by showing that both Stat-binding sites are critical for PRL-induced activity of the 2M promoter. Neither site alone in the context of the intact promoter exhibits significant functional activity. These results indicate that the two sites may interact to stabilize or increase the binding of coregulatory molecules that interact with the transcriptional machinery. As new information about the complexity of the Stat 5 family of transcription factors was reported (34, 35), reagents to these new family members allowed us to extend our initial observations. Using antibodies specific for Stat 5b, we show that not only is it present in the rat granulosa cells, it is expressed at higher levels than Stat 5a, is activated by PRL, and binds to the PRLRE of the 2M gene. These results obtained in granulosa-luteal cells in culture support those observed in luteal cells in vivo (10, 11). Antibodies to Stat 5b have allowed us to document that in differentiated granulosa cells Stat 5b is tyrosine phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in response to PRL. In addition, truncated, splice-variant forms of Stat proteins have been cloned. For the Stats in which truncated forms have been identified, Stat 1 (36, 37) Stat 3 (38), and Stat 5 (25, 26), the mutants lacking the transactivation domain have been shown to exert dominant-negative functions in transcription assays (25, 26, 36, 37, 38). When we coexpressed the truncated Stat 5b variant with the 2M promoter-luciferase reporter construct, PRL-induced activity was markedly impaired, supporting the hypothesis that Stat 5 is the major PRL-regulated activator of 2M promoter activity in the differentiated granulosa cells. Taken together, our results provide evidence that PRL-mediated signaling events that transactivate the 2M gene in the granulosa-luteal cells occur by mechanisms similar to those that regulate cytokine signal transduction of target gene activity in other tissues, such as mammary gland (13, 39, 40) and liver (35, 41). That Stat 5, especially Stat 5b, plays a major role in transducing PRL action in ovarian cells has been supported recently by the generation of mutant mice. Although female mice null for Stat 5a do not exhibit an overt ovarian phenotype (42), mice null for Stat 5b alone (43) are infertile and exhibit abnormal ovarian functions. Based on the luteal cell-specific expression of 2M in vivo as well as its regulation by PRL and Stat 5b in cultured cells, we predict that corpora lutea of the infertile mice either fail to express 2M or express it at a markedly reduced level..

The region directly 3' of the PRLRE binds both SF-1 and COUP-TF and has been designated herein as the ORRE of the 2M promoter. When this region of the 2M promoter was deleted, leaving the PRLRE intact, transgene activity was reduced to baseline and PRL inducibility was abolished. Based on these initial observations, we predicted that Stat 5 binding to the PRLRE interacted synergistically with the orphan receptors binding to the 3'- regulatory region to confer maximal promoter activity. This initial hypothesis was supported by observations of others who have shown that Stats synergistically interact with a variety of other transcription factors and coregulatory molecules. In mammary epithelial cells, Stat 5 interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor for activation of the ss-casein gene by PRL (23, 44). In liver cells, Stat 3 synergizes (interacts) with glucocorticoid receptor for activation of the 2M gene by IL-6 (24). Stat 1 and Sp1 interact to activate ICAM-I promoter in human tracheobronchial epithelial cells (21). In addition, Stat 2 has been shown to bind CBP/p300 and enhance gene activation by interferon- (20). When site-specific mutations were generated in either the Stat 5, SF-1, or COUP-TF binding sites within the context of the intact 2M promoter, a different set of functional interactions was observed..

As mentioned above, these results indicate that the functional activity of the PRLRE is dependent on the binding of Stat 5 to each site and that these two sites interact to confer maximal PRL inducibility. However, mutation of the Stat sites did not alter the high basal activity observed with the intact 2M promoter-reporter constructs compared with the -48 2M minimal promoter construct. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, these results indicated that the Stat sites acted independently of the factors binding to the ORRE. However, when site-specific mutations of the SF-1 site or the two COUP-TF binding sites were generated, marked changes in the basal activities of the mutant constructs were observed. The mutant SF-1 construct that failed to bind SF-1 exhibited markedly reduced basal activity, whereas the COUP-TF mutant construct that failed to bind COUP-TF, but did bind SF-1, exhibited elevated basal activity. These results indicated that SF-1 is a transcriptional activator and enhances 2M promoter activity, whereas COUP-TF acted as a corepressor to antagonize the activity of SF-1 and thereby reduce the functional activity of the intact 2M promoter. Thus, the 2M gene can be added to a growing list of genes that are regulated by SF-1 in ovarian cells and highlights the importance of SF-1 in many diverse functions within the gonads and adrenals as suggested by the phenotype of mice null for SF-1 (1). Furthermore, these observations provide the first evidence that COUP-TF is present and functional in ovarian granulosa cells and can regulate the expression of an ovarian gene. Although the actions of COUP-TF are complex and have been shown to be both stimulatory and inhibitory (17), our data indicate that COUP-TF acts as a corepressor of SF-1 action in the intact promoter of the 2M gene. This observation supports results obtained by one other study in which the effects of SF-1 were blunted by COUP-TF (5)..

From this, we conclude that the binding of COUP-TF to DR1 and DR2 overlaps the SF-1 site or adjacent sites. However, despite the dramatic reduction in the binding affinity of COUP-TF to the SF-1 mutant region, COUP-TF retained potent repressor activity as revealed by the markedly reduced basal activity of the SF-1 mutant construct.

In the case of the PRLRE, granulosa cell differentiation is obligatory, in part, because of the increased expression of PRLRs on the cell surface. Increased PRLR number enhances the activation of Stat 5b, which is constituitively expressed in the same amount in immature as well as differentiated granulosa cells. In the case of the ORRE, the molecular basis for the enhanced activity of this region in differentiated cells, as opposed to immature cells, remains to be determined but likely involves altered functional activity and complex interactions of SF-1 or COUP-TF on the ORRE. As shown herein, the amounts and relative ratios of these two factors binding to the 2M ORRE are different in immature and differentiated granulosa cells. There is a relative 6-fold increase in SF-1 binding in differentiated granulosa cells compared with the immature granulosa cells. Therefore, increased basal activity of the 2M promoter may depend on the increased binding of this transcriptional activator. In addition, functional changes are likely to involve the selective phosphorylation of either factor or a coregulatory molecule. Phosphorylation of SF-1 would be predicted to increase activity of the ORRE, whereas phosphorylation of COUP-TF might decrease its repressor activity on the ORRE. The phosphorylation of either factor might alter the recruitment of other coregulatory molecules. Phosphorylation of SF-1 has been shown to occur in differentiated granulosa cells (45) and, therefore, may be a critical event in increasing both basal activity of 2M as well as increasing the expression of PRLR. In combination, these two events promote enhanced transcription of 2M by PRL. As mentioned above, most cells do not express SF-1 but do express COUP-TF.

0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	5	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   PPAR is a nuclear receptor that controls lipid and glucose metabolism and exerts antiinflammatory activities. The factors regulating human PPAR (hPPAR) gene expression remain largely unexplored. To study the mechanisms controlling hPPAR expression, the hPPAR gene promoter was identified and characterized. First, an alternatively spliced exon within the 5'-untranslated region of the hPPAR gene was identified by RT-PCR. Next, the transcription start site was mapped and the hPPAR gene promoter was cloned and functionally analyzed. Because PPAR levels are elevated in tissues expressing the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF4), such as liver, the regulation of hPPAR by HNF4 was examined. Transient transfections in HepG2 and Cos cells showed that HNF4 enhances hPPAR promoter activity. 5'-Deletion and mutation analysis of the hPPAR promoter identified a regulatory element (RE) consisting of a degenerate hexamer repeat with a single nucleotide spacer (direct repeat 1), termed HNF4-RE. Gel shift assays demonstrated that HNF4 binds to this HNF4-RE. Furthermore, HNF4 increased the activity of a heterologous promoter driven by two copies of the HNF4-RE. The nuclear receptor COUP-TFII also bound this site and down-regulated basal as well as HNF4-induced hPPAR promoter activity. Finally, PPAR was shown to bind the HNF4-RE, leading to an induction of PPAR expression in hepatocytes. In summary, the organization of the 5'-flanking and untranslated region of the hPPAR gene was characterized and the hPPAR promoter region has been identified.

The factors regulating human PPAR (hPPAR) gene expression remain largely unexplored. To study the mechanisms controlling hPPAR expression, the hPPAR gene promoter was identified and characterized. First, an alternatively spliced exon within the 5'-untranslated region of the hPPAR gene was identified by RT-PCR. Next, the transcription start site was mapped and the hPPAR gene promoter was cloned and functionally analyzed. Because PPAR levels are elevated in tissues expressing the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF4), such as liver, the regulation of hPPAR by HNF4 was examined. Transient transfections in HepG2 and Cos cells showed that HNF4 enhances hPPAR promoter activity. 5'-Deletion and mutation analysis of the hPPAR promoter identified a regulatory element (RE) consisting of a degenerate hexamer repeat with a single nucleotide spacer (direct repeat 1), termed HNF4-RE. Gel shift assays demonstrated that HNF4 binds to this HNF4-RE. Furthermore, HNF4 increased the activity of a heterologous promoter driven by two copies of the HNF4-RE. The nuclear receptor COUP-TFII also bound this site and down-regulated basal as well as HNF4-induced hPPAR promoter activity. Finally, PPAR was shown to bind the HNF4-RE, leading to an induction of PPAR expression in hepatocytes. In summary, the organization of the 5'-flanking and untranslated region of the hPPAR gene was characterized and the hPPAR promoter region has been identified. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that the hPPAR gene is regulated by nuclear receptors, such as HNF-4, COUP-TFII, and PPAR..

PPAR mediates the action of fibrates on plasma lipid levels by regulating the transcription of genes controlling lipoprotein metabolism (4). Moreover, PPAR is a pivotal modulator of intracellular lipid metabolism by regulating the gene expression of proteins involved in FA uptake, FA esterification, FA entry into the mitochondria, peroxisomal and mitochondrial FA catabolism, and ketone body synthesis (1). In addition to intra- and extracellular lipid metabolism, glucose and energy homeostasis as well as body weight were also reported to be influenced by PPAR activators (5, 6). Furthermore, PPAR is an important regulator of vascular inflammation. PPAR inhibits the expression of various inducible factors implicated in the promotion of a local inflammatory response within the developing atherosclerotic plaque (2). In addition, PPAR regulates the expression of lipoprotein receptors and cholesterol transporters involved in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway in macrophages (7, 8).

High levels of PPAR expression are observed in tissues with elevated FA catabolic rates, such as liver, heart, kidney, muscle, and the large intestine (15, 16, 17). In rodents, PPAR is regulated by stress (18) and by different hormones, such as GH, glucocorticoids, insulin, and leptin (19, 20, 21, 22). PPAR expression oscillates diurnally (18), is diminished with age (23), and is induced during brown adipocyte differentiation (24). Furthermore, starvation increases PPAR expression levels in liver leading to changes in mRNA levels of PPAR target genes (25). Low PPAR mRNA levels result in decreased PPAR activity in pancreatic islets of obese Zucker diabetic (fa/fa) rats (22), in rat cardiomyocytes during cardiac hypertrophy (26), in livers of male Syrian hamsters upon lipopolysaccharide administration (27), and in intestinal epithelial cells during hypoxia (28). Moreover, PPAR expression levels correlate with human apo AI gene induction in response to fibrate treatment as demonstrated in human apo AI transgenic mice crossed with PPAR-deficient mice (29)..

The aim of our study was to determine the 5'-UTR structure of the hPPAR gene and to identify and characterize the hPPAR promoter. To identify noncoding exons within this region, different primers were designed and PCRs were carried out on reverse transcribed human liver RNA from two different subjects. Using this approach, a novel exon was discovered. When PCR was performed using a primer designed at the 3'-end of exon 2 (primer 13, Fig. 1A) and a primer hybridizing the 3'-end of exon 1 (primer 15C, Fig. 1A), a fragment of 158 bp containing both exon 1 and exon 2 was amplified (Fig. 1B, left), as expected. Additionally, a second fragment 150 bp longer was repeatedly coamplified even at stringent PCR conditions. Similar results were obtained with four other human liver and adipose tissue mRNA samples (data not shown), indicating that the unexpected additional PCR product corresponded to a rather common transcript. Cloning and sequencing of this PCR fragment revealed the presence of 156 bp of novel sequence downstream of the sequence previously known as exon 1 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, when PCR was performed using a primer within the novel sequence (primer IP3) and the exon 1-specific primer 15C, a fragment was amplified, further indicating the existence of this additional exon (Fig. 1B, right). The novel sequence was located between exon 1 and 2 in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone containing the hPPAR gene and was flanked by ag/gt consensus acceptor and donor splice sites, respectively (Fig. 1C). The newly identified exon was named exon 1b, by analogy to the nomenclature used for the alternatively spliced exon present in the 5'-UTR of the mouse PPAR gene (36), whereas the previously known exon 1 was renamed exon 1a (Fig. 1A). In addition, when 5'-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) reactions were carried out using primer IP3 located in exon 1b as gene-specific primer, a fragment covering the novel exon plus a sequence corresponding to exon 1a was amplified (data not shown), corroborating the existence of a second alternative transcript containing exon 1b in addition to exon 1a. This suggests that exon 1b is spliced out alternatively giving rise to two different transcripts with distinct 5'-UTRs (Fig. 1A). Thus, both mouse and human PPAR (hPPAR) genes display a similar 5'-UTR genomic organization. However, the noncoding exons do not show a significant degree of sequence homology among species (38% for exon 1a and 29% for exon 1b)..

Genomic sequence upstream of the previously reported exon 1a sequence (37) was obtained by primer walking the BAC clone containing the hPPAR gene. Despite the overall low degree of homology shown by the PPAR 5'-UTRs among different species, a sequence of around 60 bp was found to be 88% homologous to a region close to the transcription start site in the mouse PPAR 5'-UTR (Fig. 2A). This prompted us to examine whether the transcription start site in the human gene could also be upstream of this region. Accordingly, a primer close to that sequence (primer IP18, Fig. 2A) was used as gene-specific primer in a 5'-RACE-PCR. A 213-bp DNA fragment was amplified from human liver RNA (Fig. 2B) and subsequently sequenced. The most 5'-nucleotide before the poly-dC tail introduced by the 5'-RACE procedure mapped to a T and was designated as nucleotide +1 (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained when a different gene-specific primer (primer 5-GSP) was used in the 5'-RACE-PCR (data not shown). To confirm the results of the 5'-RACE experiments, ribonuclease (RNase) protection analysis was performed. RNase mapping with a 337-nucleotide labeled cRNA probe complementary to bp -22 to +213 (Fig. 2C) gave a major protected band of 213 bp (Fig. 2D), thus confirming the transcription start site that had been identified by 5'-RACE. These data indicate that exon 1a is considerably longer than the partially sequenced exon 1 that had been previously reported (34, 35, 37) and than the exon 1a identified in the mouse PPAR gene (36)..

Because hPPAR is highly expressed in liver (17), the 1,664-bp promoter-containing plasmid, p(H-H)-pGL3, was transiently transfected into human HepG2 hepatoma cells. Activity of this construct was about 8-fold the activity of the parental promoterless construct (pGL3 basic) in these cells (Fig. 4). Next, the promoter activity of different 5'-deletion constructs was evaluated. Deletion from -1,664 to -1,206 did not significantly affect the promoter activity. Truncation to -648 significantly reduced the luciferase activity in HepG2 cells. By contrast, in agreement with hPPAR tissue-selective expression, luciferase activities of the p(H-H)-pGL3 construct and its 5'-deletion mutants were only 2-fold higher than pGL3 basic in Cos-1 cells, a cell line that does not express PPAR. These experiments suggest that these cells are devoid of the factors driving basal hPPAR expression compared with HepG2 cells. The shortest construct, p(P-H)-pGL3, containing the GC-rich proximal promoter was only 2-fold more active relative to pGL3 basic vector in both cell lines compared with the 6-fold activity shown by the p(E-H)-pGL3 construct, which suggests that sequences between -536 and -1,664 may contain binding sites for key transcription factors driving basal hPPAR gene expression..

By contrast, in agreement with hPPAR tissue-selective expression, luciferase activities of the p(H-H)-pGL3 construct and its 5'-deletion mutants were only 2-fold higher than pGL3 basic in Cos-1 cells, a cell line that does not express PPAR. These experiments suggest that these cells are devoid of the factors driving basal hPPAR expression compared with HepG2 cells. The shortest construct, p(P-H)-pGL3, containing the GC-rich proximal promoter was only 2-fold more active relative to pGL3 basic vector in both cell lines compared with the 6-fold activity shown by the p(E-H)-pGL3 construct, which suggests that sequences between -536 and -1,664 may contain binding sites for key transcription factors driving basal hPPAR gene expression..

To this purpose, transient transfection studies were performed with the p(H-H)-pGL3 construct in HepG2 cells. In the presence of increasing concentrations of HNF4, hPPAR promoter activity was induced in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5A). To localize the region that confers HNF4 responsiveness within the hPPAR promoter, cotransfection assays were repeated with a series of 5'-deletion hPPAR promoter constructs (Fig. 5B). These experiments revealed that the HNF4 responsive region resides within the fragment flanked by HindIII and XhoI sites. Analysis of the sequence in this region of the hPPAR promoter revealed two potential hexamer binding sites separated by a single nucleotide between nucleotide -1,492 to -1,483 (Fig. 3), conforming to the DR1 response elements for HNF4 (HNF4-RE). To unequivocally characterize the imperfect DR1 as an HNF4 response element, HepG2 and Cos cells were transfected with a hPPAR promoter construct bearing two nucleotide mutations in the 5'-hexamer of the DR1 element, p(H-H)HNF4-REmut-pGL3. In contrast to the wild-type promoter construct p(H-H)-pGL3, the mutated promoter was not influenced by HNF4 cotransfection in both cell lines (Fig. 5C), thus demonstrating that the hPPAR HNF4-RE (HNF4-RE) indeed confers HNF4 response to the hPPAR promoter..

As shown in Fig. 6, HNF4 bound the HNF4-RE (Fig. 6A, lane 4) and the well characterized C3P site present in the apo CIII promoter (39) with similar efficacy (Fig. 6A, lanes 2 and 4). DNA binding was almost completely abolished when two-point mutations were introduced into the HNF4-RE-labeled oligonucleotide (GCAGCAAAGTTCA instead of GGGGCAAAGTTCA where the underlined letters indicate the mutated nucleotides) (Fig. 6A, lane 5). Furthermore, the specificity of the HNF4-DR1 interaction was demonstrated by competition studies. Inhibition of formation of the complex was shown by the addition of increasing concentrations of either the unlabeled HNF4-RE (Fig. 6B, lanes 3 to 5) or C3P (Fig. 6B, lanes 9 to 11) oligonucleotides, whereas competition with an equivalent amount of unlabeled mutated HNF4-RE did not significantly displace the labeled wild-type element (Fig. 6B, lanes 6 to 8)..

Upon cotransfection of HNF4 into both HepG2 and RK13 cells, the HNF4-REx2S-TKpGL3 transcriptional activity was significantly enhanced (Fig. 7, B and C). By contrast, the reporter activity of a similar heterologous promoter construct containing two copies of the mutated HNF4-RE was not influenced by HNF4 cotransfection (Fig. 7C).

The genomic organization of hPPAR was recently reported (34, 35). The hPPAR gene contains at least eight exons in which exons 1 and 2, the 5'-end of exon 3, and the 3'-end of exon 8 are not translated (34, 35). As an initial step in our study, the 5'-UTR of the hPPAR gene was further characterized, resulting in the completion of the 5'-end sequence of exon 1, renamed exon 1a, and in the identification of an alternatively spliced 5'-variant.

The genomic organization of hPPAR was recently reported (34, 35). The hPPAR gene contains at least eight exons in which exons 1 and 2, the 5'-end of exon 3, and the 3'-end of exon 8 are not translated (34, 35). As an initial step in our study, the 5'-UTR of the hPPAR gene was further characterized, resulting in the completion of the 5'-end sequence of exon 1, renamed exon 1a, and in the identification of an alternatively spliced 5'-variant. An alternatively spliced exon in the mouse PPAR 5'-UTR has been previously reported (36). However, alignment of both mouse and human 5'-UTR sequences revealed no significant degree of homology between them despite the coding exons being very similar between species..

The proximal promoter of the hPPAR gene contains no typical TATA or CCAAT boxes and has a high GC content, including several consensus Sp1 sites, features that are also present in the mouse PPAR promoter (36). Excluding the proximal GC-rich region, both promoters do not show a high degree in sequence homology (40%). However, only a small fragment of the mouse PPAR promoter has been sequenced to date (36). This sequence disparity in both the 5'-UTR and the promoter regions may indicate that PPAR gene expression among species could be regulated in a different manner although sufficient data to establish a thorough comparison between species are lacking at this stage..

Egr proteins could thus be involved in the up-regulation of hPPAR expression upon monocyte differentiation into macrophages (32) although further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Furthermore, potential sites for NFB and AP1, factors involved in the transduction of several cytokine and proinflammatory signals, as well as for the myeloid zinc finger gene, MZF-1, were found in the hPPAR promoter. PPAR inhibition of NFB- and AP1-induced expression of inflammatory response genes (46) lies at the basis of its antiinflammatory activities. It is tempting to speculate that hPPAR expression, in its turn, is controlled by inflammatory cytokines. Because rodent PPAR mRNA levels are increased by glucocorticoids (20, 21), putative GR response elements were searched for. No obvious GR response element could be detected within the hPPAR regulatory region analyzed; however, regulation studies in human tissues or cell lines would be necessary to determine whether hPPAR expression is also modulated by glucocorticoids in humans..

HNF4 is expressed at high levels in liver, kidney, and intestine (47). It binds as homodimers to DR1-like response elements, thereby modulating the expression of several liver-enriched genes encoding apolipoproteins, coagulation factors, serum proteins, proteins of the cytochrome P450 family, and genes involved in FA and glucose metabolism (49). Regulation of hPPAR by HNF4 is consistent with the tissue-expression pattern shown by PPAR. In the present study induction of hPPAR promoter activity by HNF4 is reported. A HNF4-RE was identified at nt -1,492 to -1,483 within the hPPAR promoter. This element closely resembles several HNF4-REs found in other genes and the GGGGCA A AGGTCA consensus HNF4 binding site (50). Moreover, the regulation of PPAR gene expression by HNF4 in vivo in mice was recently demonstrated using HNF4-deficient mice (51). These mice display significantly lower PPAR mRNA levels compared with the wild-type mice, thus demonstrating that PPAR expression is regulated by HNF4 also in mice. Nevertheless, the promoter experiments performed with the hPPAR promoter indicate that the HNF4 site identified is not responsible for the activity of the hPPAR promoter in liver because the promoter construct lacking this site still possesses a significant activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4). This may suggest that this site binds as well other factors, such as COUP-TF, present in these cells that negatively regulate the hPPAR promoter either as a result of a direct repression of the promoter or due to competition with factors, such as HNF4, for binding to the site. In addition, negative factors may bind to sites located between -1,664 and -1,206 bp in the hPPAR promoter. Future studies on the regulation of this promoter will be required to elucidate the factors governing hPPAR gene expression in liver..

0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	83	Members of the COUP-TF family of orphan nuclear receptors have been reported to bind DR1 sites that are also recognized by HNF4 (52). COUP-TF actively represses or antagonizes HNF4-mediated transcriptional activation of several genes (39, 41, 42, 43, 44). COUP-TF II has been shown to play a role in cardiac energy metabolism and heart development (53, 54). In this study, COUP-TFII was also shown to bind the HNF4-RE within the hPPAR regulatory region and to repress both basal and HNF4-induced hPPAR promoter activity. The COUP-TFII antagonism may finely tune HNF4-dependent gene expression. The expression level of a COUP-TFII/HNF4 target gene would therefore depend on the relative concentrations of both transcription factors in a given cell type or during a certain condition. For instance, the age-dependent diminution of apo AI gene expression has been shown to occur at the transcriptional level and to be associated with a decrease in the binding capacity and expression of HNF4 and a parallel increase in COUP-TFII binding and concentration levels (55). Interestingly, PPAR gene expression is also diminished in aged rats (23). Further studies are required to demonstrate whether the molecular mechanisms described for the age-dependent decline of apo AI can also explain the decreased expression of PPAR with age..

This polymorphism shows an enhanced transactivation activity (34) and has been associated with altered plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in type 2 diabetic subjects (34), supporting a role for PPAR in dyslipidemia and diabetes in humans also. Variants have been identified in other exons and introns of the hPPAR gene (Ref. 60 and Flavell, D., I. Pineda Torra, and B. Staels, unpublished observations). However, these polymorphisms either show low frequency in the populations studied or they do not directly affect PPAR activity due to their location in intronic sequences of the gene. Thus, it will be interesting to search for polymorphisms in the promoter sequences of the gene that may affect PPAR expression and function..

Laine), pcDNA3-COUP-TFII [subcloned from pMT2-COUP-TFII (65) into pcDNA3] or pSG5-hPPAR, and either 20 ng or 5 ng of the internal control Renilla luciferase reporter plasmids, pRL-Null (when basal promoter activities of the different deletion constructs were examined) (Promega Corp.) and pRL-C+ (for the remaining transfection experiments), respectively. pRL-C+ was obtained by replacing the luc + cassette in pGL3-C+ (Promega Corp.) with the Renilla gene. When either HNF4 or COUP-TFII plasmid was not cotransfected, pSG5 (Stratagene) or pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) empty vectors were added to the transfection mixture. Luciferase activity was assayed 36 h later using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega Corp.). Transfections were carried out in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least twice..

Donors were physically healthy subjects who died after traumatic brain injury. Permission to use the remaining untransplanted donor liver for scientific research purposes was obtained from the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. After 20 h of culture the medium was discarded and 250  microM fenofibric acid (Laboratories Fournier, Daix, France) or vehicle was added at the indicated concentration in serum-free medium for 24 h. HepG2 (human hepatoblastoma), RK13 (rabbit kidney), and Cos cells were cultured as previously described (31). HepG2 (105), RK13 (8 x 104), and Cos (4 x 104) cells were transfected using the cationic lipid RPR 120535B (kind gift of Aventis, Vitry, France) as described previously (64).

Double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [-32P]ATP by using T4-polynucleotide kinase. Proteins (2  microl) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 20  microl with 2.5  microg poly (dI-dC) and 1  microg herring sperm DNA in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8; 100 mM NaCl; 0.1 mM EDTA; 10% glycerol; 1 mg/ml BSA; and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) before the radiolabeled probe (0.5 ng) was added. Binding reactions were further incubated for 15 min and resolved by 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.25x Tris-borate-EDTA buffer at room temperature. For competition experiments, increasing amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotide HNF4-RE, HNF4-REmut, or C3P (39) were included in the binding reaction just before addition of the labeled oligonucleotide..

We recently reported that the expression of orphan receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF) plays a role in mediating the growth inhibitory effect of trans-retinoic acid (trans-RA) in cancer cells. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which COUP-TF regulates trans-RA activity, we evaluated the effect of COUP-TF on antagonism of AP-1 activity by trans-RA. Our results demonstrated a positive correlation between COUP-TF expression and the ability of trans-RA to inhibit AP-1 activity in various cancer cell lines. In transient transfection assay, expression of COUP-TF strongly inhibited tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced AP-1 transactivation activity and transactivation of c-Jun/c-Fos in both a trans-RA-dependent and -independent manner. In vitro studies demonstrated that the addition of COUP-TF inhibited c-Jun DNA binding through a direct protein-protein interaction that is mediated by the DNA binding domain of COUP-TF and the leucine zipper of c-Jun. Stable expression of COUP-TF in COUP-TF-negative MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells restored the ability of trans-RA to inhibit 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced c-Jun expression. The effect of COUP-TF in enhancing the trans-RA-induced antagonism of AP-1 activity required expression of retinoic acid receptors (RARs), since stable expression of COUP-TF in COUP-TF-negative HT-1376 bladder cancer cells, which do not express RAR and RAR, failed to restore trans-RA-induced AP-1 repression. Thus, COUP-TF, through its physical interaction with AP-1, promotes anticancer effects of retinoids by potentiating their anti-AP-1 activity.

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	6	Retinoids, the natural and synthetic vitamin A analogs, exert profound effects on many biological processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation (1, 2), and are recognized as promising agents for the prevention and treatment of various cancers. The effects of retinoids are mainly mediated by two nuclear receptor classes, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)1 and retinoid X receptor (RXR) (3-5). Both are encoded by three different genes (, , and ) and function as ligand-inducible transcription factors in vivo mainly as RXR/RAR heterodimers. trans-Retinoic acid (trans-RA) binds RARs, whereas 9-cis-RA binds both RARs and RXRs. Binding of retinoids to their receptors induces receptor conformational changes that switch on transcription of genes containing RA response elements (RAREs) (3-5). In addition to their positive regulation of RARE-containing genes, retinoid receptors, in response to their ligands, can inhibit effects induced by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and the transcriptional activity of the proto-oncogenes c-Jun and c-Fos (6), which are components of the AP-1 complex, which often has a role in cancer cell proliferation (7). The activation of AP-1-responsive genes by TPA or c-Jun/c-Fos through TPA response elements (TREs) is repressed by retinoid receptors in a ligand-dependent manner (8-10). Conversely, AP-1 represses transactivation of retinoid receptors (8, 9). This mutual antagonism appears to play a critical role in regulating cell growth and differentiation (6). For example, overexpression of c-Jun conferred retinoid resistance to breast cancer cells (11), while overexpression of retinoid receptors enabled trans-RA to inhibit AP-1 activity in ovarian cancer cells and their growth (12). The functional interaction between AP-1 and retinoid receptors is also observed for other nuclear receptors, including glucocorticoid receptor (13-16), thyroid hormone receptor (17), vitamin D receptor, estrogen receptor (18, 19), and androgen receptor (AR) (18)..

Transcription of various AP-1-responsive genes, such as collagenase and stromelysin, which have roles in tumor progression and invasiveness (20), is inhibited by retinoids (8-10) and has been reported to contribute to their reversal of human bronchial epithelial squamous differentiation (21). Retinyl methyl ether, which effectively prevents mammary cancer in animals, strongly suppressed AP-1 activity in breast cancer cell (22). Interestingly, RAR, a negative regulator of cancer cell growth (23), potently inhibits AP-1 activity and collagenase expression in both breast and lung cancer cells (24). Recent studies demonstrate that retinoids that specifically inhibit AP-1 activity but antagonize RAR transactivation on RAREs inhibited the growth of many different types of cancer cells (25-27). Anti-AP-1 retinoids inhibited squamous differentiation of human bronchial epithelial cells (21), TPA-induced transformation and the clonal growth of the promotion-sensitive JB6 mouse epidermal cell line (28), and papilloma formation in animals (29). Thus, anti-AP-1 activity of retinoids contributes to their chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects, presumably by blocking the processes of tumor promotion and cell transformation..

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	10	The mechanism by which retinoids inhibit AP-1 activity remains largely unclear. Unlike the effect of retinoid receptors on RAREs, inhibition of AP-1 activity by retinoid receptors is independent of retinoid receptor-RARE interaction (8-10). Previous studies suggested several possible mechanisms for AP-1 inhibition by retinoid receptors. First, retinoid receptors are reported to physically interact with c-Jun and/or c-Fos (8, 9). This interaction results in the mutual inhibition of their DNA binding and transactivation functions and could explain the cross-talk occurring between AP-1 and retinoid signaling. However, a large excess of either retinoid receptor protein or c-Jun and c-Fos proteins was required to inhibit in vitro binding to the TRE or RARE, respectively (8, 9). Because the in vivo footprint assay for glucocorticoid receptor and AP-1 interaction did not reveal any effect on DNA binding (30), whether RAR and AP-1 directly interact in vivo remains to be established. Subsequently, it was suggested that blocking activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway that activates AP-1 might be responsible for AP-1 inhibition by retinoid and other nuclear receptors (31). Although this mechanism may explain how retinoids inhibit AP-1 activity under some conditions, it does not address how mutual inhibition occurs. Recent results suggest that the molecular basis of receptor-mediated inhibition of AP-1 transcriptional activation might be due to competition for a common coactivator, such as the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CBP), which is required for transcriptional activation by both the AP-1 complex and RARs (32). However, a domain of RAR capable of inhibiting AP-1 activity, such as the DNA-binding domain (33), does not interact with CBP (32). The development of retinoids that specifically inhibit AP-1 activity without transactivating RARs (25, 26) also argues against the involvement of RAR coactivators in RARs-AP-1 cross-talk. Thus, the availability of CBP is unlikely to be the sole modulator of RAR and AP-1-signaling pathways, and other adapter proteins may be involved in the antagonism of AP-1 activity by RARs..

COUP-TF is encoded by two distinct genes, COUP-TFI (EAR-3) (36, 37) and COUP-TFII (ARP-1) (38). Both show exceptional homology and overlapping expression patterns, suggesting their redundant functions (39). COUP-TF can modulate retinoid responses through either its high affinity binding to various RAREs or its heterodimerization with RXR (40-43). We previously reported that COUP-TF expression was required for cancer cell growth inhibition by trans-RA (35). We further demonstrated that the effect of COUP-TF is partly due to its induction of RAR that mediates growth inhibition by retinoids in various cancer cells (35)..

We previously reported that COUP-TF expression was required for cancer cell growth inhibition by trans-RA (35). We further demonstrated that the effect of COUP-TF is partly due to its induction of RAR that mediates growth inhibition by retinoids in various cancer cells (35)..

Our data demonstrate that COUP-TF expression in various cancer cell lines correlated with the ability of trans-RA to suppress AP-1 transcriptional activity. In addition, we found that COUP-TF effectively suppressed AP-1 transcriptional activity by interacting with c-Jun to cause loss of c-Jun DNA binding. This interaction required COUP-TF DNA-binding domain and the c-Jun leucine-zipper domain. Although AP-1 inhibition by COUP-TF did not require trans-RA, COUP-TF strongly potentiated the AP-1 antagonism by trans-RA when RARs were expressed. Our results demonstrate that interaction between COUP-TF and AP-1 is involved in regulating anti-AP-1 activity of retinoids in cancer cells and suggest that COUP-TF plays a role in the cross-talk between retinoid and AP-1 signalings.

Since inhibition of AP-1 activity by retinoids is known to contribute to their anticancer effects, we studied whether COUP-TF expression was involved in the process. The effect of trans-RA on inhibiting AP-1 activity (Fig. 1A) was evaluated in COUP-TF-positive T-47D and ZR-75-1 breast cancer and Calu-6 lung cancer cell lines and in COUP-TF-negative MDA-MB231 breast cancer, H292 lung cancer, and HT-1376 bladder cancer cell lines (35). AP-1 activity induced by TPA was determined by transient transfection using the reporter 73Col-CAT, which contains a TRE that binds AP-1 (8). TPA-induced reporter activity was strongly inhibited in a trans-RA-dependent manner in the COUP-TF-positive ZR-75-1, T-47D, and Calu-6 cell lines. In contrast, trans-RA showed very little effect on TPA-induced 73Col-CAT activity in the COUP-TF-negative MDA-MB231, H292, and HT-1376 cell lines. Thus, COUP-TF expression correlates positively with the ability of trans-RA to inhibit AP-1 transcriptional activity..

Therefore, we transiently transfected the COUP-TF expression vector and the 73Col-CAT reporter into the COUP-TF-negative cell lines, in which trans-RA did not inhibit AP-1 transcriptional activity (Fig. 1B). Upon COUP-TF transfection, trans-RA inhibited TPA-induced reporter activity in both MDA-MB231 and H292 cells in a COUP-TF concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, COUP-TF transfection alone produced some inhibition of AP-1 activity. This observation suggested that COUP-TF inhibited AP-1 activity in both trans-RA-dependent and -independent manners in MDA-MB231 and H292 cells. When evaluated in HT-1376 cells, COUP-TF expression was able to inhibit AP-1 activity independently of trans-RA (Fig. 1B). However, it failed to confer the ability of trans-RA to inhibit TPA-induced reporter activity, even at high transfection levels, suggesting that trans-RA-dependent inhibition of AP-1 activity by COUP-TF is impaired in this cell line..

We then examined the anti-AP-1 activity of COUP-TF in HeLa cells, in which TPA strongly induced the transcription of the transfected 73Col-CAT reporter. Similar to that observed in other cancer cell lines (Fig. 1B), COUP-TFI cotransfection inhibited TPA-induced reporter activity in a COUP-TFI concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Cotransfection of COUP-TFII produced almost identical results (data not shown). Activation of collagenase promoter by TPA occurs mainly through induction of AP-1 activity that activates the TRE in the promoter (7). We therefore examined whether COUP-TF expression also interfered with transactivation activity of c-Jun homodimer and c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer. Cotransfection of 73Col-CAT with the c-Jun expression vector into HeLa cells led to about 5-fold induction of reporter expression (Fig. 2B), presumably due to activation of the collagenase promoter by the c-Jun homodimer. The c-Jun-induced 73Col-CAT reporter activity was repressed when COUP-TFI expression vector was cotransfected. Similarly, 73Col-CAT reporter activity induced by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers was inhibited by COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII (Fig. 2C). To determine that inhibition of collagenase promoter activity by COUP-TF was mediated by the TRE, we evaluated how COUP-TFI affected the TRE-tk-CAT reporter, which has a TRE sequence fused to the thymidine kinase promoter (Fig. 2B). Our result showed that cotransfection of COUP-TFI significantly inhibited c-Jun-induced TRE-tk-CAT activity (Fig. 2B). These results clearly demonstrate that COUP-TF inhibits transcriptional activity of c-Jun homodimer and c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer and that the inhibition of AP-1 activity by COUP-TF on the TRE is responsible for its antagonism of TPA activity..

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	37	Inhibition of c-Jun Binding to DNA by COUP-TF-- Inhibition of AP-1 activity by several nuclear receptors has been shown to be due to their inhibition of AP-1 binding to DNA (8, 9, 13-15, 17, 22, 47). To study whether inhibition of AP-1 DNA binding by COUP-TF was involved in its inhibition of AP-1 activity, the purified collagenase promoter fragment was used as a probe in gel shift assays for binding of in vitro synthesized c-Jun protein in the absence or presence of COUP-TF protein (Fig. 3A). c-Jun alone formed a strong complex with the promoter. However, upon preincubation with COUP-TF protein, c-Jun binding was significantly inhibited. The addition of COUP-TF protein did not show any new complex formed with the collagenase promoter, indicating that the inhibitory effect of COUP-TF is not due to its direct binding to the collagenase promoter. We also studied the effect of COUP-TF on binding of c-Jun to the TRE. Preincubation with COUP-TF protein similarly inhibited c-Jun binding to the TRE derived from the collagenase promoter (Fig. 3B). As a comparison, preincubation of c-Jun with TR3 orphan receptor (34) that could not antagonize c-Jun transactivation (data not shown) did not inhibit c-Jun binding to the TRE. This result demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of COUP-TF on c-Jun binding to the collagenase promoter is not due to regions other than the TRE in the promoter. Next, we compared the inhibitory effect of COUP-TF with that of RAR that is known to repress AP-1 activity and inhibit c-Jun binding to TRE (8). Whereas an equal amount of COUP-TF significantly inhibited c-Jun binding to the collagenase promoter, an equal amount of RAR did not show any detectable inhibition (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of c-Jun binding required a 5-fold excess of RAR, similar to that observed before (8). The addition of trans-RA did not enhance the inhibitory effect of RAR (Ref. 8 and data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that the inhibition of c-Jun binding to the TRE contributes to its suppression of AP-1 transcriptional activity by COUP-TF and that COUP-TF is a more effective inhibitor than RAR..

Inhibition of c-Jun binding required a 5-fold excess of RAR, similar to that observed before (8). The addition of trans-RA did not enhance the inhibitory effect of RAR (Ref. 8 and data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that the inhibition of c-Jun binding to the TRE contributes to its suppression of AP-1 transcriptional activity by COUP-TF and that COUP-TF is a more effective inhibitor than RAR..

In vitro synthesized c-Jun was preincubated with the indicated molar excess of COUP-TF, RAR, or TR3.

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	40	Interaction of c-Jun and COUP-TF-- Our observation that COUP-TF inhibits transactivation and DNA binding by c-Jun prompted us to examine whether COUP-TF and c-Jun interact directly using GST pull-down assay (Fig. 4). In vitro synthesized radiolabeled COUP-TFII was specifically pulled down by bacterially expressed GST-c-Jun hybrid protein but not by GST protein (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that COUP-TF and c-Jun interact in solution. To identify the domain of COUP-TFII responsible for interacting with c-Jun, COUP-TFII deletion mutants (Fig. 4A) were constructed and analyzed on the 73Col-CAT reporter for antagonism of AP-1 activity in HeLa cells (Fig. 4A) and for their interaction with c-Jun using the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 4B). Cotransfection of the c-Jun expression vector alone induced reporter transcription (Fig. 4A), whereas cotransfection with one of the C-terminal deletion mutants COUP-TFII7, COUP-TFII30, or COUP-TFII108 strongly inhibited c-Jun-induced reporter activity, as was observed using the wild-type COUP-TFII. N-terminal domain deletion mutants, such as COUP-TFIIN25, COUP-TFIIN50, and COUP-TFIIN75, also retained the inhibitory effect on AP-1 activity by COUP-TFII. In contrast, partial (COUP-TFIIN125) or complete deletion of the DNA-binding domain (COUP-TFIIDBD) abrogated anti-c-Jun activity completely. In the GST pull-down assay, COUP-TFII mutants that effectively suppressed AP-1 activity, such as COUP-TFII7, COUP-TFII30, COUP-TFII108, COUP-TFIIN25, COUP-TFIIN50, and COUP-TFIIN75, were pulled down by GST-c-Jun protein, whereas COUP-TFIIDBD, which failed to suppress AP-1 activity, was not (Fig. 4B). Thus, inhibition of AP-1 transcriptional activity by the COUP-TFII mutants correlated with their ability to interact with c-Jun. These observations further suggest that a direct c-Jun/COUP-TF interaction accounts for the inhibition of AP-1 activity by COUP-TF and that the DBD of COUP-TF is essential..

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	42	We also identified the region of c-Jun required for COUP-TF interaction (Fig. 5). Deletion of amino acids 73-232 from c-Jun (c-JunAvaI) did not affect its ability to pull down COUP-TFII. In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal domain of c-Jun from amino acid 191 to 331 (c-JunbZIP), which encompasses the leucine-zipper region and basic region, completely abolished its ability to pull down COUP-TFII. Thus, the C-terminal domain, but not the N-terminal domain, of c-Jun is responsible for COUP-TF interaction..

Treatment of both cell lines with TPA strongly induced c-Jun expression as determined by Northern blotting (Fig. 6). Induction of c-Jun expression by TPA was probably due to an AP-1-binding site in the c-Jun promoter (7). Treatment with trans-RA did not affect basal c-Jun expression in both lines and did not inhibit TPA-induced c-Jun expression in MDA-MB231 cells. However, pretreatment of MB231/COUP#16 cells with trans-RA completely abolished TPA-induced c-Jun expression.

The stable clone, HT-1376/COUP#7, which expresses high levels of COUP-TF, was analyzed for the effect of trans-RA on TPA activity (Fig. 7). About a 4-fold induction of c-Jun expression by TPA was observed in HT-1376 cells. However, the induction of c-Jun expression was largely reduced in HT-1376/COUP#7 cells, with only about a 2-fold induction. Interestingly, the basal level of c-Jun expression was also slightly reduced in HT-1376/COUP#7 cells. Despite the reduction of c-Jun expression in the absence or presence of TPA, trans-RA failed to inhibit basal and TPA-induced c-Jun expression in both wild-type and COUP-TF-expressing cells. Thus, COUP-TF expression is not sufficient to confer trans-RA-induced anti-AP-1 activity in HT-1376 cells..

Unlike MDA-MB231 cells that express RAR (48) and RAR when COUP-TF is expressed (35), HT-1376 cells did not express detectable RAR or RAR (Fig. 7), although RAR was expressed (data not shown). This result suggested that modulation of trans-RA-induced anti-AP-1 activity by COUP-TF might require RAR or RAR. The effect of RAR expression on the ability of COUP-TF to regulate trans-RA activity was then examined using transient transfection in HT-1376 cells. The 73Col-CAT reporter was transfected into HT-1376 cells with or without c-Jun and COUP-TF and/or RAR vector. Transfected cells were treated with or without trans-RA. As shown in Fig. 8A, transfected COUP-TF repressed AP-1 activity in the absence of trans-RA. In contrast, transfected RAR (10 ng) led to inhibition of AP-1 activity in a trans-RA dependent manner. The addition of COUP-TF significantly enhanced the trans-RA-induced inhibition of AP-1 activity by RAR (Fig. 8A). Similar results were observed using HeLa cells (Fig. 8B). Thus, efficient inhibition of AP-1 activity by trans-RA activity by COUP-TF requires both COUP-TF and RAR..

Inhibition of AP-1 activity has been proposed as one mechanism by which retinoids exert their anticancer effects (6). Despite extensive studies in the last few years, how retinoids specifically antagonize AP-1 activity remains largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence that COUP-TF is involved in regulating the antagonism of AP-1 transactivational activity by trans-RA. COUP-TF, by physically interacting with c-Jun, inhibits AP-1 DNA binding and transactivation and is required for efficient inhibition of AP-1 activity by liganded RARs. Our results suggest that COUP-TF plays a role in the cross-talk between retinoid and AP-1 signaling pathways..

Stable expression of COUP-TF in COUP-TF-negative cancer cells restores their sensitivity to trans-RA, demonstrating that COUP-TF can mediate anticancer effects of trans-RA (35). By studying anti-AP-1 activity of trans-RA in various cancer cell lines, we found a close correlation between COUP-TF expression and the anti-AP-1 activity of trans-RA (Fig. 1). In COUP-TF-positive ZR-75-1, T-47D, and Calu-6 cancer cell lines (35), trans-RA strongly inhibited the ability of TPA to activate transcription of the collagenase promoter, whereas in COUP-TF-negative MDA-MB231, H292, and HT-1376 cell lines, trans-RA failed to suppress TPA activity (Fig. 1). This finding is consistent with a previous study showing that trans-RA effectively inhibited AP-1 activity in ZR-75-1 and T-47D cells but not in MDA-MB231 cells (49). The requirement of COUP-TF in trans-RA-mediated AP-1 inhibition was further demonstrated by our findings that transient expression of COUP-TF in COUP-TF-negative cells (Fig. 1B) restored the ability of trans-RA to inhibit TPA-induced AP-1 transactivation and that stable expression of COUP-TF in MBA-MB231 cells enabled trans-RA to inhibit TPA-induced c-Jun expression (Fig. 6)..

Our observations that COUP-TF can effectively interact with c-Jun in vitro (Figs. 3 and 4) and inhibit AP-1 transcriptional activity on transient transfection (Fig. 2) also suggest that COUP-TF is directly involved in antagonizing AP-1 activity..

This study reveals that the orphan receptor COUP-TF behaves similarly. The molecular basis of the interaction between nuclear receptors and AP-1 pathways remains largely unknown. Models proposed include direct protein-protein interaction (8, 9, 13-15), inhibition of Jun N-terminal kinase activity (31), and competition for CBP (32). Our results of GST pull-down assays (Figs. 4B and 5) and mutation analysis (Figs. 4 and 5) support the first model. The requirement for the COUP-TF DBD for c-Jun binding is similar to observations that the DBDs of glucocorticoid receptor (14, 15) and RAR (47) are essential for their interaction with AP-1. Interestingly, the in vitro DNA-binding study showed that COUP-TF is a more effective inhibitor of AP-1 binding than RAR (Fig. 3) on the basis of the levels of each receptor to exert this effect..

Such a ligand-independent inhibition of AP-1 activity may restrict expression levels of AP-1-responsive genes in cancer cells (Figs. 6 and 7). Interestingly, we observed that COUP-TF expression potentiates antagonism of AP-1 activity by trans-RA. However, regulation of trans-RA activity by COUP-TF appears to require RAR or RAR, because transiently transfected COUP-TF was unable to confer anti-AP-1 activity to trans-RA in HT-1376 cells lacking RAR or - (Fig. 8A) or HeLa cells (Fig. 8B) unless RAR was cotransfected. In addition, stable expression of COUP-TF restored trans-RA-induced anti-AP-1 activity in MDA-MB231 cells (Fig. 6) having RARs (48) but not in HT-1376 cells lacking RAR and - (Fig. 7). Thus, expression of both RAR/ and COUP-TF is required for optimal inhibition of AP-1 activity by trans-RA..

Based on our observation that COUP-TF more effectively inhibits c-Jun binding to DNA than RAR (Fig. 3), it is tempting to speculate that COUP-TF, with its ability to interact with both RAR (35, 50) and c-Jun (Fig. 3), may function as a bridging factor to mediate RAR/AP-1 interaction. In this model, the COUP-TF/RAR heterodimer would strongly interact with AP-1 in the presence of trans-RA to inhibit the DNA binding of AP-1 and its transactivation. Similarly, COUP-TF, by interacting with c-Jun, might also potentiate the inhibition of RAR/ transactivation by AP-1. Unfortunately, perhaps due to rapid formation of the COUP-TF homodimer after COUP-TF expression in vitro (40, 51), we were unsuccessful in demonstrating the interaction between RAR/COUP-TF heterodimer and c-Jun in gel shift or GST pull-down assays (data not shown). Another possible mechanism for inhibiting AP-1 transactivation by COUP-TF may involve its recruiting of a transcriptional corepressor. COUP-TF has been widely considered as a potent negative transcriptional regulator (40-43) due to its effective interaction with corepressors, such as N-CoR and SMRT (52). The interaction between COUP-TF and both RAR and AP-1 may recruit transcriptional corepressors to the complex, thereby enhancing the mutual repression of AP-1 and RAR transcriptional activity. Interestingly, COUP-TF interacts with a variety of nuclear receptors, including RXR (41), TR (40, 50), estrogen receptor (53, 54), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (55). It remains to be determined whether and how COUP-TF is involved in modulating the anti-AP-1 activity by their ligands.     ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	4	The TR4 orphan receptor is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that modulates gene expression via binding to the AGGTCA direct repeat hormone response element. Here we report a functional study of TR4 interaction with the core promoter of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay shows that TR4 can bind to the direct repeat 1 sequence element (AGGTTAAAGGTCT, nucleotide coordinates 1757-1769, TR4RE-HBV) on the HBV core promoter. TR4 also can enhance the activity of a synthetic luciferase reporter linked with four copies of TR4RE-HBV in either liver HepG2 or non-liver H1299 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, TR4 represses the activity of a luciferase reporter containing the entire HBV genome sequences. Moreover, mutation of this TR4RE-HBV site in the HBV core promoter diminishes the TR4 suppression effect. This TR4-induced suppression of HBV core promoter activity is further confirmed by primer extension analysis of the HBV core RNAs, showing that TR4 represses both pre-core and core mRNAs. Further dissection of this repressive mechanism indicates that TR4 may suppress the HBV core promoter activity via repressing HNF4-mediated transactivation by protein-protein interactions without inhibition of HNF4 DNA binding. Furthermore, our results indicate that the N- and C-terminal regions of TR4 protein are required for TR4-HNF4 interaction. It is possible that TR4-HNF4 interaction may block the HNF4 function that results in the suppression of HBV gene expression. Together, these results demonstrate that TR4 can serve as a negative modulator in the transcriptional regulation of HBV core gene expression.

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	6	Hepatitis B virus (HBV)1 is a small virus with a 3.2-kb partially double-stranded DNA genome, containing four open reading frames: the surface antigen, the core antigen, the polymerase, and the X protein (1, 2). HBV is a major pathogen causing acute and chronic liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (3, 4). HBV transcripts are regulated by the transcriptional control of four different promoters and two enhancer elements (5). HBV is replicated from a RNA intermediate as a template for reverse transcription (1). The core promoter controls the expression of the 3.5-kb core mRNA (C mRNA) as the template for replication, and the expression of the pre-core mRNA (pre-C mRNA) for the translation of the HBeAg precursor (6). Recently, multiple binding sites for liver-specific or ubiquitous transcription factors and several hormone response elements (HRE) have been identified in the core promoter region, including Sp1 (7, 8), TATA-binding protein (9), HNF3 (10), HNF4 (11), C/EBP (12), and other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, such as the retinoid X receptor (RXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), COUP-TF1, and ARP1 (13). For example, HNF4 and RXR/PPAR can stimulate the expression of the 3.5-kb core RNA, COUP-TF1 suppresses the expression of both the pre-C RNA and C RNA, and TR2 preferentially represses the expression of the pre-C RNA (14). These findings suggest that these nuclear receptors may play important roles in viral transcription. The detailed mechanisms of how the core promoter is differentially regulated by these nuclear receptors remain unclear..

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	8	The testicular orphan receptor 4 (TR4) (NR2C2) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (15-17). This family includes classic steroid hormone receptors, the thyroid hormone receptor, the retinoid receptors, and many nuclear orphan receptors whose physiological ligands have not been identified (18). Members of this superfamily typically contain two major conserved domains, the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the ligand-binding domain (LBD) (18). Most nuclear receptors bind to their cognate ligands, translocate into the nucleus, and bind to the specific HREs to turn on their downstream target genes. TR4 was isolated from human prostate and testis cDNA libraries and is considered to be an orphan receptor, because its ligand has not been found (15). Our previous data showed that TR4 recognizes different AGGTCA direct repeat (DR) sequences either inducing or suppressing its target genes. For example, TR4 induces reporters containing the DR1 site of human ciliary neurotrophic factor  receptor promoter and the DR4 site of the -myosin heavy chain promoter (19, 20). In contrast, TR4 suppresses RXR/retinoic acid receptor (DR1), vitamin D3 receptor (DR3), and RXR/PPAR (DR1)-mediated transactivation as shown by the reporter assay (21-23). These results suggest that TR4 may act as a negative regulator of its target genes containing hormone response elements (HREs) by competition with other nuclear receptors for binding to the HREs (21, 23). In addition, our previous data showed that TR4 could also suppress androgen receptor-mediated transactivation via protein-protein interaction (22)..

Also, there are many other nuclear receptors expressed in the liver, such as HNF4 (24) and RXR/PPAR (25, 26). These findings suggest that these nuclear receptors in the liver can coordinately regulate gene expression by interacting with HRE sequences in the promoters of their target genes. Our data show that TR4 can interfere with a number of other nuclear receptors by competing for binding to the same HREs (21, 22)..

We tested whether the TR4 plays a role in regulating the activity of the core promoter through binding to the HRE-DR1 site. We showed that TR4 binds to the DR1 site in the HBV core promoter and strongly activates a reporter containing synthetic DR1 response elements. Moreover, we demonstrated that TR4 could suppress both pre-C and C RNA expression, which was also confirmed by the luciferase assay using a reporter containing the entire core promoter. Our data further suggest that TR4 may suppress HBV core promoter activity via the interruption of HNF4-induced HBV core promoter by protein-protein interaction with HNF4. These data demonstrate that TR4 can function as a repressor in liver cells to suppress HBV gene expression and replication.

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	14	Plasmids-- The plasmids CpFL(4)LUC, CpLUC, XpHNF4LUC, and CpM2LUC were gifts from Dr. A. McLachlan (The Scripps Research Institute) and were described previously (13). The plasmid pCDNAI-HNF4 was a gift from Dr. M. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras (Boston University, Boston, MA). pG4LUC was a gift from Dr. K. L. Guan (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI). The pCMX-TR4, pET14b-TR4, pSG5-VDR, and pCMV-TR2 plasmids were constructed as described previously (27, 28). pWTDHBV contains the head-to-tail dimer of the wild type HBV genome DNA (adw2) (8). The GST-TR4, TR4-N-DBD, and TR4-LBD fusion constructs were described in our previous study (29). The GAL4-HNF4 expression plasmid for one-hybrid assay was made by inserting the PCR-generated BamHI/XbaI fragment (amino acids 1-465) of HNF4 from pCDNAI-HNF4 into pM containing the GAL4 DBD-(1-147) (Invitrogen)..
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	15	Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay-- The EMSA reaction was performed as described previously (20). Briefly, TR4 and HNF4 proteins for EMSA were transcribed and translated in TNT reticulocyte lysates (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotide probes for EMSA were end-labeled with [-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs). HepG2 cell nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure of Andrew and Faller (30). The EMSA reactions were performed with 10  microg of nuclear extracts or 2  microl of TNT lysates in an EMSA buffer containing 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 6% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (v/v) Ficoll, 100 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. The reaction mixtures of the proteins and DNA were incubated for 15 min at room temperature.

Our previous data also showed that the TR4 has a better affinity than RXR to recognize the DR1-HRE in the promoter of the cellular retinol-binding protein II gene (21). To examine whether TR4 can bind to the potential DR1-HRE (named TR4RE-HBV, nucleotide coordinates 1751-1778 of the HBV ayw DNA sequence) on the HBV core promoter (13), the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed with in vitro translated TR4 protein, using radiolabeled TR4RE-HBV oligonucleotides as probes. As shown in Fig. 1, no specific supershift complex was seen with an anti-TR4 monoclonal antibody when using mock lysates (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the TR4-CpFL supershift complex was observed in the presence of an anti-TR4 antibody using in vitro translated TR4 lysates (lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, when we replaced wild type TR4RE-HBV with various mutants, we found that TR4 could only bind specifically to the wild type TR4RE-HBV, but not to other mutated TR4RE-HBVs, except for the M3 mutant, which has marginal binding (lanes 5-10). The M1 double mutant with nucleotides changed from A to T (1765) and G to A (1767) represents the HBV mutant frequently found in the patients with chronic hepatitis (33). TR4 was not able to bind to the M1 and M2 mutants (lanes 5 and 6), indicating that the second mutated nucleotide of the DR1-AGGTCA motif is essential for TR4 binding to the TR4RE-HBV. In addition, a TR4-specific antibody can supershift the TR4 TR4RE-HBV complex (lane 4), and this binding can be reduced in the presence of 100-fold unlabeled TR4RE-HBV probe but not the probe with an androgen response element probes or TR4RE-HBV mutant probes (lanes 11-15), suggesting that the binding between TR4 and TR4RE-HBV is specific..

We were interested in determining whether the binding of TR4 to the TR4RE-HBV could also allow TR4 to regulate HBV core promoter activity. A reporter construct containing four synthetic copies of the TR4RE-HBV, CpFL(4)Luc, including the HNF4 consensus binding site, was used to determine the role of TR4 (13). CpFL(4) plasmids were co-transfected with either the parental vector or a TR4 expression vector in liver HepG2, HepG2.1, and non-liver H1299 cells. TR4 can transactivate CpFL(4)Luc activity in a dose-dependent fashion in HepG2, HepG2.1, and H1299 cells (Fig. 3, A, B, and D). To confirm that the increase in reporter activity is not due to nonspecific activation by TR4, we also used the TR4 deletion mutants and VDR in this reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 3 (A-C) the activity of the reporter was only induced in the presence of full-length functional TR4, but not in VDR or the presence of TR4 mutants lacking the C terminus or N terminus, suggesting that the CpFL (TR4RE-HBV) elements of the core HBV promoter may be sufficient for TR4 to regulate HBV core promoter activity..

We therefore examined the effects of TR4 on a reporter construct containing the whole context of the HBV genome sequence (CpLuc) (13).

In contrast, co-transfection of another nuclear receptor, HNF4, induced CpLuc reporter activity, consistent with an earlier report (13). To confirm that the suppression was mediated by TR4 through binding to the TR4RE-HBV of the HBV core promoter, we also used CpM2Luc containing the mutated TR4RE-HBV to analyze TR4 suppression (13). As shown in Fig. 4B, TR4 suppression of the reporter activity was abolished by mutation of the TR4RE-HBV site.

Because earlier reports and our current data show that both TR4 and HNF4 can bind to the TR4RE-HBV site, which is overlapped with the HNF4 consensus binding site (13), we postulated that TR4 may exert its repressive effects on the core promoter through competition with other nuclear receptors such as HNF4 for binding to TR4RE-HBV. We therefore examined their potential mutual influence on the HBV core promoter. When we co-transfected equal amounts of HNF4 and TR4 with the CpLuc reporter in HepG2 hepatoma cells, TR4 repressed HNF4-induced HBV core promoter activity (Fig. 4A, column 3 versus 4), suggesting that HNF4 and TR4 may compete for the same consensus binding site on the HBV core promoter.

Fig. 5 demonstrates that TR4 and HNF4 can both bind to the TR4RE-HBV site, and the DNA binding activity of TR4 was markedly reduced in the presence of HNF4. In contrast, we did not observe any change in HNF4 binding when we added TR4, implying that the simple competition may not fully account for TR4-mediated repression of HNF4 function. This raises the possibility that TR4 may directly block HNF4 transactivation through protein-protein interactions with HNF4 instead of competing for DNA binding sites. Together, Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that TR4 can bind to the same TR4RE-HBV site as well as interact with HNF4 to influence HBV core promoter expression..

To prove this hypothesis, we constructed a plasmid encoding GAL4-HNF4 fusion protein and examined the effect of TR4 expression on HNF4-mediated transactivation in the GAL4 one-hybrid system (35). In this assay, the transcriptional activity of GAL4-HNF4 is independent of the binding of HNF4 and TR4 to their cognate binding site, DR1-HRE. If TR4 can directly regulate HNF4 transcriptional activity, we should see the activity of GAL4-HNF4 would be significantly changed in the presence of TR4 expression. HepG2 cells were co-transfected with GAL4-HN4 and the pG4LUC reporter in the presence or absence of the expression of the TR4 N- or C-terminal deletion of TR4 mutants. As the results show in Fig. 6A, the reporter activity with GAL-HNF4 alone was increased about 3-fold, which was similarly shown by the previous study (35). Interestingly, the expression of TR4 significantly increased the GAL4-HNF4-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig. 6A), indicating that TR4 can directly regulate the transcriptional activity of HNF4, which is independent of the event of the DNA binding and possibly mediated by protein-protein interactions. As expected, the PG4LUC reporter activity with the GAL4 and TR4 was not increased at any significant level (Fig. 6A, columns 1 versus 6), suggesting TR4 influences HNF4 transcriptional activity in a specific manner. Nevertheless, it is not clear how this regulation involving the interaction between TR4 and HNF4 would result in either activation or suppression of HNF4 function. In contrast, the N- or C-terminal deletion of TR4 mutants did not show any effects on the GAL4-HNF4-mediated transactivation, suggesting that these two regions of TR4 protein may be required for TR4 action in this regulation..

Interestingly, the expression of TR4 significantly increased the GAL4-HNF4-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig. 6A), indicating that TR4 can directly regulate the transcriptional activity of HNF4, which is independent of the event of the DNA binding and possibly mediated by protein-protein interactions. As expected, the PG4LUC reporter activity with the GAL4 and TR4 was not increased at any significant level (Fig. 6A, columns 1 versus 6), suggesting TR4 influences HNF4 transcriptional activity in a specific manner. Nevertheless, it is not clear how this regulation involving the interaction between TR4 and HNF4 would result in either activation or suppression of HNF4 function. In contrast, the N- or C-terminal deletion of TR4 mutants did not show any effects on the GAL4-HNF4-mediated transactivation, suggesting that these two regions of TR4 protein may be required for TR4 action in this regulation..

This assay was used to test the effect of TR4 on HNF4-mediated transcriptional activity. HepG2 cells were co-transfected PG4LUC, which contains four tandem repeats of the GAL4-binding sites, with GAL4-HNF4, TR4, or TR4 deletion mutants. B, in vitro synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled HNF4 protein was incubated with GST, GST-TR4, GST-TR4-N-DBD, and GST-TR4-LBD fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were extensively washed after the reaction and applied to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. C, COS1 cells were transfected pCMX-TR4 with either parental vector or pCDNAI-HNF4. After the transfection, the cells were cultured for 48 h, lysed for the immunoprecipitation assay, and the HNF4 signal was detected by Western blotting with a goat anti-HNF4 antibody. The results were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Then, the same blot was stripped and blotted with an anti-TR4 monoclonal antibody. D, HepG2 cells were transfected CpLUC with HNF4, TR4, or TR4 deletion mutants as described in Fig. 4A..
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	43	Next, we hypothesized that TR4 may directly regulate HNF4 transcriptional activity through interacting with HNF4. To test this hypothesis, we applied the GST pull-down assay to determine the potential interaction between HNF4 and TR4. As shown in Fig. 6B, HNF4 protein was pulled down and detected by SDS-PAGE from the mixture of 35S-labeled in vitro translated HNF4 protein incubated with GST-TR4, GST-TR4-N-DBD, or GST-TR4-LBD fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-linked Sepharose beads. Fig. 6B (lane 3) clearly demonstrated that HNF4 interacts with TR4 in vitro. However, the interaction of the deletion mutants of GST-TR4 fusion protein with HNF4 is much weaker, suggesting that instead of direct competition for binding to the TR4RE-HBV, TR4 may interact with HNF4, which could possibly result in the repression of HNF4 function. To further confirm this interaction in liver cells, we co-transfected TR4 and HNF4 into COS1 cells and used a co-immunoprecipitation assay to immunoprecipitate the TR4 and HNF4 complex by an anti-TR4 monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 6C (lane 4), we can clearly observe HNF4 bands in the precipitated complex by Western blotting when co-expressing TR4 and HNF4 proteins in COS1 cells. This result suggests that TR4 can bind to HNF4..

Also, the full-length of TR4 is essential for this regulation. We further compared the effects of TR4 on HNF4-mediated transactivation on the CpLUC reporter with deletion mutants of TR4 in HepG2 cells using transient transfection assay (Fig. 6D). As expected and similar to the result shown in Fig. 4A, TR4 suppresses HNF4-mediated transactivation (Fig. 6D, column 3 versus 4). However, the N- or C-terminal deletion of TR4 did not exhibit similarly suppressive effects as those of the full-length TR4 did (column 4 versus 7 and 8), implying that these two domains are essential in the protein-protein interaction of TR4 and HNF4, and this interaction is required for the repressive action of TR4 on the transcriptional activity of HNF4..

The first transcript is pre-C mRNA, which is the precursor of HBeAg; the other transcript is C mRNA, serving as the template for reverse transcription (6, 36). HBV RNA extracted from Huh-7 after the co-transfection of TR4 and HBV vectors was mapped with radiolabeled HBV primer at position 2024-2051 of the HBV genome (8). As seen in Fig. 7, the expression of both pre-C and C mRNAs was decreased in the presence of TR4. This result therefore confirms the reporter assays showing that TR4 can suppress HBV core promoter transcription via binding to the TR4RE-HBV site on the HBV core promoter..

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	50	Earlier studies have identified two consensus DR1 binding sites for nuclear receptors in the HBV promoter. One such site (TGAACCTTTACCC, nucleotide coordinates 1138-1150), is located in the core domain of enhancer I and is recognized by HNF4, COUP-TF1, and RXR-PPAR (37). The other site (AGGTTAAAGGTCT, nucleotide coordinates 1757-1769) is located in the core promoter that can be recognized by HNF4 and TR4 as described in current studies (13). The detailed mechanisms of how these nuclear receptors modulate HBV gene expression via these two DR1 sites remain unclear. Our data strongly suggest that TR4 preferentially binds the DR1 site of the core promoter, because TR4 suppression is abrogated if this site is mutated (Fig. 4B). The selective binding of TR4 to the 2nd DR1 site may be a key step for TR4 to prevent other nuclear receptors from binding to this site, thereby repressing transcription. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that TR4 may also regulate HBV gene expression through the DR1 site of enhancer I, because our data indicate that TR4 can recognize this site (data not shown). Moreover, because TR4 binding to the 2nd DR1 site is prevented by two mutations ((1756 (A to T) and 1767 (G to A)), which are frequently found in patients with chronic hepatitis, one may speculate that HBV may utilize these two mutations to escape suppression mediated by TR4 and/or other transcriptional repressors. Alternatively, creation of new mutations at these consensus DR1 sites may be able to increase the opportunity for other modulators to regulate HBV expression via these mutated DR1 sites (32)..

Earlier studies indicated that TR2 and TR4 could modulate the expression of a set of genes through binding to the same HREs (19, 38). Interestingly, Yu et al. (14) reported that TR2 could only repress pre-C RNA, but not C RNA expression. Our current data show that TR4 can repress both pre-C RNA and C RNA expression. Moreover, compared with the marginal suppression of TR2 on CpLuc reporter activity, TR4 has a much stronger suppressive effect on CpLuc reporter activity (data not shown), suggesting that TR4 may play a significant role in this regulation. Also, our data suggest that simple competition for binding to the DR1 site by these two nuclear receptors may not fully account for their distinct regulation of HBV core gene expression, because both nuclear receptors regulate target genes through binding to the DR sites (19, 38). The detailed mechanisms underlying the distinct regulation of HBV gene expression by these two closely related orphan receptors remain unclear. The interaction of TR4 and HNF4 suggests that the TR4 affects HBV gene expression at multiple levels, most importantly, including the DNA binding and protein-protein interactions. Nevertheless, previous reports also suggested that COUP-TF could differentially modulate target gene expression via similar HREs. For example, COUP-TF1 can induce the 7-hydroxylase promoter activity via the DR4 binding site and repress myosin heavy chain promoter activity via a similar DR4 binding site (39). Similar differential modulation of target gene expression also occurred with TR4, via binding to similar DR1 binding sites (21, 23)..

It is possible that sequences flanking the TR4RE-HBV may recruit one or more repressors that can cooperate with TR4 to form a protein complex to repress HBV core promoter. In addition, we have examined the effects of TR4 on HBV core promoter activity in non-liver cells and found that TR4 was able to induce the luciferase activity of the Cpluc reporter in H1299 cells (data not shown). This interesting finding implies that some cellular factors in liver cells may modulate the transcriptional activity of TR4 in the regulation of the HBV core promoter.

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	56	TR4 may modulate its target gene expression via two distinct mechanisms. First, TR4 can suppress target gene expression via competition with other nuclear receptors, such as RXR (DR1), VDR (DR3), and retinoic acid receptor  (DR5), for the same consensus HRE sites (21, 22). Previous studies showed that ligand-activated RXR/PPAR or PPAR can increase HBV core promoter activity through the TR4RE-HBV site (DR1) (13, 14). Therefore, it appears that TR4 may compete for the same binding site with these nuclear receptors resulting in repression of HBV core promoter activity, which this regulation does not involve in any interaction between TR4 and other nuclear receptors (21, 22). Second, TR4 can also modulate gene expression via protein-protein interactions with other nuclear receptors. For example, TR4 can suppress androgen target genes through interactions with the androgen receptor (40). In the current study, we found TR4 cannot only bind to the same DR1 site on HBV core promoter as HNF4 (Fig. 5), but also interact with HNF4 (Fig. 6, B and C). The TR4-mediated repression resulted from this interaction was confirmed by using TR4 deletion mutants in several parallel experiments and may further support that there might be multiple mechanisms by which TR4 proceeds in this repressive regulation. Previous studies showed that TR2, a close member of TR4 family, and RIP140 (receptor-interacting protein 140), one of TR4-interacting proteins, can interact and recruit histone deacetylases for gene silencing (22, 41, 42). It is possible that TR4 may carry out this repression through similar mechanisms, which would be an interesting direction for our future study to test the involvement of histone deacetylases in this regulation..

We speculate that the functional association of TR4 and HNF4 could be a unique way to relieve TR4-mediated repression, because HNF can reduce TR4 binding to the DR1 site through either competition for DNA binding or protein-protein interactions (Fig. 5).

This figure depicts a simple model of the HBV core promoter and the regulation of this promoter via TR4RE-HBV by TR4. A, The binding of TR4 to the TR4RE may restrict the accessibility of this site to other essential nuclear receptors for transcriptional activation. Also, the interaction of HNF4 and TR4 inhibits HNF4 transcriptional activity and results in the suppression of the HBV core promoter activity. B, during natural infection, by an unknown mechanism, the interaction of HNF4 and 2R4 may prevent TR4 from binding to the DR1 site (Fig. 5). Therefore, this regulation can relieve TR4-mediated repression and allow HNF4 or other nuclear receptors to proceed to the transcriptional activation..

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION GRANTS REFERENCES   Bile acids, steroids, and drugs activate steroid and xenobiotic receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR; NR1I2), which induces human cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4) in drug metabolism and cholesterol 7-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) in bile acid synthesis in the liver. Rifampicin, a human PXR agonist, inhibits bile acid synthesis and has been used to treat cholestatic diseases. The objective of this study is to elucidate the mechanism by which PXR inhibits CYP7A1 gene transcription. The mRNA expression levels of CYP7A1 and several nuclear receptors known to regulate the CYP7A1 gene were assayed in human primary hepatocytes by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR). Rifampicin reduced CYP7A1 and small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR02B) mRNA expression suggesting that SHP was not involved in PXR inhibition of CYP7A1. Rifampicin inhibited CYP7A1 reporter activity and a PXR binding site was localized to the bile acid response element-I. Mammalian two-hybrid assays revealed that PXR interacted with hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4, NR2A1) and rifampicin was required. Coimmunoprecipitation assay confirmed PXR interaction with HNF4. PXR also interacted with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator (PGC-1), which interacted with HNF4 and induced CYP7A1 gene transcription. Rifampicin enhanced PXR interaction with HNF4 and reduced PGC-1 interaction with HNF4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that PXR, HNF4, and PGC-1 bound to CYP7A1 chromatin, and rifampicin dissociated PGC-1 from chromatin. These results suggest that activation of PXR by rifampicin promotes PXR interaction with HNF4 and blocks PGC-1 activation with HNF4 and results in inhibition of CYP7A1 gene transcription. Rifampicin inhibition of bile acid synthesis may be a protective mechanism against drug and bile acid-induced cholestasis..

This tightly regulated feedback mechanism is necessary because bile acids are highly toxic and cholesterol is needed for maintaining cellular structure and function. Recent studies (4) have revealed that bile acid feedback has far-reaching impacts on liver metabolism; it not only regulates bile acid synthesis in the digestive system but also regulates cholesterol, lipoprotein, triglyceride, and glucose metabolisms. The discovery that lithocholic acid (LCA) is an endogenous ligand for pregnane X receptor (PXR) suggests that bile acids may also regulate drug metabolism in the liver and intestine by induction of CYP450 enzymes (27, 34). PXR and its human ortholog steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) induce the CYP3A, CYP2B, and CYP2C families of steroid- and drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver and intestine (17). Despite the high-sequence identity in the ligand-binding domain between human and mouse PXR, they are very different in ligand selectivity. Pregnenolone-16-carbonitrile (PCN) and dexamethasone are strong agonists for mouse PXR but weaker agonists for human PXR. In contrast, rifampicin, an antibiotic that has been used to treat intrahepatic cholestasis, activates human PXR, but not mouse PXR (18). Previous studies (6, 20) from this laboratory show that PCN and dexamethasone strongly reduced CYP7A1 activity, mRNA, and protein expression levels in rat livers. This finding was recently confirmed by reports that PCN inhibited Cyp7a1 mRNA levels in mouse liver but had no effect on Cyp7a1 mRNA expression in Pxr knockout mice (27). These results suggest that PXR may mediate LCA and PCN inhibition of mouse Cyp7a1 gene transcription. It was proposed that activation of PXR by drugs and bile acids might protect the liver against drug and bile acid-induced cholestasis (27, 34)..

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	8	Our previous studies identified two bile acid response elements (BAREs): BARE-I and BARE-II. These two BAREs are essential for basal transcriptional activity and also for conferring bile acid feedback inhibition (reviewed in Ref. 3). They contain several AGGTCA-like repeating sequences, which are potential binding sites for nuclear receptors. A direct repeat spaced by four bases (DR4) in the rat BARE-I is a binding site for an orphan receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream transcription factor-II (COUP-TFII; NR2F2) and also for liver orphan receptor (LXR; NR1H3). However, COUP-TFII and LXR do not bind to the human BARE-I due to the lack of a DR4 motif (5). The factor that binds to the human BARE-I has not been identified. The BARE-II contains an 18-bp sequence that is completely conserved in rats and humans. Hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)4 binds to a DR1, and human -fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF; NR5A2) or mouse liver-related homolog (LRH) binds to an overlapping half-site sequence in the BARE-II. HNF4 is the only nuclear receptor that is able to stimulate the human CYP7A1 gene; all other factors tested (FTF, COUP-TFII, LXR) inhibited the human CYP7A1 gene (2, 5, 29)..

However, FXR inhibits the CYP7A1 gene by inducing a negative receptor, small heterodimer partnet (SHP), which interacts with FTF and inhibits its transactivation of the CYP7A1 gene (3). The FXR/SHP/FTF mechanism is consistent with lacking inhibition of Cyp7a1 and induction of Shp mRNA expression in Fxr null mice fed with bile acids (26). However, bile acid feeding still inhibits Cyp7a1 expression in Shp null mice (15, 33), suggesting that mechanisms alternative to the FXR/SHP/FTF pathway must exist for bile acids to inhibit Cyp7a1 mRNA expression in Shp null mice (33). The alternative mechanisms include the cytokine/MAPK/JNK pathway, protein kinase C/cJun pathway, FXR/FGF19/FGFR4 pathway, and the PXR-mediated pathway (4)..

The pCMV-galactosidase plasmid (0.1  microg) was transfected as an internal standard for normalizing the transfection efficiency in each assay. In some samples, empty expression vectors were added to equalize the total amounts of plasmid DNA transfected in each assay. Four hours after transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free media and treated with LCA (Steraloids, Newport, RI) or rifampicin in the concentrations indicated in each experiment for 40 h. Cells were harvested for assay of luciferase reporter activity using Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined using a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold Systems, Pittsburgh, PA) and normalized by dividing the relative light units by -galactosidase activity. Each assay was done in triplicate, and individual experiments were repeated at least three times. Data are plotted as means  plus or minus  SD.

Nuclear receptors were synthesized in vitro using Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation Systems (Promega) programmed with receptor expression plasmids according to the manufacturer's instruction. Double-stranded synthetic probes for the PXR binding site of CYP3A4, BARE-I and BARE-II of the human CYP7A1 gene were prepared by heating equal molar amounts of complementary oligonucleotides to 95 degrees C in 2x SSC (0.5 M NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The resulting double-stranded fragments were labeled with [32P]dCTP by filling in reaction using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Labeled double-stranded probes were purified through G-50 spin columns.

HepG2 cells were grown in 100-mm culture dishes to 80% confluence. Ten micrograms of PXR, RXR, FTF, HNF4, and HA tagged-PGC-1 expression plasmids were transfected using the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method as described in Transient transfection assay. Four hours after transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free media containing vehicle (DMSO) or 10  microM rifampicin for 40 h. ChIP assays were performed using ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotec, NY) according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and washed with ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 1  microg/ml aprotinin, and 1  microg/ml pepstanin A, Sigma) twice. Cells were scraped and incubated in 1% SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.1) for 30 min on ice and sonicated using a Branson sonifier 250 with a microtip setting 6 for 15-s pulses at 40% output for a total of 1.5 min to break the DNA into 0.2- to 2-kb fragments. Cell lysates were collected by centrifugation and diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mM NaCl). Ten percent of the cell lysates were saved and used as the "input" for immunoprecipitation. After the diluted cell lysate was precleared with protein A-agarose, DNA-protein complexes were precipitated by incubating the cell lysates with 10  microg of antibodies (goat HNF4, #6556; goat PXR, #7737; goat PGC-1, #5815; goat CPF, #5995, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) against target proteins overnight followed by a 3-h incubation with protein A or G-agarose beads for each treatment. Protein A or G was added as a nonimmunoprecipitation control. The beads were washed with low-salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl) once, high-salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mM NaCl) once, LiCl wash buffer [0.25 M LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.1] once, and buffer with 10 mM Tris HCl and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, twice. Samples were eluted twice with 250  microl of ChIP elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3), and the eluates were combined. The cross-links were reversed by adjusting NaCl concentration to 200 mM and incubating the eluates at 65 degrees C for 4 h followed by a 1-h incubation in 0.04  microg/ microl proteinase K. DNA was extracted using phenol/chloroform and precipitated using isopropanol. A 391-bp DNA fragment containing BARE-I and BARE-II was PCR amplified for 45 cycles and analyzed on a 2% agarose gel.

The Ct is the fractional cycle number at which the amount of amplified target reaches a fixed threshold. The Ct value is exponentially related to copy number. High Ct value indicates low copy number. The Ct value is the Ct of the target gene minus the Ct of the reference gene (ubiquitin C). These data indicated that CYP7A1 mRNA levels were very low but detectable by this assay. SHP mRNA levels were 100-fold higher than CYP7A1. PXR mRNA levels were lower than FXR, HNF4, and PGC-1, which were abundant in human primary hepatocytes. These experiments revealed that human primary hepatocytes expressed very low levels of CYP7A1 but abundant nuclear receptors and a coactivator known to regulate CYP7A1 gene expression.

Q-PCR was then used to assay the effect of CDCA, an FXR ligand, and rifampicin, a human PXR ligand, on CYP7A1 mRNA expression levels in human primary hepatocytes (HH1106). Comparative Ct ( to Ct) method was used to quantify the change of mRNA expression levels by CDCA and rifampicin (Table 1). CDCA (30  microM) markedly reduced CYP7A1 mRNA expression by 95%, and rifampicin (10  microM) reduced CYP7A1 mRNA expression by 80%. As a positive control for CDCA induction, SHP mRNA levels were determined. As expected, CDCA induced SHP mRNA by sixfold. The observed inverse relationship of CYP7A1 and SHP mRNA expression levels by bile acid is consistent with the hypothesis that SHP mechanism mediates bile acid inhibition of CYP7A1 gene transcription. Interestingly, rifampicin completely abolished SHP mRNA expression. As a positive control of PXR induction, CYP3A4 mRNA expression levels were measured in human primary hepatocytes. The CYP3A4 mRNA levels were too low to be detected in vehicle and CDCA-treated human hepatocytes (Ct = 40). Rifampicin remarkably induced CYP3A4 mRNA levels by more than 50-fold, consistent with a previous report (9). The strong induction of SHP by CDCA and CYP3A4 by rifampicin indicates that these compounds at the concentrations tested did not cause toxic effect on human primary hepatocytes as demonstrated by MTT assays. The lack of an inverse relationship between CYP7A1 and SHP mRNA expression by rifampicin provides strong evidence that SHP is not involved in PXR inhibition of CYP7A1. These results may suggest that ligand-activated PXR reduced SHP gene transcription in human livers..

Reporter activities of all three constructs were inhibited 80% by rifampicin (data not shown). It is concluded that the PXR response element is located in the region downstream of  to 150, which contains both BARE-I and BARE-II. We thus performed EMSA using oligonucleotide probes designed based on the nucleotide sequences in the BARE-I and BARE-II. When the human BARE-I probe was used for EMSA (Fig. 2A), a mixture of in vitro synthesized PXR and RXR shifted a single band (Fig. 2B). Neither PXR nor RXR alone bound the BARE-I probe (Fig. 2B).

We reported previously that HNF4 bound to the BARE-II and COUP-TFII bound to the BARE-I synergistically stimulated rat CYP7A1 gene transcription (29). We proposed a model that factors bound to the BARE-I and BARE-II interact and regulate CYP7A1 gene transcription. We therefore wanted to test the hypothesis that PXR, which binds to the BARE-I, might also interact with HNF4 to regulate the human CYP7A1 gene. We used mammalian two-hybrid assay to study the interaction between Gal4-PXR-LBD fusion and VP16-HNF4 fusion in HepG2 cells. In this assay, Gal4-PXR-LBD fusion protein binds to the Gal4-DBD (DNA binding site or UAS) in a luciferase reporter (Gal4 to 5XUAS-TK-Luc), which has a TK minimal promoter, and expresses low basal activity in mammalian cells. If Gal4-PXR fusion protein interacts with VP16-HNF4 fusion protein, then the Gal4 reporter activity should be stimulated. The effect of a PXR ligand on the interaction also can be tested in this assay. The two-hybrid assays in Fig. 5A show that Gal4-PXR-LBD (AA 107 to 434) interacts strongly with VP16-HNF4 (D + BD, AA 125 to 364) only in the presence of rifampicin. As a control for specificity of interaction, Gal4-PXR interacts very weakly with VP16-FTF. It should be noted that the FTF binding site overlaps with the HNF4 binding site in the BARE-II. We then used Gal4-HNF4 and VP16-PXR hybrids in two-hybrid assays. Figure 5B shows that Gal4-HNF4 full-length and VP16-PXR-LBD interact without addition of a HNF4 ligand (4-fold of the background). It should be noted that HNF4 has intrinsic activity, and the endogenous HNF4 ligand is not known for certain. Addition of rifampicin somewhat enhanced the interaction. The interactions between Gal4-HNF4 and VP16-PXR fusion proteins were much weaker than between Gal4-PXR/VP16-HNF4 hybrids (Fig. 5A), as indicated by much lower reporter activities. The NH2-terminal region (A/B + DBD; AA 1 to 129) of HNF4 did not_interact with PXR, whereas the COOH-terminal region (LBD; AA 130 to 455) of HNF4 did.

Since then, several other nuclear receptors including HNF4, LXR, RXR, and Estrogen receptor (ER), and ER-related receptor were found to interact with PGC-1 and regulate gluconeogenesis and energy metabolism (23, 25). It is not known whether PGC-1 interacts with PXR. We therefore performed mammalian two-hybrid assays to study PXR interaction with PGC-1. Figure 6A shows that Gal4-PGC-1 strongly interacts with VP16-PXR as indicated by a 400-fold stimulation of Gal4 reporter activity over Gal4 basal activity. A ubiquitous steroid receptor coactivator, SRC-1, interacts much weaker (20-fold) with VP16-PXR. Because coactivator is known to interact with nuclear receptor by binding to the LBD and ligand enhances the interaction, we then studied the effect of rifampicin on PXR interaction with HNF4 and PGC-1. Figure 6B shows that rifampicin induced a fourfold stimulation of PXR and PGC-1 interaction. Interestingly, overexpression of HNF4 strongly inhibited PXR and PGC-1 interaction only when a PXR ligand was added. This indicates that rifampicin promotes PXR and HNF4 interaction and excludes PGC-1 from interaction with PXR. Figure 6C shows that Gal4-PGC-1 interacts strongly with VP-16-HNF4 (500-fold), and rifampicin did not have any effect on the interaction. This is expected because rifampicin is not a ligand of HNF4. When PXR expression plasmid was cotransfected, addition of rifampicin strongly inhibited HNF4 and PGC-1 interaction. These results also suggest that rifampicin promotes PXR interaction with HNF4 and prevents PGC-1 interaction with HNF4.

We established the human primary hepatocyte as a suitable model for studying CYP7A1 gene regulation by nuclear receptors and PGC-1. Q-PCR analysis reveals that CYP7A1 mRNA expression levels are repressed in human primary hepatocytes, likely because the negative effects of several negative regulators of the human CYP7A1 gene, FTF, COUP-TFII, PXR, Prox1 (see below), and SHP, may dominant over the positive effect of activators HNF4 and PGC-1.

This inverse relationship of CDCA effect on CYP7A1 and SHP expression is consistent with the FXR/SHP mechanism of bile acid inhibition of CYP7A1 gene transcription. In contrast, rifampicin strongly reduced both CYP7A1 and SHP mRNA expression in human primary hepatocytes. This result provides strong evidence that SHP is not involved in PXR inhibition of CYP7A1 because reduction of a negative factor should result in induction of CYP7A1 expression.

Our findings suggest that PXR inhibition of CYP7A1 gene transcription may be an additional mechanism for reducing intrahepatic bile acid concentrations and further protect the liver from toxic effects of bile acids and xenobiotics.

The interaction between PXR and HNF4 is novel and is consistent with our model that factors bound to the BARE-I and BARE-II interact and coordinately regulate basal transcription of the CYP7A1 gene (8). HNF4 is known to play a central role in regulation of bile acid synthesis (3). There are reports that HNF4 is required for PXR-mediated xenobiotic induction of CYP3A4 in mice (31) and that HNF4 regulates PXR expression and xenobiotic response during fetal liver development (14). Therefore, the PXR and HNF4 interaction may be physiologically important in the coordinated regulation of xenobiotic and bile acid metabolisms. Both two-hybrid assay and co-IP assay using HepG2 and primary hepatocyte extracts show that rifampicin markedly enhances PXR interaction with HNF4. The interaction between PXR and PGC-1 is as strong as between HNF4 and PGC-1. This is the first report that PXR is a target of PGC-1. Rifampicin is not required for PXR to interact with PGC-1 and does not affect HNF4 and PXR binding to CYP7A1 chromatin. On the other hand, rifampicin dissociates PGC-1 from CYP7A1 chromatin likely due to enhancing PXR interaction with HNF4..

HNF4 is known to play a central role in regulation of bile acid synthesis (3). There are reports that HNF4 is required for PXR-mediated xenobiotic induction of CYP3A4 in mice (31) and that HNF4 regulates PXR expression and xenobiotic response during fetal liver development (14). Therefore, the PXR and HNF4 interaction may be physiologically important in the coordinated regulation of xenobiotic and bile acid metabolisms. Both two-hybrid assay and co-IP assay using HepG2 and primary hepatocyte extracts show that rifampicin markedly enhances PXR interaction with HNF4. The interaction between PXR and PGC-1 is as strong as between HNF4 and PGC-1. This is the first report that PXR is a target of PGC-1. Rifampicin is not required for PXR to interact with PGC-1 and does not affect HNF4 and PXR binding to CYP7A1 chromatin. On the other hand, rifampicin dissociates PGC-1 from CYP7A1 chromatin likely due to enhancing PXR interaction with HNF4..
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	62	Our results suggest a model for PXR, HNF4, and PGC-1 regulation of the CYP7A1 gene (Fig. 9). HNF4 and PGC-1 are the most important transactivators of the human CYP7A1 gene. PGC-1 interacts with HNF4, which binds to the BARE-II and activates human CYP7A1 gene. According to this study, PXR binds to the BARE-I and interacts with PGC-1 but may not be important in basal transcription of the CYP7A1 gene. It should be noted that our model does not suggest a ternary complex formation among PXR, HNF4, and PGC-1. PGC-1 is a coactivator that binds to the LBD of both PXR and HNF4. Therefore, it is not likely that PGC-1 interacts simultaneously with both nuclear receptors. Ubiquitous coactivators, SRC-1 and CBP, are known to interact with PXR and HNF4; however, our data show a much stronger interaction of PXR with PGC-1 than SRC-1. Nuclear receptor/coactivator complexes may facilitate the recruitment of histone acetytransferase to remodel the chromatin to allow recruitment of other coactivator/mediator complexes and assemble the general transcriptional machinery that regulates RNA polymerase II activity (10). On the basis of our results, we propose a model that activation of PXR by rifampicin would allow PXR to interact directly with HNF4 and exclude PGC-1 from interacting with HNF4, resulting in suppression of the CYP7A1 gene transcription. Corepressors, such as SMRT and NCoR1, have been shown to inhibit nuclear receptor activity (7). Our preliminary results show that the interaction of SMRT and NCoR1 with HNF4 and PXR is very weak. It is also possible that rifampicin-activated PXR may compete with HNF4 for PGC-1, thus inhibiting CYP7A1 gene transcription. This mechanism of PXR inhibition of gene transcription is not likely because PGC-1 interaction with PXR or HNF4 does not require a ligand and rifampicin-activated PXR and HNF4 is known to strongly induce, not inhibit, CYP3A4 gene transcription..

Top: HNF4 and PGC-1 are the most important activators of human CYP7A1 gene. PGC-1 interacts with HNF4, which binds to the BARE-II and transactivates the human CYP7A1 gene. According to this study, PXR is able to bind to the BARE-I. Coactivators SRC-1 and cAMP response element binding protein binding protein (CBP) and histone acetytransferase (HAT) may be also recruited to remodel chromatin and recruit other coactivator complexes to induce the basal transcription of the CYP7A1 gene by RNA polymerase II. Bottom: rifampicin activates PXR to promote its interaction with HNF4. This interaction may disrupt the interaction between PGC-1 and HNF4 (and may be also PXR) and result in suppression of CYP7A1 gene transcription. Corepressors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) may be also recruited to inhibit CYP7A1 gene transcription..
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	64	  Very recently, a homeobox transcription factor, Prox1, has been shown to interact specifically with FTF and inhibits the CYP7A1 gene (24). Prox1 is expressed in the liver and intestine and may play an important role not only in liver development, but also in regulation of bile acid synthesis. Our Q-PCR analysis detects very high levels of Prox1 mRNA in human primary hepatocytes, indicating that Prox1 might be the dominant repressor of CYP7A1 gene expression in human livers. However, it is not known whether bile acids or drugs affect Prox1 interaction with FTF, HNF4, or PXR. Another recent report (28) shows that Prox1 interacts with FTF and inhibits SHP gene expression and that Prox1 specifically interacts with histone deacetylase (HDAC)3. HDACs are known to form complexes with nuclear receptors and corepressors and inhibit gene transcription (13). The roles of these transcriptional repressors in mediating bile acid inhibition of CYP7A1 gene transcription remain to be elucidated..

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	66	In summary, this study provides the first evidence that PXR is able to interact with HNF4 and PGC-1 and plays a role in mediating rifampicin and bile acid inhibition of CYP7A1 gene transcription. On ligand binding, PXR interacts with HNF4, blocks PGC-1 interaction with HNF4, and results in inhibition of the CYP7A1 gene. The PXR pathway may be important for preventing bile acid and drug-induced cholestasis by inhibiting bile acid synthesis as well as stimulating bile acid transport, excretion, and detoxification. Thus PXR plays a central role in coordinated regulation of bile acid homeostasis and drug metabolism. This may be the mechanism for using rifampicin and steroids to treat pruritus of intrahepatic cholestasis and primary biliary cirrhosis (1, 12). Efficacious PXR agonists may be developed for treating these chronic liver diseases..

To understand the role of COUP-TFII in glucose homeostasis, conditional COUP-TFII-deficient mice were generated and crossed with mice expressing Cre under the control of rat insulin II gene promoter, resulting in deletion of COUP-TFII in pancreatic ss-cells. Homozygous mutants died before birth for yet undetermined reasons. Heterozygous mice appeared healthy at birth and showed normal growth and fertility. When challenged intraperitoneally, the animals had glucose intolerance associated with reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Moreover, these heterozygous mice presented a mild increase in fasting and random-fed circulating insulin levels. In accordance, islets isolated from these animals exhibited higher insulin secretion in low glucose conditions and markedly decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Their pancreata presented normal microscopic architecture and insulin content up to 16 weeks of study. Altered insulin secretion was associated with peripheral insulin resistance in whole animals. It can be concluded that COUP-TFII is a new, important regulator of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity..

COUP-TFII is generally considered to be a functional transcriptional repressor of genes controlled by nuclear hormone receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4, which are well known to play important roles in the glucose-responsive phenotype of ss-cells (6,7). The possibility that COUP-TFII might play a role in glucose homeostasis is supported by in vitro studies suggesting that this protein is involved in regulating insulin gene expression in pancreatic ss-cells (8) but also in the expression of several other genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism (9,10). It has been shown that COUP-TFII is expressed in the early developing endocrine pancreas and in mature differentiated islet cells (11). However, until now the potential function of COUP-TFII in pancreatic ss-cells remains unknown. One way to address this issue is to generate COUP-TFII-deficient mice. Since global COUP-TFII deficiency results in embryonic lethality (12), we generated in this study a conditional knockout of the COUP-TFII gene using the Cre-loxP system. Our data show that inactivation of one COUP-TFII allele in ss-cells results in disturbed insulin secretion and peripheral insulin resistance..

The resulting Cre+/ to .COUP-TFII fl/wt females were mated to COUP-TFII fl/wt males to generate mice with different genotypes. As shown in Fig. 2, homozygous Cre+/ to .COUP-TFII fl/fl mice were embryonic lethal. Since there are no precedents for embryonic lethal phenotypes resulting from ss-cell-specific gene deletions, this lethality, together with the observations of Magnuson and colleagues (14), led us to examine possible Cre-induced deletion of the floxed COUP-TFII allele in other tissues than endocrine pancreas. Multiplex PCR analysis was performed on DNA prepared from liver, hypothalamus, brain, and spinal cord (Fig. 1B). We detected gene deletion in the spinal cord from the Cre+/ to .COUP-TFII fl/wt mice, while we previously demonstrated that the COUP-TFII gene is expressed in the ventral neural tube at 9.0 days post coitum (11). Therefore, extrapancreatic COUP-TFII gene knockout could contribute in the observed lethality of homozygous Cre+/ to .COUP-TFII fl/fl mice..

Since altered insulin secretion can modify insulin sensitivity in vivo, an insulin tolerance test was performed showing that Cre+/ to .COUP-TFII fl/wt animals were resistant to the glucose-lowering effect of exogenous insulin (Fig. 4B). The normal insulin sensitivity of the COUP-TFII fl/wt mice allowed us to rule out a role of the hypomorphic floxed allele by itself. Interestingly, in isolated soleus muscle, basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis is similar when wt is compared with COUP-TFII fl/wt or Cre+/ to .COUP-TFII fl/wt mice, indicating that insulin resistance is unlikely a primary defect in skeletal muscle (Fig. 4C).

Our results demonstrate that a heterozygous COUP-TFII deletion in islet ss-cells leads to an impaired glucose sensitivity and then to an abnormal insulin secretion and secondary insulin resistance. The results obtained in vivo and in isolated islets allow us to exclude any participation of the autonomic nervous system in the alteration of insulin secretion. In addition, pleiotropic effects of reduced intracellular COUP-TFII activity on ss-cell metabolism, which may be detrimental to the generation of ATP, seem to be excluded since genes analyzed by RT-PCR show no major change in expression level. Moreover, as COUP-TFII deficiency is genetically imposed upon ss-cells, we interpret the lack of -cell response to hypoglycemia as secondary e.g., caused by a high rate of insulin release. It is well known that ss-cells can suppress -cell function (22). Tissue-specific deletion of HNF-3ss in pancreatic ss-cells in mice suggested in vivo coupling of -cell function to ss-cells (23). It is worthy of note that the abnormalities due to a partial COUP-TFII deficiency in pancreatic ss-cells mimic some of the disorders observed in type 2 diabetic patients..

A mouse 129SV PAC genomic clone containing the entire COUP-TFII gene was isolated by screening the RPCI21 library (from the resource center of the German Human Genoma Project). A conditional allele was generated by flanking the first exon with loxP sites for the Cre recombinase. A loxP site was inserted into a BglII site located 445 bp upstream of the Met-ATG codon, and the pgk-neo selection gene flanked by two additional loxP sites was introduced into a NdeI site located in the first intron. The targeting construct was obtained after digestion by HindIII-AvrII, and the insertion was electroporated into CK35 embryonic stem cells (24). After selection, the genotype of G418-resistant clones were identified by Southern blot analysis after XbaI digestion using an external flanking 5' EcoRI-EcoRI DNA fragment as a hybridization probe, after SpeI digestion using an external 3' noncoding DNA fragment and after PCR analysis. Ten percent of correctly recombined clones were identified. Cre-mediated recombination was obtained after electroporation of 107 recombinant embryonic stem cells using 4  microg pIC-Cre vector (25). Of 288 clones isolated after Cre expression, 4 had lost the selection gene, as identified by Southern blot analysis of XbaI-digested DNA with E1 probe. Two clones containing an fl first exon were isolated. Mice strains carrying a COUP-TFII fl allele were established on a mixed C57BL/6N x 129SVJ background. Genotyping was performed by PCR analysis using DNA isolated from the tail tip of newborn mice using the primers flanking the 5' loxP site: A5HF, GCA AGT CGA TTG TCT GGC TTC; R5HF, AAC TCC TCC GCT GCA CAC TA..

HNF1 down regulates HNF4-mediated activation of transcription via a direct protein to protein interaction. Here we show that HNF4 enhances the transcriptional activity of HNF1 in a DNA binding independent manner, thus indicating that it behaves as a HNF1 coactivator. Using mutations in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of HNF4, we confirmed the involvement of the Activation Function 2 module and demonstrated the requirement of the integrity of the LBD for the interaction with HNF1. Moreover, we show that HNF4 cooperates with p300 to achieve the highest HNF1-mediated transcription rates.

They are involved in complex cross-regulatory networks that determine the phenotype of hepatocytes and pancreatic ss-cells (1 to 3). HNF1 is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor (1) whereas HNF4 belongs to the hormone nuclear receptor superfamily (4). Both transcription factors are highly conserved during evolution (4,5). HNF1 and HNF4 directly modulate the expression of a large number of genes (4,6,7). They can also modulate transcription indirectly through the above mentioned transcription factor network, including a HNF1-mediated negative regulation of genes activated by HNF4 (8,9). The roles of these transcription factors in vivo have been confirmed by defects linked to the invalidation of their genes in mice (10 to 14). Further underscoring the importance of these transcription factors, mutations in HNF1 and HNF4 genes have been identified in patients with Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young, MODY3 and MODY1, respectively (15,16). MODY1 and MODY3 mutations result in loss of function of these transcription factors (17). Moreover, it has been reported that expression of a HNF1 dominant negative mutant linked to MODY3 led to an impaired function of pancreatic ss-cells (18)..

Several proteins interact with various HNF1 domains and play crucial roles in HNF1 function. DcoH (Dimerization Cofactor of HNF1), is a small protein, which binds to the HNF1 dimerization domain and is involved in dimer stabilization (19). The ability of various HNF1 domains to interact with multiple coactivators allows formation of a platform for recruitment of a transcriptional complex, leading to a strong enhancement of transcription. CBP/p300 interacts with both the DNA binding domain and the activation domain of HNF1 while P/CAF, SRC-1 and RAC3 interact with the HNF1 activation domain (20,21). Each of these coactivators can independently increase activation of transcription by HNF1. In addition, they cooperate with each other to further enhance the HNF1-mediated activation of transcription (21). HNF1 can also interact with GATA 4, GATA 5 and Cdx-2 transcription factors (22). The interactions between HNF1, GATA5 and Cdx-2 lead to a cooperative enhancement of HNF1-mediated activation of transcription (22). A synergy between HNF1 and neurogenin 3 was also recently reported (23). HNF1 down regulates HNF4-mediated activation of transcription via a direct interaction of these transcription factors (8,9)..

Interestingly, pull-down experiments also showed that HNF1 lacking its activation domain (HNF1-AD) efficiently interacted with HNF4 (Fig. 1D). This result indicates that the sequence 1 to 291 of HNF1, containing the dimerization and DNA binding domains, is able to interact with HNF4. This prompted us to investigate whether coexpression of HNF4 and HNF1-AD could activate the HNF1-TATA promoter. Despite their efficient interaction, HNF1-AD and HNF4 were unable to activate transcription (Fig. 1E), thus indicating that cooperation between HNF1 and HNF4 requires the HNF1 activation domain..
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	28	AF2 is not the only sequence within the HNF4 LBD required for interaction and cooperation with HNF1 The repressive action of HNF1 on HNF4 was unambiguously shown to require the HNF4 LBD (9). However, using truncated fragments of HNF4, Ktistaki and Talianidis mapped the sequence involved in the interaction with HNF1 between residues 337 and 368, leading to the conclusion that the HNF4 AF2 activation function is necessary and sufficient for interaction with HNF1 (9). In fact, this sequence does not contain solely the AF2 (sequence 358 to 366 corresponding to helix 12 of the LBD), but also a fragment forming part of the large helix termed H10 to H11, according to conventional nomenclature (31). Indeed, H10 and H11 are contiguous in HNF4 and form a helix that plays a key role in HNF4 function (31). Furthermore, the integrity of this helix is crucial for protein conformation (32). These recent findings begged a re-evaluation of the HNF4 sequence involved in interaction with HNF1. Using full-length HNF4, we analysed the effects of point mutations located in the HNF4 LBD (Fig. 2A) on the interaction and cooperation with HNF1. The E262A mutation was shown to affect HNF4 dimerization (26). The E276Q mutation does not alter the intrinsic HNF4 transcriptional activity but impairs recruitment of HNF4 transcriptional partners (24,33). Owing to the bulky side chain of phenylalanine, the A223F mutation was hypothesized to affect occupancy of the ligand binding pocket by fatty acids that act as structural cofactors rather than as conventional ligands (31). Accord ingly, A223F mutation mildly impaired HNF4 transcriptional activity and interaction with coactivators (data not shown). In the AF2 module, the acidic group of the amino acid residue side chain at position 363 and the hydrophobic nature of the amino acid residue side chain at position 365 are strictly conserved and play a key role in nuclear receptor function (34). Residue L366 is also important since the L366Q mutation alters HNF4 transcriptional activity (35). Pull-down assays showed that introducing three mutations E363K, L365Q and L366Q in the AF2 (HNF4-AF2mut construct) altered interaction between HNF4 and HNF1 (Fig. 2B). Note however that the decrease in interaction was mild. This result confirms the involvement of the AF2 in the interaction between HNF1 and HNF4 but indicates that this module is not the unique sequence required for interaction between these proteins. Interaction with HNF1 was also significantly decreased by the A223F and E276Q mutations while mutation E262A had no effect (Fig. 2B). Consistent with data from pull-down assays, the HNF4-mediated enhancement of HNF1-dependent transcriptional activation of the ( to 96/+11) LPK promoter was not impaired by the E262A mutation but was significantly decreased with the mutants A223F, E276Q and HNF4-AF2mut (Fig. 2C). We controlled so that mutant and wild-type HNF4 were expressed at a similar level in transfected cells as shown in Figure 2D for mutants A223F and HNF4-AF2mut and in (24,26) for the mutant E276Q and E262A, respectively. It appears therefore that the interaction and cooperation between HNF4 and HNF1 depend on both the AF2 module (helix 12) and the integrity of the HNF4 LBD..

However, using truncated fragments of HNF4, Ktistaki and Talianidis mapped the sequence involved in the interaction with HNF1 between residues 337 and 368, leading to the conclusion that the HNF4 AF2 activation function is necessary and sufficient for interaction with HNF1 (9). In fact, this sequence does not contain solely the AF2 (sequence 358 to 366 corresponding to helix 12 of the LBD), but also a fragment forming part of the large helix termed H10 to H11, according to conventional nomenclature (31). Indeed, H10 and H11 are contiguous in HNF4 and form a helix that plays a key role in HNF4 function (31). Furthermore, the integrity of this helix is crucial for protein conformation (32). These recent findings begged a re-evaluation of the HNF4 sequence involved in interaction with HNF1. Using full-length HNF4, we analysed the effects of point mutations located in the HNF4 LBD (Fig. 2A) on the interaction and cooperation with HNF1. The E262A mutation was shown to affect HNF4 dimerization (26).

In the absence of HNF1, the coactivator p300 alone or coexpressed with HNF4 was unable to activate the HNF1-TATA promoter (Fig. 3A). On this promoter, p300 slightly enhanced HNF1 transcriptional activity (Fig. 3A). Note that this moderate increase is due at least in part to the low ratio of p300/HNF1 expression vectors used in our experiments (3:1) compared to that used in other studies performed on other promoters [e.g. 10:1 in Soutoglou et al. (21)]. We have verified that by using a higher ratio, we could obtain a stronger enhancement of HNF1 activity by p300 alone (data not shown). Interestingly, in the presence of HNF4, p300 synergistically enhanced HNF1-mediated activation of transcription: the activity of the promoter was increased 18.4-fold, which is 4.7-fold higher than the additive value for the induction of HNF1 activity by p300 and HNF4 alone (1.8 and 2.1, respectively). The marked p300-mediated enhancement of cooperation between HNF1 and HNF4 could also be observed on the ( to 96/+11) LPK promoter (Fig. 3B). On both promoters, the enhanced cooperation between HNF1 and HNF4 was significantly impaired by mutations in the HNF4 AF2 module (Fig. 3A and B). These results strongly argue for the involvement of HNF4 in the p300-mediated activation of these promoters despite the absence of HNF4 response element in their sequences. The result obtained with the HNF4-AF2mut led us to investigate whether mutations in AF2 affect p300 binding. Pull-down experiments clearly showed a much weaker interaction of p300 with HNF4-AF2mut than with wild-type HNF4 (Fig. 3C). This result is in line with our previous observation that deletion of the AF2 resulted in a decrease in interaction (about 70%) between HNF4 and p300 (33). Therefore, we cannot exclude that the impaired cooperativity of HNF4-AF2mut was also due to reduced p300 recruitment. Because it has been documented that HNF4 and CBP/p300 form a transcriptionally active complex (36), we verified whether in our experimental conditions this complex was sufficient to achieve the strong cooperation. This question was addressed by the use of human HNF1 promoter containing a HNF4 response element but lacking a HNF1 binding site. Using the same p300/HNF4 expression vector amounts used in Figure 3A and B, cotransfection of p300 failed to strongly enhance the HNF4-mediated activation of transcription (Fig. 3D). It appears therefore that the strong activation of transcription observed in Figure 3A and B requires a ternary complex including HNF1, HNF4 and p300..

0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	36	  With the aim to investigate the mechanism underlying the p300-mediated enhancement of the cooperation between HNF1 and HNF4, we surveyed the p300 domains involved in interactions with these transcription factors. Using a double hybrid approach, it was previously shown that the sequences 180 to 662 and 1818 to 2079 of p300 interact with the HNF1 transactivation domain (20). Using GST pull-down assays, we mapped more precisely the amino-terminal sequence of p300 involved in interaction with full-length HNF1 between residues 340 and 528 (Fig. 4B). We also confirmed that full-length HNF1 interacts with the carboxy-terminal region of p300 (Fig. 4C). We have previously shown the ability of HNF4 to interact with the amino-terminal domain of p300 (33). HNF4 also interacted with the p300 carboxy-terminal region as shown in Figure 4C. The presence of multiple interaction surfaces between these proteins led us to analyse the effect of HNF4 on the recruitment of the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of p300 to HNF1. The strategy consisted of determining whether HNF4 affects the cooperation between HNF1 and the amino- or carboxy-terminal fragments of p300 fused to the VP16 activation domain named Np300-VP16 and Cp300-VP16, respectively (Fig. 4A). Expression of the VP16 activation domain affected neither the basal activity of the promoter nor its activity in the presence of expression vectors for HNF1 alone or together with HNF4 (Fig. 4D, left part). Expression of Np300-VP16 failed to affect the basal activity of the promoter and the HNF1-mediated activation of this promoter (Fig. 4D, middle). Similar results were obtained with expression of Cp300-VP16 (Fig. 4D, right). Conversely, in the presence of both HNF1 and HNF4, Np300-VP16 and Cp300-VP16 markedly enhanced the promoter activity (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that, in a cellular context, p300 recruitment by the HNF1 to HNF4 complex can be mediated through both its amino- and carboxy-terminal regions and reinforce data obtained in Figure 3 suggesting that HNF4 improves p300 recruitment to a promoter containing a HNF1 binding site (Fig. 4E)..

In this study, we show that HNF4 can serve as a coactivator for HNF1 since HNF4 is able to enhance HNF1 activity in a DNA-binding independent manner. A synergy between HNF1 and HNF4 can be inferred from data obtained in undifferentiated Caco-2 cells on a promoter containing binding sites for these two HNFs. Since mutation of the HNF4 binding site did not affect this synergy, the authors suggested that this effect probably did not involve HNF4 DNA binding (37). In light of our results, these data can now most probably be explained by the ability of HNF4 to directly act as a HNF1 coactivator. Analysis of the physiological role of this HNF4 coactivator function in cell types that endogenously express HNF1 and HNF4 cannot be realized by conventional targeting of HNF4 expression since HNF4 also positively regulates HNF1 expression. Therefore, this concern will first require development of an experimental model that permits to distinguish between HNF4 effects linked to regulation of HNF1 expression on one hand and to regulation of HNF1 transcriptional activity on the other hand (Fig. 5)..

Only the simultaneous overexpression of CBP and P/CAF together with that of the truncated HNF1 could activate transcription (21). This points to a critical role for the HNF1 activation domain, which could be the recruitment of other required coactivators and/or stabilization of the transcriptional complex recruited by HNF1..

Our results also strongly suggest that HNF4 improves p300 recruitment. The synergy between HNF4 and p300 may be mediated in two ways. The first involves simultaneous interactions of HNF4 and p300 with HNF1 (Fig. 4E). In this case, HNF4 could indirectly improve HNF1 to p300 interaction through induction of a HNF1 conformational change. Such a mechanism is reminiscent of that of the CBP-mediated improvement of the interaction between HNF1 and P/CAF (21). Similarly, upon docking to PPAR, PGC-1 undergoes a conformational change that permits binding of SRC-1 and p300 (39). The second involves docking of p300 by HNF4, which is bound to HNF1 (Fig. 4E). The recruitment of p300 to the HNF1 to HNF4 complex could be mediated by its amino- and/or carboxy-terminal regions, which contain the C/H1 and C/H3 domains, respectively. These domains are known to be involved in protein to protein interactions (40). The presence of multiple interaction surfaces in HNF1, HNF4 and p300 most probably facilitates formation of a ternary complex formed with these proteins (Fig. 4E). The remaining synergy between HNF1 and HNF4 after mutations in the HNF4 AF2 (Fig. 3) may be accounted for by the ability of p300 to interact and activate the HNF4 AF1 (33,41) and by the fact that the two above mentioned mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive..

HNF4 not only directly binds to promoters but also, through interaction with other transcription factors already bound to DNA, can facilitate coactivator recruitment to further enhance transcription. Recently, it has been shown that HNF4 also serves as coactivator for Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding protein-2 (42). Furthermore, our results yield insights into a higher complexity of the transcriptional network and on the primordial relationship between HNF1 and HNF4 (Fig. 5). In the regulatory loop between HNF1 and HNF4, HNF4 can activate both HNF1 expression and transcriptional activity. In contrast to these additive processes, the negative effect of HNF1 on HNF4 transcriptional activity can attenuate the HNF1-mediated activation of expression. These regulatory feedback mechanisms will have to be taken into account considering that HNF1 and HNF4 are involved in a large diversity of pathways controlling function of multiple organs, notably liver and endocrine pancreas..

0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	3	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The nuclear receptor superfamily is a group of transcriptional regulatory proteins linked by conserved structure and function (1). The superfamily includes receptors for a variety of small hydrophobic ligands such as steroids, T3, and retinoids, as well as a large number of related proteins that do not have known ligands, referred to as orphan nuclear receptors (2). The receptor proteins are direct regulators of transcription that function by binding to specific DNA sequences named hormone response elements (HREs) in promoters of target genes. Nearly all the superfamily members bind as dimers to DNA elements. While some apparently bind only as homodimers, thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), vitamin D receptor (VDR), retinoic acid receptors (RARs), the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and several orphan nuclear receptors bind their specific response elements with high affinity as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). Based on this high-affinity binding, such heterodimers have been considered to be the functionally active forms of these receptors in vivo. These heterodimers display distinct HRE specificities to mediate the hormonal responsiveness of target gene transcription, in that distinct HREs are comprised of direct repeats (DRs) of a common half-site with variable spacing between repeats playing a critical role in mediating specificity (2, 9). Accordingly, RARs activate preferentially through DRs spaced by two or five nucleotides, whereas VDR and TR activate through DRs spaced by three and four nucleotides, respectively. RXR-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor heterodimers as well as RXR homodimers activate preferentially through DRs spaced by one nucleotide (referred to as DR1). In addition to DRs, response elements composed of palindromes as well as inverted palindromes referred to as everted repeats (ER) have been shown to mediate transcriptional activation by RXR-RAR and RXR-TR heterodimeric complexes (9). Such DNA-binding flexibility stands in contrast to the steroid hormone receptors, which bind exclusively as homodimers to inverted repeats (IR) spaced by three nucleotides (10)..

In contrast with HNF4, homodimers of the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors (COUP-TFs) such as EAR2, EAR3, and ARP1 are potent dominant repressors of both basal transcription and transactivation by several receptors, including RXR, RAR, VDR, and TR (12). Repression of these pathways by COUP-TF is believed to be accomplished in part by direct competitive binding and by the presence of a strong carboxy-terminal repressor domain (13).

Protein-protein interactions between nuclear receptors, however, can bring the B42 transactivation domain to the LexA sites and activate the expression of the ss-Gal construct. The LexA portion of such chimeras contains its own dimerization domain and directs high-affinity binding to the LexA operators as a dimer, regardless of the status of dimerization between nuclear receptors. Therefore, an important merit of this system is the fact that dimerization properties of nuclear receptors can be directly assessed without complications associated with HRE binding.

The I-box sequences are moderately conserved among a subset of nuclear receptors including the homodimerizing HNF4, leading us to test whether the HNF4 I-box region plays a similar role in the homodimeric interactions. To this end, we constructed a series of chimeras between HNF4 and RXR. PCR was used to construct B42/HNF, a chimeric protein consisting of the B42 transactivation domain fused to the entire hinge and LBDs (D, E and F, amino acids 106 to 455) of the rat HNF4 (Fig. 1A). Chimeric receptors B42/H/X-298/389, B42/H/X-338/429, B42/X-HHH, B42/H-XXX, and B42/X/H-428/339 were similarly constructed (Fig. 1A). Western blot analyses were executed to confirm that expression levels for all the mutants constructed were comparable (data not shown). LexA/HNF4 showed some constitutive transcriptional activity in yeast, which was approximately 3.5-fold higher than that of LexA alone (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1B, coexpression of B42/HNF led to approximately 5.5-fold enhancement of this constitutive activity, faithfully reflecting the HNF4-HNF4 homodimeric interactions in this yeast system. Furthermore, coexpression of B42/H/X-338/429 or B42/X-HHH led to approximately 4- and 7-fold enhancements of the transcriptional activity of LexA/HNF4, respectively. In contrast, the RXR I-box could not substitute the HNF4 I-box for the homodimeric interactions, as shown by inabilities of B42/H/X-298/389, B42/H-XXX, and B42/X/H-428/339 to enhance the transcriptional activity of LexA/HNF4. These results demonstrate that the HNF4 I-box is indeed a sufficient and transferable interaction interface for the homodimeric interactions..

In contrast, the RXR I-box could not substitute the HNF4 I-box for the homodimeric interactions, as shown by inabilities of B42/H/X-298/389, B42/H-XXX, and B42/X/H-428/339 to enhance the transcriptional activity of LexA/HNF4. These results demonstrate that the HNF4 I-box is indeed a sufficient and transferable interaction interface for the homodimeric interactions..

In these interactions, LexA/RAR, which includes a full-length RAR in contrast to LexA/TR and other LexA chimeras consisting of only LBDs, shows higher ss-Gal activities than LexA/TR, probably due to the AF1 activation domain in the RAR A/B domains (25). Since LexA/TR and LexA/RAR show similar basal activities in yeast, this difference results in higher fold-activations with LexA/RAR than LexA/TR. For instance, coexpression of B42/RXR conferred approximately 44-fold activation to LexA/RAR and approximately 11-fold activation to LexA/TR (Fig. 1B). It is noteworthy that incorporation of only the RXR I-box sequences conferred to the resulting chimera the ability to heterodimerize with RAR and TR (Fig. 1B, compare interactions with B42/HNF and B42/H-XXX). Thus, we conclude that the RXR I-box was indeed a transferable interaction interface for heterodimerization, as reported previously (21)..

First, none of the chimeric receptors was able to enhance the constitutive transcriptional activities of the LexA/HNF4, demonstrating that substitution of any of these HNF4 subregions with that of the RXR I-box blocked homodimerization. This suggests that important residues for the homodimeric interactions are present throughout the entire HNF4 I-box. Second, the C-terminal 11-amino acid subregion of the RXR I-box was sufficient to direct chimeric receptors to heterodimerize with RARs or TRs; i.e. B42/H-HHX, B42/X-HHX, B42/H-XHX, and B42/X-XHX efficiently interacted with LexA/RAR and LexA/TR (Fig. 3B)..

Among these, RXR K417, A424, and R426 (indicated by arrowheads in Fig. 4) are conserved changes from HNF4: i.e. HNF4 has glutamic acid, threonine, and glutamine (HNF4 E327, T334, and Q336) at these positions.

Interactions of these point-mutants with LexA/HNF4 were largely unaffected among single, double, and triple mutants with an exception of AR-K, as shown in Fig. 5B. All the quadruple mutants were not able to interact with LexA/HNF4 (Fig. 5B). In contrast, quadruple mutants AR-KA and AR-KR showed relatively strong interactions with LexA/RAR (Fig. 5B). Quaduple mutant AR-AR, all the triple mutants, double mutant AR, and, most surprisingly, two single mutants (A326 and R331) were also able to interact with LexA/RAR. These interactions were relatively weak, but highly specific, as these mutants did not show any interactions with LexA/GR either in the presence or absence of its ligand, deoxycortisol (data not shown). Addition of the RAR ligands, all-trans-retinoic acid or 9-cis-retinoic acid, did not affect the interactions (data not shown). The inherently weaker interactions of LexA/TR with the heterodimerizing chimeras, however, were not evident with these point-mutants. In contrast, as expected from their RAR-based mutations, P326 and PR that incorporate both P326 and R331 were not able to stimulate ss-galactosidase activities above that of B42/HNF when coexpressed with LexA/RAR (Fig. 5B). Western blot analyses were executed to confirm that the expression levels for all the mutants tested were indeed comparable (Fig. 5C and data not shown)..

0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	50	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   A dimerization interface has been identified within the DNA binding domains (DBDs) of RXRs, RARs, VDR, and TRs that selectively promote DNA binding to cognate direct repeat HREs (15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20). Another dimerization interface referred to as the I-box has recently been mapped to a transferable 40-amino acid region within the carboxy-terminal LBDs of RAR, TR, COUP-TF, and RXR, which mediates cooperative binding to DNA (21). In contrast to the interface within the DBDs, this dimerization motif promotes cooperative binding with similar efficiency to all three classes of repeats, DR, IR, and ER. In the recently described crystal structure of the RXR LBD (27), a rotationally symmetrical dimerization interface was formed mainly by helix 10 (H10) and, to a lesser extent, helix 9 (H9) and the loop between helix 7 (H7) and helix 8 (H8). The I-box nicely overlaps with H9 and H10 (Fig. 2), whose sequences are well conserved among a subset of nuclear receptors including HNF4 (11) and COUP-TF (12) that prefer to homodimerize. In addition, the crystal structures of RAR and TR LBDs (28, 29) demonstrate that the I-box regions adopt a structure similar to that of the RXR (27) in an overall common fold that can be summarized as an -helical antiparallel sandwich composed of 12 -helices (H1-H12). As expected from this common fold and the conservation of the I-box sequences, the HNF4 I-box was expected to play an important role in the HNF4-HNF4 interactions. As shown in Fig. 1, the HNF4 I-box region is indeed sufficient for the homodimeric interactions (see the results with B42/H/X-338/429 and B42/X-HHH in Fig. 1). However, residues critical for homodimerization are clearly different from those for heterodimerization, since the HNF4-HNF4 interactions were not affected by any of the HNF4 point-mutations replacing the two residues found to be critical for the heterodimeric interactions (Fig. 5). One potential explanation of the inability of B42/H-HHX and similar mutants (shown in Fig. 3) to interact with LexA/HNF4 is that the overall structure of the chimeras is disrupted.

Another dimerization interface referred to as the I-box has recently been mapped to a transferable 40-amino acid region within the carboxy-terminal LBDs of RAR, TR, COUP-TF, and RXR, which mediates cooperative binding to DNA (21). In contrast to the interface within the DBDs, this dimerization motif promotes cooperative binding with similar efficiency to all three classes of repeats, DR, IR, and ER. In the recently described crystal structure of the RXR LBD (27), a rotationally symmetrical dimerization interface was formed mainly by helix 10 (H10) and, to a lesser extent, helix 9 (H9) and the loop between helix 7 (H7) and helix 8 (H8). The I-box nicely overlaps with H9 and H10 (Fig. 2), whose sequences are well conserved among a subset of nuclear receptors including HNF4 (11) and COUP-TF (12) that prefer to homodimerize. In addition, the crystal structures of RAR and TR LBDs (28, 29) demonstrate that the I-box regions adopt a structure similar to that of the RXR (27) in an overall common fold that can be summarized as an -helical antiparallel sandwich composed of 12 -helices (H1-H12). As expected from this common fold and the conservation of the I-box sequences, the HNF4 I-box was expected to play an important role in the HNF4-HNF4 interactions. As shown in Fig. 1, the HNF4 I-box region is indeed sufficient for the homodimeric interactions (see the results with B42/H/X-338/429 and B42/X-HHH in Fig. 1). However, residues critical for homodimerization are clearly different from those for heterodimerization, since the HNF4-HNF4 interactions were not affected by any of the HNF4 point-mutations replacing the two residues found to be critical for the heterodimeric interactions (Fig. 5). One potential explanation of the inability of B42/H-HHX and similar mutants (shown in Fig. 3) to interact with LexA/HNF4 is that the overall structure of the chimeras is disrupted. However, this is ruled out by the ability of the chimeras to interact with LexA/RAR (Fig. 3)..
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	52	The results described here define an 11-amino acid subregion of the I-box as a major determinant of dimerization specificity. This is consistent with the fact that this subregion is contained within H10 (Fig. 2), a major interface in the recently described crystal structure of the RXR LBD (27) and overlaps with heptad 9 previously shown to be critical for both homo- and heterodimerization of RXR (30, 31, 32). We also found that a chimeric RAR construct containing the RXR 11-amino acid subregion readily interacted with RAR, lending further support for the importance of this subregion for the heterodimeric interactions (our unpublished results). Within this subregion, RXR amino acids A416 and R421 are particularly critical, consistent with the fact that these two residues are conserved between RXR and USP, but not in the homodimerizing HNF4. As shown in Fig. 4, HNF4 has glycine and leucine, while COUP-TF has glycine and arginine at these positions, respectively. In contrast, RAR and TR, heterodimeric partners of RXR, have proline and lysine at these positions. As expected, mutant HNF4s incorporating only the RXR A416 or R421 heterodimerized with RAR. However, these and other HNF4 point-mutants we constructed showed distinct interactions with different receptors. R331, which resembles COUP-TF at the two target positions, weakly interacted with LexA/RXR (data not shown), consistent with a recent finding in which COUP-TF was shown to have an ability to heterodimerize with RXR (14). In contrast, PR, which resembles RAR and TR at these positions, did not interact with LexA/RXR (data not shown). Similarly, AR with the RXR sequences at these two positions interacted less efficiently with LexA/RAR than single mutants A326 or R331 (Fig. 5B). Overall, these results suggest that the two residues (RXR A416 and R421) are clearly important for identity in heterodimerization. Finally, it should be noted that changes of these two residues alone were not sufficient to switch specificity in the dimeric interactions (i.e. from homodimerization to heterodimerization). The change of specificity in dimerization was achieved with at least three mutations incorporated, as shown by AR-K, which weakly interacts with LexA/RAR, but not with LexA/HNF (Fig. 5). Similarly, all the quadruple mutants changed specificity in dimerization (Fig. 5B; compare results with LexA/HNF4 and LexA/RAR). It is also noteworthy that the effects of substitutions with the corresponding RXR sequences on the heterodimerizing potential of the resulting HNF4 chimeras are largely accumulative: i.e. A326, R331, AR, AR-K, AR-A, AR-R, and AR-AR show relatively weak fold-activations with LexA/RAR (3- to 7-fold, as shown in Fig. 5B), while the quadruple mutants AR-KR and AR-KA, as well as the quintuple mutant B42/H-HHX (Fig. 3B), which incorporates all the five RXR amino acids of the 11-amino acid subregion, showed much stronger fold activations with LexA/RAR (23-, 21-, and 43-fold activations, respectively). Accordingly, identity seems to be determined in the context of the overall structures in relation to neighboring residues, rather than solely by nature of the two residues. In addition, it will be interesting to test effects of the identified mutations in the context of full-length receptors..

0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	54	In conclusion, we have identified an 11-amino acid subregion of the RXR I-box as a critical domain for the heterodimeric interactions and specifically identified two residues in this subregion as determinants of heterodimerization. Recently, we introduced random mutations into these two residues of RXR in an effort to make mutant RXR more selective in the process of heterodimerization. Consistent with the importance of these residues in heterodimerization, we were indeed able to find a series of mutant RXRs with significantly altered specificity (S.-K. Lee and J. W. Lee, unpublished). To understand in detail how these two residues fit into the overall structure of the I-box in each nuclear receptor and how they direct specificity in dimerization, more mutational studies as well as more structural information will be required..

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	4	The cholesterol 7-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A) is transcriptionally regulated by a number of factors, including hormones, bile acids, and diurnal rhythm. Previous studies have identified a region from nucleotides (nt) 74 to 55 of the rat CYP7A promoter that enhanced bile acid repression of the SV40 early promoter, as assayed with a luciferase reporter gene in transiently transfected HepG2 cells. The rat CYP7A promoter/reporter activity was strongly stimulated by cotransfection with an expression plasmid encoding the nuclear hormone receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) in a dose-dependent manner. Site-directed mutagenesis in the region of nt 74 to 55 altered this stimulation. Recombinant COUP-TFII expressed in HepG2 or COS-1 cells were found to bind to nt 74 55 and nt 149 128 probes by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and by supershifting the corresponding band with COUP-TFII-specific antibodies. The region of nt 176 117 was previously mapped as a retinoic acid response region and was found to bind retinoid X receptor (RXR). EMSA supershift assays of wild-type and mutant oligomers using antibody against RXR revealed that the sequences between nt 145 and 134 were important for RXR binding. We conclude that COUP-TFII stimulates the transcriptional activity of the rat CYP7A promoter by binding to the sequences between nt 74 to 54 and nt 149 to 128. RXR may stimulate CYP7A gene transcription by binding to a direct repeat of the hormone response element separated by one nucleotide located at nt 146 134..

The catabolism of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver is the main mechanism for elimination of cholesterol from the body and thus plays an important role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (1). The gene CYP7A is transcriptionally regulated by a number of factors, including bile acids, cholesterol, hormones, and circadian rhythm (2-6)..
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	7	The CYP7A promoter structure is typical of a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II promoter in that, upstream of the TATA box, there are several cis-acting elements that regulate the transcriptional activity of this promoter (7-9). Transient transfection assay of chimeric CYP7A promoter/luciferase constructs in HepG2 cells revealed that the region from nt 416 to +32 of the rat CYP7A gene contained the promoter and regulatory domains conferring the activation of transcription by dexamethasone and retinoic acid and suppression by bile acids, phorbol esters, and insulin (2, 3, 9, 10). We have mapped two footprints that are protected from DNase I digestion using rat liver nuclear extracts (11). Footprint (Fp)1 A is located between nt 81 and 35, and FpB is located between nt 148 and 129. Nucleotide sequences in these two regions are highly conserved among homologous CYP7A genes of different species. These footprints contain liver-enriched transcription factors binding sites and hormone response elements. A putative bile acid response element (BARE) was mapped to the FpA region, which lead us to propose that a bile acid responsive nuclear receptor may be mediating bile acid response (11)..

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	9	The molecular mechanism of bile acid repression is still unknown. Determining what factors interact with these BARE sequences is a first step in elucidating the nature of the bile acid response. A nuclear protein factor, which was found to bind a repeated sequence -65TCAAGTTCAAG-54 was named direct repeat binding protein (DRBP). Binding of DRBP to BARE was diminished when liver nuclear extract prepared from rats fed deoxycholate was used in EMSA (11). The sequence from nt 73 to 57 contains an imperfect direct repeat of the hormone response element (HRE, AGGTCA) separated by four nucleotides (DR4). According to the 3-4-5 rule for the binding specificity of the steroid/thyroid hormone family of transcription factors (12), a DR4 would be predicted to act as a thyroid hormone response element, hence "7TRE" as the tentative name for this DR4 sequence (11). However, CYP7A promoter constructs containing these sequences did not respond to thyroid hormones in HepG2 cells (2). A number of nuclear factors have affinity for DR4 sequences, including TR, XONR, and LXR that form heterodimers with RXR (13, 14). COUP-TFII (or ARP-1) of orphan nuclear receptor family with promiscuous binding specificities also bind a DR4 sequence (15, 16). COUP-TFs are believed to influence developmental changes, which is supported by the report that the COUP-TFII promoter responds to differentiation signal, retinoic acid (17). Recently, we have mapped a complex retinoic acid response region located between 176 and 117 of the rat CYP7A promoter (10)..

Primers were designed to introduce a 5 KpnI and a 3 XhoI site for cloning into the luciferase reporter vector, pGL2-Basic (Promega) resulting in the plasmid p-200/+32. The mutations in the sequences from nt 74 to 54 (see Fig. 1A) were introduced by linking two fragments synthesized by PCR with mutagenic primers containing restriction sites at the 5- or 3-end and using p-416/+32 as a template. The region from nt 74 to 54 was replaced with a SpeI site () by linking the nt 416/74 (SpeI) and nt 53(SpeI)/+32 fragments to generate p-41674/54 SpeI. To delete the SpeI site, p-41674/54 SpeI was digested with SpeI, treated with Mung bean nuclease, and then religated to generate deletion mutant p-41674/54. p20074/54 was obtained by PCR using p-41674/54 as a template. p-416LSM74/71 (linker-scanning mutation) was constructed by ligating a nt 70 to +32 (SpeI/XhoI) fragment to 416 74/54Spe digested with SpeI and XhoI. p-41674/65 was isolated as a spontaneously arising deletion mutant. p-416LSM-59/54, p-416LSM70/66, and p-416IM64/63 (insertion mutation) were constructed similarly to p-416LSM74/71.

Primers were designed to introduce a 5 KpnI and a 3 XhoI site for cloning into the luciferase reporter vector, pGL2-Basic (Promega) resulting in the plasmid p-200/+32. The mutations in the sequences from nt 74 to 54 (see Fig. 1A) were introduced by linking two fragments synthesized by PCR with mutagenic primers containing restriction sites at the 5- or 3-end and using p-416/+32 as a template. The region from nt 74 to 54 was replaced with a SpeI site () by linking the nt 416/74 (SpeI) and nt 53(SpeI)/+32 fragments to generate p-41674/54 SpeI. To delete the SpeI site, p-41674/54 SpeI was digested with SpeI, treated with Mung bean nuclease, and then religated to generate deletion mutant p-41674/54. p20074/54 was obtained by PCR using p-41674/54 as a template. p-416LSM74/71 (linker-scanning mutation) was constructed by ligating a nt 70 to +32 (SpeI/XhoI) fragment to 416 74/54Spe digested with SpeI and XhoI. p-41674/65 was isolated as a spontaneously arising deletion mutant. p-416LSM-59/54, p-416LSM70/66, and p-416IM64/63 (insertion mutation) were constructed similarly to p-416LSM74/71.

The dose-dependent stimulation of the promoter activity of the reporter plasmids by COUP-TFII fell into roughly three groups. In the first group, the wild-type promoter fragments (p-416/+32 and p-200/+32) showed the greatest stimulation of transcriptional activity, and the effect was positive at all points of the curve (Fig. 1B). The second group, which includes p-416LSM74/71, p-416LSM70/66, p-41674/65, p-416LSM59/54, p-41674/54, and p20074/54 displayed considerably flatter dose-response curves (Fig. 1B). The mutations in this group destroyed one or both of the putative HRE half-sites, AGGTCA, either by completely deleting the sequence (p-41674/65, p-41674/54, and p20074/54) or by replacing the sequence with an SpeI restriction site while preserving the relative spacing of sequences on either side of the mutation (p-416LSM74/71, p-416LSM70/66, and p-416LSM59/54) (Fig. 1A). Reporter plasmids with both HRE half-sites deleted (p-41674/54 and p20074/54) retained significant stimulation by COUP-TFII (approximately 3-4 fold), suggesting there may be additional COUP-TFII sites elsewhere in the promoter. Consistent with the hypothesis that the putative COUP-TFII activation elements were downstream of position nt 200, p-20074/54 was stimulated to approximately the same extent as p-41674/54, which has the same deletion but was 216 base pairs longer (Fig. 1B)..

The increased band shift with COS-1 extracts was attributed to the higher activity of the MT2 promoter of pTF3A, which drives transcription of the recombinant gene encoding COUP-TFII, in COS-1 cells relative to HepG2 cells. This presumably results in higher levels of expression of recombinant COUP-TFII in this cell line. Overexpression of COUP-TFII was associated with a reduction in DRBP binding, even in probes unable to be shifted by COUP-TFII (nt 72/59 and 65/54). The reduction in DRBP binding may be attributed to the reduced proportion of DRBP in the given mass of protein in COS-1 nuclear extracts overexpressed with recombinant COUP-TFII. Alternatively, if COUP-TFII interacts with DRBP in solution, the overexpressed COUP-TFII may be sequestering the DRBP and forms larger complexes with the probe nt 74/53.

The band that increased in intensity when shifted by nuclear extracts from HepG2 overexpressing COUP-TFII was supershifted by the anti-COUP-TF antibody (Fig. 3), indicating that COUP-TFII was interacting directly with the region. Extracts prepared from cells overexpressing recombinant C/EBP, LAP, HNF4, or HNF3 did not produce any changes in the band-shift pattern (data not shown), and antiserum directed against C/EBP (potential binding site at nt 52 to 41) and c-erbA (a homologue of the thyroid receptor that is regulated by phosphorylation events) did not change the gel shift pattern (Fig. 3).

However, when performed with extracts prepared from HepG2 cells treated with all trans-retinoic acid, the ligand for RAR, the nt 74 to 54 probe was weakly supershifted with anti-RXR (data not shown). DRBP, the major nuclear factor that binds to the sequence was not affected by the antibody, indicating that the proteins responsible for that band are distinct from COUP-TFII and RXR.

Antibody against RAR and RXR did not supershift the nt 74 to 53 probe. However, when performed with extracts prepared from HepG2 cells treated with all trans-retinoic acid, the ligand for RAR, the nt 74 to 54 probe was weakly supershifted with anti-RXR (data not shown). DRBP, the major nuclear factor that binds to the sequence was not affected by the antibody, indicating that the proteins responsible for that band are distinct from COUP-TFII and RXR. These results confirm that the COUP-TFII binds to DR4 motif, which does not bind thyroid hormone receptor. C/EBP, LAP, HNF4, and HNF3 do not bind to this region of CYP7A promoter..

The region of nt 146 to 134 was shown by EMSA to bind RXR and contains HRE half-sites separated by one nucleotide (DR1), the preferred binding site for RXR homodimer (14). The pattern of response of the mutants in nt 74 to 54 suggested that the nt 74 to 54 was the element with the strongest potential for COUP-TF activation of transcription. The deletion of the sequences from nt 74 to 54 results in the increase of transcriptional activity of CYP7A promoter/reporter plasmids. This sequence was previously found to mediate the bile acid response and to interact with DRBP, whose binding was sensitive to deoxycholate feeding in rats. Fig. 6 is a model which shows the binding sites for these transcription factors on the rat CYP7A proximal promoter. Interactions of transactivators COUP-TFII and RXR with DRBP and their competition for binding to these bile acid response elements may regulate the CYP7A gene transcription by bile acids and hormones. The CCAAT enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP and C/EBP or LAP) (21) consensus binding site flank the COUP-TFII binding site at nt 74 to 54. The C/EBP family of transcription factors are temporally regulated and are thus important developmental regulators of gene expression. COUP-TFII may recruit C/EBP on to the apolipoprotein A1 promoter (22). The DBP B-site, which also is the LAP binding site, was located in the nt 149 to 118 region (23). However, antibody directed against C/EBP and LAP did not supershift the nt 149/118 probe. This is consistent with the lack of effect of these transcription factors on CYP7A promoter activity we observed.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	51	In light of the well-characterized negative effect of COUP-TFII on gene promoters, removing a COUP-TFII binding site in CYP7A promoter may explain the much higher activity of the deletion mutants (Fig. 1). However, several recent reports support our finding that COUP-TFII also can function as a transactivator (24-27). COUP-TFII binds as a stable homodimer to many variations of GGTCA sequences in direct repeats and interferes with vitamin D3, thyroid hormone, and retinoic acid receptors by competing for the AGGTCA sites, the cognate sequences for the steroid/thyroid hormone receptors (15). However, if the negative effect of COUP-TFII is due to interfering with a positive factor, over-expression of COUP-TFII should repress the transcriptional activity of the CYP7A promoter. COUP-TFII activated transcription of the CYP7A promoter at all COUP-TFII expression plasmid to reporter plasmid ratios tried. The deletion of the strong proximal COUP-TFII site at nt 74 to 55 may allow enhancers in the promoter to interact more readily with the transcriptional machinery and resulting in higher transcriptional activity. COUP-TFII has been reported to interact with TFIIB (28) and to affect the transcriptional activity by interacting with other transcription factors. For example, COUP-TFII is required for activation of the apolipoprotein A1 promoter by RXR (22). As the COUP-TFII and RXR both recognized the nt 149 to 128 probe, it is possible that COUP-TFII may interact with RXR. The heterodimer of COUP-TFII and RXR is known to bind a DR1 motif and transrepress gene transcription (13)..

However, the DRBP and COUP-TFII apparently share binding sequence, the 3 COUP-TFII half-site overlaps with the DRBP binding site (Fig. 2A). COUP-TF clearly influences cholesterol metabolism, in that this transcription factor has previously been shown to affect the transcription of the promoters for apolipoprotein AI (16), apolipoprotein AII, apolipoprotein B (29), apolipoprotein CIII (29, 30) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene (27)..

Previously, we described the existence of a negative cis-acting regulatory element(s) within the 1- to 0.7-kilobase pair (kb) portion of the 5-flanking region of the mouse HGF promoter. In the present study, we show that the repressor element is located at position 872 to 860 base pairs and comprises an imperfect estrogen-responsive element 5-AGGTCAGAAAGACCA-3. We demonstrate that chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), a nuclear orphan receptor belonging to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, through binding to this site effectively silences the transcriptional activity of the HGF promoter. We show that estrogen receptor, on the other hand, relieves the repressive action of COUP-TF, resulting in the induction of the HGF promoter. Using mice transgenic for either 2.7 or 0.7 kb of the HGF promoter region linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, we found that injection of estradiol stimulates HGF promoter activity in tissues such as the mammary gland and ovary of mice harboring 2.7 but not 0.7 kb of the mouse HGF promoter region. Potential involvement of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors in the regulation of HGF gene expression is also discussed..

Further investigations revealed that HGF is a multifunctional cytokine with a broad range of target cells (3, 4). HGF elicits its biological effects through binding to and activating a specific transmembrane tyrosine kinase (4-6) known as Met (HGF receptor) (7). HGF gene expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level and is restricted to stromal cells such as fibroblasts, macrophages, leukocytes, and endothelial cells in various tissues. Numerous studies have shown that this growth factor is involved in the growth and regeneration of several organs (8-10). In response to tissue loss, such as in the case of partial hepatectomy or hepatotoxin injury, the level of HGF mRNA dramatically increases in the liver as well as in other organs such as the lung and spleen (9, 10). HGF mRNA also increases in the remaining kidney or lung after unilateral nephrectomy or pneumonectomy, respectively (9, 10). Recent investigations in transgenic mice homozygous for a null mutation in the HGF gene (knock-out mice) have proved that HGF is essential for the development of various tissues such as liver, muscle, and placenta (11, 12)..

For example, it has been shown that in MRC-5 fibroblasts and HL-60 cells HGF expression is down-regulated by transforming growth factor 1 and dexamethasone or by coculture with epithelial cells (13-15). In contrast, phorbol esters, interleukin-1, or tumor necrosis factor  increase HGF mRNA level (16-19). Overexpression of HGF mRNA in various neoplastic tissues has also been reported. To understand the transcriptional regulation of HGF, the sequences of the human, rat, and mouse HGF gene promoters have been determined and the major transcriptional start sites have been mapped (20-23). Several potential regulatory sites including NF-IL6 (also known as C/EBP) were identified in the 5-flanking region of the mouse HGF promoter by our laboratory (22) as well as by others (20-24). We reported the identification and partial characterization of a transcriptional repressor in the promoter of the mouse HGF gene (25). We also localized a negative regulatory region in the 5-flanking region of the mouse HGF promoter residing at position 1 to 0.7 kb (22). In the current study, we show that COUP-TF binds to an imperfect estrogen response element (ERE) in this region and represses HGF promoter activity. We show that high expression of the estrogen receptor counteracts the suppressive action of COUP-TF by competing for the same binding site..

The 2.7 HGF-CAT transgenic mouse lines (three different founders) harbor 2.7 kb of the HGF promoter that contains the HERE1 element. The 0.7 HGF-CAT transgenic lines (two different founders) carry 0.7 kb of the HGF promoter region that lacks the HERE1 element. Transgenic mice were maintained in animal facilities at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health standards established by the "Guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals." Mice were injected subcutaneously with 100 mg of 17-estradiol (Sigma) per kg of body weight in a volume of 0.1 ml of buffered saline containing 0.2% ethanol.

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	29	We previously reported the existence of a negative regulatory region in the 5-flanking region of the mouse HGF gene located between nucleotides 964 and 699 bp (22). To further define this region, two additional HGF-CAT chimeric constructs containing a 5 deletion (0.85 HGF-CAT) or an internal deletion (0.85 DHGF-CAT) were generated by using the restriction enzyme AflII (Fig. 1). Four different HGF-CAT chimeric constructs, 1.0 HGF-CAT, 0.85 HGF-CAT, 0.85 DHGF-CAT, and 0.7 HGF-CAT, were subsequently tested for promoter activity by transfection into human endometrial carcinoma RL95-2 cells, human hepatoma HepG2 cells, and mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells. Promoter activity of each construct as determined by CAT assays revealed that the 0.7 and 0.85 HGF-CAT constructs had consistently stronger promoter activity than the 0.85 DHGF-CAT and the 1.0 HGF-CAT constructs (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the region between nucleotides 964 and 812 bp contains a negative cis-acting element(s) and that a negative trans-acting factor(s) may interact with this 154-bp DNA fragment to repress HGF gene transcription. --> Fig. 1. Localization of a cis-acting repressor element in the 5-upstream flanking region of the mouse HGF promoter. Mouse HGF-CAT constructs consisting of a series of 5 deletions or an internal deletion were transiently transfected into NIH3T3, HepG2, and RL95-2 cells. Graphical representation of relative CAT activity after normalization against -galactosidase is shown.

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	32	To examine whether trans-acting factors specifically bind to the 154-bp DNA fragment, we performed gel mobility band shift analysis using the end-labeled 154-bp fragment with nuclear protein extracts from NIH3T3 cells. Examination of the DNA-protein complexes by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions revealed a prominent and specific band with a slow electrophoretic mobility. This complex was totally abrogated in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled "self" probe competitor (Fig. 2, lane 3). Since computer analysis of the nucleotide sequence of this DNA fragment identified consensus binding sites such as ERE and CRE, we carried out gel mobility band shift assays in the presence of synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the individual consensus sequences HERE1 and CRE and other potential binding sites that are present in the 5-flanking region of the mouse HGF. As shown in Fig. 2, the binding was completely abolished when a 100-fold molar excess of the HERE1 oligonucleotide (872 to 860 bp) was added to the reaction mixtures (Fig. 2, lane 4). On the other hand, the CRE oligonucleotide at a 100-fold molar excess did not compete for this binding site (Fig. 2, lane 6). Other oligonucleotides found in the mouse HGF promoter corresponding to GRE, TIE, AP1, IL-6RE, NF-IL6, and HERE2 (a mutated version of HERE1) also failed to compete with the 154-bp DNA fragment for binding to the nuclear protein present in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 7-11). We confirmed these results by DNase I footprinting analysis using NIH3T3 cells and mouse liver tissue nuclear protein extracts. Taken together, these data suggest that the HERE1 (nucleotides 872 to 860, 5-GGTCAGAAAGACC-3) is involved in the formation of the protein-DNA complex.

In NIH3T3 nuclear extract, the specific complex was abolished by unlabeled HERE1, VitA2ERE (wild type ERE), and COUP binding sites (Fig. 4A, lanes 3-5) but not by HERE2 and GRE (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 and 7). We used COUP binding site because it is well known that COUP-TF binds to the AGGTCA motif regardless of its configuration (single half-site, direct as well as indirect repeats, and various spacings) (29). Although RL95-2 cell nuclear extract formed two different bands with the HERE1 probe, these bands were totally abolished by 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled HERE1, VitA2ERE, and COUP oligonucleotides (Fig. 4A, lanes 9-11) but not by HERE2 and GRE (Fig. 4A, lanes 12 and 13). It is known that RL95-2 and NIH3T3 cells express small amounts of ER, and that the major function of ER in the transcriptional regulation of target genes is induction (30, 32). Given the fact that COUP-TF mainly exerts repression on its target genes through binding to VitA2ERE (30, 35, 36), we opted to determine if the protein complex formed by HERE1 is COUP-TF. To test this possibility, we performed supershift assays using antibody against COUP-TF, estrogen receptor, or nonimmune serum using the labeled HERE1 as probe. As shown in Fig. 4, anti-COUP-TF antibody totally abrogated complex formation between the HERE1 probe and nuclear proteins from different sources such as NIH3T3, HepG2, RL95-2 (Fig. 4B), and nonparenchymal liver cells (Fig. 4C) that are known to express the HGF gene. The anti-ER antibody and nonimmune control serum did not show any effects (Fig. 4, B and C). These results demonstrate that the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF binds to the HERE1 site of the HGF promoter region. It is of interest to note that HERE1 and HERE2 also bind to the estrogen receptor if this receptor is highly expressed (32). We previously demonstrated this by using extract from RL95-2 cells that were transfected with an ER expression vector (32). Taken together, our findings indicate that HERE1, like VitA2ERE, interacts with both ER and COUP-TF. --> Fig. 4. Identification of the protein(s) binding to the HERE1 element as COUP-TF.

Given the fact that COUP-TF mainly exerts repression on its target genes through binding to VitA2ERE (30, 35, 36), we opted to determine if the protein complex formed by HERE1 is COUP-TF. To test this possibility, we performed supershift assays using antibody against COUP-TF, estrogen receptor, or nonimmune serum using the labeled HERE1 as probe. As shown in Fig. 4, anti-COUP-TF antibody totally abrogated complex formation between the HERE1 probe and nuclear proteins from different sources such as NIH3T3, HepG2, RL95-2 (Fig. 4B), and nonparenchymal liver cells (Fig. 4C) that are known to express the HGF gene. The anti-ER antibody and nonimmune control serum did not show any effects (Fig. 4, B and C). These results demonstrate that the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF binds to the HERE1 site of the HGF promoter region. It is of interest to note that HERE1 and HERE2 also bind to the estrogen receptor if this receptor is highly expressed (32). We previously demonstrated this by using extract from RL95-2 cells that were transfected with an ER expression vector (32). Taken together, our findings indicate that HERE1, like VitA2ERE, interacts with both ER and COUP-TF. --> Fig. 4. Identification of the protein(s) binding to the HERE1 element as COUP-TF. A, the HERE1 element was labeled with 32P and incubated with nuclear protein extracts from NIH3T3 or RL95-2 cells. Double-stranded oligonucleotides including self, COUP, VitA2ERE, HERE2, and GRE were added to the reaction mixture to compete for binding as indicated (100 x ). B and C, supershift of HERE1 bound to nuclear protein(s) from NIH3T3, HepG2, RL95-2, and rat liver nonparenchymal cell (NPC) nuclear extracts by anti-COUP-TF antibody is shown. Anti-ER antibody and normal rabbit serum were also used for comparison. The binding assays were done as described under "Experimental Procedures."

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	40	To test whether the estrogen receptor relieves the repression of the HGF promoter activity mediated by COUP-TF, we co-transfected various HGF-CAT chimeric constructs with an estrogen expression vector into NIH3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, the promoter activity of the 0.85 DHGF-CAT and 1.0 HGF-CAT constructs that contain HERE1 increased in the presence of ER in a dose-dependent manner. However, the activity of the 0.85 HGF-CAT and 0.7 HGF-CAT constructs were not affected by ER since they do not contain the HERE1 region (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained when HERE1 was tested for its responsiveness to ER in the context of the SV40 heterologous promoter. CAT assays of NIH3T3 cell extracts co-transfected with the chimeric constructs HERE1-SV40-CAT and HERE2-SV40-CAT revealed that addition of increasing amounts of the estrogen receptor expression vector not only overcame the suppressive function conferred to the SV40 promoter by COUP-TF bound to HERE1 but also highly stimulated SV40 promoter activity (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, HERE2 did not suppress the SV40 promoter (since it does not bind COUP-TF; see Fig. 2, lane 11) but it bound ER with low affinity as we reported previously (32). Furthermore, overexpression of COUP-TF (pRS-COUP) in NIH3T3 cells counteracted the stimulatory function of ER on HERE1 but had no effect on the HERE2-SV40-CAT construct (Fig. 6B). These results demonstrate that the mouse HGF gene is transcriptionally suppressed by COUP-TF via binding to the HERE1 element at nucleotide 872 bp in the 5-flanking region of the mouse HGF gene. High expression of ER counteracts the suppressive function of COUP-TF by competing with ER for binding to HERE1. --> Fig. 5. Overexpression of ER relieves the repression of the HGF promoter exerted by COUP-TF. Four different HGF-CAT constructs (0.7 HGF-CAT, 0.85 HGF-CAT, 0.85 DHGF-CAT, and 1.0 HGF-CAT) were co-transfected with various concentrations of pHEO, the human estrogen receptor expression vector, as indicated into NIH3T3 cells in the presence of estradiol (107 M). CAT activity was normalized by -galactosidase activity, and the relative CAT activities are presented as the averages from three independent experiments performed in duplicate.

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	42	We previously showed that injection of estradiol into mice dramatically stimulated HGF mRNA expression in mouse ovary (32). Our present data reveal that the molecular mechanism by which estradiol stimulates the HGF promoter is through the counteraction by ER of COUP-TF, which directly down-regulates the mouse HGF promoter. Only high levels of ER counteract the suppression caused by COUP-TF bound to HERE1. To further confirm that HERE1 is functional and responsible for the stimulation of HGF mRNA by estradiol in vivo, we analyzed transgenic mice that harbor 2.7 and 0.7 kb of the mouse HGF promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene. The activity of the 2.7 HGF-CAT promoter construct in transgenic mice that carries the HERE1 element was up-regulated in the mammary tissue and ovary after injection of estradiol (Fig. 7). On the other hand, the activity of the 0.7 HGF-CAT construct that does not contain the HERE1 element did not change upon treatment with estradiol (data not shown). This result strongly suggests that in vivo high expression of ER counteracts COUP-TF and stimulates HGF mRNA expression. --> Fig. 7. Estradiol stimulates HGF promoter activity in transgenic mice. Cell extracts for CAT assays were prepared from mammary gland, adjacent skin, and ovary from 2.7 HGF-CAT transgenic mice that harbor 2.7 kb of the HGF promoter region and from nontransgenic mice after injection of 17-estradiol (100 mg/kg of body weight) or control saline solution. Fifty micrograms of total protein extract from each tissue were subjected to CAT assay. A graphic representation of relative CAT activity after normalization for protein concentration is shown.

In this region, an estrogen response element (HERE1) was identified that binds to ER and is responsible for the estradiol stimulation of the mouse HGF promoter in RL95-2 cells co-transfected with an ER expression vector (32). We now show that this same element binds with high affinity to the nuclear orphan receptor COUP-TF, which belongs to the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily, and silences the activity of the HGF promoter. We demonstrate that the estrogen receptor competes with COUP-TF for binding to this site, thereby relieving the repressive action of COUP-TF..

HERE1 is localized in the 5-flanking region and HERE2 is in the first intron of the HGF gene. By using gel mobility band shift and supershift assays, we demonstrated that HERE1 is similar to the ERE found in the vitellogenin (vit) gene (37) and that it binds not only to ER but also to COUP-TF (Fig. 4) (30 and 32). Co-transfection of ER or COUP-TF expression vectors in NIH3T3 cells revealed that HERE1 confers the repressive function of COUP-TF to the heterologous SV40 promoter and that not only did ER overcome the suppression of COUP-TF but it also stimulated the SV40 promoter (Fig. 6). In the homologous mouse HGF promoter, ER only counteracted the negative effects of COUP-TF (Fig. 5)..

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	48	The molecular mechanisms of COUP-TF-mediated transcriptional repression are partially understood. COUP-TF acts via several different mechanisms to inhibit target gene transcription including competition with other nuclear receptors for the occupancy of DNA binding sites, active repression of basal transcription, active repression of transactivator-dependent transcription, quenching of transactivator-dependent transcription, transrepression of activated transcription, and titration of the common coregulator RXR (31, 38). Our data shown here reveal that COUP-TF may down-regulate the mouse HGF promoter by active repression of basal transcription because HERE1 suppresses the basal SV40 promoter and that ER may activate HGF transcriptional activity by replacing COUP-TF and relieving the promoter from repression (Fig. 5). COUP-TF belongs to the orphan (thus far, no ligand has been found that can bind and directly regulate the activity of this factor) nuclear receptor family and resembles the thyroid hormone receptor/steroid hormone receptor superfamily (31, 36). The mode by which it represses its target gene involves the binding of COUP-TF to the AGGTCA motif arranged in various configurations (i.e. direct repeats (DR) or inverted repeats (IR) with different numbers of spacers ranging from 0 to 8 nucleotides) (31). Interestingly, the AGGTCA half-site depending on its configuration forms the response elements for other nuclear receptors such as the estrogen receptor (which binds to IR3), thyroid hormone receptor (which binds to IR0 or DR4), retinoid receptors (RAR, which binds to IR0 and DR2, and RXR, which binds to DR5 and DR1), vitamin D receptor (which binds to DR3), HNF4, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (31). It is believed that COUP-TF directly competes with these receptors for binding to the AGGTCA sequence and thus inhibits their transactivating functions. Suppression by COUP-TF is also achieved in part through heterodimerization of COUP-TF with RXR (which is the essential transactivating partner for vitamin D3 receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, and RAR), thereby titrating RXR to a transcriptionally inactive complex (31, 38). It is tempting to speculate that in addition to ER other members of the nuclear receptor family mentioned above may bind to the COUP-TF binding site in the HGF promoter HERE1 and thus activate HGF transcription in a tissue-specific manner. The COUP-TF site in the HGF promoter, however, is composed of an estrogen response element (IR3) and apparently binds only to the estrogen receptor..

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	50	Previous observations in our laboratory showed that administration of 17-estradiol to immature female mice caused a significant induction of HGF mRNA in the ovaries (32). The tissue- and cell type-specific expression of the mouse HGF gene by estrogen may be due to different amounts of hormone receptors in these tissues, as shown by other studies (37). Our present studies show that high expression of estrogen receptor in NIH3T3 cells is sufficient to counteract the suppression of COUP-TF on the mouse HGF promoter (Fig. 5). HGF promoter activity or lack thereof in transgenic mice also supports this hypothesis because estradiol stimulated the HGF promoter in mice carrying the 2.7 HGF-CAT construct that contains HERE1, particularly in tissues that have high expression of ER (Fig. 7). In this regard, it is important to understand how HGF gene expression is relieved from COUP-TF repression in other tissues in which ER may not be operational. The factors that are known to activate HGF expression include cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor  and polypeptide growth factors such as epidermal growth factor. These agents do not exert their gene-regulatory function directly through the AGGTCA motif, the DNA binding site for COUP-TF. Although the molecular mechanisms by which these agents induce their target genes are not fully understood, it is well established that they utilize members of the AP1, C/EBP, nuclear factor B (NFKB), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors. Indeed, in our previous report (22) we demonstrated that several NF-IL6 (C/EBP) response elements exist in the 5-flanking region of the HGF promoter region and that IL-6 induces HGF promoter activity in a stromal (fibroblast) cell line stably transfected with an HGF-CAT chimeric construct. In our very recent investigations using gel shift, supershift, and CAT assays, we have found that functional C/EBP binding sites exist in the HGF promoter. We also found that co-transfection of expression vectors encoding C/EBP or C/EBP with HGF-CAT vectors dramatically (more than 20-fold) stimulates the transcriptional activity of various HGF-CAT promoter constructs (even those constructs that do not contain COUP-TF binding sites, thus indicating that promoter activation is not due to interference with COUP-TF binding).3 These observations provide an explanation for how the HGF promoter is released from repression exerted by negative acting factors such as COUP-TF. The C/EBP family of transcription factors is known to consist of regulators of important cellular functions ranging from metabolism to cell growth to differentiation..

HNF4 is central to embryogenesis (2,3) and is required for the normal function of hepatocytes and pancreatic ss-cells (4,5). HNF4 occupies a key position in a complex transcription factor network and directly regulates the expression of genes involved in the transport and metabolism of various nutrients, as well as that of genes coding for serum proteins (1). HNF4 is linked to human diseases: mutations in HNF4 response elements in promoters of factors VII and IX are correlated with haemophilia, while mutations in the HNF4 gene have been found in patients carrying the syndrome of maturity onset diabetes of the young 1 (MODY1) (1,6)..

Two of these domains, the DNA binding domain (DBD) and the ligand binding domain (LBD) are involved in dimerisation of HNF4, which behaves as a homodimer (8). Dimerisation via the DBD is involved in HNF4 dimerisation on DNA, whereas dimerisation via the LBD is essential for dimerisation in solution and strongly stabilises the HNF4 to DNA complex (9,10). The LBD is also involved in other functions, including transcriptional activation and interaction with transcriptional partners. Both domains are well conserved in HNF4 (11). Crystal structures of the LBDs of HNF4 and HNF4 have recently been resolved (12,13). These LBDs adopt the canonical fold of -helices (10 helices numbered H1 to H12 to follow the conventional nomenclature) and ss-sheets arranged as an antiparallel -helical  sandwich  in a three-layer structure shared with the LBD of other nuclear receptors (14). The LBD structures of HNF4 and HNF4 are very similar and closely resemble that of RXR, another member of the nuclear receptor subfamily 2 (NR2). Indeed, 194 core carbons of the LBD of HNF4 and RXR superimpose with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 1.26 A and 223 core carbons of the LBD of HNF4 and RXR superimpose with a r.m.s.d. of 1.00 A (12,13). In these structures, the LBD dimerisation interface is made of residues in helices 7 (H7), 9 (H9) and 10 (H10), the major part of the interface being made up of H10..

This structure gives rise to the formation of a series of intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds that improve RXR LBD homodimerisation (27). In particular, residues E352 and R348 are directly involved in the dimerisation interface by forming charge-driven interactions. The -helical conformation near E352 in the RXR homodimer and the resulting interactions were also observed in the PPAR/RXR LBD heterodimer (28). Sequence alignment indicates that a glutamic acid residue and an arginyl residue are also encountered at the equivalent positions in human and rat HNF4 (E262 and R258). Figure 1 shows that these residues are conserved in remote species such as Drosophila and in the Xenopus HNF4ss and are specifically encountered in members of the NR2 subfamily (27 to 29). Interestingly, in the crystal structure of the HNF4 LBD, a bulge near E262 was also observed in H7 (12). Gampe et al. described this glutamate as a single residue E insert in H7 and hypothesised that it may play a crucial role in the function of nuclear receptors belonging to the NR2 subfamily, including HNF4 (27,28). We investigated the role of the E262 and R258 amino acid residues in HNF4 function using biochemical and mutagenesis studies..

According to Gampe et al. (27,28), the inserted glutamate residue (indicated by the arrow in Fig. 1) may facilitate RXR dimerisation (i) because of the -helix conformation its insertion generates and (ii) because of its carboxylic group, which forms a salt bridge and hydrogen bonds (27,28). A similar conformation was observed near the corresponding E262 residue in the HNF4 LBD (12). We investigated the role of this glutamate residue in HNF42 dimerisation. To this end, the HNF42 E262 residue was deleted in construct HNF42-E262 and its charge was inverted in construct HNF42-E262K and removed in constructs HNF42-E262A and HNF42-E262M, the bulk of the residue being conserved in the latter mutation..

Dimerisation was studied by either co-immunoprecipitation assays using c-myc-HNF42 WT or GST pull-down assays using GST-HNF42 WT. As expected, HNF42 WT efficiently bound to both c-myc-HNF42 WT (Fig. 2A) and GST-HNF42 WT (Fig. 2B). Conversely, all mutants failed to bind efficiently to c-myc-HNF42 WT (Fig. 2A) or GST-HNF42 WT (Fig. 2B). Next, we analysed the effects of mutations on dimerisation of a given mutant with itself. For these assays, we focused on mutants E262A and E262. In co-immunoprecipitation assays, no dimer was detectable with either E262A or E262 (Fig. 2C). This result was not due to a lower expression of mutated c-myc-HNF42 (Fig. 2C, insert). Impaired dimerisation of mutants was confirmed by pull-down experiments performed in increasingly stringent conditions. HNF42 WT dimerisation was unaltered at 300 mM KCl and decreased by only 25% at 600 mM KCl (Fig. 2D). In sharp contrast, dimerisation dropped dramatically at 300 and 600 mM KCl for both mutants (Fig. 2D). Thus, removing the carboxylic group at position 262 is sufficient to strongly impair HNF42 dimerisation in solution..

This led us to investigate the role of the corresponding R258 residue of HNF42 in dimerisation. When the positive charge of this residue was removed in the R258M mutant, HNF4 dimerisation dropped (Fig. 2E), although less markedly than when elicited by E262 mutations (compare decrease in dimerisation in Fig. 2A and E).

Surprisingly, none of the mutations altered HNF42 binding to the HNF4 response element of the HNF1 promoter (HNF1 site, Fig. 3A). The specificity of the band shift was ascertained by supershifting it with HNF4 antiserum 455 (33) (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained on another HNF4 response element, site B of the apoCIII promoter (CIIIB site), which is also a direct repeat 1 (DR1) (Fig. 3E, results in the absence of competitor). Results obtained with increasing amounts of labelled probe exclude that lack of detection of DNA binding impairment by E262A mutation was due to saturated binding (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained with other mutants (data not shown). Mutated and wild-type HNF4 yielded a retarded band of identical intensity and electrophoretic mobility. More specifically, we did not observe a band of higher mobility corresponding to a HNF4 monomer bound to DNA as observed for the RAR monomer (15). In addition, to rule out the possibility that mutants bound to DNA as two adjacent monomers, we performed EMSA with the HNF1 mt site containing one mutated half-site and obtained no binding of the mutants (Fig. 3D). Thus, HNF4 mutants, like wild-type HNF4, bind DNA as homodimers. To evidence possibly diminished interactions with DNA, we performed EMSA in less-favorable conditions. First, we increased the ionic strength (300 versus 100 mM KCl in Fig. 3A) in EMSA but found no difference in DNA binding between wild-type and mutated HNF4 (data not shown). Second, we carried out competition experiments with COUP-TFII, which binds to several HNF4 response elements. The rationale here was to check whether this nuclear receptor impinges on DNA binding of HNF42-E262A more efficiently than on wild-type HNF42. In these assays, the truncated COUP-TFII AB was used to distinguish complexes formed with either HNF42 or COUP-TFII. EMSA was performed on the CIIIB site since COUP-TFII does not bind to the HNF1 site (17,30). COUP-TFII AB similarly competed for HNF42 WT and -E262A DNA binding (Fig. 3E). Also, unlabelled DNA competed equally for DNA binding of both proteins (data not shown). In addition, we observed that mutations did not alter binding to a direct repeat 2 (DR2), to which HNF4 binds less efficiently than to a DR1 (9) (data not shown). It appears therefore that the E262 residue does not play a significant role in HNF42 DNA binding..

The I-box almost perfectly overlaps H9 and H10 that form the major portion of the dimer interface in RXR and HNF4 homodimers (12,13,27,36). Mutagenesis studies also showed that the HNF4 I-box is an important interaction interface for homodimerisation in solution (37) and is likely involved in DNA binding (15). We therefore compared the effects of mutations in H7 and H10 on HNF4 dimerisation in solution and DNA binding. Until now, the role of the HNF4 I-box has been studied using multiple (double, triple or quadruple) mutations (15,37). For example, the K300E-E327K HNF4 double mutant was used to show the involvement of the salt bridge between these residues in the exclusive homodimerisation of HNF4 (15). For our comparative study, we chose a single mutation located in H10 E327M. In co-immunoprecipitation assays with c-myc-HNF42 WT, we observed that the E327M mutation decreased HNF42 dimerisation in solution by 25% (Fig. 4A). The extent of this decrease was similar to that observed for the R258M mutation (Fig. 2E). A similar drop in HNF42 dimerisation in solution with E327M and R258M mutations was also observed in GST pull-down assays (Fig. 4B). Note that the impairment of dimerisation by the E262 mutations was stronger, as observed in both co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays (Fig. 2A and B). The stronger effect of the E262A mutation on HNF42 dimerisation in solution was confirmed by a different co-immunoprecipitation assay, where unlabelled HNF42 WT, -R258M, -E262A or -E327M and the 455 antiserum raised against their common C-terminus were used to co-immunoprecipitate labelled HNF43, which contains a different C-terminus not recognised by this antiserum. R258M, E262A and E327M mutations strongly impaired the ability of HNF42 to interact with HNF43 (Fig. 4C), thus confirming the involvement of these three residues in HNF4 dimerisation. Quantification again indicated that the E262A mutation resulted in the strongest impairment of HNF42 dimerisation in solution (Fig. 4C)..

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	46	  In contrast to E262A and R258M mutations, the E327M mutation moderately but significantly decreased HNF42 DNA binding to the HNF1 site (Fig. 4D). The specificity of the band shift was ascertained by supershifting it with the 455 antiserum (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, the intensities of the supershifted bands obtained with wild-type and E327M HNF4 were similar. It has previously been shown that the impaired DNA binding of HNF4 mutants (i.e. K300E-E327K and R154X) due to decreased dimerisation could be rescued in the presence of antibodies, which facilitate dimerisation. This phenomenon is likely due to the bivalency of antigen recognition by antibodies (15,32). Conversely, when decreased DNA binding is not due to a loss of dimerisation, DNA binding is not recovered in the presence of antibodies, as observed for the D126Y and D126H HNF4 mutants (38). Therefore, the decreased DNA binding and impaired dimerisation of the E327M mutant are directly correlated. E327M mutation also impaired HNF42 DNA binding to the CIIIB site and to the synthetic DR2 site (data not shown). Our results not only confirm that H10 and H9 constitute a motif of the LBD dimerisation interface required for efficient DNA binding of HNF4 (15), but also show that another region of the LBD dimerisation interface, namely H7, is not required for strong DNA binding of this protein..

However, HNF4 transcriptional activity was abolished by E262 deletion (Fig. 5A).

The loss of activation by HNF42-E262 was neither due to a lower protein expression, as controlled by western blotting (Fig. 6D), nor to an unfolding of the protein, as assessed by limited protease mapping assays using chymotrypsin or trypsin (data not shown). Deletion of the neighbouring residue, D261, also abolished HNF4 transcriptional activity (Fig. 5A, last bar). The dramatic drop in HNF4 transcriptional activity caused by the E262 deletion prompted us to determine whether this mutant exhibits a dominant-negative effect on the wild-type protein.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	53	  To gain further insight into the consequences of altered dimerisation of HNF4 by substitution mutations, we took advantage of the fact that a truncated HNF4 lacking the AF-2 activation function module (HNF4-AF-2, left part of Fig. 5F) exhibits a dominant-negative effect through its ability to dimerise with the wild-type protein (7). In a first set of experiments, we compared HNF4-AF-2 repression on the transcriptional activities of wild-type HNF4 and of the two mutants E262A and E262K. The rationale was that the dominant-negative mutant would exhibit a weaker repression on mutant HNF4, with impaired dimerisation, than on wild-type HNF4. HNF4-AF-2 reduced the activity of wild-type HNF4 by 50% while it reduced that of E262A and E262K mutants by 29 and 26%, respectively (Fig. 5F). Accordingly, compared to HNF4-AF-2, HNF4-AF-2 bearing the E262A mutation (HNF4-AF-2-E262A) exhibited a weaker repressive activity on the wild-type protein. Indeed, HNF4-AF-2 reduced the wild-type HNF4-mediated activation of transcription by 50% while HNF4-AF-2-E262A reduced it by 30% (Fig. 5G). By demonstrating that substitution mutations of E262 affect repression of HNF4-mediated activation of transcription, our results highlight the importance of this residue for dimerisation in a cell context..

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	57	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   We observed that two charged residues located in H7 of the HNF4 LBD, i.e. R258 and E262, are involved in HNF4 dimerisation in solution. We failed to detect significant impairment of DNA binding of their substitution mutants. At first glance, this may seem striking, since dimerisation via the LBD is thought to be crucial for strong HNF4 DNA binding. However, the accuracy of our findings is verified by the fact that (i) results obtained by various pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays all converge and (ii) the same methods and EMSA allowed us to detect the expected impairments due to the E327M mutation located in H10. In addition, our results are in agreement with recent crystallographic studies of the HNF4 LBD, which indicate that H7, together with H9 and H10, constitute the dimerisation interface of this nuclear receptor (12,13). The interest of our work was to describe the critical role of the charge of R258 and E262 residues in dimerisation in solution of HNF4, a role suggested by Gampe et al. from the crystal structure of RXR (27,28). Mutants of nuclear receptors that are deficient in dimerisation in solution after in vitro analysis but still able to efficiently bind DNA have already been described (39 to 41). To explain the behaviour of several of these mutants, it was suggested that dimers were stabilised on DNA via the DBD dimerisation interface. However, such a hypothesis is unlikely here since the E327M mutation impaired DNA binding in spite of its lower effect on dimerisation in solution than E262 mutations. A more probable explanation of the efficient DNA binding of H7 mutants is that the HNF4 dimerisation interface is improved by a DNA binding-induced conformational change of the LBD. An allosteric effect of DNA, which modulated HNF4 recruitment of co-repressors, has recently been documented (42). We also observed an allosteric effect of DNA that most likely occurs in the LBD and modulates coactivator recruitment (data not shown)..

Failure to detect a subtle loss of HNF4 function in these assays where the protein is overexpressed does not exclude that these mutations may have greater consequences on HNF4 function when the protein is expressed at normal levels. Interestingly, a significant effect of substitution mutants in H7 on HNF4 transcriptional activity could be detected by analysing the repression of this activity with an HNF4 mutant exhibiting a dominant-negative activity. These results demonstrate the importance of E262 for HNF4 dimerisation in a cell context. Moreover, it should be kept in mind that the activity of nuclear receptors can be repressed by proteins that prevent their dimerisation (43,44). HNF4 is a target of AMP-activated protein kinase, which inhibits HNF4 activity by decreasing its dimerisation (45). The ability of HNF4 to form a highly stable homodimer in solution (8) is likely crucial in this type of repressive mechanism that does not exclusively occur on DNA. Other pathways that do not necessarily require DNA binding include cross-regulatory mechanisms in which nuclear receptors are frequently involved. In these mechanisms, dimerisation can be of major importance (46). Since HNF4 is known to interact with numerous other transcription factors, including Smad proteins (18), it likely participates in cross-regulatory pathways. Therefore, involvement of H7 residues in dimerisation in solution may be crucial in HNF4 biological activities..

Note that, probably due in part to its impaired dimerisation, HNF4-E262 did not exhibit a dominant-negative activity. None of the MODY1-associated HNF4 mutants can repress wild-type HNF4 activity (6). Even single or double mutations in the AF-2 module, which is crucial for HNF4 transcriptional activity, do not result in a dominant-negative effect (J.Eeckhoute, unpublished results). Interestingly, HNF4-D261, a mutant having a deletion of the neighbouring residue, exhibited an abolished transcriptional activity but an unaltered DNA binding (EMSA data not shown), a behaviour that is very similar to that of the E262 mutant. These findings may be explained by the loss of the special conformation (the -helix) in H7, which was hypothesised to result from the presence of an additional residue, the  E insert  (28). The D261 and E262 deletions most probably modify the orientation of the side chain of residues in H7. Several residues in H7 point towards the HNF4 ligand binding pocket and probably participate in fatty acid binding, which is required for the stability and function of HNF4 and HNF4 (12,13). The marked decrease in HNF4 transcriptional activity and recruitment of transcriptional partners caused by the E262 deletion may reflect the alteration in fatty acid binding secondary to the loss of the -helix conformation generated by this glutamate residue..

H9 and H10 constitute the core of the LBD dimerisation interface of several non-steroid nuclear receptors (27,36,47,48). This core is required for efficient DNA binding (35). In HNF4, this core is also involved in dimerisation required for DNA binding, as evidenced using a double mutation in H9 and H10 (15). We observed that a single mutation in H10, E327M, was sufficient to alter HNF4 dimerisation and DNA binding. The role of H7 in nuclear receptors has been less extensively studied and only recent crystallographic data indicate that its contribution to dimerisation varies according to the receptor and, for RXR, with its homodimeric or heterodimeric state (47). Concerning HNF4, our results clearly show that H7 has a crucial role in dimerisation in solution but does not contribute to the dimerisation activity required for DNA binding..

Based on the zinc finger motif of the DNA binding domain and on a potential ligand binding domain HNF4 is classified as a member of the nuclear orphan receptor superfamily (4 ). HNF4[alpha] turned out to be present also in non-hepatic cells such as kidney, intestine, stomach and pancreas (5 -7 ). The importance of HNF4[alpha] in gene control in tissues distinct from the liver has been documented by the fact that a human inherited disease is based on the expression of a mutated HNF4[alpha] gene in the endocrine pancreas leading to maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY1; 8 ). In addition to the role of HNF4[alpha] as a tissue specific transcription factor it functions also in early embryogenesis: in the Xenopus egg we identified the HNF4[alpha] protein as a maternal transcription factor that contributes to the zygotic activation of the gene encoding HNF1[alpha] (9 ). In mouse embryos HNF4[alpha] transcripts have been identified in the primary endoderm as early as day 4.5 and later in the liver diverticulum, the gut and nephrogenic tissues starting from day 8.5 (6 ,10 ). The early embryonic requirement of HNF4[alpha] is well established in the mouse, as the knock-out of the HNF4[alpha] gene leads to a disturbance of gastrulation and thus to early embryonic lethality (11 ). The embryonic role of HNF4 seems to be evolutionary conserved, as maternal HNF4 mRNA has been identified in the Drosophila egg. Furthermore, a large chromosomal deletion spanning the HNF4 locus results in defects in the gut and malpighian tubules of the developing Drosophila and these malformations are interpreted that HNF4 plays similar functions in invertebrates and vertebrates (7 )..

Thus far, six distinct splice variants of HNF4[alpha] have been identified in human and murine cDNA samples. We use the nomenclature most recently used for the human splice variants (12 ): HNF4[alpha]1 represents the initially identified transcript (3 ) and HNF4[alpha]2 through HNF4[alpha]6 are the splice variants identified subsequently. HNF4[alpha]2 is a splice variant that contains a larger exon 9 resulting in an insertion of 10 additional amino acids in the Pro-rich C-terminal part and has been identified in the rat (13 ), the mouse (14 ) and human (1 ,15 ). HNF4[alpha]3 initially refered to as HNF-4C (16 ) has been identified in human liver cDNA and is characterized by a shorter and distinct C-terminus, whereas HNF4[alpha]4 found in human kidney and liver RNA contains in the N-terminal region the two additional exons 1B and 1C (1 ,12 ). The fifth splice variant HNF4[alpha]5 carries the exon 1B and 1C found in HNF4[alpha]4 together with the larger exon 9 found in HNF4[alpha]2, whereas HNF4[alpha]6 combines exon 1B and exon 1C with the C-terminal truncation found in HNF4[alpha]3 (12 ). We speculate that all these splice variants have unique properties allowing a modulation of the HNF4[alpha] activity. Indeed, we have shown in transient transfection assays using HNF4 dependent reporter genes, that HNF4[alpha]4 has a lower transactivation potential compared to HNF4[alpha]2 (1 ). However, it should be stressed that all these HNF4[alpha] variants have only been identified as mRNAs and the existence of the corresponding proteins has not been proven..

The fifth splice variant HNF4[alpha]5 carries the exon 1B and 1C found in HNF4[alpha]4 together with the larger exon 9 found in HNF4[alpha]2, whereas HNF4[alpha]6 combines exon 1B and exon 1C with the C-terminal truncation found in HNF4[alpha]3 (12 ). We speculate that all these splice variants have unique properties allowing a modulation of the HNF4[alpha] activity. Indeed, we have shown in transient transfection assays using HNF4 dependent reporter genes, that HNF4[alpha]4 has a lower transactivation potential compared to HNF4[alpha]2 (1 ). However, it should be stressed that all these HNF4[alpha] variants have only been identified as mRNAs and the existence of the corresponding proteins has not been proven..

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	24	It is well established that the composition of the culture medium has a profound effect on the differentiation state of hepatocytes (23 ). In general the presence of serum leads to substantial dedifferentiation of the hepatic phenotype. To explore whether the cultivation conditions of hepatocytes has any effect on the expression of tissue specific transcription factors known to be responsible for the hepatic phenotype, we determined the presence of liver transcription factors in the immortalized murine hepatic cell line MHSV-12. This cell line has been found to express most abundantly transcripts of liver specific proteins such as albumin, aldolase A and B as well as tyrosine amino transferase, but this liver specific expression pattern is reversibly decreased in serum containing medium (23 ). Analyzing the expression of HNF1[alpha] in the MHSV-12 cell line cultured under various conditions we did not detect any change in this transcription factor (data not shown). However, probing HNF4[alpha] in gel retardation assays using various antibodies we detected some significant differences: as illustrated in Figure 1 A, in extracts of MHSV-12 cells grown in serum-free MX83 medium, that maintains a highly differentiated hepatic phenotype (23 ), HNF4[alpha] could readily be detected in gel retardation experiments (lane 1) and this DNA-protein complex could be supershifted by an antibody raised against the A/B-domain or the F-domain of HNF4[alpha] (lanes 2 and 3, respectively). In contrast, in extracts derived from MHSV-12 cells cultivated in the presence of serum, that leads to a dramatic dedifferentiation (23 ), we observed that the HNF4[alpha] protein detected in gel retardation assays (lane 4) did not react with the antibody specific for the A/B-domain of HNF4[alpha] (lane 5). However, in the same extracts the presence of HNF4[alpha] protein could be verified with the antibody specific for the F-domain (lane 6). These results imply that the properties of HNF4[alpha] change in MHSV-12 cells depending on the culture conditions..

As the difference in the HNF4[alpha] protein is only detected with the monoclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal A/B-domain, we suspected a distinct 5'-end of the HNF4[alpha] mRNA. Therefore, we generated by reverse transcription a cDNA starting in the D-domain (primer HN7 in Fig. 3 A) and ligated this DNA at the 5'-end with an oligonucleotide that could be used as a second primer start site. Using this 5' RACE strategy we succeeded in cloning two independent cDNA fragments, that were analyzed by sequencing. The sequence of the longer cDNA clone, shown in Figure 3 B, revealed that the 5'-end from -107 to +47 is completely different from the published nucleotide sequence of mouse HNF4[alpha], whereas the 3'-end (nucleotide +48 to +274) is highly identical to the known sequence. The loss of identity is exactly at the same position in the shorter cDNA clone (data not shown), thus excluding a cloning artefact. As the loss of identity corresponds in both cases to the position of the exon 1-exon 2 boundary (6 ), we anticipate that the new cDNA encodes a novel splice variant of the HNF4[alpha] gene we refer to as HNF4[alpha]7..

However, these RT-PCR reactions were performed close to saturation and, therefore, heavily overestimate the amount of HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts. In contrast the previously described HNF4[alpha]1 splice variant is exclusively detected in MHSV-12 cells grown in serum-free medium (compare lanes 4 and 5). These data confirm that the serum induced change in the differentiation state of the hepatic cells is accompanied by an alteration in the HNF4[alpha] splice variants. In differentiated cells grown under serum-free conditions HNF4[alpha]1, and to a small extent HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts, are present, whereas dedifferentiated cells grown with serum contain almost exclusively the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant..

The presence of this splice variant was confirmed by RT-PCR using primers specific for the [alpha]7 splice variant.

By RT-PCR using the primer pair HN18/HN7 (lanes 1 and 2) or HN6/HN7 (lanes 4 and 5) the presence of the [alpha]7 and [alpha]1 splice variant was determined, respectively. The RNA used was either prepared from cells grown in serumfree MX83 medium (lanes 2 and 4) or from cells maintained in DMEM with 10% serum (lanes 1 and 5). The PCR products were separated on a 1.8% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. pBR322 plasmid DNA restricted with Alw441 and Mva1 was loaded in lane 3 as size marker.The marker fragment migrating between the HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 PCR product is 383bp in size. The position of the primers is given in Figure 3A. HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 have distinct transactivation potential.

Using a luciferase reporter construct containing four HNF4 binding sites in front of the tk promoter (31 ) we observed in the dedifferentiated hepatoma cell line C2 that lacks HNF4[alpha], (31 ) a 2-fold lower transactivation potential of HNF4[alpha]7 compared to HNF4[alpha]1 (Fig. 5 A). In Hela cells an even greater difference in the transactivation potential between the two splice variants was observed (Fig. 5 B). In fact using high concentrations of the HNF4[alpha]7 expression vector no transactivation of the luciferase reporter was seen. Taken together these results establish that MHSV-12 cells grown in serum, that leads to dramatic dedifferentiation of the hepatic phenotype, contain the HNF4[alpha]7 variant that has a significantly lower transactivation potential..

(A) The dedifferentiated hepatoma cell line C2 lacking HNF4[alpha] was transiently transfected with 50 ng expression vector encoding HNF4[alpha] protein and 2  microg H4-tk-luc as a reporter, that contains four copies of the HNF4 binding site from the human [alpha]1-anti-trypsin gene in front of the thymidine kinase promoter as previously described (31). Rc/CMV (InVitrogen) is the expression vector without insert, whereas rHNF4[alpha]1 contains the rat transcription factor (3) used to construct the mHNF4[alpha]1 and mHNF4[alpha]7 constructs. mHNF4[alpha]1 is a mouse rat chimeric protein with amino acids 1-102 derived from the mouse [alpha]1 protein and amino acids 103 to the C-terminus of the rat protein. mHNF4[alpha]7 is the corresponding chimeric protein containing the N-terminus of the [alpha]7 splice variant fused to the C-terminus of the rat protein. For both these constructs the AccI site at codon 102 of the HNF4[alpha]1 protein was used (see Fig. 3B). (B) Increasing amounts of the expression vector encoding mHNF4[alpha]1 or mHNF4[alpha]7 were transfected into Hela cells with the H4-tk-luc reporter. The amount of plasmid DNA was kept constant by adding Rc/CMV. The error bars given refer to independent transfection experiments..

RNA isolated from mouse tissues were analyzed by RT-PCR for the presence of the HNF4[alpha]7 and HNF4[alpha]1 splice variants using the HN18/HN7 and HN6/HN7 primer pairs, respectively (see Fig 3A). To control the quality of the RNA the presence of GAPDH mRNA was analyzed in aliquots of the same RT reactions. The print-outs of the phosphor imager represent PCR reactions generated by using 35 (HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7) or 30 (GAPDH) cycles. To estimate the abundance of the HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts the signals were counted in the phosphor imager and corrected for the amount of GAPDH mRNA. To ascertain that the PCR reactions were still in the linear range the values given for the high expressing tissues (liver, kidney, stomach and intestine) were calculated from experiments using only 30 cycles of amplification..

The HNF4[alpha]7 and HNF4[alpha]1 transcripts were detected by RT-PCR as in Figure 6 using 35 cycles of amplification. The GAPDH RNA was amplified by 25 cycles.

The arrow designates the complexes containing HNF4[alpha]1 or HNF4[alpha]7, whereas the arrow head points to the supershift containing HNF4[alpha]1. (C) RNA prepared from the embryonic stem cell line E14-1 grown on feeder cells (lane 2) or from the feeder cells alone (lane 3) was analyzed by RT-PCR for the presence of HNF4[alpha]7 (35 cycles) and GAPDH (25 cycles) mRNA as in (A). In lane 1 no RNA was added in the RT reaction. HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 show a distinct tissue specific expression pattern.

To allow a reliable quantification we made the PCR reaction with 32P-labeled dCTP that permits low cycling numbers and thus ensures quantitative measurements. As shown in Figure 6 both these transcripts can be identified in the liver and the stomach (lanes 1 and 3), whereas in the kidney and to a smaller extent in the intestine only the HNF4[alpha]1 transcript can be detected. In the pancreas only small amounts of HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts are present. But the significance of this finding is questionable as the GAPDH mRNA cannot be seen probably because the pancreatic RNase was not sufficiently inhibited during RNA preparation. However, traces of HNF4[alpha]7 RNA were also detected in the ovary, heart, bladder and brain, where no HNF4[alpha]1 transcripts and normal levels of GAPDH RNA were observed. Clearly, the HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 splice variants are expressed differentially in the various tissues analyzed. By quantification of the PCR products in a phosphor imager we estimate that in the stomach about a third of the HNF4[alpha] transcripts correspond to the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant (lane 3). Furthermore, the abundance of the HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts differs by a factor of ~1000-fold between high and low expressing tissues. HNF4[alpha]7 is expressed in embryonic stem cells of the mouse.

Therefore, we investigated the presence of HNF4[alpha]7 in the murine embryonal carcinoma cell line F9 that resembles the pluripotent stem cells of the inner cell mass of the early mouse embryo. This cell line can can be differentiated into distinct endodermal cell types upon retinoic acid treatment. Most interestingly these stem cells can be differentiated by retinoic acid treatment into visceral endoderm when they are cultured in suspension as aggregates and these cell types share properties of hepatocytes (24 ,32 ) . Based on RT-PCR we succeeded to show that undifferentiated F9 cells contain exclusively the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant ( Fig. 7 A, lanes 1 and 2), whereas the differentiated cell population contains the HNF4[alpha]1 as well as the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variants (lanes 3 and 4). From three independent experiments we estimated by quantification in a phosphor imager a 15-fold increase in HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA upon differentiation into visceral endoderm, whereas the level of HNF4[alpha]1 transcripts increased from undetectable levels to a value ~60% of the amount of the HNF4[alpha]7 transcript. Since in the immortalized hepatic MHSV-12 cells grown in the presence of serum, the balance between HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 is altered by the addition of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Fig. 1 ), we wondered whether a similar effect is seen in F9 cells. As Figure 7 A demonstrates the expression pattern of HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 is not changed upon dexamethasone treatment in either undifferentiated or differentiated F9 cells..

Early embryonic expression of the HNF4[alpha] gene starting in the primary endoderm at embryonic day 4.5 of the mouse has been documented by in situ hybridization (10 ). As the probe used in these experiments did not differentiate between the [alpha]1 and [alpha]7 splice variant, the identity of this signal in respect to the splice variants is not clear. However, another in situ hybridization used a genomic fragment of the exon 1 of the original HNF4[alpha] transcript (6 ) and thus, in retrospect, was a HNF4[alpha]1 specific probe. With this probe HNF4[alpha] transcripts were first localised only on day 7 p.c. in visceral extraembryonic endoderm. This detection at a later time point in embryogenesis could well reflect the fact that this probe could not hybridize to the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant. Similarly, the relatively late appearance of HNF4[alpha] binding activity in gel retardation assays starting at 8.5 days p.c. (25 ) might also be interpreted as a lack of reactivity of the antibody with the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant. Therefore, by indirect evidence the earlier appearance of HNF4[alpha]7 compared to HNF4[alpha]1, we have seen in the differentiating F9 cells (Fig. 7A and B) matches the available data in the developing embryo..

As unfertilized mouse eggs are about 20 times larger than the ES cells, the input RNA in the RT-PCR corresponds to ~4000 ES cells. Since in such an ES cell aliquot we could identify the HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA, we assume that HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts are absent in the egg and accumulate by zygotic transcription in early mouse embryogenesis. This is consistent with the appearance of HNF4[alpha] transcripts in in situ hybridization experiments with a probe detecting HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 only at day 4.5 p.c. (10 ). Therefore, it seems unlikely that HNF4[alpha] mRNA is a maternal component in mammals. This is in contrast to Drosophila HNF4 (7 ) and Xenopus HNF4[beta] mRNA (2 ) that are known to be present as maternal transcripts.

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	70	Our finding that the transactivation potential of the HNF4[alpha] splice variants differs in transient transfection assays and that the extent of this effect depends on the cell type used (Fig. 5 ), indicates that the two HNF4[alpha] splice variants cooperate differentially with other transcription factors. As the HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 splice variants have distinct N-termini, we expect that this domain determines the differential cooperation. Therefore, we exclude the reported interaction with COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII (38 ) as well as the binding to HNF1[alpha] (39 ) as the mechanisms mediating the distinct properties of of HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7, since these interactions involve the C-terminus common to HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7. However, the specific binding observed with the basal transcription factor TFIIB (40 ) might trigger the distinct properties of the two splice variants, as the formation of this complex requires the N-terminus of HNF4[alpha] (38 ,40 ). Alternatively, HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 may exert distinct activities due to differential heterodimerization with other members of the HNF4 family (1 ,2 ). But we would not expect differential heterodimerization with other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, since HNF4[alpha] seems usually not to heterodimerize with these components (41 ,42 )..

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	72	Analyzing the expression of the HNF4[alpha] splice variants we revealed that HNF4[alpha]7 is under a complex regulatory network. In the hepatic cell line MHSV-12 the glucocorticoid plays a major role as the lack of this hormone seems to be a critical component for the appearance of HNF4[alpha]7. Clearly, the glucocorticoid hormone alters the balance between the HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 splice variants. As glucocorticoids are known to trigger the final stage of hepatic differentiation at birth (43 ), we have investigated the expression of these two HNF4[alpha] splice variants. Using liver extracts from 2 days before birth up to 2 days after birth we could not see any change (data not shown). In fact, as all the HNF4 binding activity observed in gel retardation assays could be supershifted by the A/B specific antibody at all stages analyzed, we have no data to support a major change in HNF4[alpha] splice variants at birth, although glucocorticoid action is an essential step at this developmental stage. A lack of glucocorticoid control was also seen in F9 cells. Neither in undifferentiated nor in differentiated F9 cells the addition of dexamethasone altered the level of the HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA (Fig. 7 A). On the other hand in these F9 cells the retinoic acid mediated differentiation to visceral endoderm leads to an increase in HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA but more significantly also to the appearance of the HNF4[alpha]1 splice variant. This change in HNF4[alpha] expression can also be seen on the protein level, as HNF4 binding activity reacting with the anti A/B antibody is only detected in the differentiated cells (Fig. 7 B)..

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	74	Our data show that the splice variant HNF4[alpha]7 contains a distinct first exon. As the original exon 1 of the murine HNF4[alpha] gene has been shown to contain the initiation site of the promoter (6 ,44 ), we assume that the novel exon 1 found in HNF4[alpha]7 indicates a second promoter of the HNF4[alpha] gene. Therefore, we propose that the differential expression of the two splice variants is mainly due to the differential use of two distinct promoters of the HNF4[alpha] gene ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
