Maturity onset diabetes of the young, subtype 1 (MODY1), is associated with defective glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. MODY1 is caused by mutation in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4). To understand better the MODY1 phenotype, we tested whether HNF4 was able to modulate directly the insulin gene promoter. Transfection of cultured 293T cells with an HNF4 expression vector led to 10-fold activation of a cotransfected reporter plasmid containing the rat insulin I gene promoter. Computer analysis revealed a potential HNF4-binding site between nucleotides 57 and 69 of the promoter; mutation of this sequence led to reduced ability of HNF4 to activate the promoter. The ability of HNF4 to bind this sequence was confirmed using gel shift analysis. In transfected INS-1 beta cells, mutation of either the HNF1 site or the HNF4 site in the insulin gene promoter led to 50-75% reduction in reporter gene activity; expression of dominant negative HNF4 led to significant reduction in the activity of wild type and both mutated promoters. Thus, in addition to the previously described indirect action of HNF4 on insulin gene expression mediated through elevated HNF1 levels, HNF4 also activates the insulin gene directly, through a previously unrecognized cis element.     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES
In adult mammals, the insulin gene is expressed exclusively in the beta cells of the endocrine pancreas (1-3). This selectivity is controlled primarily at the transcriptional level through well defined promoter elements (4-6). Although a number of transcription factors have been defined that interact with the insulin promoter and activate it in synergistic fashion (7-10), the action of these factors alone is not sufficient to explain the remarkable degree of cell specificity observed in vivo (9). Most likely, additional transcription factors participate in achieving specificity.
MODY1 is a monogenic form of diabetes characterized by impaired glucose-dependent insulin secretion in the absence of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues (11, 12). This indicates that a beta cell defect is the primary cause of MODY and implies that MODY genes have a role in insulin production and/or secretion. Consistent with this is the fact that four of the five known MODY subtypes are caused by mutations in distinct transcription factors expressed in pancreatic beta cells (13). The striking MODY phenotype caused by such single gene disorders provides clear evidence of the important role of each of these transcription factors in beta cell function.
MODY1 is caused by mutation in HNF4, a transcription factor of the nuclear receptor subfamily (14). At least eight different mutations have been identified in MODY1 patients (15). Four mutations result in truncated HNF4 proteins, of which two are nonsense mutations (14, 16), and two are frameshift mutations (17, 18). The other four mutations are missense mutations that affect various domains of the HNF4 protein (19-22).
MODY3 is caused by mutation in the HNF1 gene encoding a transcription factor of the homeodomain family (23). Like HNF4, HNF1 is expressed in liver and beta cells. In fact, HNF1 was shown to be a direct transcriptional target of HNF4 in liver (24). Furthermore, a mutation in the HNF4-binding site in the HNF1 gene promoter produces a MODY phenotype (25). Consistent with these observations, MODY1 and MODY3 show a similar clinical phenotype. Recent studies (26) have shown that induction of dominant negative (DN) HNF1 in beta cells leads to alterations in expression of a number of beta cell genes including the insulin gene. Because DN-HNF4 led to reduced activity of the Hnf1 promoter and reduced insulin mRNA levels (27), it was hypothesized that HNF4 increases insulin mRNA levels indirectly by increasing HNF1 levels, which in turn activate the promoter through binding to an HNF1 consensus sequence (28).
Recently, however, strong evidence has been obtained indicating that this hypothesis may be an over-simplification and that the actual relationship between HNF4 and HNF1 may be more complex; it has been shown (29, 30) that P2, the major promoter of the Hnf4 gene in beta cells, is regulated by HNF1. Therefore, activation of beta cell genes by HNF4 may involve more than a simple transcriptional regulatory cascade mediated through HNF1, as previously envisaged.
In this study, we have examined this idea through a detailed analysis of the insulin gene promoter. In addition to confirming that HNF4 activates insulin gene expression in an indirect fashion, through an HNF1-binding site, we have identified a novel cis element in the insulin gene promoter, which mediates direct activation of the promoter by HNF4 in beta cells.     EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES Cell Culture
293T, HeLa S3 Tet-Off (CLONTECH PT3001-1), and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (200 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100  microg/ml). INS-1 DN-HNF4 26 cells (27) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50  microM 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin (200 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100  microg/ml) supplemented with 150  microg/ml G418 and 100  microg/ml hygromycin.
Plasmids
Reporter Plasmids-- pGL3.Synt.LUC, a plasmid containing the luciferase (LUC) gene controlled by the rat insulin I gene promoter, was generated by replacement of the SV40 promoter of pGL3-promoter vector (Promega) with the insulin promoter fragment (410 to 1). pGL3.SV40.LUC is the plasmid pGL3-promoter vector (Promega), containing the luciferase gene controlled by the SV40 early promoter. RSV.LUC contains the luciferase gene controlled by the RSV promoter (31). -Actin.LUC contains the luciferase gene controlled by -actin promoter. CMV.TK.LUC contains the luciferase gene controlled by CMV enhancer and herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. The reporter plasmids Synt 5 LUC, Synt 6 LUC, Synt 7 LUC, and Synt 8 LUC contain the luciferase gene controlled by Synt 5-8 block replacement mutants of the rat insulin I promoter (5). pGL3.HNF4Synt.LUC was generated by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis of pGL3.Synt.LUC. The nucleotides mutated (57 to 69) were ACGGCAAAGTCCA to CATTACCCTGAAC. pGL3.HNF1Synt.LUC was generated by subcloning of the mutated insulin promoter from 410MFInsLUC to pGL3-promoter vector (Promega). The nucleotides mutated (222 to 218) were TTAAT to GTCCG. The Renilla luciferase internal control plasmid pRL.RSV contains the Renilla luciferase coding sequence from pRL null vector (Promega) controlled by the RSV promoter.
Expression Plasmids-- pSG5.HNF4 encodes rat HNF4 controlled by the SV40 early promoter. pcDNA3.HNF4 encodes rat HNF4 controlled by the CMV promoter. pCMV.PDX1 is a PDX1 expression vector controlled by the CMV promoter. pCMV.E2A is a mouse E2A (E47) expression vector (9) controlled by the CMV promoter. pCGN.HA.BETA is a BETA2 expression vector encoding hemagglutinin epitope-tagged BETA2 controlled by the CMV promoter (9).
Transfection
Transfections of 293T, HeLa, and COS7 cells were carried out by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique (32). 4-7 h after addition of DNA, cells were exposed to 20% glycerol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 min. Cells were harvested 40-48 h after transfection, and cell extracts were assayed for reporter enzyme activity. INS-1 DN-HNF4 26 cells (27) were transfected using electroporation as follows. Cells were suspended in 450  microl of cold phosphate-buffered saline (calcium/magnesium-free), and plasmid DNA dissolved in 50  microl of H2O was added. Cells were incubated on ice for 10 min, then transferred to 4-mm gap cuvettes (BTX), and pulsed for 6 ms at 320 V/cm, 975 microfarads using an ECM 830 pulse generator. For induction of DN-HNF4, cells were incubated with 1  microg/ml doxycycline for 24 h prior to transfection.
Reporter Gene Assay
Following transfection, cell extracts were prepared by 3 cycles of freeze-thawing, followed by centrifugation to remove cell debris. The firefly and Renilla luciferase assays were carried out as follows: extracts containing 5-50  microg (2-5  microl) of protein were added to 50  microl of firefly luciferase assay buffer (Promega E1501) or 100  microl of Renilla luciferase assay buffer (33). The samples were placed in a luminometer (LUMAC Biocounter M2500), and light output was determined over a 10-s interval. Statistical significance was evaluated by t test using InStat software.
Oligonucleotide Probes
Oligonucleotides were synthesized corresponding to the HNF4 binding element (HBE) region (5'-gatccGCCCTTAATGGGCCAAACGGCAAAGTCCAGGGa-3') from the rat insulin I promoter (5) (positions 86 to 53) and C3P region (5'-agctGCAGGTGACCTTTGACCAGCTc-3') from the rat ApoCIII promoter (34). Radioactive probes were generated by incubation of the appropriate annealed oligonucleotides (5 pmol) in the presence of 50  microCi of [-32P]dATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), 0.25 mM dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 5 units of DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs, Klenow fragment) for 40 min at room temperature. The radiolabeled oligonucleotides were separated from free nucleotide by spin dialysis using Sephadex G-50. Specific activity obtained was typically ~2,000 cpm/fmol.
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)
Cells were transfected with 10  microg of expression plasmids as described above. Whole cell extracts (10-15  microg of protein) were incubated for 10 min on ice in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2.5 mM MgCl2) containing 600 ng of poly(dI dC) and 600 ng of poly(dA dT) (Sigma) in a final assay volume of 14  microl. Subsequently, 1  microl of 32P-labeled probe was added (~10 fmol), and incubation was allowed to continue on ice for an additional 25 min. Samples were subsequently resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 45 mM Tris borate, 1 mM EDTA (0.5 x  TBE) at 184 V for 2 h at 4  degrees C. The gel was dried, and the labeled DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. In supershift experiments, 1  microl of anti-HNF4 antiserum or preimmune serum was added after the first 10 min of incubation, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min before addition of the 32P-labeled probe.     RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES
HNF4 Can Activate the Insulin Gene Promoter-- Because HNF4 was previously shown to affect insulin mRNA levels in beta cells (27), its involvement in the direct transcriptional regulation of the insulin gene was examined. 293T cells were transfected with a reporter plasmid encoding the luciferase gene controlled by the rat insulin I gene promoter (410 to 1) in the presence or absence of an HNF4 expression plasmid. For comparison, cells were also transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids controlled by no promoter or by other promoters as follows: RSV, -actin, CMV.TK, and SV40 in the presence or absence of HNF4 expression plasmid. HNF4 activated transcription of the insulin gene promoter 9.5-fold (Fig. 1) but did not activate the other promoters tested, indicating that this activation is specific. Similar results were obtained upon transfection of HeLa cells (not shown).

Activation of the insulin gene promoter by HNF4 protein. 293T cells were transfected with 1  microg of luciferase reporter plasmid containing either no promoter (pGL3.basic), the rat insulin I gene promoter (pGL3.Synt), or one of the following promoters: SV40, RSV, -actin, or CMV.TK in the presence of 1  microg of HNF4 expression plasmid (pcDNA3.HNF4) or empty expression plasmid control. Results are expressed as the ratio of luciferase activity observed in the presence as compared to the absence of HNF4. Each data point represents the mean  plus or minus  S.E. of at least three independent transfection experiments for each reporter plasmid. The asterisk indicates statistical significance (p  <  0.0001) in the presence compared to the absence of HNF4.
Identification of the Region in the Insulin Gene Promoter Important for HNF4 Activation-- In order to characterize further this HNF4-dependent activation, the insulin gene promoter was scanned for the presence of an HNF4 consensus binding sequence using TESS software (www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess). Such a consensus site was found between nucleotides 57 and 69 (Fig. 2), suggesting the presence of an HNF4-binding site in the promoter of the insulin gene. To determine whether this putative HNF4-binding site is necessary for HNF4 activation of the insulin gene promoter, we examined the ability of HNF4 to activate the insulin gene promoter mutated at this site. Four block replacement mutants of the insulin promoter, spanning the consensus binding sequence and designated Synt 5-8, were used (5) (Fig. 2). As before, 293T cells were transfected with reporter plasmids encoding the luciferase gene controlled by the wild type rat insulin I promoter or by one of its mutated variants, Synt 5-8, in the presence or absence of HNF4 expression plasmid. HNF4 activation of mutants Synt 5 and Synt 8, in which mutations are located outside the putative HNF4-binding site, was not reduced compared with wild type promoter activation. In contrast, mutation Synt 6 and Synt 7, each abolishing a part of the HNF4 consensus site, showed significantly attenuated activation (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the nucleotides mutated in mutants Synt 6 and Synt 7 are important for HNF4 activation of the insulin gene promoter.

An HNF4 consensus site (boldface letters) is located between nucleotides 57 and 69 and adjacent to PDX1-binding site (boldface letters). Block replacement mutants of the insulin promoter, designated Synt 5-8 (5), were generated by mutation of all nucleotides of the relevant portion of the wild type sequence as follows: A  C and G  T. The location of the HBE probe is also shown.

Block replacement mutations in the HNF4 consensus binding site in the insulin gene promoter reduce HNF4 activation of the promoter. 293T cells were transfected with 1  microg of luciferase (LUC) reporter plasmid containing the wild type rat insulin I promoter or each of the block replacement mutants Synt 5-8 in the presence of 1  microg of HNF4 expression plasmid (pcDNA3.HNF4) or empty expression plasmid control. The nucleotides mutated in Synt 5-8 are 43 to 53, 54 to 63, 64 to 68, and 79 to 88, respectively (5). Results are expressed as the ratio of luciferase activity observed in the presence as compared to the absence of HNF4. Each data point represents the mean  plus or minus  S.E. of at least three independent transfection experiments for each reporter plasmid. Asterisks indicate statistical significance (p = 0.024 for Synt 6 and p = 0.0006 for Synt 7) compared with the values obtained for wild type promoter.
HNF4 Can Bind the Insulin Gene Promoter-- We next tested the ability of HNF4 to bind to the putative binding sequence in the insulin gene promoter. An EMSA was performed using a probe containing the putative HNF4-binding site, designated the HBE element (Fig. 2). Whole cell extracts were made from HeLa cells transfected with HNF4 expression plasmid and from untransfected HeLa cells. Incubation of transfected extracts with the radiolabeled HBE probe resulted in a strong band that was absent when extracts from mock-transfected cells were used (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). Competition with unlabeled HBE oligonucleotide abolished this band (lane 3). Addition of anti-HNF4 serum generated a supershifted band that was not observed with preimmune serum, confirming the presence of HNF4 in the complex (lanes 4 and 5). Apolipoprotein C III (ApoCIII) is a well characterized target gene of HNF4 (35, 36). Competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the C3P element, an HNF4-binding site in the ApoCIII gene promoter (37), also abolished the observed band (lane 6). Competition with increasing amounts of unlabeled HBE and C3P probes indicates that HNF4 affinity to its binding site in ApoCIII gene is higher than its affinity to the binding site in the insulin gene (Fig. 4B).
View larger version (44K):    Fig. 4.   HNF4 can bind the insulin gene promoter, as demonstrated in EMSA. A, whole cell extracts from mock-transfected HeLa cells (lane 1) or HeLa cells transfected with HNF4 expression vector (lanes 2-6) were incubated with 32P-labeled HBE probe and separated on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Specificity of binding was analyzed by adding 100- or 60-fold molar excess of unlabeled HBE probe (lane 3) or C3P probe (lane 6), respectively. The formation of an immune complex is shown with the addition of anti-HNF4 serum (lane 4) and compared with the addition of preimmune serum (lane 5). B, affinity of HNF4 to HBE probe is lower than its affinity to C3P probe. Whole cell extracts made from untransfected COS7 cells (lane 1) or COS7 cells transfected with HNF4 expression vector (lanes 2-10) were incubated with 32P-labeled HBE probe and separated on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Competition was performed using 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled HBE oligonucleotide (lanes 3-6, respectively) or 3-, 10-, 20-, and 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled C3P oligonucleotide (lanes 7-10, respectively).
HNF4 and Other Insulin Gene Transcription Factors-- E2A (38-40), BETA2 (NeuroD) (41, 42), and PDX1 (also known as IPF1, STF1, and IDX1) (43-45) are well characterized insulin gene transcription factors that can synergistically activate the insulin gene promoter when cotransfected to HeLa cells with a reporter gene controlled by the promoter; however, when the insulin promoter construct is transfected to beta cells, it is ~4 times more active (9). This implies that additional factor(s), present in beta cells, may be important for insulin gene regulation. In light of our data showing that HNF4 can bind and activate the insulin gene promoter, its possible cooperation with the other three known insulin gene transcription factors was examined. 293T cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid controlled by the rat insulin I gene promoter and with expression plasmids encoding the four transcription factors E2A, BETA2, PDX1, and HNF4. Expression of HNF4 with E2A, BETA2, and PDX1 produced a synergistic activation of the insulin gene promoter that was ~2-fold higher than the activation generated by the three factors alone (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained upon transfecting HeLa cells (not shown).
View larger version (32K):    Fig. 5.   A, HNF4 enhances the insulin gene promoter activation generated by E2A, BETA2, and PDX1. 293T cells were cotransfected with 1  microg of luciferase reporter plasmid containing the rat insulin I promoter in the presence or absence of 0.1  microg of expression vectors encoding HNF4, E2A, BETA2, and PDX1 as indicated. Results are expressed relative to the activity observed in the presence of E2A + BETA2 + PDX1. Each bar represents the mean  plus or minus  S.E. of 8 independent experiments. The asterisk indicates statistical significance (p = 0.005) compared with the value obtained upon transfection with E2A + BETA2 + PDX1. B, HNF4 enhances PDX1 activation of the promoter in a synergistic manner. 293T cells were cotransfected with 1  microg of luciferase reporter plasmid containing the rat insulin I gene promoter in the presence or absence of 0.1  microg of expression plasmids encoding the indicated transcription factors. Results are expressed relative to the activity observed in the presence of HNF4 + PDX1. Each data point represents the mean  plus or minus  S.E. of 8 independent transfection experiments. Asterisks indicate statistical significance (p  <  0.0001 for HNF4 and for PDX1) compared with HNF4 + PDX1.
To investigate further this augmented activation generated by HNF4, the effect of HNF4 and PDX1 was tested in the absence of E2A and BETA2. 293T cells were cotransfected with a reporter plasmid encoding the luciferase gene controlled by the rat insulin I promoter and with expression vectors encoding PDX1 and HNF4. Expression of HNF4 and PDX1 generated synergistic activation of the promoter (Fig. 5B). Synergistic activation was also observed in HeLa cells (not shown). This cooperativity of HNF4 with PDX1 is probably responsible for the synergistic activation observed previously upon coexpression of HNF4 with E2A, BETA2, and PDX1.
Mechanism of Action of HNF4 in Beta Cells-- Expression of dominant negative HNF1 in the beta cell line INS-1 reduced the expression of several beta cell genes, including the insulin gene (26), and has similar effects to that of dominant negative HNF4 (27). Furthermore, HNF4 is a transcription activator of HNF1 (24, 27), and mutations in HNF1 are responsible for MODY3 (23). This raises the possibility that HNF4 may activate the insulin gene indirectly, through Hnf1 gene function. In non-beta cells, the HNF4-dependent activation we observed (Fig. 1) may be mediated in part through HNF1, but the substantial reduction in the activation of promoter mutated in the HNF4-binding site (Fig. 3) indicates that a significant portion of the effect is mediated directly.
To assess the significance of the HNF4 site in the insulin gene promoter in beta cells, and to test whether in beta cells HNF4 activates the insulin gene promoter directly or indirectly through HNF1, we used INS-1 DN-HNF4 26 cells, a derivative of INS-1 cells that contains a plasmid encoding doxycycline-inducible dominant negative HNF4 (27). This dominant negative protein possesses a functional dimerization domain but lacks a DNA binding domain and therefore suppresses activity of the endogenous wild type HNF4. Luciferase reporter plasmids controlled by wild type rat insulin I gene promoter or by promoter mutated either in HNF1- or HNF4-binding sites were electroporated into these cells. In the absence of doxycycline (i.e. no expression of DN-HNF4), mutations in either the HNF4 site or the HNF1 site led to reduced activity of the insulin gene promoter (Fig. 6A). Thus both sites are important for full transcriptional activation in beta cells.
View larger version (32K):    Fig. 6.   Effect of DN-HNF4 on wild type and mutated insulin gene promoter in beta cells. A, luciferase reporter genes containing wild type insulin gene promoter (wild type, WT) and insulin gene promoter containing mutations in the HNF1 site (HNF1) or HNF4 site (HNF4) were electroporated into INS-1 DN-HNF4 26 cells in the presence (light bars) and absence (dark bars) of doxycycline (Dox., to induce DN-HNF4). Cells were harvested 48 h following electroporation, and normalized luciferase activity was determined. Results are expressed relative to the activity obtained for wild type promoter in the absence of doxycycline. Each data point represents the mean  plus or minus  S.E. of at least three independent electroporation experiments. Asterisks indicate statistical significance (p = 0.04 for wild type (WT), p = 0.02 for HNF4, and p = 0.02 for HNF1) in the presence compared to the absence of doxycycline. B, model depicting possible effects of DN-HNF4 on insulin gene expression.
To confirm the role of HNF4 and to distinguish between a direct action of HNF4 as compared with an indirect action mediated through HNF1, we compared the activity of wild type and mutated promoters in the presence and absence of doxycycline. If HNF4 acts exclusively in an indirect manner, through HNF1, induction of DN-HNF4 should not affect the activity of promoter mutated at the HNF1 site. In fact, induction of DN-HNF4 significantly reduced the activity of both the wild type promoter and promoter mutated in the HNF1-binding site (Fig. 6A), confirming the involvement of HNF4 in insulin promoter activation, and showing that at least part of this effect does not involve HNF1. Furthermore, expression of DN-HNF4 led to significant reduction in activity of a promoter fragment mutated in the HNF4 site (Fig. 6A), confirming that HNF4 also increases insulin gene transcription through an indirect effect via HNF1 (Fig. 6B). Although this experimental system does not permit quantitative comparison of the relative contribution of the direct effects as compared with the indirect effects of HNF4, the significant DN-HNF4-dependent reduction in observed activity for both the HNF1 and HNF4 promoter clearly indicates that both effects are substantial.     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES
Identification of HNF1 and HNF4 as the mutated genes responsible for MODY3 and MODY1, respectively, has prompted efforts to establish the precise role of these factors in health and disease. Because the MODY phenotype involves a primary defect in beta cells, the defective function of these transcription factors must be manifested in these cells. Indeed, expression of DN-HNF1 and DN-HNF4 leads to clear alterations in expression of key beta cell genes, including the insulin gene (26, 27). Because previous studies have shown that HNF4 is an activator of HNF1 (24) and that MODY3 can be caused by mutation in an HNF4-binding site in the HNF1 promoter (25), it was proposed that the effect of HNF4 on the insulin gene promoter is indirect, mediated through activation of HNF1 (27).
In this report, we have examined the above hypothesis. Expression of DN-HNF4 in beta cells led to reduced activity of both wild type insulin gene promoter and promoter mutated in the HNF1-binding site, strongly suggesting the presence of an HNF4-binding site elsewhere in the promoter region. Indeed, we identified such a sequence between nucleotides 57 and 69 of the promoter, and we were able to show that it is capable of binding HNF4 in vitro. We further showed that this site is essential for full activation of the promoter in beta cells and for efficient HNF4-dependent activation in non-beta cells. Expression of DN-HNF4 in beta cells also led to reduced activity of a promoter construct bearing mutations in the HNF4 site. The data therefore indicate that in addition to the previously recognized indirect action of HNF4 on insulin gene expression mediated through HNF1, there is also a direct action mediated through binding to the novel HNF4 consensus sequence in the promoter.
These results are consistent with recent reports (29, 30) indicating that the epistatic relationship between HNF4 and HNF1 in beta cells is more complex than previously appreciated and may differ from that in liver. It has been shown that the Hnf4 promoter contains an upstream beta cell-specific promoter whose activity is regulated by HNF1. This promoter also contains a binding site for PDX1, mutations in which strongly correlate with the diabetic phenotype in a MODY family (30). Taken together, the data are consistent with the idea that HNF1, HNF4, and PDX1 participate in a complex autoregulatory transcriptional network that controls many of the functional properties of developing and mature beta cells. Of central importance in this regard is the insulin gene, whose expression is modulated by all three factors. Interestingly, we have observed synergistic activation of the insulin gene promoter by HNF4 and PDX1, which have adjacent binding sites in this promoter, thus adding an additional level of complexity to the transcriptional control network. The current results indicating that HNF4 activates the insulin gene through both direct and indirect actions will permit a more detailed understanding of the MODY phenotype.     ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
