   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs) are orphan receptors that belong to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor (TR) superfamily and can repress the transcriptional activity of several target genes; however, the precise mechanism of this repression is unknown. Transfection of a Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to the putative ligand-binding domain of COUP-TFI (Gal4-COUP-TFI) significantly represses the basal transcriptional activity of a reporter gene containing Gal4-binding sites. Cotransfection of COUP-TFI can relieve the Gal4-COUP-TFI repression in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, COUP-TFI35, which lacks the repressor domain (the C-terminal 35 amino acids), fails to relieve this repression. This finding suggests that the repressor domain of COUP-TFI may squelch a limiting amount of corepressor in HeLa cells. In addition, increasing concentrations of TRss also can relieve the COUP-TFI repression in a hormone-sensitive manner. Similarly, overexpression of increasing concentration of COUP-TFI, but not COUP-TFI35, can squelch the silencing activity of the unliganded TRss. Collectively, these results indicate that COUP-TFI and TRss share a common corepressor(s) for their silencing activity. To determine which corepressor is involved in the COUP-TF-silencing activity, we used a yeast two-hybrid and in vitro GST pull-down assays to demonstrate that COUP-TFI can interact with the fragment of N-CoR (nuclear receptor-corepressor) encoding amino acids 921-2453 and the fragments of SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoic acid receptor and TR) encoding amino acids 29 to 564 and 565-1289, respectively. Interestingly, the fragment of SMRT encoding amino acids 1192 to 1495, which strongly interacts with TRss, interacts very weakly with COUP-TFI. Furthermore, overexpression of N-CoR or SMRT potentiates the silencing activity of COUP-TFI and can relieve the COUP-TFI-mediated squelching of Gal4-COUP-TFI activity. Therefore, our studies indicate that N-CoR and SMRT act as corepressors for the COUP-TFI silencing activity.
   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Steroid/thyroid hormone receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate diverse aspects of growth, development, and homeostasis by binding as monomer, homodimers, or heterodimers to their cognate DNA response elements to modulate transcription of target genes (1, 2, 3). Thyroid hormone (TR) and retinoic acid receptors (RAR) bind to cognate DNA response elements and repress basal promoter activity in the absence of ligand (3, 4, 5). The region important for repression may represent a unique interaction surface for contacting a particular target within the basal transcriptional machinery. Highly charged regions are a common feature of other repression motifs. These charged regions consist of basic residues (6) or acidic residues (7, 8). In contrast to these well-defined small repression motifs, the homologous repression regions of TR and RAR are large and appear to include multiple regions within the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) and hinge regions. Many interacting proteins have been identified and proposed to be important for mediating the repressor function. The identified molecular targets of repressors can be categorized into three groups (9): basal transcription factors, activators, and coregulators, such as coactivators and corepressors.
Silencing activity of unliganded TR and RAR requires limiting factors termed corepressors (5). Recently, two corepressors that bind to unliganded TR and RAR have been cloned using a yeast two-hybrid screen: N-CoR (nuclear receptor-corepressor) (10, 11) and SMRT (silencing mediator for RAR and TR) (12, 13, 14, 15). Binding of these corepressors is necessary for unliganded receptors to silence the activity of target promoters. Prevailing evidence suggests that binding of hormone changes the conformation of the receptors, which results in the release of the corepressor and recruitment of coactivators, thereby abolishing their silencing activity. These two corepressors exhibit significant sequence homologies in their receptor-interacting domains, suggesting the existence of a corepressor gene family. COUP-TFs (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors) belong to the steroid receptor superfamily and are classified as orphan receptors because their ligand has yet to be defined. There are two COUP-TF genes in mammals, COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII. COUP-TFs have been implicated in neurogenesis, organogenesis, and cell fate determination (16, 17, 18, 19). COUP-TFs can form stable homodimers and bind to a variety of hormone response elements recognized by other members of the steroid receptor superfamily, such as RAR, retinoid X receptor (RXR), TR, vitamin D receptor (VDR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4. COUP-TFs can thereby inhibit transcriptional activities of these receptors on both consensus and natural response elements (17, 20). Four mechanisms have been proposed to address COUP-TF s ability to inhibit the transactivation function of other members of the steroid receptor superfamily. First, COUP-TFs repress the hormone-dependent transactivation of target genes by VDR, TR, and RAR through direct competition for occupancy of their response elements (21, 22, 23). Second, COUP-TFs heterodimerize with RXR to reduce the available concentration of RXR for heterodimerization with TR, VDR, RAR, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and thus indirectly interfere with these receptors to transactivate their target genes (21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27). Third, COUP-TFs can tether to DNA via LBD-LBD interactions with TR, RAR, and RXR to transrepress their activities (27). Finally, COUP-TFs have been shown to repress basal and activator-dependent transcriptional activities of various promoters when their binding site is placed upstream or downstream of these promoters (27). The silencing domain in COUP-TFs was localized to the C terminus of the putative LBD, which can be transferred to the heterologous Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD). Activators that can be repressed by COUP-TFs include acidic (Gal4-RII), glutamine-rich (Gal4-ftzQ), proline-rich (Gal4-CTF1P), and Ser/Thr-rich (Gal4-ZenST) transactivators (27). Because COUP-TF can repress such a diverse group of transactivators, it is unlikely that COUP-TF s repression is through direct quenching of these transactivators or by interfering with their respective targets. It is rather likely that COUP-TFs interact with a common target, a putative corepressor(s) that mediates their repression.
To substantiate this hypothesis, we address two major questions in this paper; 1) Does COUP-TFI-mediated repression require corepressors? and 2) If it does, does COUP-TFI share corepressors with other receptors, such as TR and RAR? To answer these questions, we first examined whether cofactors are involved in COUP-TFI-mediated repression using either self-squelching or TR/COUP-TF-mediated mutual squelching experiments. Next, we examined whether COUP-TFI can interact with N-CoR or SMRT. Finally, we examined whether N-CoR or SMRT can function as a corepressor in COUP-TFI-mediated repression. Results from these experiments indicate that both N-CoR and SMRT can function as corepressors for COUP-TFI-mediated repression of target genes.
   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   COUP-TFI-Mediated Transcriptional Repression Requires Corepressor(s) The putative LBD of the COUP-TFI (amino acid 184 to 423) has been previously shown to contain a transcriptional repression domain. To repress transcription, it is generally believed that the COUP-TFI interacts with the basal transcriptional machinery either directly or indirectly through other cofactor molecules. To determine whether a cofactor(s) is required for this repressor activity, we carried out transfection experiments. Transfection of a Gal4 DBD fused to the COUP-TFI (amino acid 184 to 423) cDNA, designated as Gal4-COUP-TFI, significantly repressed basal promoter activity of the 17 mer x 4-thymidine kinase promoter-linked luciferase reporter DNA as shown previously (Fig. 1). This repression activity can be reversed by the exogenously expressed LBD of COUP-TFI (184 to 423), which does not bind to the reporter construct, in a dose-dependent manner. The observed release of repression cannot be attributed to the nonspecific effect of overexpression of COUP-TFI on Gal DNA-binding activity because overexpression of COUP-TFI had little effect on the basal promoter activity when cotransfected with the Gal4 DBD alone (27). In contrast, COUP-TFI mutant, COUP-TFI35 (amino acid 184 to 388), which does not contain a repressor domain, cannot reverse Gal4-COUP-TFI-mediated repression. Overexpression of COUP-TFI or COUP-TFI35 does not affect the basal promoter activity of Gal4 (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that a limiting factor, termed corepressor(s), is required for the activity of COUP-TFI-mediated repression. These results also suggest that the C-terminal 35 amino acids are required for interaction with the putative corepressor(s).

HeLa cells were transfected with 0.1  microg Gal4-COUP-TFI cDNA, 0.3  microg 17 mer x 4-tk-luciferase reporter DNA, and increasing amounts of COUP-TFI or COUP-TFI35 expression plasmid (0.2, 0.4, and 1.0  microg). Gal4 cDNA (0.1  microg) was transfected instead of Gal4-COUP-TFI in lane 1.
  COUP-TFI Shares Common Corepressor(s) with TRss To elucidate whether COUP-TFI shares common corepressors with TRss, squelching experiments were performed. Overexpression of TRss in the absence of T3 can reverse the basal repression activity of Gal4-COUP-TFI by squelching endogenous corepressors in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the liganded TRss cannot squelch the repression (lines 3 to 8, Fig. 2). Similarly, overexpression of TR mutant, TR168 to 456(V174A/D177A), which loses its silencing activity but retains hormone-dependent transactivation (28), cannot relieve the basal repression activity of Gal4-COUP-TFI (lines 9 to 11, Fig. 2). These findings strongly suggest that TRss- and COUP-TFI-mediated repression share the same corepressor(s).

HeLa cells were transfected with 0.1  microg Gal4-COUP-TFI cDNA, 0.3  microg 17 mer x 4-tk-luciferase reporter DNA, and increasing amounts of TRss or TR168 to 456 (V174A/D177A) expression plasmids (0.2, 0.5, and 1.0  microg). Cells were treated with 10-7 M T3 for 24 h in lanes 6 to 8. Gal4 cDNA (0.1  microg) was transfected instead of Gal4-COUP-TFI in lane 1.
  In a reverse experiment, we examined whether COUP-TFI can squelch the repression activity of Gal4-TRss. As shown in Fig. 3, transfection of Gal4-TRss into HeLa cells significantly repressed the basal promoter activity of the reporter construct. Overexpression of COUP-TFI can reverse this repression in a dose-dependent manner. As expected, we observe no reversal of TRss-mediated repression by overexpression of the repression-defective COUP-TFI mutant, COUP-TFI35. These results further suggest that common corepressors are shared by COUP-TFI and TRss for their repression activity.

HeLa cells were transfected with 0.1  microg Gal4-TRss cDNA, 0.3  microg 17 mer x 4-tk-luciferase reporter DNA, and increasing amounts of COUP-TFI or COUP-TFI35 (0.2, 0.4, and 1.0  microg). Gal4 cDNA (0.1  microg) was transfected instead of Gal4-COUP-TFI in lane 1.
  Both N-CoR and SMRT Interact with COUP-TFI Using the LBD of TRss as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, the TR-interacting protein, SMRT, has been cloned (12, 14, 15). Similarly, Horlein et al. (10) have cloned another TR-interacting protein, N-CoR, which has sequence similarity to SMRT. Both N-CoR and SMRT have been identified as corepressors for TR and RAR. We asked whether these two corepressors can function as corepressors for COUP-TFI. First, we examined whether COUP-TFI can interact specifically with these authentic corepressors. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we confirmed that these corepressors can interact with TRss in a hormone-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, a fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 921-2453 and fragments of SMRT encoding amino acids 565-1495 and 1192 to 1495 can interact with TRss in a hormone-dependent manner as previously described (10, 12, 14). It should be pointed out that, to our surprise, a larger fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190-2453, which contains a fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 921-2453, cannot interact with TRss in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Although the reason for this discrepancy is not clear at present, it is possible that the N-terminal repression domain of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190 to 920 is very potent and overrides the activation function of Gal4 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. This notion is further supported by our observation that a fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190-2453 can interact with TRss in vitro (data not shown).

A, Various fragments of SMRT and N-CoR constructs. The fragments of SMRT encoding amino acids 29 to 564, 565-1289, 565-1495, and 1192 to 1495 were constructed. The fragment of SMRT encoding amino acids 1192 to 1495 was obtained by yeast two-hybrid screen as a bait of the LBD of TRss. The fragments of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190-2453 and 921-2453 were constructed. In N-CoR, there are two repression domains (RD1 and RD2) as shown in the N-terminal region. The acidic-basic motif (AB) and the serine-glycine-rich domain (SG) in the central region are indicated. Glutamine-rich regions (Q) and predicted amphipathic -helix (H) regions are also indicated. The most N-terminal region of SMRT (amino acids 1 to 483) contains four putative repeated motifs, and it has 44% identity with N-CoR. A series of deletion mutants of N-CoR or SMRT (illustrated in Fig. 4A) were created and tested for interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system with TRss (B) or COUP-TFI (C). For the experiments presented here, Gal4 DBD-TR168 to 456 or Gal4 DBD-COUP-TFI constructs were coexpressed with Gal4 AD-N-CoR or SMRT deletion mutants. Each two-hybrid pair was transformed into the yeast y190, the transformants were propagated, and the ss-galactosidase activity was determined. The effects of T3 on the TR/N-CoR or SMRT interaction in the presence of 1  microM T3 in the culture medium was also tested. Cotransformation of Gal4 DBD-COUP-TFI and Gal4 AD-TFIIB was used as a positive control. At least two independent yeast transformants were analyzed, and the results were determined as mean  plus or minus  SEM.
  Next, we examined the interaction between COUP-TFI and N-CoR or SMRT. We first demonstrated that no interaction between Gal4 DBD-COUP-TFI (amino acids 184 to 423) fusion and Gal4 activation domain (AD) (empty vector) was shown as a negative control (lane 1 in Fig. 4C). In contrast, as a positive control, we showed a strong interaction between Gal4 DBD-COUP-TFI and Gal4 AD-TFIIB (lane 7 in Fig. 4C). We then examined the interaction of various deletion fragments of N-CoR or SMRT with COUP-TFI (Fig. 4C). In a yeast two-hybrid assay system, the interaction of COUP-TFI with N-CoR or SMRT was detected when COUP-TFI was bound to DNA response element. In the absence of DNA response element, no interaction was observed (data not shown). A fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 921-2453 strongly interacts with COUP-TFI; however, a fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190-2453 does not interact with COUP-TFI in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Similar to the TRss interaction study (Fig. 4B), the repression domains of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190 to 920 may interfere with the Gal4 activation domain function in a yeast two-hybrid assay; thus, a fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190-2453 is not able to activate ss-galactosidase activity of the reporter. However, both N-CoR fragments encoding amino acids 190-2453 and 921-2453 were found to interact with COUP-TFI in an in vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay because these in vitro interactions are presumably not influenced by the repressor function of N-CoR. Thus, a fragment of COUP-TFI encoding amino acids 56 to 423 can interact specifically with N-CoR in yeast and in vitro. On the other hand, fragments of SMRT encoding amino acids 29 to 564 and 565-1495 strongly interact with COUP-TFI (Fig. 4C). In contrast, a fragment of SMRT encoding amino acids 1192 to 1495, which interacts well with TR, interacts only weakly with COUP-TFI in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that the COUP-TFI-interacting domain of SMRT is located mainly at amino acids 29 to 564 and 565-1191. These interaction data in yeast are further supported by the in vitro protein-protein interactions as shown in Fig. 5B. Both fragments of SMRT encoding amino acids 29 to 564 and 565-1289 are able to interact with GST-COUP-TFI, whereas a fragment of SMRT encoding amino acids 1192 to 1495 fails to interact with GST-COUP-TFI.

Radiolabeled N-CoR, SMRT, or TFIIB were tested for their abilities to bind to an immobilized GST-COUP-TFI fusion protein or to GST control protein. GST or GST-COUP-TFI fusion protein were expressed in yeast and purified by adsorption to a glutathione-Sepharose beads. A, The fragments of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190-2453 and 921-2453 and TFIIB, translated in vitro, were incubated with the GST control protein (lanes 2, 5, and 8) or GST-COUP-TFI (lanes 3, 6, and 9) for 30 to 60 min at 4 C with rocking. The GST or GST-COUP-TFI Sepharose beads were then extensively washed, and radiolabeled corepressor proteins (lanes 3 and 6) or TFIIB (lane 9) bound to the matrix were eluted with SDS loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

The molecular weight of each protein is indicated.
  N-CoR and SMRT Potentiate the Basal Repression by Gal4-COUP-TFI From the above studies, we have shown that N-CoR and SMRT can interact with COUP-TFI specifically. We then asked whether these two corepressors are required to mediate COUP-TFI repression activity in mammalian cells. As shown in Fig. 6, neither N-CoR nor SMRT have a significant effect on transcription activity of the reporter construct in the absence of cotransfected Gal4-COUP-TFI. However, both N-CoR and SMRT can potentiate the repressor function of Gal4-COUP-TFI in a dose-dependent manner in HeLa cells. These data suggest that both N-CoR and SMRT can function as corepressors of COUP-TFI in HeLa cells. Thus, it is likely that they are the endogenous corepressors of COUP-TFI in HeLa cells.

HeLa cells were transfected with 0.1  microg Gal4 or Gal4-COUP-TFI cDNA, 0.3  microg 17 mer x 4-tk-luciferase reporter DNA, and increasing amounts of N-CoR or SMRT expression plasmid (0.5 and 1.0  microg).
  N-CoR and SMRT Can Reverse the Squelching of COUP-TFI-Mediated Repression As shown earlier (Fig. 1), overexpression of COUP-TFI can squelch the repressor activity of Gal4-COUP-TFI. If N-CoR and SMRT are the limiting factors required for COUP-TFI-mediated repression, we expect that overexpression of N-CoR or SMRT should reverse this squelching activity. As shown in Fig. 7, overexpression of N-CoR or SMRT was able to relieve the squelching effects of COUP-TFI on Gal4-COUP-TFI repression function in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, overexpression of N-CoR or SMRT had no significant effect on transcription activity of the reporter construct in the absence of cotransfected Gal4-COUP-TFI (data not shown). Therefore, both N-CoR and SMRT can substitute for the endogenous corepressor(s) in mediating COUP-TFI s repressor function.

     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   We have shown that both N-CoR and SMRT can function as corepressors for COUP-TFI-mediated gene silencing. Since COUP-TFI has been shown to interact with TFIIB in vitro (29, 30), it is proposed that COUP-TFI can interact with TFIIB in a nonproductive manner to interfere with the basal transcription. However, many coactivators and corepressors have been identified as positive and negative cofactors in the transcriptional control of target genes by members of the steroid/TR superfamily (15, 31). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that some of the cofactors may also be involved in gene-silencing mechanisms of orphan receptors, such as COUP-TFI. Initial evidence for mediators of nuclear receptor transactivation came from the finding that transiently transfecting increasing amounts of an ER-expressing plasmid into cultured cells results in a bell-shaped curve of transcriptional activation and was attributed to the squelching of a coactivator(s) by the excessive amounts of estrogen receptor (32). By analogy with that, we demonstrated that a putative corepressor(s) may be involved in COUP-TFI-mediated basal repression because overexpression of COUP-TFI, but not COUP-TFI35 (which has lost its repression domain), can squelch the repression activity of Gal4-COUP-TFI. Previously, we showed that a 15-amino-acid deletion from the C terminus (Gal4-COUP-TF15) had little effect on Gal4-COUP-TF activity, whereas a 25-amino-acid (Gal4-COUP-TF25) or a 35-amino-acid (Gal4-COUP-TF35) deletion largely impaired its active repression function (27). Therefore, these data suggested that the C-terminal border of the major active repression function of COUP-TF is located within amino acids 408 and 398, and it is this region that may interact with the corepressor(s). In addition, the repressor domain of COUP-TFI may directly target the basal transcriptional machinery.
To examine whether a corepressor(s) can be shared between TRss and COUP-TFI, squelching experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 2, unliganded but not liganded TRss can squelch the basal repression of Gal4-COUP-TFI. The evidence that the TR mutant, TR168 to 456 (V174A/D177A) (28), which does not interact with the putative corepressors, cannot squelch the basal repression of Gal4-COUP-TFI further supports the notion that common corepressors may be involved in basal repression between TRss and COUP-TFI. Furthermore, overexpression of COUP-TFI, but not COUP-TFI35, can squelch the basal repression activity of Gal4-TRss, also suggesting that common corepressors can function for both COUP-TFI and TRss. Theoretically, the target of transcriptional interference may be either a basal transcription factor(s) or a corepressor(s). Transfection of COUP-TFI or TRss did not change the basal transcription of a PRE-tk-luciferase reporter lacking a proper response element (data not shown), suggesting that squelchers are unlikely to interfere directly with the function of any basal transcriptional machinery. Therefore, the target(s) of interference between COUP-TF and TRss is likely to be one or more transcriptional corepressor protein(s).
Because COUP-TFI can form homodimers by itself or form heterodimers with TRss (27), it is possible that the squelchers can form non-DNA-binding heterodimers with the repressors used in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 (Gal4-COUP-TFI/COUP-TFI for Fig. 1, Gal4-COUP-TFI/TRss for Fig. 2, and Gal4-TRss/COUP-TFI for Fig. 3). If this is the case, inhibition of repressor activity may be due to inhibition of DNA binding rather than to squelching of a limiting corepressor(s). However, several lines of evidence suggest that this is not the case. First, both COUP-TFI and TRss have the ability to bind specifically to corepressors. Second, a mutant form of TRss (TR168 to 456 (V174A/D177A)), which loses its ability to interact with corepressor but retains its intact dimerization domain, is not able to inhibit the repression activity of Gal4-COUP-TFI. Third, COUP-TF mutant (COUP-TFI35), which loses its ability in silencing, also loses its ability to squelch repressor activity of TRss. Finally and most importantly, we have demonstrated directly that both N-CoR and SMRT can mediate repressor activity of COUP-TFI (Fig. 6) and reverse the self-squelching activity (Fig. 7). Therefore, inhibition of repression activity by squelchers in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 indeed results from squelching of a limiting corepressor(s).
Because squelching experiments showed that COUP-TFI may share a corepressor(s) with TRss, we examined protein-protein interaction between COUP-TFI and N-CoR or SMRT in a yeast two-hybrid assay and in in vitro GST pull-down assays as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The amino acid 921-2453 fragment of N-CoR interacts with COUP-TFI. This result is consistent with what has been observed in TR interaction studies (10, 33). Interaction between COUP-TFI and the amino acid 190-2453 fragment of N-CoR was not detected in a yeast two-hybrid assay, but was detected in an in vitro GST pull-down assay. This discrepancy is likely due to the potent repressor domain of the N-terminal portion of N-CoR, which suppresses the Gal4 activation function, resulting in interference with ss-galactosidase expression. Consistent with this interpretation, Seol et al. (33) also recently demonstrated that the repressor domain of N-CoR strongly interferes with the mammalian two-hybrid assay to study the protein-protein interaction between N-CoR and TR or RAR. On the other hand, the amino acid 29 to 564 and amino acid 565-1289, but not amino acid 1192 to 1495, fragments of SMRT strongly interact with COUP-TF in yeast and in vitro assays. Based on these data, we concluded that there are at least two COUP-TFI-interacting domains within the SMRT molecules. The lack of interaction between COUP-TFI and SMRT (1192 to 1495) is surprising because this region interacts very strongly with TRss. Thus, different repressors may interact differentially with SMRT. Finally, the corepressor-interacting region in COUP-TFI is localized in the extreme C terminus, which is quite different from the region of TR and RAR where hinge and N-terminal portions of LBD are involved in this interaction. Thus, repression function of COUP-TFs may act in a different way from that of TR and RAR (Fig. 8).

  In support of this observation, N-CoR has been shown to function as a corepressor for RevErb A (34). However, a region homologous to the CoR box in the RevErb A, which is necessary for TR and RAR to interact with N-CoR, is not required for RevErb A-mediated repression. N-CoR contains two adjacent but distinct interaction domains, amino acids 2040 to 2239 and 2239 to 2296. The former fragment of N-CoR strongly interacts with both TR and RevErb A; however, the latter fragment of N-CoR interacts weakly and preferentially with RevErb A. Taken together, these data suggest that different nuclear receptors, utilizing different amino acid sequences, repress transcription by interacting with different region of N-CoR or SMRT as shown in Fig. 8.
Recently, an activator for COUP-TFII has been identified using a yeast two-hybrid screen, designated ORCA (orphan receptor coactivator) (35), and this factor is identical to a recently described ligand (p62) of tyrosine kinase- signaling molecule p56lck, suggesting that ORCA may link COUP-TFII and cell surface signal transduction pathways. This integrating role may be similar to what is observed with cAMP response element-binding protein CBP and the related protein p300. CBP plays a role in integrating cAMP second messenger and nuclear hormone receptor signal transduction pathways. Of interest, ORCA/p62 shares a small region of homology with CBP, suggesting a potential similarity in their mechanism of action. However, based on their data, ORCA/p62 does not bind directly to COUP-TFII-binding sites and COUP-TFII/ORCA complex is not detected in gel retardation assays. Therefore, it is possible that ORCA/p62 may function directly or indirectly by phosphorylating COUP-TFII or ORCA/p62 may overcome the function of a specific COUP-TFII-associated corepressor. Because ORCA/p62 can convert COUP-TFII into a transcriptional activator in a ligand-independent manner in mammalian cells, it is possible that COUP-TFI can also be activated by a coactivator(s) in a ligand-independent manner. Our preliminary data showed that overexpression of hSRC-1a (36), which is a general coactivator for members of steroid receptors, cannot relieve the repressor activity of Gal4-COUP-TFI in HeLa cells (data not shown).
In conclusion, we demonstrated that corepressors are involved in the mechanisms of COUP-TFI-mediated gene silencing, and that both N-CoR and SMRT can function as corepressors for COUP-TFI in mammalian cells. Therefore, orphan receptors such as COUP-TFI and RevErb A can function as a repressor in vivo by utilizing corepressors that are common for members of the TR and RAR subfamily.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Mammalian Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, and Luciferase Assays HeLa cells were routinely maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Twenty-four hours before transfection, 2 x 105 cells were plated per well on a six-well dish in DMEM containing 5% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped serum. Cells were transfected with the indicated DNAs using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer s guidelines. Usually, 1.8  microg of total DNA including 0.3  microg of reporter and 0.05 to 1.0  microg of expression vector were used per 35-mm diameter dish. Within 24 h, the DNA/Lipofectin mixture was removed and cells were fed with DMEM containing 5% stripped serum and the indicated hormones; cells were harvested 24 h later. Cells extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Data are presented as an average of three separate experiments  plus or minus  SEM. All transfections were performed at least three times in triplicate.
Cloning of SMRT by Yeast Two-Hybrid System Yeast strains used are as follows. y190: MATa, leu2 to 3, 112, ura3 to 52, trp1 to 901, his2-D200, ade2 to 101, gal4gal180URA3 GAL-lacZ, LYS GAL-HIS3, cyhr. y187: MAT, gal4, gal80, his3, trp1 to 901, ade2 to 101, ura3 to 52, leu2 to 3, -112, URA3 GAL-lacZ met-. BJ2168: MATa, prc1 to 407, Prb1 to 1122, pep4 to 3, leu2, trp1, ura 3 to 52. Yeast-selective media and plates were prepared according to Guthrie and Fink (37). The yeast strain y190 containing pAS1cyh2-TR168 to 456 was transformed with a human brain cDNA library in pGAD10 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and plated on synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (containing 25 mM 3-aminotriazole) as described by Durfee et al. (38). His+ colonies exhibiting ss-galactosidase activity using the filter lift assay were further characterized. ss-Galactosidase activity was determined using chlorophenol red ss-D galactopyranoside as described (38). To recover the library plasmids, total DNA from yeast was isolated and used to transform Escherichia coli (HB101) which lacks leu2 gene. Transformants were identified on minimal medium lacking leucine and containing ampicillin. To ensure that the correct cDNAs were identified, library plasmids isolated were retransformed into y190 containing pAS1cyh2-TR168 to 456, and ss-galactosidase activity was determined. The specificity of the interaction of cor 10.1 (SMRT 1192 to 1495), one of the 12 positive clones, with TR was determined by mating y190 containing pGAD10-cor 10.1 with the strain y187 containing either pAS1-SNF, pAS1-cdk2, pAS1-p53, or pAS1-lamin. The ss-galactosidase activity of these diploids was examined using the filter lift and chlorophenyl red ss-D galactopyranoside methods. The cor 10.1 clone was identical to recently identified corepressor SMRT. The yeast two-hybrid system was also used to determine protein-protein interaction between COUP-TFI and SMRT or N-CoR.
Protein-Protein Interaction by GST-Pulldown Assay GST-COUP-TFI (pCBGST1-COUP-TFI) fusion protein was expressed and extracted in yeast strain BJ2168 as described previously (39). GST-pulldown assay was performed as described with modifications (4, 39): 30  microl glutathione-Sepharose beads stored in NENT buffer (500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 6 mM MgCl2, and 8% glycerol) were incubated with yeast extracts containing GST-fusion proteins in a 1:1 vol ratio together with NENT buffer for 30 to 60 min at 4 C. Preparation of yeast extracts containing GST-fusion protein was described previously (39). Subsequently, the supernatant was removed and the beads were washed twice with 1 ml NENT buffer and twice with 1 ml transcription washing buffer (60 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.05% NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 6 mM MgCl2, and 8% glycerol). In vitro-translated and -radiolabeled proteins were obtained using TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems (Promega). Five to 10  microl crude lysate were incubated with the beads in 200  microl transcription washing buffer for 2 h at 4 C. Finally, the beads were washed five times with 1 ml NENT buffer and proteins were solubilized in SDS loading buffer and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. The input lane contains 10% of the labeled protein used for binding.
