The [epsis]4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), one of the main allele of APOE polymorphism, is a major risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease. However, several data suggest that genetic factors, within the APOE locus, may also modulate the risk associated with this polymorphism. We look for new mutations in the APOE promoter, susceptible to modify the risk associated with the APOE [epsis]4 allele. We characterised a G[rarr]T mutation at -186 bp of the APOE gene TATA box, named Th1/E47cs. This new polymorphism is located in a consensus sequence of a potential transcriptional (Th1/E47) factor binding site. We studied the impact of this new polymorphism with those of other markers of the APOE locus in a large case-control study and observed that Th1/E47cs modulated the influence of the APOE [epsis]4 allele on the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
INTRODUCTION
The apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), a key player of the lipid transport, exists as three main alleles in the general population: [epsis]2, [epsis]3 and [epsis]4. These polymorphisms correspond to mutations in the coding sequence of the APOE gene resulting in amino acid substitutions (Arg and Cys) at positions 112 and 158 of the protein. This gene is located on chromosome 19 at position q13.2. The implication of chromosome 19 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) was suspected on at least three occasions (1-3) before the report of an association between late-onset AD and the APOE [epsis]4 allele (4). Numerous studies confirmed this finding and extended this observation to early-onset AD (5-7). It is now established that carrying an [epsis]4 allele increases the risk of AD in an allele dose dependent manner and shifts the age of onset of the disease to earlier ages (8). Conversely, bearing an [epsis]2 allele confers a protection against the disease (5,9,10). Thus, the APOE genotype appears as an important biological marker for AD susceptibility accounting for between 45 and 60% of AD genetic variability.
Several biological mechanisms have been proposed to underlie this association. The E4 isoform would facilitate or not limit the amyloid substance deposition (11,12). This isoform may not protect against oxidative stress, in contrast to the E2 isoform (13). It has also been suggested that the E2 and E3 isoforms would prevent the aggregation of Tau protein by limiting abnormal phosphorylation leading to the constitution of paired helical filament, while the E4 isoform would not (14).
However, none of these hypotheses fully explained why as many as 50% of homozygous subjects who survive until 80 years, do not develop AD. This observation suggests that other factors should influence the APOE associated risk. Indeed, other genetic and environmental factors such as family history, gender, smoking, oestrogen, cholesterol level or other polymorphisms located in APOE receptor genes for instance (15-20), may modify the APOE associated risk. However, recent reports suggest that additional genetic factors within the APOE locus itself may also modulate this risk. Firstly, a genetic study of markers in the vicinity of the APOE locus demonstrated that a combination of three polymorphisms increases the estimation of the APOE associated risk of AD compared with APOE polymorphism alone (5). Secondly, a distortion of the allelic expression of the APOE gene is observed in the brain of affected patients; indeed, the relative expression of the [epsis]4 allele is increased 1.5-fold in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 bearer AD patients, compared with [epsis]3/[epsis]4 bearer controls (21).
Together, these data suggest the potential existence of one or more additional genetic susceptibility factors in the APOE sequence, modifying the risk associated with the APOE [epsis]4 allele in the occurrence of AD. Detailed sequence analyses and a study of the APOE locus are needed to characterise such additional genetic factors. For instance, Mui et al. reported a polymorphism (1E1) in the first intron of the APOE gene in strong linkage disequilibrium with the APOE [epsis]4 allele (22).
To go further in this hunt for other polymorphism(s), we sequenced the 375 bp upstream of the APOE TATA box and detected a new polymorphism whose impact on AD risk, together with the APOE [epsis]4 allele was investigated in a large case-control study. RESULTS
Sequencing the 375 bp upstream to the TATA box of APOE, we found a (G[rarr]T) polymorphism at position -186 of the TATA box, located in a potential consensus binding sequence of the Th1/E47 heterodimer transcriptional factor (Fig. 1) (23). Because of this location, we named it Th1/E47cs polymorphism (for Th1/E47 consensus sequence polymorphism).

(b) Comparison of the APOE promoter sequence including the Th1/E47cs polymorphism and the consensus sequence of the predicted binding site of the Th1/E47cs heterodimer (21). The predicted positions of Th1 and E47 binding site are indicated at the top and are based on the known half-site specificity of E47 and that predicted for Th1. The G[rarr]T mutation (boxed) is located in the half-site specificity of E47. Nucleotide positions are numbered relative to the canonical E-box sequence.
We studied the association of the Th1/E47cs polymorphism with AD in a large case-control study (310 cases, age = 74.6  plus or minus  9.3 years; 293 controls, age = 73.5  plus or minus  10.9 years). We analysed the Th1/E47cs polymorphism together with the APOE, the 1E1 and the D19S178 repeat polymorphisms. The distributions of these polymorphisms are presented in Table 1. No deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed for any of these polymorphisms. As expected, the [epsis]4 allele was strongly associated with AD (OR = 4.67, 95% IC [3.28-6.67]), while the [epsis]2 allele exhibited a protective effect (OR = 0.27, 95% CI [0.14-0.52]). In the control population, the Th1/E47cs G allele was the common one (0.531), in contrast to the AD population (0.468). The allelic and genotypic distributions were significantly different in the AD cases when compared with the control cases (P = 0.03 and P = 0.007, respectively). The Th1/E47cs T allele was associated with an increased risk of developing AD (OR = 1.29, CI 95% [1.02-1.63]) and the OR was 1.79 (CI 95% [1.21-2.65], P = 0.002) for individuals bearing at least one T allele. For the 1E1 polymorphism, the allelic and genotypic distributions, similar to the ones reported by Mui et al. (20), were significantly different between the AD and control populations (P = 0.002 and P = 0.0005, respectively). The 1E1 C allele was associated with a decreased risk of developing AD (OR = 0.56, CI 95% [0.40-0.78], P = 0.0003). No difference in the allelic or genotypic distributions of the D19S178 repeat alleles was observed (P = 0.90 and P = 0.95, respectively).
We calculated pairwise linkage disequilibriums between D19S178, Th1/E47cs, 1E1 and APOE polymorphisms (Table 2). As expected significant linkage disequilibriums existed between Th1/E47cs, 1E1 and APOE polymorphisms. D19S178 was independent of the other polymorphisms, although a weak linkage disequilibrium existed with APOE in the control population.
We estimated the haplotypes generated by these four polymorphisms using the myriad haplotype algorithm. Among the 16 theoretical haplotypes, 15 were observed (Table 3a). All haplotypes were observed in AD cases, while three (nos 2, 5 and 7) were not represented in controls. The difference in the distribution of the estimated haplotype frequencies between cases and controls was tested with a likelihood ratio test with 13 degrees of freedom ([chi]2 = 696). To take into account the strong association of the APOE [epsis]4 allele with AD, we compared the estimated haplotype distributions in the [epsis]3/[epsis]3 and in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 AD and control subgroups (Table 3b and c). In each subgroup ([epsis]3/[epsis]3 and [epsis]3/[epsis]4 genotype bearers, respectively), the estimated haplotype distributions were significantly different between AD and control subjects (likelihood test [chi]2 = 374, df = 8 and [chi]2 = 160, df = 6, respectively), suggesting potential independent effect of the other polymorphisms.

In the whole population (AD = 261, Controls = 253), we estimated the OR for developing AD for subjects with at least one allele in the genotype for each polymorphism separately (Table 4). As expected a significant effect was observed for all of them except for D19S178. To determine if the effect of the Th1/E47cs and 1E1 polymorphisms were not due to the linkage disequilibrium existing with the APOE polymorphism, we performed a multivariate logistic regression taking into account age, gender, and the four polymorphisms in the same model. The effects of Th1/E47cs and 1E1 polymorphisms persisted and even increased, reinforcing the hypothesis of several genetic susceptibility factors within the APOE locus.

If we assume that the level of expression of the APOE alleles is increased due to cis mutations in the promoter region, this hypothesis has three major implications: (i) the promoter mutation may modulate the expression of the APOE alleles leading to an increased deleterious risk for [epsis]4 and to an increased protective effect for [epsis]2; (ii) given that what determines the risk is the importance of the relative level of expression of both alleles of the APOE, this promoter mutation will have a differential effect in APOE heterozygous and homozygous genotypes; (iii) the effect of the cis mutation in heterozygous individuals will depend on the phase of this polymorphism with the APOE [epsis] alleles (i.e., the haplotype). In heterozygous Th1/E47cs and APOE [epsis]4 genotype bearers, the [epsis]4 allele may be combined either with the Th1/E47cs T or G allele. One of these combinations may increase the relative expression level of the [epsis]4 allele and decrease the relative expression level of the [epsis]3 allele, the other combination having the inverse influence. Thus, in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 genotype bearers, the risk of developing AD will be different between the Th1/E47cs heterozygous and homozygous individuals. To test these assumptions, we studied the gender and age adjusted OR for developing AD for Th1/E47cs heterozygous genotype bearers compared with homozygous Th1/E47cs individuals. The Th1/E47cs heterozygous genotype was only associated with an increased risk of developing AD in the heterozygous APOE individuals (OR = 2.40, CI 95% [1.40-4.12], P = 0.001) and not in the homozygous APOE individuals (OR = 1.02, CI 95% [0.67-1.57], P = 0.91). In particular, in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 sub-population (Table 5), the risk of developing AD for the heterozygous Th1/E47cs individuals was increased compared with the homozygous Th1/E47cs individuals (OR = 1.90, CI 95% [0.97-3.70], P = 0.06, AD = 107 and Controls = 54). This increased risk became significant in a larger [epsis]3/[epsis]4 population (OR = 2.07, 95% CI [1.21-3.54], P = 0.008, AD = 152 and Controls = 91). However the risk obtained for the heterozygous 1E1 individuals was not significant compared to the homozygous 1E1 individuals (OR = 0.62, 95% CI [0.36; 1.05], P = 0.07). To assess the contribution of each polymorphism on the risk of developing AD in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 population, we performed a multiple logistic regression. We detected an increased risk tendency for developing AD only in the heterozygous Th1/E47cs (OR = 1.89 CI 95% [1.07-3.35], P = 0.027) but not in the heterozygous 1E1 bearers (OR = 0.75, 95% CI [0.43-1.33], P = 0.33). Altogether, these data suggest that the Th1/E47cs polymorphism could modify the relative level of expression of the APOE alleles.

In order to approach the influence of the phase of the Th1/E47cs and APOE polymorphisms on the AD risk, we estimated the frequencies of the haplotypes with the Th1/E47cs T or G allele associated with the [epsis]4 allele in the AD or controls [epsis]3/[epsis]4 bearer populations (as described in Materials and Methods). For the APOE [epsis]3/[epsis]4 and Th1/E47cs G/T bearers, 57.6% of the controls were estimated to have the [epsis]4 and T alleles on the same chromosome, while this proportion was 69.7% in the case group, leading to an estimated OR of 1.7. DISCUSSION
Recently, the hypothesis of other(s) mutation(s) nearby the APOE gene was fuelled by new physiological data: a difference in the allelic expression of the APOE gene was observed (19), suggesting that non-coding polymorphism(s) in the regulatory regions of the APOE gene could modify the risk of developing AD. Looking for such new polymorphisms, we found a (G[rarr]T) polymorphism located at position +7 of a degenerative E-box consensus (Fig. 1) (23), that influenced the effect of APOE polymorphisms on AD in the expected way.
The Th1/E47cs and 1E1 polymorphisms were associated with AD when studied separately. Although a strong linkage disequilibrium existed between the [epsis]4, Th1/E47cs T and 1E1 G alleles, the effect of each of these polymorphisms persisted when introduced in the same logistic regression model. This observation suggested that the risk associated with the APOE [epsis] alleles may be modulated according to their combination with other polymorphisms. To have at least one Th1/E47cs T or 1E1 C allele significantly modified the risk of developing AD in the whole population. Furthermore, the impact of the [epsis]4 allele seemed decreased, suggesting that part of its effect may be attributed to the promoter polymorphisms. Another argument was brought forward when estimating the risk associated with the phase. The estimated risk of developing the disease for the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 genotype bearers was not similar according to the combination of the Th1/E47cs and APOE [epsis] alleles on the same chromosome. These results were in accordance with our previous data which suggest that the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 individuals will preferentially develop AD, because they expressed the [epsis]4 allele at a greater level. Thus, a cis mutation in the APOE promoter, may favour the relative expression level of the [epsis]4 allele, and potentially the deleterious action of the E4 isoform.
The Th1/E47cs polymorphism was characterised into a binding site of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, E47. This factor E47 belongs to the class A proteins which are ubiquitously expressed and form combinatorial interactions with the class B proteins to control tissue-specific gene expression (24). In particular, E47 is expressed in brain, associated with multiple class B protein and is implicated in the development and maintenance of the mammalian nervous system (25-27). Little is known about the Th1 factor. It was identified in a screen of a mouse embryo cDNA library. Its homologous protein in Drosophila is a partner for the Drosophila class A protein daughterless, expression of which is essential for neurogenesis (28).
Nevertheless it is essential to determine, in vitro and in vivo, the functionality of this transcriptional factor sequence binding. Furthermore, the effect of this new polymorphism susceptible to modulate the risk associated to the APOE alleles must be confirmed by other epidemiological studies and a more profound analysis will have to be performed to determine the haplotypes. In conclusion, The Th1/E47cs polymorphism, located within a putative regulatory element of the APOE promoter could contribute to the APOE expression level but other polymorphisms in the regulatory sequences of this gene may exist and a more extended screening of these regulatory regions needs to be developed. The regulation of the APOE gene could be very important for deciphering the mechanisms of the involvement of the APOE alleles, in particular to better define subjects at higher risk of developing AD. POPULATION AND METHODS Populations
The AD and control samples were Caucasian originating from France. Sixteen cases were from other European countries. These different ethnic origins did not influence genotype distributions. Diagnoses of probable AD were established according to the DSM-III-R and NINCS-ADRDA criteria (n = 293; age = 74.6  plus or minus  9.3, range 51-98; age of onset = 71.02  plus or minus  8.9, range 49-94; 32.2% of men) (29,30). The Caucasian controls were defined as subjects without DMS-III-R dementia criteria and with integrity of their cognitive functions (n = 310; age = 73.5  plus or minus  10.9, range 59-105; 37.4% of men). Each individual or their relatives signed an informed consent. The number of subjects tested for the different polymorphisms varied as followed: Th1/E47cs study, 279 AD cases and 310 controls; 1E1 study, 293 AD cases and 307 controls; D19S178 study, 272 AD cases and 279 controls.
In order to increase the statistical power of the study for further analysis in heterozygous individuals, we increased the number of individuals with the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 genotype adding new [epsis]3/[epsis]4 subjects from independent populations, up to a total of 152 AD and 91 control cases (73.3  plus or minus  8.5 and 70.3  plus or minus  8.5 years, respectively). Sequencing
Direct sequencing was performed with the 70770 sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Life Science) using [[gamma]-35S]dATP. APOE PCR products were obtained as described in ASO technique (see below). Reactions were run on a 6% acrylamide/8 M urea gel for 1-2 h under 60 W. The gels were then exposed to X-ray film. Genetic analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells. We analysed the Th1/E47cs polymorphism distribution together with two other polymorphisms located in the 19q13.2 chromosomal region flanking the Th1/E47cs polymorphism: the 1E1 polymorphism located 1.15 kb downstream of the Th1/E47cs polymorphism and the anonymous (CA)n repeat DNA marker, D19S178 located ~2.4 cM upstream of the APOE gene. The frequency of the D19S178 repeat alleles were dichotomised in long (167 and over) and short alleles (5).
The four markers were amplified by polymerase chain reaction in a Perkin-Elmer Cetus thermal cycler. The anonymous (CA)n repeat DNA marker, D19S178, the 1E1 polymorphism and the APOE polymorphism were tested as previously described (8,22,31). Because the Th1/E47cs polymorphism did not create or destroy any restriction enzyme sites, two techniques were used to confirm the results. The first one consisted of designing a mismatch primer which contained one mismatched base pair, four bases away from the 3[prime] end of the forward primer and five bases from the polymorphism. When incorporated into a PCR product, this primer produced a Bstn I cut site when a G was present and no cut site when a T was present at the polymorphic site. Briefly, the PCR step was performed during 40 cycles (1 min at 94 degrees C, 1 min 15 s at 54 degrees C and 1 min at 72 degrees C each cycle) with the forward primer 5[prime]-AGAATGGAGGAGGGTGCCTG-3[prime] and the reverse primer 5[prime]-ACTCAAGGATCCCAGACTTG-3[prime] in a total volume of 50  microl containing 1.25 U Taq DNA polymerase, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1% of DMSO, 0.5 mM of MgCl2. Twenty five  microl PCR of product was digested with 1 U Bstn I at 60 degrees C overnight. Digestion products were visualised with a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The Th1/E47cs T allele was characterised by a 49 bp fragment and the G allele by a 31 bp fragment. The second technique consisted of performing an allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridisation. A 375 bp fragment containing the Th1/E47cs polymorphism was amplified using as forward primer: 5[prime]-TACTTTCTTTCTGGGATCCAGG-3[prime] and reverse primer: 5[prime]-ACTCAAGGATCCCAGACTTG-3[prime]. PCR was performed in a total volume of 50  microl during 35 cycles (1 min at 94 degrees C, 1 min at 50 degrees C and 1 min at 72 degrees C each cycle) containing 1.25 U Taq polymerase, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1 mM of MgCl2. The two primers: 5[prime]-GCCCAGTAATCCAGACACCC-3[prime] and 5[prime]-GCCCAGTAATACAGACACCC-3[prime] (for the G and T allele detection, respectively), were 5[prime] end labelled with DIG (Boerhinger Mannheim). Allele-specific hybridisation was obtained after washing for 3 min in a 0.1% SDS and 0.5 x  SSC solution at 61 degrees C and 62 degrees C for the G and T allele hybridisation, respectively. Detection was realised as described by the supplier (Boerhinger Mannheim). Statistical analysis
The SAS software release 6.10 was used (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Univariate analysis was performed using Pearson's [chi]2 test and Fisher exact test when necessary. Since the impact of the [epsis]4 allele is the more pronounced in a range from 60 to 75 years (32,33) and since no significant difference was observed in the distribution of the different markers according to the age (a cut-off of 65 years was tested), we analysed the different polymorphisms without performing distinction between early and late onset. Deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium hypothesis were tested.
Pairwise linkage disequilibriums were measured on collapsed data after estimation of two marker haplotype frequencies by the maximum likelihood procedure for D19S178, Th1/E47cs, 1E1 and APOE (coded as biallelic marker, i.e. allele [epsis]4 versus allele [epsis]2 or [epsis]3) (34). The standardised disequilibrium ([delta]) and the percent of the maximum possible value of disequilibrium were computed as outlined by Thompson et al. (35). Statistical significance for linkage disequilibrium was considered only at P  <  0.001 level since multiple non-independent pairwise comparisons were performed. Extended haplotype frequencies of the four markers were estimated on collapsed data using the myriad haplotype algorithm described by McLean and Morton (36), implemented in a computer program by Cox et al. (37). The comparisons between haplotype frequencies in cases and controls were tested with a likelihood ratio test. The estimated frequencies were compared with those expected on the basis of equilibrium by Pearson's [chi]2 or Fisher exact test as necessary (38). In the multivariate analysis, we coded the genotypes of each subject as dummy variables according to the tested hypotheses (at least one D19S178 short allele: SS+SL versus LL, at least one Th1/E47cs T allele: TT+TG versus GG, at least one 1E1 C allele: CC+GC versus GG and at least one [epsis]4 allele). The effects of these variables on the disease were tested in a multiple logistic regression model adjusted for age and gender. Estimation of the risk of developing AD according to the combination of the Th1/E47cs T and [epsis]4 alleles in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 subgroup
According to the three polymorphisms presented in Table 3c, we defined in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 sub-populations: fi = xi + yi --> 1 where fi is the frequency of the haplotype i (i = 1-8; as defined in Table 3c), xi is the frequency of the [epsis]3 allele found in the haplotype i and yi, the frequency of the [epsis]4 allele found in the haplotype i.
Because our estimation is performed in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 sub-population with equal total proportion of [epsis]3 and [epsis]4 alleles, we have: 2
Given that the 1E1 C allele is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the APOE [epsis] polymorphism (Tables 2 and 3) and is only associated with the [epsis]3 allele, y2 = y4 = y6 = y8 = 0. Thus, the x2, x4, x6 and x8 values are directly obtained from Table 3c with fi = xi. From equation 2, we obtain:              and 3
xi can be directly approached with the haplotype distribution estimated in the [epsis]3/[epsis]3 subgroup.
If xi[prime] is the frequency of the haplotype i in the [epsis]3/[epsis]3 AD or control subgroup, the xi value is estimated as follows: 4 and from equation 4: 5
The yi value can be deduced from equation 1. Thus, we estimated frequency of the four possible phases of the Th1/E47cs G/T and APOE [epsis]3/[epsis]4 heterozygous AD and control sub-populations as follows: [epsis]4 and Th1/E47cs T allele: x1 + x3 [epsis]4 and Th1/E47cs G allele: x2 + x4 [epsis]3 and Th1/E47cs T allele: y1 + y2 + y5 + y6 [epsis]3 and Th1/E47cs G allele: y3 + y4 + y7 + y8 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
