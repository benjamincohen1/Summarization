   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Apolipoprotein-E (apoE) protects against coronary artery disease via hepatic removal of atherogenic remnant lipoproteins, sequestration of cholesterol from vessel walls and local anti-oxidant, anti-platelet and anti-inflammatory actions. ApoE gene transfer may thus ameliorate a hyperlipidaemic profile and have beneficial effects at lesion sites to prevent or regress atherosclerosis, a concept endorsed by adenoviral-mediated hepatic expression studies. Here, using plasmid vectors expressing allelic human apoE2 or apoE3 isoforms, skeletal muscle was evaluated as an effective secretory platform for apoE gene augmentation. Transfected myoblasts and myotubes were found to efficiently secrete recombinant apoE in vitro as spherical 10 to 16 nm lipoprotein particles with pre-ss mobility. Intramuscular plasmid injection in apoE to / to  mice, which develop spontaneous atherosclerotic plaque and xanthoma resulted in expression and secretion of apoE. Human apoE mRNA was detected by RT to PCR in injected muscles and, although concentrations of apoE3, which is rapidly cleared from plasma, were near ELISA detection limits, levels of plasma apoE2 were measurable (17.5  plus or minus  4.3 ng/ml). To assess whether muscle-based expression of apoE2 could inhibit atherogenesis, long-term follow-up studies were conducted. Although hyperlipidaemia was not reduced in treated animals, end-point pathology showed clear retardation of atherosclerotic and xanthomatous lesions. Up to 9 months following a single apoE2 plasmid administration, atherosclerotic lesion coverage in proximal aorta was significantly reduced by 20 to 30% (P  <  0.01), whereas development of gross dorsal xanthoma ( > 5 mm diameter) was effectively reduced to zero. We conclude that expression of apoE from ectopic muscle sites has therapeutic potential to limit progression of atherosclerosis.
   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Human apoE is a 34 kDa polymorphic protein associated with the surface of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins [chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein (VLDLs), or their remnants] and certain high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles (1 to 3). Of the three major isoforms, the rarest variant, apoE2, is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinaemia (4,5) and differs from wild-type apoE3 by an R158C substitution; apoE4 (C112R) produces a dominant hyperlipidaemia (6) and is implicated in re-stenosis (7). ApoE protects against coronary heart disease, in part by mediating the hepatic clearance of atherogenic remnant lipoproteins through two receptors, the LDL-receptor and the LDL-receptor related protein (LRP), with a differential binding activity (E4  >  E3  >  E2) (8).
Low apoE is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease (9,10), whereas severe hyperlipidaemia and atherosclerosis ensues in humans or animal models if apoE is dysfunctional or absent (11,12). Expression of apoE3Leiden or apoE4Arg142Cys in mice, both natural variants, produces a type III hyperlipidaemia phenotype (13,14), whereas apoE-deficient (apoE to / to ) mice are markedly hypercholesterolaemic and develop spontaneous atherosclerosis (15 to 17). In contrast, apoE infusion into hyperlipidaemic rabbits reduces plasma cholesterol and regresses atheromatic lesions (18), whereas apoE transgenic mice over-expressing apoE rapidly clear VLDL/LDL-cholesterol and resist diet-induced or diabetic hyperlipidaemia (19,20). These findings suggest that gene-based strategies to correct dysfunctional apoE will be atheroprotective. Indeed, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of human apoE3 to the liver of apoE to / to  mice reverses their hyperlipidaemia and restricts lesion progression (21,22).
Increasing evidence suggests that skeletal muscle can serve as an efficient secretory platform for circulating proteins (23 to 28). Moreover, the direct injection of plasmid vector into muscle for the permanent systemic delivery of apoE may offer significant advantages over viral-transduction of hepatocytes. Here, we show that cultured mouse C2C12 myoblast and myotube cells transfected with plasmids encoding human apoE2 and apoE3 cDNAs secrete apoE protein and then, in a short-term experiment, demonstrate that injecting the plasmids into the regenerating muscle of apoE to / to  mice results in detectable expression of apoE and secretion into plasma. Finally, in long-term studies of 6 or 9 months, we show that injection of the pCMVapoE2 vector restricts lesion and xanthomata formation, even though there was no improvement in the hyperlipidaemia.
   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Secretion of recombinant human apoE from transfected cultures of C2C12 muscle cells The ability of proliferating mononucleate myoblasts and multinucleate post-mitotic myotubes to synthesize and secrete apoE was evaluated. Mouse C2C12 cells were transfected with pCMVapoE2, pCMVapoE3 or control pCMV( to ) plasmids and culture media harvested over 24 h, in some cases following differentiation and fusion of myoblasts into myotubes. Analysis of media samples by ELISA yielded values of 0.7 to 0.9  microg and 0.35 to 0.5  microg apoE secreted per 106 transfected cells for myoblast and myotube cultures, respectively. SDS to PAGE western blotting revealed that the recombinant apoE migrated as an 34 kDa doublet (Fig. 1A), presumably reflecting differential O-glycosylation on Thr194 as previously reported for human plasma apoE by Weisgraber (3).

After 2 days the derived myotube-containing cultures were changed to serum-free medium which was collected for analyses 24 h later.

(B) Transmission electron micrograph of negatively stained lipoprotein particles released from pCMVapoE2 transfected cultures. Spherical particles of 10 to 16 nm diameter are present (scale bar, 50 nm). A similar result was obtained with media samples from pCVMapoE3 transfected cultures. (C) Non-denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and apoE western blotting of normal human plasma (lane1), media samples from control pCMV( to ) (lane 2), pCMVapoE2 (lane 3) and pCMVapoE3 (lane 4) transfected myotubes. The mobility of apoE-containing lipoproteins with , pre-ss and ss mobility are indicated.
  To characterize the physical nature of lipoprotein particles released from apoE-transfected muscle cells, culture media from apoE2- and apoE3-expressing myotubes were collected and examined; firstly, by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) following negative staining and, secondly, by non-denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with apoE antibodies. Using TEM, no lipoproteins were detected in media from the control, untransfected C2C12 myotubes (data not shown). In contrast, media from myotubes expressing human apoE2 or apoE3 contained abundant small spherical particles, 10 to 16 nm in diameter (Fig. 1B), similar to those secreted by other apoE recombinant cell lines (29) or released naturally from human monocyte-macrophage cells (30). There was no difference in diameter of released lipoprotein particles between pCMVapoE2 or pCMVapoE3 transfected cells (12.3  plus or minus  1.4 and 13.8  plus or minus  1.4 nm, respectively; P  >  0.05). Immunoblotting of normal human plasma showed that the major apoE-containing lipoproteins had the expected and pre-ss mobilities (HDL and VLDL, respectively) (Fig. 1C, lane 1) (31). Some heterogeneity was seen in the particles released from pCMVapoE2- or pCMVapoE3-transfected myotubes but most had pre-ss mobility (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4).
Acute expression of human apoE following intramuscular plasmid injection in apoE to / to  mice To initially evaluate the expression of recombinant apoE from an ectopic site in the skeletal musculature, groups of apoE to / to  mice were subjected to intramuscular injection of pCMVapoE2, pCMVapoE3 and control pCMV( to ) plasmids. Injections were performed in single tibialis anterior muscles, 3 days after BaCl2-induced regeneration to enhance transfection of myofibres (32). At 6 days following plasmid injection blood plasma samples were collected and assayed for apoE by ELISA and for total cholesterol and triglyceride levels (Table 1). As the ELISA used a human apoE-specific monoclonal antibody for capture, no apoE was detected in wild-type C57BL6 mice. However, human apoE was clearly detectable in plasma from pCMVapoE2-injected mice (17.5  plus or minus  4.3  microg/ml) but below the reliable detection limit in pCMVapoE3-treated animals ( < 5  microg/ml). In some mice, total RNA was extracted from excised muscle and examined for apoE mRNA using RT to PCR and a published protocol (33). The expected product (244 bp) was seen in pCMVapoE2- and pCMVapoE3-treated muscle, but was absent from an animal receiving pCMV( to ) (data not shown).
View this table:    Table 1. ApoE, cholesterol and triglyceride levels in plasma from apoE to / to  mice following intramuscular injection of pCMVapoE plasmids   Although apoE to / to  mice exhibited an 6-fold increase in plasma cholesterol compared with controls, injection of pCMVapoE2 or pCMVapoE3 did not result in significant reductions (Table 1). Total plasma triglyceride levels were similar in all four groups (Table 1). To further examine lipoprotein metabolism in control, pCMVapoE2- and pCMVapoE3-injected mice, plasma lipoproteins were separated by isopycnic centrifugation to yield standard VLDL, IDL, LDL and HDL fractions which were then assayed for cholesterol content. The two treatment groups did not show obvious differences in lipoprotein to cholesterol profiles from the control of pCMV( to )-injected apoE to / to  mice, although VLDL was elevated in the pCMVapoE2-injected group (P  <  0.05) (Fig. 2).

Distribution of lipoprotein subclasses in plasma samples from control C57BL/6 mice and apoE to / to  mice injected intramuscularly with 50  microg of pCMV( to ), pCMVapoE2 and pCMVapoE3. BaCl2-treated tibialis anterior muscles were injected with plasmids and blood plasma collected after 6 days. Plasma samples were subjected to sequential isopycnic centrifugation to isolate VLDL, IDL, LDL and HDL compartments and these lipoprotein fractions were assayed for cholesterol content normalized to original plasma volume.
  Inhibition of atherosclerotic plaque and xanthoma formation in apoE to / to  mice following intramuscular pCMVapoE2 injection Due to apoE deficiency and gross hyperlipidaemia, apoE to / to  mice develop aortic atherosclerosis and exhibit gross bilateral xanthoma formation from 3 months of age (15,16). To evaluate long-term effects of ectopic muscle-based expression of apoE following intramuscular plasmid injection, atherosclerotic plaque and xanthoma formation were examined up to 9 months following intramuscular plasmid injection. As pCMVapoE2 produced measurable levels of apoE in plasma (Table 1), this vector was used for injection. Mice at 6 to 8 weeks old were subjected to a single regime of intramuscular pCMVapoE2 plasmid injection and sacrificed 6 or 9 months later; control animals received pCMV( to ). Animals were dissected and evaluated for the presence of gross bilateral xanthoma by physical examination and for aortic atheroma by quantitative morphometry as described in Materials and Methods.
In the 6 month group, all untreated mice had visible macroscopic dorsal xanthoma and 3 of 5 scored with a diameter of  > 5 mm (Table 2; Fig. 3A). In contrast, in the plasmid-injected group of animals, no animals had dorsal xanthoma of  > 5 mm (Table 2): in this group, four of five animals exhibited no macroscopically visible xanthoma and one had clear xanthoma formation but of  < 5 mm. Similarly, a significant reduction of atherosclerotic plaque (Table 2; Fig. 3B) was seen in the treated mice, 30% less than in untreated animals. The mean percentage surface area of aorta staining with Oil-Red-O was reduced from 29.6  plus or minus  1.5 in controls to 20.2  plus or minus  5.1 in pCMVapoE2-injected animals (P  <  0.05). Comparable findings were seen at 9 months (Table 2) even though the atherosclerotic lesions were more advanced. Thus, Oil-Red-O staining plaque area in the aorta was reduced by ~20% (from 47.4  plus or minus  3.6 to 39.0  plus or minus  9.2%; P  <  0.05). At 9 months, all animals in the control group had macroscopically visible dorsal xanthoma, with four of six mice exhibiting lesions  > 5 mm in diameter. In the treated group at 9 months, two of six animals had no grossly observable xanthoma and none had xanthoma of  > 5 mm. There were no significant differences in the mean plasma concentrations of cholesterol and triglyceride for treated and untreated mice at both the 6 and 9 month time points (data not shown).

     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Cultured mouse C2C12 muscle cells which had been transfected with pCMVapoE2/3 expression vectors efficiently synthesized and secreted recombinant human apoE, whether grown as mononucleated myoblasts or differentiated into post-mitotic multinucleate myotubes. This implies that injection of plasmid vector into skeletal muscle would result in apoE expression and this was confirmed by direct measurements when apoE2 was clearly detected in plasma 6 days following intramuscular injection of plasmid into apoE to / to  mice. Release of the corresponding protein into plasma following intramuscular injection of expression vector plasmids has been reported for several different proteins, including decorin, endostatin, -galactosidase, factor IX, growth hormone and erythropoietin (25 to 28).
ApoE to / to  mice are recognized as a valuable model of human atherosclerosis (34). The animals are grossly hypercholesterolaemic on normal chow, exhibit spontaneous xanthoma formation and develop atheroma in coronary arteries from 2 months. Widespread fibroproliferative atherosclerotic lesions then evolve to form fibrous plaques with smooth muscle cell caps and necrotic cores at 5 months, whereas near-total occlusion of the coronary artery ostium and profound atheroma is observed at 8 months. In our 6 day study, intramuscular injection of pCMVapoE2 or of pCMVapoE3 did not reduce plasma lipid levels; nor were reductions seen in the long-term studies when single or double injections of pCMVapoE2 were used. This may largely reflect a low efficiency of gene expression and apoE synthesis and secretion. Thus, although plasma apoE as low as 0.4  microg/ml, compared with a normal level of 30 to 60  microg/ml, can effectively reduce plasma cholesterol (35), this concentration was not reached in our study. The lower level of plasma apoE3 compared with apoE2 is most likely explained by its increased binding affinity for hepatic LRP, the receptor responsible for clearing remnant lipoproteins after lipolysis (11). Similar results have been described in Yoshida Wistar rats receiving an intramuscular injection of naked plasmid DNA, where local expression of human apoE3 was demonstrated in the muscle but no recombinant protein could be detected in plasma (36). In line with this study, here we observed the local expression of both apoE2 and apoE3 cDNA in treated muscles of apoE knockouts, but plasma accumulation of only recombinant apoE2 protein. This effect is presumably due to reduced plasma clearance and liver uptake of the exogenous apoE2 compared with apoE3 and, accordingly, the expression of low levels of apoE2 did not significantly alter plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
Despite the unchanged hyperlipidaemia, the end-point pathologies 6 and 9 months following gene transfer showed clear evidence of atherosclerotic plaque and xanthoma retardation in animals treated with pCMVapoE2. We believe that this inhibition reflects anti-atherogenic actions of apoE at lesion sites. Although most plasma apoE is secreted by the liver, a significant proportion (10%) is macrophage-derived and transplantation of bone marrow from normal mice into apoE to / to  animals prevents development of atherosclerosis (37,38). In part, this represents the ability of macrophage-derived apoE to promote clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins and reduce serum cholesterol concentration (39). However, low-dose expression of human or mouse apoE transgenes in macrophages of apoE to / to  mice (giving a plasma apoE of 5% of wild-type levels) inhibits atherogenesis without correcting the hyperlipidaemia (40). This implies direct atheroprotective effects of apoE in the artery wall, a view endorsed by the abundance of apoE in atherosclerotic lesions (41) and by the finding that transfecting endothelium to secrete apoE prevents lesion progression (42). However, although it is clear that endogenous apoE within lesions, supplied by infiltrating macrophages, effectively retards foam cell formation and progression of atherosclerosis, these atheroprotective actions can also be carried out by exogenously derived apoE. Thus, liver-derived apoE also infiltrates and accumulates within the arterial intima to regress atherosclerosis in apoE to / to  mice (43). Importantly, studies in transgenic mice expressing adrenal apoE have shown that even low plasma levels (1 to 2% of normal) of extrahepatic, non-macrophage apoE can limit atherosclerosis without reversing the hyperlipidaemia (44); presumably, muscle-derived apoE had a similar effect.
One mechanism by which locally produced apoE is atheroprotective is by enhancing cellular cholesterol efflux, a function largely restored to the plasma of apoE to / to  mice after low-dose expression of the human apoE3 gene in macrophages (41). Whether this action could contribute to the apoE2-mediated inhibition of atherogenesis seen in our study is uncertain, although there is evidence that efficient cholesterol efflux is not restricted to the apoE3 isoform (45). Other atheroprotective actions of apoE include inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation (46), reducing oxidative insults (47), restricting platelet aggregation (48) and downregulating VCAM-1 expression on endothelial cells (A.K. Stannard et al., manuscript submitted). Here there is less isoform dependency: apoE2 has greater antioxidant activity than apoE3, whereas our own studies on the anti-platelet and anti-inflammatory properties of apoE did not find an obvious difference between isoforms (48).
Increasingly, skeletal muscle is being proposed as an important target for cell-mediated gene therapy. Muscle tissues are stable with little nuclear turnover, are well vascularized and actively secretory and readily accessible for gene delivery. The present study shows for the first time that expression of even very low levels of apoE from ectopic muscle sites has therapeutic potential to limit progression of atherosclerosis. However, further studies are needed to critically evaluate this strategy, including the use of more efficient vectors such as adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vectors (49,50).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Materials ApoE expression plasmids were constructed by ligating full-length human apoE2 and apoE3 cDNAs into pCMVss (Clontech Laboratories, Basingstoke, UK) after removal of the LacZ gene by NotI digestion. A control vector, pCMV( to ) was also produced lacking LacZ. Plasmids were bulked up and purified using an Endofree Plasmid kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium (DMEM), additional tissue culture materials and lipofectAMINE were purchased from Life Technologies (Paisley, UK). Other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise (Poole, UK).
Expression and secretion of apoE by cultured mouse muscle cells Murine myoblast cells (C2C12) were grown as adherent monolayers to subconfluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM glutamine. Cultures were transfected with plasmid DNAs using lipofectAMINE, as previously described by Dodds et al. (51). Following transfection, cultures were grown under normal conditions for 24 h and then either processed for apoE analyses (see below) or transferred for 2 days to DMEM containing 5% heat-inactivated horse serum to induce cell differentiation and fusion into large multinucleate myotubes. For evaluation of apoE expression, cultures were grown for 24 h in serum-free media, which were then collected for analysis. Secreted human apoE was measured directly by a commercial ELISA kit according to the manufacturer s instructions (Apo-Tek ApoE kit; Per-Immune, Rockville, MD). For other analyses, medium was concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration (VIVASPIN, 10 000 mwco; Vivascience, Westford, MA). Western blot analyses were performed following 15% SDS to PAGE by transfer to Hybond membranes (Nycomed Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK) and probed with polyclonal goat anti-apoE antibody (1:3000; Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat as a secondary (1:10 000; Sigma) and chemiluminescence detection (ECL western blotting kit; Amersham-Pharmacia). The electrophoretic mobility of natively secreted apoE-containing particles was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (29), whereas particle diameters were quantified by negative staining TEM.
Expression of human apoE from skeletal muscle of apoE to / to  mice The apoE-deficient mice used in this study were provided through animal husbandry at Glaxo Wellcome and have been described by Piedrahita et al. (15). For plasmid injections, female apoE to / to  mice (6 to 8 weeks old) were anaesthetized and 50  microl of 1.2% (w/v) BaCl2 solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was injected into the tibialis anterior muscle to induce regeneration. Three days later, mice were injected with plasmids, each receiving 50  microg of DNA in 50  microl of PBS.
Plasma analyses Citrated plasma samples were collected from mice at intermediate times by tail-bleeds (50  microl) or at the end-point by cardiac puncture under terminal anaesthesia. Plasma apoE was quantified with the Apo-Tek ApoE kit. Total serum cholesterol and triglycerides were measured in microtitre plates using commercial reagents and standards (CHOD-PAP; Roche Products, Lewes, UK). Plasma lipoproteins were fractionated by sequential isopycnic ultracentrifugation into VLDL (   <  1.006 g/ml), IDL ( = 1.006 to 1.019 g/ml), LDL ( = 1.019 to 1.063 g/ml) and HDL ( = 1.063 to 1.21 g/ml) as described previously by Owen et al. (52).
Tissue analyses Following exsanguination of the animal, the heart and thoracic aorta were removed en bloc and the vessel dissected clean of adventitial fat. The bottom half of the heart was removed and the remaining portion cut open to expose the aortic cusps. The aorta was then opened up along its length and pinned out en face onto a piece of cork. Fixation of the tissue was achieved by placing in phosphate-buffered formalin for at least 3 days. Tissues were then stained with Oil-Red O and the mean lesion surface area per section was quantified blind using computer-assisted image analysis (Sigmascan) according to Plump et al. (16). In some animals, the injected muscles were excised and examined for apoE mRNA using RT to PCR and a published primer set (33); negative controls included no RNA template and omission of the reverse transcriptase. The presence of bilateral dorsal xanthoma was evaluated in a blind manner by visual inspection on an animal per animal basis and scored positively when gross xanthoma  > 5 mm in diameter was present.
Statistics Results are shown as means  plus or minus  SD and statistical analysis was performed by Student s t-test (SigmaStat); P  <  0.05 was considered to be significant.
