ABSTRACT
Apolipoprotein E (apoE), particularly the e4 allele, is genetically linked to the incidence of Alzheimer's disease. In vitro, apoE has been shown to bind -amyloid (A), an amyloidogenic peptide that aggregates to form the primary component of senile plaques. In previous work, we demonstrated that apoE3 from tissue culture medium binds to A with greater avidity than apoE4 (LaDu, M. J., Falduto, M. T., Manelli, A. M., Reardon, C. A., Getz, G. S., and Frail, D. E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23403-23406). This is in contrast to data using purified apoE isoforms as substrate for A (Strittmatter, W. J., Weisgraber, K. H., Huang, D. Y., Dong, L.-M., Salvesen, G. S., Pericak-Vance, M., Schmechel, D., Saunders, A. M., Goldgaber, D., and Roses, A. D. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 8098-8102). Here we resolve this apparent discrepancy by demonstrating that the preferential binding of A to apoE3 is attenuated and even abolished with purification, a process that includes delipidation and denaturation. We compared the A binding capacity of unpurified apoE isoforms from both tissue culture medium and intact human very low density lipoproteins with that of apoE purified from these two sources. The interaction of human A- (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40) -peptide and apoE was analyzed by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western immunoblotting for either A or apoE immunoreactivity. While the level of the apoE3A complex was 20-fold greater compared with the apoE4A complex in unpurified conditioned medium, apoE3 and apoE4 purified from this medium bound to A with comparable avidity. Moreover, using endogenous apoE on very low density lipoproteins from plasma of apoE3/3 and apoE4/4 homozygotes, apoE3 was again a better substrate for A than apoE4. However, apoE purified from these plasma lipoproteins exhibited little isoform specificity in binding to A. These results suggest that native preparations of apoE may be a more physiologically relevant substrate for A binding than purified apoE and further underscore the importance of subtle differences in apoE conformation to its biological activity.
INTRODUCTION
Apolipoprotein E (apoE),() a component of several classes of lipoproteins, acts as a ligand for lipoprotein receptors, thus regulating lipid transport and clearance. ApoE is also expressed in the brain (1) and in response to injury in both the peripheral (2) and central nervous (3) systems. In humans, apoE has three major isoforms, E2 (Cys, Cys), E3 (Cys, Arg), and E4 (Arg, Arg), which are products of three alleles at a single gene locus. The presence of cysteine in apoE2 and apoE3 allow these isoforms to form disulfide-linked dimers. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the apoE e4 allele is present with increased frequency in patients with sporadic (4) and late-onset familial (5) Alzheimer's disease (AD). Due primarily to this genetic linkage, the role of apoE in the pathogenesis of AD is being actively pursued.
A major neuropathological feature of AD is the presence of extracellular senile plaques composed predominantly of aggregated -amyloid peptide (A). The physiological mechanism by which apoE contributes to AD pathology may be by means of an isoform-specific interaction with A. ApoE and A colocalize in senile plaques (6) , and synthetic A peptides bind in vitro to apoE from tissue culture medium (7) and cerebrospinal fluid (5, 8, 9) as well as to purified apoE (9, 10) . However, studies involving apoE isoform specificity in binding to A have been limited and contradictory. In previous work, we demonstrated that apoE3 from tissue culture medium binds to A with greater avidity than apoE4 (7) . This is in contrast to data from Strittmatter et al. (10) , who used apoE isoforms purified from human plasma as substrate for A. Here we resolve the apparent discrepancy between these studies by demonstrating that the previously observed preferential association of A with apoE3 is attenuated or abolished by purification, a process that includes delipidation and denaturation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Expression of Human ApoE in Cultured Cells Human apoE3 and apoE4 were expressed in HEK-293 cells stably transfected with human apoE3 or apoE4 (products of the e3 and e4 alleles, respectively) cDNA as described previously (7) . Conditioned medium containing apoE was concentrated (Centriprep, Amicon, Inc.) 50-fold prior to binding reactions or purification.
Purification of ApoE Human plasma was screened for apoE genotype using a modification of the method of Hixson and Vernier (11) . Intermediate and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles ( d  <  1.02 g/ml) were isolated (12) from the plasma of individuals homozygous for apoE3 and apoE4. Unpurified preparations of VLDL were used within 2 weeks of isolation. Purification of apoE from this lipoprotein fraction and from concentrated conditioned medium was carried out according to standard procedures (13) . Briefly, the conditioned medium and lipoproteins were dialyzed against 0.01% EDTA, lyophilized, and delipidated in CHCl:MeOH (2:1). Delipidated proteins were pelleted in MeOH and solubilized in 6 M guanidine, 0.1 M Tris, 0.01% EDTA (pH 7.4), and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were fractionated on a Sephacryl S-300 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in 4 M guanidine, 0.1 M Tris, 0.01% EDTA (pH 7.4), and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing apoE were dialyzed in 5 m M NHHCO, lyophilized, and resuspended in 0.1 M NHHCO. Unpurified and purified apoE proteins were quantified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, protein staining, and densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) of serial dilutions of apoE-containing samples using a purified apoE standard.
ApoEA Complex Formation and Detection For binding reactions, synthetic human A- (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40) -peptide, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, was resuspended to 5 m M in 100% MeSO. ApoE (25  microg/ml, 700 n M) was incubated for 2 h (except as noted in the legend to Fig. 4 ) at room temperature with 250  micro M A at pH 7.4 as described previously (7) . Control reactions without A contained 5% MeSO. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 nonreducing Laemmli buffer (14) (4% SDS, no 2-mercaptoethanol) and frozen at -20  degrees C. Samples were boiled for 5 min, electrophoresed on 10-20% SDS-Tricine gels, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.), and probed with antibodies to A or apoE (1:1000 dilution). Monoclonal antibody 4G8 to amino acids 17-24 of A was provided by Drs. H. M. Wisniewski and K. S. Kim (15) . ApoE antiserum was obtained by immunizing rabbits with apoE purified from human serum. Proteins on Western blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) and quantified by densitometry.

Lanes 1 and 7, apoE alone; lanes 2-6 and 8-12, apoE + A for 2 min, 10 min, 2 h, 8 h, and 24 h, respectively.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Genetic data have defined the presence of the e4 allele of apoE as a major risk factor for the occurrence of sporadic (4) and late-onset familial (5) Alzheimer's disease. However, the physiological mechanism by which apoE isoform specificity contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease is unknown. Previously, using unpurified apoE from conditioned medium, we showed that the amount of the apoE3A complex was much greater compared with the apoE4A complex (7) . These results are in contrast to data published by Strittmatter et al. (10) . Using apoE purified from human plasma, they reported that apoE4 binds A more rapidly than apoE3. However, the level of A binding to apoE3 and apoE4 after several hours of incubation was comparable. The major differences between these two studies are the source of apoE (plasma versus secreted by cultured cells) and whether the apoE protein was purified prior to use in the binding assays. In this study, we examined whether these differences could account for the discrepancy between these two reports regarding apoE isoform-specific binding to A. We compared the A binding capacity of unpurified apoE from both conditioned medium and intact human VLDL from plasma of apoE3/3 and apoE4/4 homozygotes with the A binding capacity of apoE purified from these two sources. The purification procedure (13) used was the same as that used by Strittmatter et al. (10) .
We first examined the effect of purification of apoE from conditioned medium on the formation of apoEA complexes. ApoE3 and apoE4 were purified from the medium of transfected HEK-293 cells, and the binding of this material to A was compared with the binding of unpurified apoE from medium (Fig. 1). Prior to purification, the amount of the apoE3A complex (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 2) was 20-fold greater compared with the apoE4A complex ( lane 4). These results are consistent with our previous data that demonstrated that this preferential binding of A to apoE3 is maintained over time, pH range, and concentration of apoE and A (7) . Purification of the apoE isoforms from this medium resulted in a decrease in A binding to apoE3 (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 6) and an increase in A binding to apoE4 ( lane 8). To determine whether an auxiliary component that influences the isoform specificity of apoE binding to A is present in the medium of HEK-293 cells, we reconstituted purified apoE with mock-transfected conditioned medium. The isoform specificity of apoE binding to A was not restored to pre-purification levels, indicating that purification does not remove a component present in the medium that confers the preferential binding of A to apoE3 (compare Figs. 2 and 1 A, lanes 5-8).
Figure 1: ApoE/A binding: effect of purifying apoE isoforms from conditioned medium. Shown are Western blots of binding reactions using 25  microg/ml apoE (700 n M) incubated with ( lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) or without ( lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) 250  micro M A-(1-40)-peptide for 2 h at room temperature. Sources of apoE were as follows: conditioned medium of transfected cells (apoE3, lanes 1 and 2; apoE4, lanes 3 and 4) and purified from conditioned medium (apoE3, lanes 5 and 6; apoE4, lanes 7 and 8). Samples were run in nonreducing Laemmli buffer on 10-20% SDS-Tricine gels, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane, and probed with 4G8 antibody ( A) or apoE antiserum ( B).
To examine the binding of A to unpurified plasma apoE isoforms, VLDL was isolated from the plasma of apoE3/3 and apoE4/4 homozygotes and used for binding reactions with A. Similar to the results using unpurified apoE from conditioned medium, we observed an 20-fold difference in the amount of the apoE3A complex (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 2) compared with the apoE4A complex ( lane 4) when using intact VLDL particles as the source of apoE. As with purification of apoE from medium, purification of apoE from the VLDL fraction of human plasma attenuated the preferential binding of apoE3 to A (Fig. 3 A and B, lanes 6 and 8). The level of A binding to both apoE4 and apoE3 dimer was increased after purification of apoE from plasma. In apoE3/3 plasma, the apoE immunoreactive species migrating slightly higher than the apoEA complex (55 kDa) is the apoE3-apolipoprotein A-II heterodimer (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2).() The autoradiographs shown in Figs. 1 and 3 are representative of several experiments with similar results using different apoE-containing preparations. While some variation in the purification-mediated loss of preferential apoE3 binding to A was observed, in general, purification of apoE from both medium and plasma abolished isoform-specific binding to A.
Figure 3: ApoE/A binding: effect of purifying apoE isoforms from human plasma. Shown are Western blots of apoE/A binding reactions assayed under the conditions described in the legend to Fig. 1. Sources of apoE were as follows: intact VLDL from apoE3/3 ( lanes 1 and 2) and apoE4/4 ( lanes 3 and 4) homozygotes and purified from VLDL of apoE3/3 ( lanes 5 and 6) and apoE4/4 ( lanes 7 and 8) homozygotes. Samples were run as described in the legend to Fig. 1 and probed with 4G8 antibody ( A) or apoE antiserum ( B). For apoE3 VLDL, total protein was 95 ng/ microl, and triglyceride was 600 ng/ microl. For apoE4 VLDL, total protein was 110 ng/ microl, and triglyceride was 400 ng/ microl.
Strittmatter et al. (10) used apoE purified from plasma to show that A binds to apoE4 monomer at a faster rate than to apoE3 monomer. However, the contribution of the apoE3-A complex in their time course data is difficult to discern since the blots were probed for apoE and A immunoreactivity simultaneously (10) . Therefore, we repeated the time course study using purified plasma apoE isoforms and probed for A (Fig. 4 A) and apoE (Fig. 4 B) immunoreactivity individually. Similar to the results obtained by Strittmatter et al. (10) , apoE4 monomer did form a complex with A at a faster rate compared with apoE3 monomer. However, when the apoE3 dimer-A complex was taken into account, the total binding of A to apoE3 and apoE4 remained comparable across time.
There are several possibilities that could account for the loss of isoform specificity in the binding of purified apoE to A. Purification may result in a change in the oxidative state of apoE that influences its binding to A. Although the apoE isoforms are subject to the same conditions while undergoing purification, oxidation could be specific to the Cysin apoE3. This could affect conformation-dependent binding of apoE to A, either directly or via interaction of other amino acids with this residue. However, apoE3 dimer, particularly in its purified form, readily binds A, indicating that at least oxidation of cysteine does not seem to adversely affect apoE3 A complex formation. In addition, oxidation provides no obvious explanation for the increase in A binding to purified apoE4 monomer.
Another more likely explanation is that apoE acquires a conformation when lipid-associated that confers isoform-specific binding to A. Purification, which includes delipidation, may increase the binding of A to apoE3 dimer and apoE4 monomer by disrupting the endogenous conformation of these apoE species. In each of the unpurified preparations used here, apoE was lipid-associated. ApoE from human plasma was in the VLDL fraction, while the majority of apoE in conditioned medium was in a high density lipid fraction.() Purified apoE has been shown to require lipid to restore its biological activity in other assay systems, presumably by allowing the denatured protein to refold to its functional conformation. These apoE activity assays include such diverse functions as receptor binding and modulation of neuritic growth. While purified apoE is unable to displace I-labeled low density lipoprotein (LDL) from LDL receptors (16) , high affinity binding is restored when apoE is added in the presence of a variety of lipid particles, including phospholipid vesicles (17) . Similarly, the binding of purified apoE to LDL receptor-related protein is enhanced by the addition of -migrating VLDL (18) . In primary dorsal root ganglia cultures, purified apoE3 and apoE4 have no effect on neuritic growth. However, when added in the presence of -migrating VLDL, both apoE isoforms affect neuritic growth, with apoE3 increasing neuritic extension and decreasing branching and apoE4 decreasing both branching and extension (19) . Experiments are in progress using the assay system described here to determine the nature of the interaction of A with lipid-associated apoE using both endogenous lipoproteins and reconstituted lipid vesicles.
The data presented here are consistent with a function for apoE in the pathogenesis of AD by sequestering A. Avid binding of apoE3 to soluble A in the neuropil could lead to enhanced clearance or altered fibril formation, both of which could prevent the conversion of A into a neurotoxic species. Since lipid-associated apoE3 and apoE4 bind the LDL receptor and LDL receptor-related protein with equal affinity (18) , efficient uptake and clearance of A may depend on its preferential binding to apoE3. Alternatively, purified apoE3 and apoE4 are known to differ with respect to their effect on A fibril formation (20, 21, 22) , suggesting that native apoE may play an even greater isoform-specific role in the extracellular aggregation of A due to differences in A binding characteristics. Finally, there is evidence that A-induced toxicity in hippocampal neurons is attenuated by the addition of rabbit apoE (23) , leading to the intriguing possibility that human apoE may contribute to A-induced toxicity in an isoform-specific manner.
In summary, using unpurified apoE from tissue culture medium and intact VLDL particles, the apoE3A complex was 20-fold more abundant than the apoE4A complex. This isoform specificity was attenuated or abolished when apoE purified from these two sources was used in binding reactions with A. ApoE is an apolipoprotein, and as such, its endogenous conformation requires lipid. It is therefore not surprising that the type of apoE preparation used can affect the results. The avidity of A binding to apoE3 compared with apoE4 demonstrated here may be involved in the isoform-specific effect underlying the genetic correlation between the apoE e4 allele and AD. The physiological relevance of this complex to plaque formation or neurodegeneration awaits further investigation.
