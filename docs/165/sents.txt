0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, April 23, 2002, and in revised form, May 31, 2002.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	4	Previous epidemiological studies show that an elevated serum cholesterol level is a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 (1-3) and that statin therapy reduces the frequency of AD (4) and dementia (5).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The decreased levels of cellular cholesterol have been shown to reduce A production in vitro (6) and in vivo (7).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Previous studies have also shown the association of cholesterol accumulation with mature senile plaques (8) and neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons (9).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Additionally, a recent study (10) has suggested that an increased cholesterol level in the membrane facilitates amyloid fibril formation through formation of GM1 ganglioside-bound A, a putative endogenous seed.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These findings suggest that increased cellular cholesterol levels induce high amyloid -protein (A) production and subsequent AD development.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	9	However, several studies (11-14) have shown opposing evidence indicating that cholesterol levels in serum, cell membranes of brains, and cerebrospinal fluid are decreased in AD patients compared with those in controls.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Previous studies have shown that increased dietary cholesterol levels reduce A secretion (15) and that increased cellular cholesterol levels inhibit the A-mediated cell toxicity (16, 17).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	11	 On the other hand, the effect of A on cellular cholesterol metabolism has also been investigated (18).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Our recent studies have shown that not monomeric but oligomeric A affects cholesterol metabolism (19) and eventually reduces cellular cholesterol levels (20).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In addition, cholesterol deficiency has been shown to promote tau phosphorylation in vitro (21, 22) and in vivo (23).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These findings suggest that the involvement of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD is dualistic.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The elevated levels of cellular cholesterol contribute to AD development by elevating A secretion; however, the increasing amount of oligomerized A reduces cellular cholesterol levels, which in turn may promote the progression of AD pathologies.

0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Because apoE3 contains cysteine at residue 112 and apoE4 does not, the higher ability of apoE3 to promote lipid release may be caused by its increased number of helical segments due to the formation of disulfide-linked dimers.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	211	 To examine this possibility, we performed immunoblot analysis of the conditioned culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes under reducing and nonreducing conditions.

0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	218	 These results indicate that apoE3 has a higher ability to generate apoE lipid particles with less numbers of apoE molecules per particle than apoE4, suggesting that apoE3-expressing astrocytes could supply more cholesterol to neurons than apoE4-expressing astrocytes, thereby supporting neuronal plasticity and promoting neuronal regeneration.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	219	It was reported that apolipoproteins with multiple -helix segments of 20-30 amino acid residues, in which hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues are aligned on opposite sides of the axis, induce cholesterol efflux from cells when added to the culture medium (44, 46-50).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	220	 ApoE is one of such apolipoproteins, and the effects of apoE on cholesterol release have been examined in various cell systems (51-54).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	221	 This apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol release results in the generation of pre--HDL, which contains apolipoproteins, cellular cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Recent studies (31, 37) have demonstrated that HDL-like particles in association with exogenous or endogenous apoE are also generated in the cultured medium of the central nervous system cells such as astrocytes and neurons.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	223	 In addition, we have found that the addition of exogenous apoE promotes lipid release from the central nervous system cells generating HDL-like particles in an apoE isoform-dependent manner (34).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Consistent with our previous findings using exogenous apoE, the present study also shows that the amount of lipids released from apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes is apoE isoform-dependent, with the order of potency being apoE3  >  apoE4.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	225	 However, the mechanism underlying this isoform-dependent cholesterol release remains undetermined.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	226	Therefore, the next question to be addressed is what is the mechanism underlying the apoE isoform-dependent cholesterol release.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	227	 We found that the amount of lipids released from apoE3-expressing astrocytes is ~2.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	228	5-fold greater than that from apoE4-expressing astrocytes, whereas the amount of apoE3 released is similar to that of apoE4.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	229	 One possible explanation to this may be that each particle contains equal amount of apoE proteins; however, particles containing apoE3 contain ~2.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	230	5-fold greater amounts of lipids than those containing apoE4.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Another possible explanation may be that each particle contains equal amounts of lipids, but apoE3-containing particles contain lower numbers of apoE molecules than apoE4-containing particles.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	232	 This implies that apoE3 has the ability to form lipid particles with a lower number of apoE molecules than apoE4, and thus to generate ~2.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	233	5-fold greater numbers of apoE-lipid particles than apoE4 with the same number of apoE molecules.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Between these two possibilities, our experiment favors the latter because, as shown in Fig.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	235	 6 and Table II, the sizes of particles in both conditioned culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes are similar.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	236	The apoE isoform-dependent difference in the association of lipoprotein particles may be explained in terms of the mechanism underlying the apoE isoform-specific formation of apoE oligomers; apoE3 protein forms dimers, and apoE4 does not.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	237	 This difference may be because apoE3 has cysteine at position 112 of the N-terminal domain, whereas apoE4 has arginine at the same position.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Previous studies have shown that the number and the length of amphiphilic helices are responsible for determining the ability of a given apolipoprotein to promote lipid release (44, 49, 55).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Interestingly, human apoA-II is known to form disulfide-linked dimers and exhibit stronger ability to promote lipid release than monomeric apoA-II (44).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	240	 These lines of evidence allow us to postulate that the higher ability of apoE dimers than apoE monomers to promote lipid release may explain the greater amounts of lipids released in the conditioned culture media of apoE3-expressing astrocytes than apoE4-expressing astrocytes.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Based on this assumption, we propose a model of the isoform-dependent association of apoE with lipid particles (Fig.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Consistent with our present results, previous studies have revealed the conformational adaptability of apoE the N-terminal domain as a function of lipid availability (56) or the presence of competitor apolipoproteins (for review see Ref.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	243	 In these studies, a model of two possible conformations of apoE on spherical lipid particles was proposed; at a high apoE concentration, the N-terminal domain is displaced from the lipid surface to form a helix bundle in a closed conformation, whereas at a low concentration on the surface, the four helix bundles of the N-terminal domain are in an open conformation, and all the helices are in contact with the lipid surface.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Based on these lines of evidence together with our findings that an apoE3-containing HDL-like particle contains approximately one-half the number of apoE molecules compared with an apoE4-containing particle, it may be possible that the apoE isoform-dependent conformational change occurs on the surface of lipid particles; the N-terminal domain of apoE3 is in an open conformation, whereas that of apoE4 is in closed helix bundle conformation.

0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Based on these findings, we propose a model showing that one apoE4-containing lipid particle contains ~2-fold numbers of apoE molecules compared with an apoE3-containing lipid particle.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	249	Another possible explanation may be the preferential association of apoE isoforms with lipoproteins; apoE4 preferentially associates with very low density lipoprotein, whereas apoE3 associates with HDL.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	250	 This assumption is based on the facts that the N-terminal domain modulates the lipid-binding preference elicited by the C-terminal domain (58, 59) and that the interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains is responsible for this isoform preference (60, 61).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	251	 It has been suggested that in apoE4, the interaction of arginine 61 with glutamic acid 255 may stabilize an extended helical structure in the carboxyl terminus that is best accommodated on a less curved very low density lipoprotein surface, whereas this interaction does not exist in apoE3, which therefore lacks stability and has shorter helices and preference for HDL (61, 62).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Based on these lines of evidence, apoE3 may preferentially bind to an HDL particle with a lower number of apoE molecules to stabilize the particle, whereas apoE4 has less binding efficacy to an HDL particle, which requires higher numbers of apoE molecules to stabilize the particle.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Because the physical properties of apoE are assumed to influence its functions (i.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	254	 how it associates with lipid particles and stabilizes them), the apoE-isoform-dependent difference in the stability among the 22-kDa N-terminal fragments of apoE (63) may be involved in the isoform-dependent binding efficacy of apoE to HDL particles.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	255	Previous studies (48-50, 54) have demonstrated that various cells generate cholesterol-rich HDL-like particles with exogenous apolipoproteins.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	256	 However, this is not the case with astrocytes, because we and other researchers have found that generation of HDL by endogenous apoE and by exogenous apoE is differently regulated in cultured astrocytes; HDL-like particles that are generated with exogenous apolipoproteins have low amounts of cholesterol (34, 37), whereas HDL-like particles generated with endogenous apoE are cholesterol-rich (37).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	257	 In support of these findings, the present study has shown that apoE-lipid particles generated by the endogenously synthesized and released apoE are cholesterol-rich, compared with those generated by the addition of exogenous apoE (34).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Because the amount of apoE that is free from lipid particles in the cultured medium and CSF is below detection limit (see Ref.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	259	 4, a and b), these results suggest that under physiological conditions, cholesterol-rich lipid particles associated with endogenous apoE are the major cholesterol source for neurons in the central nervous system.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	260	 In this regard, it is of interest to note that apoE3-expressing astrocytes could supply more cholesterol in the form of apoE lipid particles to other cells including neurons with comparable levels of apoE secretion than apoE4-expressing astrocytes.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Under the steady-state conditions, the lipid metabolisms in the central nervous system appear similar between the brains of apoE3 and apoE4 knock-in mice; the concentrations of free and esterified cholesterol in the postnuclear supernatant, plasma membrane, and endoplasmic reticulum of the brain homogenate are similar (64).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	262	 However, under different conditions such as during recovery phases after brain injury and cell damage, endogenous apoE-mediated generation of HDL-like particles could play a critical role in cholesterol delivery to neurons, which are an essential material for axonal regeneration and synapse formation (65-68).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Actually, previous studies (69, 70) have demonstrated that traumatic brain injury is the most robust environmental risk factor for development of AD.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	264	 These lines of evidence may allow us to postulate that the apoE isoform dependence of the development of AD may be explained by the apoE isoform-dependent ability in the cholesterol supply to neurons after injury and cell damage, leading to neuroregeneration.

0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received January 13, 2004; Accepted January 26, 2004.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Overview of concordant linkage/association regions observed in full genome screens published until 2003   These disease-specific characteristics, together with the advent of relatively inexpensive and powerful high-throughput genotyping technologies, and the near completion of the human genome sequence have led to a steep increase in the number of laboratories studying the genetics of AD worldwide.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	4	 To date, no less than 12 full-genome screens using linkage- or association-based methodologies have been published for AD, some using overlapping or identical samples, but each employing different sets of genetic markers and/or analytic strategies (8 to 19) (Table 1).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	5	 On the other hand, the number of locus-specific, candidate gene-based AD association studies has now become nearly intractable.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Over the course of 2003, more than 10 genes were reported to show either positive or negative evidence of association with different AD phenotypes per month in peer-reviewed journals as listed on NCBI's  PubMed .
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Despite these vast efforts, no single gene has yet emerged to attain nearly the degree of replication and consistency that has been observed by literally hundreds of laboratories studying the association of APOE-4 and AD.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In this review, we present and discuss the findings of all genetic AD association studies published in 2003 (excluding those explicitly searching for the causes of early-onset familial AD cases, i.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Using these data as an example, we then attempt to pinpoint the methodological difficulties that are likely to underlie the remarkable failure to replicate genetic findings using current approaches.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	10	Candidate gene studies Searching  PubMed  (www.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	11	gov/PubMed/) with keywords  alzheimer* AND (association OR associated)  for all papers published between January 1 and December 31, 2003, retrieved a total of 1037 studies (on December 28, 2003), of which 90 directly deal with genetic association between candidate polymorphisms and AD.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	12	 As can be seen in Table 2, these studies examined a total of 55 genetic loci ( locus  being a set of markers within the same 5 Mb genomic interval) on 20 different chromosomes.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	13	 A total of 55 analyzed genes within these loci were found to be  positive  (as judged by the authors), while 68 tested  negative .
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Interestingly, even 10 years after its discovery, the largest number (n=18) of reports focusing on a single gene dealt with the association between APOE and AD, using new polymorphisms, new samples/ethnic groups or new phenotypes.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	15	 When these studies were not considered, a total of 38 positive and 67 negative papers remained.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Overview of chromosomal loci tested for genetic association with AD in 2003   If 2003 represents one of the most prolific vintages for late-onset AD genetic studies, the next most pressing question is: did the large quantity of studies also dilute the quality of the product, perhaps even making for an unpalatable quaff? The answer, in our opinion, is yes, at least in the majority of cases.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	17	 There is growing consensus that the success rate and reliability of genetic association studies in complex diseases depend on the fulfillment of several criteria (20,21), three of which are discussed in more detail below.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	18	 These are in addition to the  classic  requirements of at least plausible biological and/or positional candidacy for any investigated locus, as well as direct proof of pathophysiological consequences of any positive disease association.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	19	 While the former criterion is fulfilled for the vast majority of AD candidate genes investigated thus far, the latter condition has been more elusive.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This is due to several factors that generally bedevil the study of genetic association in complex diseases, such as linkage disequilibrium with the actual (and functionally relevant) disease-modifying variant, small effect sizes (which impede the detection of significant effects using basic molecular and biochemical assays), and possibly the involvement of as yet unknown pathophysiological mechanisms.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The situation of APOE-4 in AD serves as a good example: while the genetic association per se has been extremely well established over the past decade, there is still no consensus as to how this association translates pathophysiologically (22,23).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	22	Thus, before attempting to uncover the  functional consequences  of any putative new disease association, we propose that more emphasis must be placed on criteria that allow for a better distinction between false-positive as well as false-negative findings prior to initial publication.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	23	Power: does the sample size and structure enable the investigators to detect effect sizes of only moderate or small extent? While this is an obvious concern in reports with a negative outcome, the power of a study also governs the rate of false positive findings, i.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	24	 the probability that an observed significant association is indeed genuine and not only observed by chance (24 to 26).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Other factors influencing the ability to detect meaningful effects include the attributable risk of the polymorphism to the overall genetic variance, degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the associated allele and the actual disease predisposing variant, mode of inheritance and, to a lesser extent, disease prevalence.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	26	 While these variables are, of course, difficult to estimate when the true disease gene is unknown, power for any given sample size can fairly easily be calculated for a variety of possible and plausible scenarios.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In practice, however, this still remains the exception.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	28	 A recent study estimated that the minimal number of cases and controls sufficient to achieve 80% power at =0.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	29	05 is usually far greater than 200 when the actual disease allele is not tested directly, even under the most favorable of circumstances (26).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	30	 It is interesting that, regardless of these estimates, 20% of all studies published in 2003 have still used smaller sample sizes and thus are probably not suitable for use in reaching any reliable conclusion.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	31	Replicability: has the result been validated/replicated in an independent sample of sufficient size? While there have been reports of  significant  associations between putative candidate genes and AD on every chromosome in the human genome over the past 10 years (27), none of these findings with the exception of APOE-4 has yet been replicated consistently.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Many a seemingly  positive  result could (and should) have been validated in an independent dataset prior to its first publication, as several authors have long been suggesting in guidelines for the proper  quality control  of genetic association findings (20,21,25,28,29).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The current inflation of probable false-positive reports may have been avoided if independent replication had been sought earlier.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	34	 If an independent sample cannot be found in-house, the establishment of at least temporary  consortia  between collaborative laboratories to test each other's positive signals prior to publication would represent an easy and effective means to restore credibility.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Upon our review of the 2003 AD genetics literature, less than 20% of all studies either referred to findings in two or more independent samples at once, or were published in tandem with independent reports investigating the same candidate genes and/or genetic variants.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	36	Haplotype structure: have the authors made attempts to elucidate the structure of the underlying haplotype architecture? The more current and systematic assessment of haplotype structures at various regions throughout the genome in the past 3 to 4 years has emphasized the importance of performing haplotype- or systematic LD-analyses when searching for novel complex disease genes (30,31), especially when effect sizes are expected to be lower than those conferred by APOE-4.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In addition to increasing the power of the analyses, this approach also reduces the number of statistical tests that need to be performed, which should lead to a further decrease of false-positive findings.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Several very recently published complex disease associations would have been impossible to observe, without thorough assessment of the underlying haplotype architecture (32 to 34).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Along these lines, recent studies on APOE have shown that this locus would have been easily identified by means of haplotype analysis alone, even without the prior knowledge of the 4 polymorphism (35,36).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Yet, in 2003 only about one-third of all studies investigated more than one polymorphism per locus.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Only half of these carried out a more or less  thorough  assessment of haplotype structure (i.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	42	 four or more polymorphisms per gene).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	43	Out of all 90 papers published in 2003 on the topic of genetic association between candidate genes and the different AD phenotypes, only 21 (23%) fulfilled at least two of the above criteria.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Most likely, many of the observed discrepancies across studies could be explained by a lack of methodological thoroughness.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Nonetheless, there were three loci, in addition to APOE, that tested positive across at least three studies (on chromosomes 6p21, 10q24, and 11q23; Table 2).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	46	 These loci are covered in the remainder of this review.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	47	Chromosome 6p21 This chromosomal region was implicated as harboring a putative AD gene as early as 1980, based on an association finding between variants in the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex region (HLA-A, at 30 Mb) and AD in a small case to control study (37).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Two other potential AD candidates map within this 5 Mb interval, the genes encoding the hereditary haemochromatosis protein (HFE, at 26 Mb) and the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA, at 31 Mb).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	49	 While in 2003 two studies reported significant evidence of association with the latter two genes (38,39), two other studies did not confirm these findings (40,41).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Another candidate gene located in this region, HAPA1B, has been found to be associated with certain neuropsychological variables (42), but not disease risk itself (43).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Finally, one study investigated variation in onset age as a function of the HLA A2-allele in a small sample of AD patients, but did not find any significant effects (44).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	52	 A literature search for association studies with any of these genes including the years before 2003 yielded at least 15 positive studies, while 10 reports found no evidence of a genetic involvement of these factors.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	53	 While there has been some evidence for a direct involvement of TNFA in Ass-production and toxicity (45), direct proof for a pathogenetic relevance for any of the other genes/proteins remains to be seen.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Furthermore, the full-genome screens for AD genes have consistently yielded signals on 6p21 residing between 39 and 42 Mb, whereas the associated genes map 10 Mb further proximal.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Thus, while there is increasing evidence supporting the existence of a putative AD locus on 6p21 in general, the possibility that the actual disease gene has not yet been identified cannot be excluded, despite the overlapping positive results from this year and past studies.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	56	Chromosome 10q24 Of the six candidate loci analyzed in the region between 10q21 and 10q25 in 2003, three were reported to be associated with AD phenotypes across multiple samples (i.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	57	 CDC2/VR22, TNFRSF6/IDE and GSTO1/2).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The only locus found to be associated by more than one group of investigators is located between 90 and 94 Mb and encompasses the genes TNFRSF6 (90 Mb) and IDE/KIFF11/HHEX (46 to 48).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Probably the best candidate on biological grounds is IDE, encoding the insulin degrading enzyme (protein: IDE).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This metalloprotease has been shown to degrade monomeric Ass before it can aggregate into oligomeric forms and, ultimately, into ss-amyloid plaques (49).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	61	 While several issues of the proposed mode of action still remain controversial (e.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	62	 the precise cellular location of Ass cleavage, relevance of IDE function/dysfunction on the development of AD), there are now a number of animal models available showing the predicted effects in vivo (50 to 52).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Before 2003, there were two papers published showing allelic association with microsatellite markers in this region (53,54), while two reports did not find association with IDE variants or nearby markers and AD (55,56).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Note that the data on one of the negative studies (55) actually largely overlaps with the positive paper by Edland et al.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	65	 (46), with the important exception that the authors of the first paper did not account for potential interactions between IDE and APOE 4-status.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	66	 This may be crucial, since the latter study only found a significant effect of IDE on AD risk in individuals lacking the APOE 4-allele.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Clearly, more studies on independent samples of sufficient size are necessary to further elucidate the potential role of IDE variants on the development of AD in the more general population.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	68	In addition to the IDE locus, a total of four other genes on the long arm of chromosome 10 were found to be associated with AD.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Two of these (CDC2 and VR22) map 30 Mb proximal of IDE, while the other two (GSTO1/2 and PRSS11) map 10 to 30 Mb distal.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	70	 While none of these associations has yet been confirmed in independent AD samples, it is noteworthy that two of these genes were also found to be associated in other neurodegenerative illnesses, frontotemporal dementia (CDC2) (57) and Parkinson's disease (GSTO1/2) (58), potentially suggesting a more common pathway leading to neuronal cell death across these syndromes.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	71	 CDC2 encodes for the cell division cycle 2 protein which is involved in the phosphorylation of both tau and APP, and is found in neurons bearing neurofibrillary tangles.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	72	 GSTO1 and 2 encode for glutathione S-transferase omega-1 and -2, which are involved in the physiological response to oxidative stress, and may in particular be responsible for regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines like IL1-ss.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Thus, while these are all plausible AD candidate genes on positional as well as biological/biochemical grounds, further studies are still necessary to elucidate their proposed roles in influencing the risk and/or age-at-onset for AD in the general population.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	74	Chromosome 11q23 The region near the tip of the long arm of chromosome 11 has been implicated in only one of the full genome screens published to date (8) (and therefore does not appear in Table 1).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Yet, there were a total of three studies showing significant association with an AD candidate gene in 2003: BACE, encoding the ss-site APP cleaving enzyme (ss-secretase) (59 to 61).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	76	 This protein is an excellent AD candidate on biochemical grounds as it is only after the ss-secretase cleavage of APP that Ass can be liberated from its precursor via -secretase cleavage.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Most interestingly and in contrast to all other putative AD associations discussed above there appears to be a high degree of consistency with respect to the site and allelic nature underlying these findings: all positive studies, including the initial report by Nowotny and colleagues published in 2001 (62), observe over-representations of the G-allele of a synonymous SNP located at codon 262 (in exon 5) in AD cases as compared with healthy controls.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Furthermore, in all of these studies the observed effect was most pronounced in carriers of the APOE 4-allele, yielding significantly elevated odds ratios ranging from 2 to 7.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	79	In contrast to these four positive associations, there is an equal number of studies in the literature showing no apparent effects of this BACE polymorphism and AD.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	80	 However, it must be pointed out that one of these only studied early-onset familial AD cases (63), and the remaining studies did not account for the potential interaction with the APOE 4-allele (64 to 66).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Unless this is done, similar to the situation encountered for the variants tested in IDE (see above), no firm conclusions can be reached as to whether or not the exon 5 polymorphism in BACE is a genetic risk factor for AD in these samples.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Thus, of the three known APP-cleaving enzymes and associated proteins [- (ADAM9,10 and 17), ss- (BACE, BACE2) and -secretase (PSEN1, APH1A, NCSTN, PEN2)], most of which have already been tested for genetic association with AD phenotypes, BACE currently shows the most promise of being a genuine and relevant risk factor for late-onset AD.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	83	 As is the case for all other putative AD genes, more studies using sufficiently sized samples and appropriate analytic strategies need to be performed before more general conclusions can be reached.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Note, that the first study examining the putative genetic role of BACE in late-onset AD in 2004 also reports a significant effect of the exon 5 polymorphism in a case-control sample of Chinese origin (67).

0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, July 14, 2004.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	4	ABCA1 is abundant in liver and macrophages, where its expression is induced by agonists of the liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) pathways (10-16).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	5	 ABCA1 is also expressed in both glia and neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), where it is particularly abundant in Purkinje cells and in large pyramidal cortical neurons (10, 17, 18).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Similar to non-CNS cells, ABCA1 is induced by LXR/RXR stimulation in primary neurons, astrocytes, and microglia (18-20).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	7	The importance of lipid homeostasis in the CNS is underscored by the fact that the brain is the most cholesterol-rich organ in the body, and contains 25% of total body cholesterol in only 2% of the total body weight (21).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Nearly all brain cholesterol is synthesized in situ, as quantitative analyses show that essentially no cholesterol crosses the blood-brain barrier (21).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In contrast, the brain cannot degrade cholesterol, and excess cholesterol must be delivered to the peripheral circulation for eventual excretion via the liver.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Approximately 6-7 mg of cholesterol leaves the human brain each day after conversion to 24S-hydroxycholesterol, which easily traverses the blood-brain barrier (22-24).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	11	Glial cells play crucial roles in regulating lipid homeostasis in the CNS.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Astrocytes and microglia are the cells within the CNS that synthesize and secrete apolipoproteins that transport lipids within the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (25-27).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is the major apolipoprotein in the brain, and is also a component of several lipoproteins in the peripheral circulation including HDL, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and chylomicrons (28-30).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In humans, apoE exists as one of three allelic variants that contain either a cysteine or arginine residue at amino acids 112 and 158 (31).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Liver transplantation experiments in humans have shown that the allelic variant of apoE in plasma is converted to that of the donor, whereas apoE in the CSF retains the allelic identity of the recipient, illustrating that CNS and non-CNS apoE pools are synthesized independently (32).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Additionally, brain perfusion experiments in guinea pigs have shown that radiolabeled apoE administered into the peripheral circulation demonstrates very low blood-to-brain transport (33), providing additional support for independent regulation of CNS and non-CNS apoE pools.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	17	 ApoJ is a second major CNS lipoprotein that, unlike apoE, easily traverses the blood-brain barrier and associates with HDL in the periphery (26, 33, 34).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	18	 ApoE and apoJ are synthesized and secreted from astrocytes and microglia, and expression of both apoE and apoJ are induced in response to CNS injury or disease (24, 26).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	19	 ApoE is thought to coordinate the mobilization and redistribution of cholesterol in the repair and maintenance of neuronal membranes and myelin (35-37), whereas apoJ may function as a cytoprotective extracellular chaperone (38).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In contrast to apoE and apoJ, apoA-I is primarily taken up into the brain from outside the CNS, and is believed to be involved in the maturation of lipoprotein particles in the CSF (26, 39).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	21	In 1993, apoE was discovered to be an important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a finding that has now been replicated in over 100 studies.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Inheritance of apoE4 increases the risk of AD in a dosage-specific manner and may act by decreasing the age of onset of AD (40, 41).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In contrast, inheritance of apoE2 appears to protect from AD and is associated with a later age of onset (42).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain how apoE participates in the pathogenesis of AD, including roles for apoE in the formation, deposition, or clearance of the A peptides that constitute amyloid plaques (43-51).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	25	 For example, apoE binds A in vivo and is required for amyloid deposition (50-53).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Furthermore, apoE affects deposition of A in an isoform-specific manner, such that mice expressing human apoE4 develop at least 2.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	27	5-fold more A deposits than mice expressing human apoE3 per unit area (45, 49, 53, 54).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Interestingly, replacement of the murine apoE with any of the human apoE isoforms completely suppresses A deposition compared with wild-type mice expressing endogenous murine apoE (49, 55), suggesting that distinctions between human and murine apoE may play important roles in A deposition and/or clearance.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Compared with apoE, the role of apoJ in AD is less well understood, although it is known that apoJ also binds A and has been suggested to play a major role in transporting A across the blood-brain barrier (33, 34).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	30	Both ABCA1 and apoE have been shown to be induced in response to LXR/RXR stimulation (15, 16, 20, 56, 57) and to be repressed by ZN202 (58) in peripheral macrophages.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Previous work has demonstrated that apoE is a robust acceptor of lipids from ABCA1 (59, 60), raising the question of whether ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux may play important roles in the brain where apoE is a predominant apolipoprotein.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Furthermore, antisense inhibition of ABCA1 has been observed to inhibit the secretion of apoE from monocyte-derived macrophages (61), raising a second question of whether ABCA1 may also regulate apoE synthesis or secretion in other apoE-producing cells such as astrocytes or microglia.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	33	To address these two questions, we sought to determine the relationship between ABCA1, cholesterol efflux and apoE metabolism specifically in glia.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In this study, we report that ABCA1-deficient primary astrocytes and microglia are impaired in their ability to efflux lipids to exogenous apoE, which results in lipid accumulation under normal culture conditions.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Furthermore, lack of ABCA1 expression decreases apoE secretion from glial cells in vitro.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In vivo, this impairment of apoE secretion by astrocytes and microglia results in a decrease in apoE levels by 65% in whole brain lysates of ABCA1-deficient mice, with hippocampus and striatum being the most severely affected regions.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Our observations show that ABCA1 plays key roles in cholesterol transport and apoE metabolism in the CNS.

0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	221	 To address this possibility, apoE levels were compared between total brain extracts prepared from age- and sex-matched wild-type and apoA-I-deficient mice, a model characterized by absent HDL and apoA-I.

0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Additionally, we show that ABCA1 facilitates cholesterol efflux to exogenous apoE in primary astrocytes and microglia, as efflux is reduced in the absence of ABCA1 in both cell types.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	230	 However, both astrocytes and microglia may also contain ABCA1-independent pathways to efflux cholesterol to apoE, as some residual efflux remains in ABCA1-/- cells.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Our findings are in agreement with previous studies showing that macrophage ABCA1 facilitates cholesterol efflux to exogenous apoE (60, 72).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	232	Under the experimental conditions used in our efflux studies, we did not observe marked apoE isoform specificity in a pattern that was consistent between astrocyte and microglial cultures.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	233	 In astrocyte cultures, apoE2 was a slightly less potent acceptor than apoE3 or apoE4, but this trend was not observed in microglial cultures where no significant differences were observed in efflux among any of the apoE isoforms.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Our findings are in contrast to a previous study suggesting that apoE2 elicits more cholesterol efflux than apoE3 or apoE4 (73).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The reasons why our findings differ from previous work are not clear, but may be due to subtle differences in culture preparation or efflux protocol.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	236	In this study, we show that ABCA1 plays a critical role in the secretion of apoE from both astrocytes and microglia.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	237	 These observations confirm and extend a previous study in which ABCA1 was found to facilitate apoE secretion from human monocyte-derived macrophages (61).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	238	 We also demonstrate that ABCA1 is positively correlated with steady-state levels of intracellular apoE as well as with apoE secreted into the medium, both of which are measures of dynamic processes.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Steady-state intracellular apoE levels reflect a balance between apoE synthesis and degradation of both newly synthesized and recycled apoE, whereas secreted apoE levels reflect a balance between apoE released from the cell coupled with reuptake of apoE by apoE receptors that are expressed in both astrocytes and microglia.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Although the mechanisms by which ABCA1 affect apoE metabolism in glial cells are not yet understood, it is clear that lack of ABCA1 impairs the proportion of total apoE that is secreted into the medium in both astrocytes and microglia.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	241	There are several potential mechanisms by which ABCA1 may affect apoE metabolism, which may or may not be linked functionally to lipid efflux.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	242	 ABCA1 is known to cycle between the plasma membrane and late endosomal compartments (74) and, in addition to the plasma membrane, it has been suggested that ABCA1 may efflux cholesterol from late endosomes and lysosomes (65).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Moreover, apoA-I has been recently reported to be internalized and resecreted during ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux (75).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	244	 An increasing body of evidence indicates that internalized apoE does not undergo complete degradation and that it is resecreted (75-77).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	245	 For example, nascent lipoproteins recovered from livers of apoE-/- mice transplanted with wild type bone marrow, a model in which circulating apoE is derived exclusively from macrophages, showed that up to 60% of internalized apoE may be reutilized under physiological conditions (78).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Recently, HDL3 was shown to stimulate the recycling of internalized apoE and to act as an extracellular acceptor for recycled apoE in hepatoma cells (76).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	247	 In this study, apoE recycling was accompanied by cholesterol efflux and involved internalization of HDL3-derived apoA-I and its targeting to endosomes containing cholesterol and apoE (76).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Taken together, these observations suggest the possibility that apoE secretion and recycling may be coupled to cholesterol efflux and that ABCA1 may play a role in this process.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	249	It is also possible to speculate that ABCA1 could influence apoE secretion by affecting trafficking in secretory or recycling pathways.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	250	 In this respect, plasma membrane-associated ABCA1 may have a distinct function compared with intracytoplasmic ABCA1.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	251	 For example, plasma membrane-associated ABCA1 may function to transport cholesterol and phospholipids to various extracellular apolipoprotein acceptors, whereas intracytoplasmic ABCA1 may primarily participate in intracellular lipid trafficking.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Additionally, it is known that apoE requires prenylation in order to be efficiently secreted (79), suggesting the possibility that any impact of ABCA1 on prenylation pathways might also affect apoE secretion.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Although much remains to be learned, our results provide support for a role of ABCA1 in apoE secretion.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	254	 have reported that nascent particles released into conditioned medium from ABCA1-/- astrocytes contain less cholesterol than wild-type particles, suggesting that ABCA1 affects both secretion and lipidation of apoE in the CNS.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	255	In vivo, total apoE levels are reduced by 65% in whole brains of ABCA1-/- compared with wild-type animals, indicating a critical role for ABCA1 in maintaining normal apoE homeostasis in the CNS under physiological conditions.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Loss of ABCA1 affects apoE levels most severely in the hippocampus and striatum, whereas cortex and thalamus are moderately affected by ABCA1 deficiency.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	257	 ApoE levels in the cerebellum are minimally reduced in ABCA1-/- mice compared with wild-type controls.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	258	 We hypothesize that defective secretion of apoE from astrocytes and microglia is a key factor that underlies the reduced apoE levels in vivo.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	259	 In the absence of ABCA1, both astrocytes and microglia secrete less apoE, and the intracellular pool of microglial apoE available for secretion is also lower.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Interestingly, elimination of ABCA1 had no effect on apoJ levels, suggesting that ABCA1 selectively regulates apoE metabolism rather than having a general effect on other brain-derived apolipoproteins.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	261	 To our knowledge, whether deficiency of human ABCA1 results in changes in CNS or CSF levels of apoE has not been determined.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	262	The in vivo reduction of brain apoE levels, coupled with the reduced ability of ABCA1-/- glia to maintain normal levels of cholesterol efflux and apoE secretion in vitro, suggests that ABCA1 deficiency may impair normal brain function, particularly in response to injury or disease.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	263	 ApoE expression is known to be induced in glial cells in response to neuronal injury, where it is believed to participate in lipid transport processes involved in repairing neuronal membranes (36, 80).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Because ABCA1 deficiency results in region-specific reductions in apoE levels in brain, it is possible to speculate that ABCA1 may play a role in recovery from a variety of neurological insults by facilitating lipid mobilization via apoE.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	265	Our observation that ABCA1-/- mice have a significant reduction in apoE levels in brain creates a paradox for predictions about the role of ABCA1 in AD.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	266	 In this study, we provide the first direct evidence that glial ABCA1 affects apoE metabolism in vivo and in vitro.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Reduced levels of apoE in ABCA1-/- brains may predict a greater susceptibility to neuronal injury due to decreased lipid-mediated repair pathways, yet lower levels of apoE may also delay amyloid deposition.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	268	 In addition to glial ABCA1, neuronal ABCA1 may also participate in AD by affecting A generation.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	269	 At present, it is controversial whether ABCA1 increases or decreases A generation, as two in vitro studies reported that increased ABCA1 expression reduced A production (18, 81), whereas a third study reported the opposite finding (19).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Genetic variations in ABCA1 have been reported to alter the susceptibility to AD (82, 83), although additional studies are necessary to fully validate these results.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Clearly, understanding the contributions of ABCA1 to AD will require in vivo studies in which the contribution of glial and neuronal ABCA1 to the pathogenesis of AD can be evaluated in an appropriate physiological context.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	272	In summary, we demonstrate that glial ABCA1 is a key participant in apoE metabolism.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	273	 We show that selective disruption of ABCA1 reduces cholesterol efflux to exogenous apoE and impairs apoE secretion from both astrocytes and microglia.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	274	 As a result, ABCA1-/- glia accumulate lipids under normal culture conditions.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	275	 In vivo, ABCA1 is required to maintain normal levels of apoE in brain.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Further, the effect of ABCA1 is specific to apoE and is independent of HDL and apoA-I levels.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Taken together, our observations provide a clear and direct link between ABCA1 and apoE metabolism in brain.

0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	12	 These results suggest that native preparations of apoE may be a more physiologically relevant substrate for A binding than purified apoE and further underscore the importance of subtle differences in apoE conformation to its biological activity.

0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The major differences between these two studies are the source of apoE (plasma versus secreted by cultured cells) and whether the apoE protein was purified prior to use in the binding assays.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	66	 In this study, we examined whether these differences could account for the discrepancy between these two reports regarding apoE isoform-specific binding to A.

0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	73	 These results are consistent with our previous data that demonstrated that this preferential binding of A to apoE3 is maintained over time, pH range, and concentration of apoE and A (7) .
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Purification of the apoE isoforms from this medium resulted in a decrease in A binding to apoE3 (Fig.

0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	104	 However, when the apoE3 dimer-A complex was taken into account, the total binding of A to apoE3 and apoE4 remained comparable across time.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	105	There are several possibilities that could account for the loss of isoform specificity in the binding of purified apoE to A.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Purification may result in a change in the oxidative state of apoE that influences its binding to A.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Although the apoE isoforms are subject to the same conditions while undergoing purification, oxidation could be specific to the Cysin apoE3.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	108	 This could affect conformation-dependent binding of apoE to A, either directly or via interaction of other amino acids with this residue.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	109	 However, apoE3 dimer, particularly in its purified form, readily binds A, indicating that at least oxidation of cysteine does not seem to adversely affect apoE3 A complex formation.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	110	 In addition, oxidation provides no obvious explanation for the increase in A binding to purified apoE4 monomer.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	111	Another more likely explanation is that apoE acquires a conformation when lipid-associated that confers isoform-specific binding to A.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Purification, which includes delipidation, may increase the binding of A to apoE3 dimer and apoE4 monomer by disrupting the endogenous conformation of these apoE species.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	113	 In each of the unpurified preparations used here, apoE was lipid-associated.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	114	 ApoE from human plasma was in the VLDL fraction, while the majority of apoE in conditioned medium was in a high density lipid fraction.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	115	() Purified apoE has been shown to require lipid to restore its biological activity in other assay systems, presumably by allowing the denatured protein to refold to its functional conformation.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	116	 These apoE activity assays include such diverse functions as receptor binding and modulation of neuritic growth.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	117	 While purified apoE is unable to displace I-labeled low density lipoprotein (LDL) from LDL receptors (16) , high affinity binding is restored when apoE is added in the presence of a variety of lipid particles, including phospholipid vesicles (17) .
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Similarly, the binding of purified apoE to LDL receptor-related protein is enhanced by the addition of -migrating VLDL (18) .
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	119	 In primary dorsal root ganglia cultures, purified apoE3 and apoE4 have no effect on neuritic growth.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	120	 However, when added in the presence of -migrating VLDL, both apoE isoforms affect neuritic growth, with apoE3 increasing neuritic extension and decreasing branching and apoE4 decreasing both branching and extension (19) .
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Experiments are in progress using the assay system described here to determine the nature of the interaction of A with lipid-associated apoE using both endogenous lipoproteins and reconstituted lipid vesicles.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	122	The data presented here are consistent with a function for apoE in the pathogenesis of AD by sequestering A.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Avid binding of apoE3 to soluble A in the neuropil could lead to enhanced clearance or altered fibril formation, both of which could prevent the conversion of A into a neurotoxic species.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Since lipid-associated apoE3 and apoE4 bind the LDL receptor and LDL receptor-related protein with equal affinity (18) , efficient uptake and clearance of A may depend on its preferential binding to apoE3.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Alternatively, purified apoE3 and apoE4 are known to differ with respect to their effect on A fibril formation (20, 21, 22) , suggesting that native apoE may play an even greater isoform-specific role in the extracellular aggregation of A due to differences in A binding characteristics.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Finally, there is evidence that A-induced toxicity in hippocampal neurons is attenuated by the addition of rabbit apoE (23) , leading to the intriguing possibility that human apoE may contribute to A-induced toxicity in an isoform-specific manner.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	127	In summary, using unpurified apoE from tissue culture medium and intact VLDL particles, the apoE3A complex was 20-fold more abundant than the apoE4A complex.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	128	 This isoform specificity was attenuated or abolished when apoE purified from these two sources was used in binding reactions with A.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	129	 ApoE is an apolipoprotein, and as such, its endogenous conformation requires lipid.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	130	 It is therefore not surprising that the type of apoE preparation used can affect the results.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The avidity of A binding to apoE3 compared with apoE4 demonstrated here may be involved in the isoform-specific effect underlying the genetic correlation between the apoE e4 allele and AD.

0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the  Department of Pharmacological Sciences, University Medical Center, State University of New York, Stony Brook, New York 11794 and the   Departments of Immunology and Vascular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	2	Within the central nervous system, apolipoprotein E (apoE) synthesis is increased in response to nerve injury, a finding that may reflect a role for apoE in neuronal remodeling.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Recent studies show that apoE3 promotes and apoE4 inhibits neurite outgrowth in cultured neuronal cells.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Interestingly, these isoform-specific effects are observed only when apoE is presented to cells in the presence of an exogenous lipid source such as rabbit -very low density lipoprotein (-VLDL), making it difficult to discern the biologically active form of apoE or to understand the role of the lipid source.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In the present study we tested whether a cell-derived lipidated form of apoE can alter neurite outgrowth in the absence of -VLDL by constructing Neuro-2a cell lines expressing high levels of apoE.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Our results showed that endogenous apoE3 stimulated neurite outgrowth, whereas the endogenous apoE4 isoform was neutral.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Furthermore, -VLDL antagonized the stimulatory effects of the endogenous apoE3.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Characterization of the secreted apoE3 indicated that the neurite outgrowth-stimulating activity could be recovered from culture medium with an anti-apoE immunoaffinity column and was present in a poorly lipidated particle with a density between 1.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These results indicated that the biological activity of apoE3 in stimulating neurite outgrowth was inherent in the cell-derived apoE particle and was not dependent on either (a) an interaction of apoE3 with an artificial lipid source or (b) independent actions of apoE3 and -VLDL.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	10	Apolipoprotein E (apoE)1 is a 299-amino acid glycoprotein (1) first identified in 1973 as a constituent of human very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and subsequently found in all lipoprotein classes.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	11	 ApoE plays a key role in cholesterol homeostasis by mediating the hepatic clearance of plasma cholesteryl ester-rich VLDL and chylomicron remnants.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In contrast to other apolipoproteins, which are synthesized only in liver and gut, apoE is expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types including abundant expression by steroidogenic cells and astrocytes of the brain (1-4).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	13	 ApoE is present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at 5-10  microg/ml, which is approximately 5-10% of its plasma concentration (5, 6).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The endogenous lipoproteins in CSF are predominantly HDL-like particles that arise from astrocyte-derived apoE in addition to apoAI, which presumably crosses the blood-brain barrier (7, 8).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The role of brain apoE is not known, although its expression appears to be correlated with nerve injury and neuronal remodeling (8-13).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	16	The three common isoforms of human apoE result from cysteine-arginine interchanges at residues 112 and 158 (14).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	17	 ApoE3 contains cysteine at residue 112 and arginine at residue 158.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	18	 ApoE2 contains 2 cysteines, whereas apoE4 contains arginines at these residues.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A correlation between the apoE 4 allele and late-onset familial Alzheimer's disease has been identified (15-17).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, the role of apoE in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease is still unknown.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	21	 There is evidence that apoE interacts with protein components of both pathologic features of Alzheimer's disease (amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) in an isoform- specific manner (18, 19).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In addition, purified delipidated apoE will stimulate isoform-specific differences in neurite outgrowth when added to neuronal cells in culture (14, 20, 21).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	23	 A murine neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro-2a, exposed to delipidated apoE3 has significantly longer neurite extensions when compared with either control cells or cells treated with apoE4 (14).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The delipidated apoE4 isoform has an inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth that correlates with destabilization of microtubular arrays (14).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Interestingly, these isoform-specific differences are only observed when an exogenous lipid source (rabbit -VLDL) is added along with the delipidated apoE isoforms.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Neither the rabbit -VLDL, which contains abundant rabbit apoE, nor the human apoE alone alters neurite outgrowth.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	27	Neuro-2a cell lines expressing low quantities of apoE isoforms display similar isoform-specific differences in the presence of rabbit -VLDL, yet are indistinguishable from control cells that lack apoE expression in the absence of the exogenous lipid source (22).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Multiple lipid sources (VLDL, triglyceride-rich emulsions, HDL, and HDL-like CSF lipoproteins) can substitute for -VLDL to propagate similar isoform-specific differences (21-23).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	29	 However, a puzzling aspect of these studies is that CSF lipoproteins fail to induce a difference in neuritogenesis unless they are enriched with exogenous human apoE (23), even though the CSF HDL-like particles already contain apoE (7, 23).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Importantly, these studies do not identify a physiologically significant or biologically active form of apoE because they require artificial lipid sources to observe apoE-induced stimulated neurite outgrowth.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	31	If apoE-mediated alterations in neurite outgrowth are relevant to neuronal remodeling events in vivo, it is likely that the biologically active form of apoE is a cell-derived, lipidated complex that can act in the absence of -VLDL or other artificial lipid sources.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	32	 To test this possibility we constructed Neuro-2a cell lines that secrete higher levels of the apoE isoforms.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	33	 These cells produced a minimally lipidated apoE3 that stimulated neurite outgrowth in the absence of exogenous lipid.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Under identical conditions, apoE4 had no effect on neurite outgrowth, indicating that the E4 isoform was neutral and not inhibitory.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Furthermore, exogenous -VLDL antagonized the stimulatory effects of cell-derived apoE3.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Thus, these studies identified a minimally lipidated form of apoE that was biologically active in promoting neurite outgrowth.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	37	A high expression apoE3 vector was constructed by inserting a PCR-generated apoE3 cDNA into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen).

0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	252	 These experiments (21, 34) as well as the present results argue that the apoE4 isoform is devoid of neurite-stimulating activity but is not inhibitory when presented to cells alone, in combination with exogenous lipids, or as a cell-derived lipidated particle.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	253	When present in the neurite extension assay, -VLDL antagonized the stimulatory effect of apoE3, an effect that was not detected in previous studies in which -VLDL was required for the effect of delipidated apoE (14, 20-23, 33).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	254	 It may be that in experiments with delipidated apoE, -VLDL acts as a lipid source to facilitate formation of an active apoE particle and at the same time antagonizes the action of the lipidated apoE.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In this case, the level of apoE3-stimulated neurite outgrowth would depend on the balance between these two factors.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Furthermore, it is unlikely that the antagonism observed in the present study is a nonspecific cytotoxic effect because -VLDL alone modestly stimulated neurite outgrowth (111%), an effect also observed by others (14, 20, 22).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	257	 The antagonism by -VLDL may reflect sequestration of secreted apoE or competition at a cellular receptor site.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	258	Cell-derived apoE occurred as a poorly lipidated particle with a density of 1.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Because this minimally lipidated form of apoE was biologically active in the absence of an exogenous lipid source, it was unlikely that the neurite outgrowth stimulation reflects an action of apoE to simply deliver lipid to the cell for membrane formation.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	260	 We speculate that apoE acted extracellularly to direct neurite extension or as a paracrine factor to stimulate neurite growth.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	261	How does the lipidated apoE3 particle stimulate neurite outgrowth although apoE4 remains neutral? The LDL receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) bind apoE containing lipoproteins and are expressed by neuronal cells (35-37).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Evidence from several studies implicate LRP in the apoE isoform-specific stimulation of neurite outgrowth (21, 22, 38).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	263	 In particular, inhibition of the apoE3 effect on neurite outgrowth by anti-LRP antibodies provides strong evidence for the involvement of LRP.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	264	 However, binding studies with the LRP show no isoform-specific differences between apoE3 and apoE4 (27).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	265	 This discrepancy may be resolved by recent reports of other apoE receptors.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	266	 A new apoE receptor has been described which localizes to neurons and has a high homology to the LDL receptor (39).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Additional brain-specific receptors with high homology to the LRP (40) and the LDL receptor (41) also have been identified.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	268	 The present findings that a cell-derived form of apoE3 is active in stimulating neurite outgrowth will permit both physical characterization of the particles and analysis of isoform-specific interactions with these recently described neuronal receptors.

0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	5	 This study was designed to determine whether the decreased antioxidant activity of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 allele could represent a genetic risk factor for the development of left ventricular failure (LVF) in -thalassemia homozygotes.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	6	 A total of 251 Greek -thalassemia homozygotes were studied.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Patients were divided in three groups: group A (n = 151) with no cardiac impairment, group C (n = 47) with LVF, and 53 patients with LV dilatation and normal LV systolic function constituted the group B.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	8	 DNA was obtained from all patients, and the polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the polymorphism at the APOE locus.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The APOE allele frequencies were compared with those of a Greek control sample of 216 healthy blood donors.

0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	16	1-3 More is known about their molecular pathology than any other genetic disease, and it has been possible to trace almost all of the diverse pathophysiologic features back to primary molecular defects in single genes.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	17	4 In monogenic disorders, most of the phenotypic variability is expected to be due to allelic heterogeneity, although siblings with the same genotype can show big phenotypic differences.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The molecular basis of such difference in clinical expression is not yet fully understood.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	19	Homozygous -thalassemia is characterized by severe hemolytic anemia associated with chronic tissue damage, disease- or treatment-related organ failure and premature death.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	20	Heart failure remains the main cause of death and is traditionally attributed to iron overload because of regular transfusions, increased iron intestinal absorption, and ineffective erythropoiesis during the life span of the patients.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	21	5,6 During the last two decades, a striking improvement in life quality and life expectancy has been observed, mainly due to proper transfusion and effective chelation therapy to prevent secondary hemosiderosis.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	22	Regular chelation therapy with deferoxamine mesylate, a naturally occurring trihydroxamic acid produced by Streptomyces pilosus, increases urinary and fecal iron excretion, resulting in amelioration of cardiac dysfunction8,9 and increased survival.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	23	7 Although many patients benefit from this therapy, others continue to have organ dysfunction and die, sometimes despite intensive treatment with deferoxamine.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	24	10 It can thus be hypothesized that either the deferoxamine therapy is not effective in those patients, or they have reduced defense mechanisms against the iron overload.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The present study was designed to test the hypothesis whether a postulated genetically determined decreased antioxidant (and iron binding) activity in some patients with homozygous -thalassemia could represent an independent risk factor for the development of heart failure.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	26	Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a plasma protein with known functions in cholesterol transport and metabolism and Alzheimer's disease.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	27	11,12 The APOE gene is located on chromosome 19, and a polymorphism exists at the APOE locus with the three most common alleles designated 2, 3, and 4, corresponding to three isoforms of the apoE protein.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	28	13 It was recently shown that apoE at physiologic levels has isoform-specific effects in protecting a rat neuronal cell line from oxidative cell death, and that these effects correlated with apoE's antioxidant activity in in vitro assays (ranked E2 > E3 > E4).
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	29	14 The demonstrated metal binding ability (including iron) of apoE was postulated to be one mechanism accounting for its antioxidant properties.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	30	14 We hypothesized that a decreased antioxidant activity of apoE4 in -thalassemia homozygotes might be a genetic risk factor for the development of left ventricular failure (LVF).
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We tested our hypothesis by comparing the frequency of APOE allele 4 in -thalassemia major patients divided into three groups according to their cardiac status with the 4 frequency in a Greek control sample.

0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	79	23,24 The exact mechanism of iron overload toxicity has been uncertain for many years.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Via the iron-driven Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions, the nontransferrin plasma iron, in its bivalent or trivalent form, has a high toxicity through the formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	81	25 This leads to peroxidative damage of membrane lipids and proteins.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Imbalance between production of oxygen free radicals and antioxidant defense mechanisms can result in oxidative stress and human disease.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	83	26 In the heart, the imbalance between free radicals and antioxidant mechanisms is manifested as impaired function of the mitochondrial inner-membrane respiratory chain resulting in abnormal energy metabolism expressed clinically with fatal cardiomyopathy.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Apart from iron overload, it has been recently shown by our group that myocarditis appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of LVF in a certain number of patients with homozygous -thalassemia.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	85	27 As shown in animal models, oxygen free radicals may also contribute to the pathogenesis of infectious myocarditis.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	86	In the present study, we categorized the patients in three groups according to the severity of heart disease.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The normal cases of group A and the severely affected cases of group C had clear clinical and echocardiographic characteristics and were easily distinguished.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Patients of group B were characterized by LV dilatation and good LV function.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In these cases, LV and left atrial (LA) dilatation could possibly represent the first step of LV dysfunction without overt LV decreased contractility, or a compensatory mechanism due to anemia.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Some of these patients will eventually develop LVF.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	91	The results of the functional polymorphism at the APOE locus in our study suggest that the 4 allele may be a genetic risk factor for the development of LVF (and other organ damage) in homozygous -thalassemia.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	92	 It represents the first demonstration of a genetic factor unlinked to the  globin gene cluster contributing to the clinical manifestations of the disease.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The 4 allele could represent a predictive marker for development of LVF in patients with -thalassemia major and LV dilatation (our patient group B), suggesting a closer follow-up of such patients.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	94	 As the APOE 4 frequency was found in only 12.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	95	8% of patients with homozygous -thalassemia and LVF, it is obvious that other genetic and environmental factors, as for instance, the number of transfusions, iron overload, chelation therapy, and viral myocardial inflammation, play a role in the development of organ damage.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The fact that patients in groups B and C, as shown in Table 1, did not have either higher ferritin levels or were transfused more inadequately than those without cardiac impairment, supports the role of APOE 4 allele as a genetic risk factor for LVF development.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Furthermore, some patients of group A with 4 allele could still develop LVF.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Additional evidence for the relationship between the 4 allele and heart disease comes from an analysis of patients homozygous for the 4 allele, of whom three had LVF and one LV dilatation, but numbers in this category are small.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The increase in the 4 allele frequency among patients with cardiac disease comes with a reduction in 3 rather than 2 allele frequency, but the 2 allele frequency is already very low in the Greek population,22 and other factors may influence the level of this allele.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	100	As the APOE 4 allele was found in patients of advanced age with no cardiac impairment, the presence of the 4 allele does not guarantee the development of LVF in -thalassemia.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	101	 In addition, as more than 85% of patients with LVF do not carry the 4 allele, this is neither a necessary prerequisite for the development of LVF.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	102	 This is equivalent to the association of APOE 4 with Alzheimer's disease, where the association has been confirmed in almost 100 studies around the world.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	103	30 A consensus statement on APOE genotyping in Alzheimer's disease concluded that APOE genotyping can be used as an adjunct to other diagnostic tests, but that prospective investigations of dementia as a function of APOE genotype are needed,31 and something similar might apply to -thalassemia.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	104	Allelic variation at the APOE locus has been studied in many populations.

0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Also among Caucasian populations there is a significant variation in the allele frequencies.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	107	32 Average allele frequencies from Caucasians show an 4 allele frequency of 15.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The very low 4 frequency in the Greek population22 is in agreement with the gradient found for the frequency of this allele in Europe, and is supported by a similar low frequency (7.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	109	33 Our finding of an association between the APOE 4 allele and LVF in Greek -thalassemia homozygotes now needs confirmation from other populations using appropriate population controls.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	110	The well-known isoform-specific influence of apoE on plasma cholesterol level and atherosclerosis32 cannot explain the association found between APOE allele 4 and LVF in -thalassemia homozygotes, as atherosclerosis is not a general feature of the pathophysiology of the disorder.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	111	It is recognized now that the severity of a monogenic disorder may be modified by a second locus, depending on the genetic background.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	112	34 Any genes involved in the pathogenic pathway represent candidate modifier genes.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	113	35 The boundaries between monogenic and polygenic disorders might not always be so clear-cut as previously thought,34 as more genes and gene interactions become known from the progress of the Human Genome Project.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	114	The finding of an increased frequency of APOE 4 allele in -thalassemia homozygotes with LVF provides additional evidence to the theory of oxygen free radicals as contributing to the organ damage, due to the recently demonstrated antioxidant and iron binding activity of apoE.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	115	14 This suggests that several other genetic loci could be of potential relevance to the oxidative damage of organs in -thalassemia.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Such loci include genes modulating genesis of oxygen free radicals (ie, cytochrome C oxidase), genes for scavenger enzymes (superoxide dismutases, catalase), genes regulating mitochondrial DNA replication, structural genes for membrane lipoproteins, and genes involved in DNA repair mechanisms.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	117	36 It is noteworthy that mutant mice lacking the Mn-superoxide dismutase enzyme suffer neonatal lethality due to dilated cardiomyopathy.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	118	37 Other functional polymorphisms in such genes could be examined for association with organ failure in -thalassemia.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	119	 It is also believed that genetic susceptibility for a majority of common diseases will be associated with relatively common alleles of one or several loci.

0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	151	Several lines of evidence imply the translocation and localization of the CLN6 protein to the ER.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	152	 First, the CLN6 antigenic sites were found to colocalize with PDI, an established ER marker, but not with the cis-Golgi marker GM130 or with lysosomes stained for CtsD.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Secondly, the CLN6 protein does not undergo proteolytic processing steps.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Thirdly, although it contains no potential N-glycosylation sites, the replacement of the residue isoleucine 153 by serine located in the second proposed luminal loop (amino acid residues 137 to 179) resulted in the addition of an oligosaccharide chain that could be removed by PNGase F treatment.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The mutant CLN6 was also completely sensitive to endo H removing the high mannose ER-type oligosaccharide chains but not complex Golgi-type oligosaccharides.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	156	 These data strongly support the concept of CLN6 residency in the ER.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	157	ER residency of membrane proteins is achieved by retention and/or retrieval mechanisms requiring signal structures and targeting motifs within the proteins.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Thus, ER-resident, type I transmembrane proteins contain a dileucine motif in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, whereas an arginine-containing signal structure functions as targeting signal in some type II membrane proteins (41, 44, 45).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Recent studies have revealed additional ER retention signals such as RXR (R = arginine, X = a large neutral or positively charged residue) (46 to 48).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Furthermore, the oligomerization of proteins mediated by transmembrane and/or luminal domains forming large homodimeric or heteromeric protein complexes might prevent package into transport vesicles and export from the ER (44, 49, 50).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The signal structures responsible for the retention of the polytopic CLN6 in the ER are not known.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Both the N- and the C-terminal domain harbor potential RRR and RKK retention motifs.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	163	 However, the replacement of these motifs by lysine and leucine residues, respectively, did not alter the ER localization of the mutant CLN6.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	164	2 It is also possible that the dimerization reported in this study or the assembly of CLN6 in oligomeric complexes prevents its export from the ER.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	165	The function of CLN6 has not been defined.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	166	 However, the comparable rates of synthesis, sorting, and proteolytic processing of CtsD in CLN6-defective and control cells as well as similar specific activities of two lysosomal enzymes, -hexosaminidase and ASA, suggest that CLN6 does not limit transport of at least three enzymes to the lysosome.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	167	 On the other hand, this study shows that the capability to degrade exogenous arylsulfatase A is strikingly impaired in CLN6-defective cells.

0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	169	 It is probable that the acidic pH-dependent octamerization cannot be completed by endocytosed ASA resulting in increased lysosomal instability (53).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Taking the endocytosed ASA as an index for the delayed degradation in CLN6-defective cells, the results indicate that either specific lysosomal proteases are absent and/or inactive or other lysosomal parameters such as pH or the presence of cofactors are affected.

0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	3	Apolipoprotein (apo) E, a constituent of several lipoproteins, is a ligand for the low density lipoprotein receptor, and this interaction is important for maintaining cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	4	 We have used a gene replacement strategy to generate mice that express the human apoE3 isoform in place of the mouse protein.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The levels of apoE mRNA in various tissues are virtually the same in the human apoE3 homozygous (3/3) mice and their littermates having the wild type mouse allele (+/+).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in fasted plasma from the 3/3 mice were not different from those in the +/+ mice, when maintained on a normal (low fat) chow diet.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We found, however, notable differences in the distribution of plasma lipoproteins and apolipoprotein E between the two groups: -migrating lipoproteins and plasma apoB100 levels are decreased in the 3/3 mice, and the apoE distribution is shifted from high density lipoproteins to larger lipoprotein particles.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In addition, the fractional catabolic rate of exogenously administered remnant particles without apoE was 6-fold slower in the 3/3 mice compared with the +/+ mice.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	9	 When the 3/3 and +/+ animals were fed a high fat/high cholesterol diet, the 3/3 animals responded with a dramatic increase (5-fold) in total cholesterol compared with the +/+ mice (1.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	10	5-fold), and after 12 weeks on this same diet the 3/3 animals developed significantly (at least 13-fold) larger atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic sinus area than the +/+ animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Thus the structural differences between human APOE3 and mouse ApoE proteins are sufficient to cause an increased susceptibility to dietary-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in the 3/3 mice.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	12	Apolipoprotein (apo)1 E is important for the transport of cholesterol and triglyceride throughout the body.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	13	 It is an amphipathic protein that stabilizes the structure of lipoprotein particles via its ability to bind lipid, and it functions as a ligand for lipoprotein receptors, such as the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (1-3).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	14	 ApoE is a major protein component of chylomicron remnants, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL), but it is not present on low density lipoproteins (LDL).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	15	 ApoE is also enriched in a subclass of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and functions as an effective ligand for their binding to the LDLR (4).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	16	The human APOE gene is located on chromosome 19 (5) as part of an apolipoprotein cluster that also includes the genes encoding APOCI, APOCII, and APOCIV (6).

0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	18	 A distal enhancer, the hepatic control region, that is required for liver expression is located 15 kb downstream of the gene (8, 9).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The liver synthesizes approximately 70% apoE found in the body and 20% is found in the brain, and the remainder is synthesized in several tissues including the spleen, lung, heart, ovary, testis, kidney, and skin (10, 11).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	20	Three major APOE alleles, 2, 3, and 4, occur in humans at frequencies of 7.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These three alleles are distinguished by coding differences at positions 112 and 158 (13).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The most common isoform, apoE3, has a cysteine at position 112 and an arginine at position 158; the apoE2 isoform has a cysteine at both positions, whereas the apoE4 isoform has an arginine at both positions.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Functionally, the three isoforms differ in their affinity for the LDLR, with apoE3 and E4 exhibiting 100% binding and apoE2 displaying only 1% normal binding affinity (14).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Despite the lower affinity of apoE2 for the LDLR, individuals homozygous for 2 typically have lower than normal plasma cholesterol levels, except for the fraction of homozygotes (5-10%) who develop type III hyperlipoproteinemia (15).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Individuals homozygous for 4 have higher total plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol compared with 3 homozygotes and are at increased risk for developing coronary artery disease (16).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The 4 allele is also associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (17, 18).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	27	ApoE isoform-specific effects are important in the etiology of atherosclerosis and other diseases, but appropriate animal models to rigorously investigate these effects are currently lacking.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	28	 To date, transgenic animals made by pronuclear injection of human DNA have been used to study these effects, but this method produces mice with varying levels of transgene expression due to differences in chromosomal location and copy number, and expression of the endogenous mouse apoE complicates the interpretation of the data (19-24, 47).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	29	 To overcome these difficulties we have used targeted gene replacement to generate mice that express only the human apoE3 isoform at levels that are in the physiological range.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In these mice the coding sequences for mouse apoE were replaced with sequences coding for human APOE3 without disturbing any of the known regulatory sequences.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This replacement results in animals with expression of human apoE mRNA, identical in tissue distribution and levels, to that of mouse apoE mRNA in wild type animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	32	We here describe the essentially normal cholesterol and triglyceride levels of mice homozygous for human apoE3 (3/3) when maintained on a normal (low fat) mouse chow diet but show that they are markedly more susceptible to diet-induced atherosclerosis than their wild type littermates (+/+).

0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	275	We have successfully replaced the coding sequence of the mouse apoE gene with the equivalent human APOE3 coding region without altering any known endogenous regulatory sequences.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Expression of the human apoE mRNA in the liver, brain, and other tissues parallels that found normally in wild type mice.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Thus, the human APOE3 protein is functional and is expressed at physiological levels in these modified mice, thereby providing a model for studying the function of human APOE3 in vivo.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	278	To date, pronuclear injection of DNA has been used to generate transgenic animals expressing various forms of human APOE to study its role in lipid metabolism (19-24, 47).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	279	 There are three severe limitations to this approach as follows: the number of copies of the transgene can vary over wide ranges; there are marked and uncontrolled differences in the expression of transgenes at different chromosomal locations; and the presence of the endogenous mouse protein complicates the interpretation of the results.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Most importantly, rigorous comparisons between different isoforms are not possible because of the variable expression inherent in conventional transgenic animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	281	Mice made by replacement of the endogenous mouse coding region with the equivalent region of the human gene retain the natural chromosomal context at the apoE locus.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Thus, locus-specific sequences and enhancers are not altered except for any possible intragenic control sequences that differ between mice and humans.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Therefore, it was expected that tissue-specific expression of the human replacement APOE3 gene would closely parallel that of the endogenous mouse apoE gene.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Our mRNA studies show that this expectation was indeed fulfilled, with the exception of intestinal apoE mRNA which was slightly reduced in the 3/3 mice compared with the +/+ mice.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	285	 The significance of this reduction in intestinal expression is not clear, considering that intestinal apoE expression is very low compared with other tissues and that chylomicrons originating from the small intestine are known to contain very little apoE (34, 35).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Differences between the 3/3 and +/+ mice consequently are highly informative as far as function of the apolipoprotein itself are concerned.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Thus, gene replacement demonstrates the advantages over pronuclear injection in generating transgenic animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	288	The lipid profiles of the 3/3 and +/+ mice are very similar when the mice are maintained on a chow (low fat) diet, and the fasting levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol are essentially identical in the two animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	289	 However, when the same mice were fed a high fat diet, the 3/3 animals responded with a 5-fold increase in total cholesterol compared with a 1.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	290	5-fold increase in the +/+ animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Second, after 3 months on a high fat diet, the atherosclerotic plaques seen in all the 3/3 animals were 13-fold larger than those observed in the wild type controls.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Third, there was a 6-fold slower clearance rate of remnant lipoprotein particles in the 3/3 animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	293	 The accumulation of cholesterol and the delayed clearance of remnant particles observed in the 3/3 animals are likely causes of the increased susceptibility to lesion development.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	294	The dramatic delay in clearance of remnant particles in the 3/3 mice was unexpected since previous studies using transgenic mice expressing human APOE have revealed normal or enhanced clearance kinetics (22, 36).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	295	 One possible explanation for the observed delay in clearance is that the human APOE3 protein has a lower affinity to mouse LDLR and/or other receptors than mouse ApoE because of species differences in their structures.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Mouse and human apoE differ in 30% of their amino acid sequences with most of the differences being at the amino and carboxyl termini (1).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	297	 The receptor binding domain (residues 136-160) is highly conserved between mouse and human apoE since 21 of 25 residues are identical in this region including seven residues designated as critical for receptor binding (37, 38).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	298	 The residues that differ have conservative substitutions (e.

0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Thus, it must be ascribed to differences outside the receptor binding domain if the affinity for the receptor differs between the mouse and human apoE proteins.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Species differences in the receptors that interact with apoE, such as the LDLR, and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, could also contribute to a lower affinity.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	302	A dysfunctional interaction between human APOE3 and mouse heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) may also contribute to the delay in clearance.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	303	 It has been postulated that HSPG's are involved in the initial sequestration process that enhances the uptake of apoE containing lipoproteins (40, 41).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	304	 The interaction of apoE with HSPG's is thought to occur mainly via electrostatic attraction (42).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Human APOE3 has a cysteine at position 112 where the mouse protein has an arginine at the equivalent position (mouse apoE residue 104).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	306	 This charge difference could be significant, even though residue 112 is outside the known heparin-binding domain.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	307	The delayed clearance could also be due to protein-protein interactions not involving receptors.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Several proteins are known to interact with apoE and play a role in lipid metabolism.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	309	 For example, the interaction of apoE with hepatic and lipoprotein lipases mediates/or enhances the catabolism of lipoproteins (41).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Lipoprotein particles containing human APOE3 may be less efficient in this type of interaction than mouse ApoE.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	311	 This would have important consequences in the remodeling and processing phase of lipoprotein catabolism.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	312	Another consideration in the clearance experiment is that the exogenously introduced remnant particles have to acquire apoE prior to their removal by receptors.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	313	 In +/+ mice most of the plasma apoE is associated with HDL particles that are presumably the source of apoE used to clear the exogenously added remnants.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	314	 In the 3/3 animals, however, the majority of plasma apoE3 is associated with large lipoproteins and may not transfer as easily to exogenously added particles.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	315	 In support of this, we and others (27) have noted that the distributions of apoE among mouse plasma lipoproteins analyzed by FPLC and by ultracentrifugation do not always agree and that apoE associated with HDL are more readily lost by ultracentrifugation.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Although the capacity for apoE3 to exchange between different classes of lipoproteins has not been documented, the decreased ability of apoE3 to transfer from large lipoproteins may have important implications.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	317	The association of apoE3 with larger lipoproteins in mice (Fig.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	318	 5, A and C) is different from observations made in humans that demonstrate a preference of apoE3 for HDL (1, 43).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	319	 It is very unlikely that this difference is the result of a mutation unexpectedly introduced into the APOE3 gene during its manipulation because in our work2 we observed that transgenic apoE3 mice, in an endogenous apoE (/) background, had a virtually identical apoE3 distribution pattern as seen in the 3/3 replacement mice.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	320	 These mice were made by pronuclear injection of a human cosmid clone isolated from a different individual from the one we used to make our mice (24).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Similar findings were also reported by Taylor et al.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	322	 (44) in transgenic apoE3 mice (that also express mouse apoE) which showed that the majority of human APOE3 resided in larger lipoprotein particles using SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis of fractions separated by sequential density ultracentrifugation.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	323	 In this work the authors also found that mouse ApoE and human APOE co-distributed among lipoproteins.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	324	 This is different from the results of our FPLC analysis of 3/+ heterozygote plasma which shows that approximately half of the mouse ApoE and only a minor fraction of human APOE3 was associated with HDL (data not shown).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	325	 It is not known whether the observed differences between our work and Taylor et al.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	326	 are the result of different techniques used to fractionate the plasma lipoproteins or the result of different levels of human APOE and mouse ApoE expression in the two types of mice.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Further characterization of these large apoE3-rich lipoprotein particles is required to understand the observed delay in clearance in the 3/3 animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	328	The reduced clearance rate of remnant particles in the 3/3 mice, whatever its cause eventually proves to be, is not sufficient to cause any alteration in fasted plasma cholesterol levels in these animals relative to their +/+ littermates when the animals are on a normal chow diet.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	329	 The 3/3 mice are, however, much more susceptible to diet-induced hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis than their +/+ littermates.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	330	 Possibly, on the high fat diet a postprandial accumulation of -VLDL's occurs that leads to the development of atherosclerosis, as suggested by Zilversmit (45).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	331	 In human APOE2 homozygous individuals with type III hyperlipoproteinemia, there is an abnormal accumulation of remnant particles that has been suggested to cause accelerated coronary and peripheral vascular disease (46).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	332	 Even small changes in lipid metabolism that decrease the clearance efficiency of lipoproteins are likely to have dramatic effects on the development of atherosclerosis, and thus the 3/3 animals give us an opportunity to investigate what changes are important.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	333	In conclusion, we have demonstrated the use of targeted gene replacement to generate mice expressing the most common human isoform, APOE3, at physiological levels.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	334	 These mice allow us to document the behavior of the human APOE3 isoform in vivo in mice without any co-expression of mouse apoE.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Future experiments comparing these mice with mice expressing the human apoE2 and E4 isoforms created in an identical manner should prove invaluable for studying diseases related to the different human apoE isoforms.

0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	4	[alpha]2-Macroglobulin (A2M) is a proteinase inhibitor found in association with senile plaques (SP) in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	5	 A2M has been implicated biochemically in binding and degradation of the amyloid [beta] (A[beta]) protein which accumulates in SP.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We studied the relationship between Alzheimer's disease and a common A2M polymorphism, Val1000 (GTC)/Ile1000 (ATC), which occurs near the thiolester active site of the molecule.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In an initial exploratory data set (90 controls and 171 Alzheimer's disease) we noted an increased frequency of the G/G genotype from 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We therefore tested the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is over-represented in Alzheimer's disease in an additional independent data set: a group of 359 controls and 566 Alzheimer's disease patients.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In the hypothesis testing cohort, the G/G genotype increased from 0.

0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The presence of the G allele was associated with an increase in A[beta] burden in a small series.

0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These four proteins have each been genetically linked to Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that they may participate in a common disease pathway.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	16	[alpha]2-Macroglobulin (A2M) is a proteinase inhibitor which inhibits proteinases of all classes by a steric trapping mechanism.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The tetrameric A2M structure undergoes a conformational change upon cleavage of a peptide bond in the bait region by a proteinase and this conformational change traps the proteinase.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	18	 A2M has been implicated in several pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer's disease.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A2M immunostains senile plaques (SP) (1-3) and binds amyloid [beta] protein (A[beta]) 1-42 with high affinity (apparent Kd  <  1.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Moreover, recent data suggest that a serine proteinase-A2M complex can degrade A[beta] (5) and trypsin-activated A2M efficiently degrades A[beta] in vitro and prevents in vitro formation of thioflavin S-positive A[beta] fibrils as well as A[beta]-induced toxicity of cultured human cortical neuronal cells (6).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	21	After being activated, A2M is cleared by the A2M-r/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (A2M-r/LRP).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	22	 A2M-r/LRP is a multifunctional receptor and interestingly is also the primary neuronal apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptor (7,8).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	23	 LRP also binds and clears the Kunitz proteinase inhibitor containing isoforms of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (9).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Thus A2M potentially impacts both apoE and APP metabolism in the brain.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	25	Because of these biological links to Alzheimer's disease, we studied the possible association of a previously reported polymorphism in the A2M gene with Alzheimer's disease.

0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	30	 No difference in A2M serum levels was associated with the two alleles.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This polymorphism is especially interesting because it has the potential to be biologically relevant to the function of A2M as a proteinase inhibitor because it occurs near the thiolester active site of the molecule.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	32	Our initial exploratory experiment tested the possibility that the less common form of A2M (the `G' allele) would be associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Because of the potential for error due to multiple hypothesis testing, we planned to use the initial data set as an exploratory data set, with the intent to formulate specific hypotheses which would then be tested formally in a second independent data set.

0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The results from the second data set supported the hypothesis, with G/G genotype frequencies of 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	50	12 in Alzheimer's disease (P  <  0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	51	05, Fisher's exact test) (Table 1).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The G allele was not over-represented in this data set (control = 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	53	 No difference in age of onset between G/G and non-G/G was found in the second data set.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Multivariate analysis showed that site of collection did not influence genotype frequencies.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	55	 We also compared the rate in controls to the subset of 387 clinic-based Alzheimer's disease cases (G/G frequency = 11.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	56	06) and the subset of 179 familial Alzheimer's disease samples (G/G frequency = 12.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	57	056) and found essentially equal over-representation of G/G in each.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	58	 These data support an association of the G/G genotype with Alzheimer's disease.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	59	We then carried out a series of exploratory analyses using pooled data from all individuals (737 Alzheimer's disease patients and 449 controls).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The G/G genotype was present in 11.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	61	9% of the Alzheimer patients and 7.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The genotype frequency in controls was consistent with a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Age of onset was not different between Alzheimer's disease patients with G/G (70.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	64	2, mean  plus or minus  SD) and non-G/G carriers (70.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	65	 A multivariate logistic model that controlled for the presence of the APOE4 allele and gender showed an odds ratio of 1.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	66	01) for the presence of A2M G/G genotype.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The presence of APOE4 in this model was associated with an odds ratio of 4.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The odds ratio of the combination of G/G and APOE4 is 9.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	69	001) relative to those with neither risk factor.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	70	 To explore whether the G/G-mediated risk was influenced by the presence or absence of APOE4, we stratified the sample by the presence or absence of APOE4.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Similar over-representations of the G/G genotype were seen in the strata with or without APOE4, suggesting that the effects of the two risk factors are independent.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Multivariate analysis for interaction between the G/G genotype and either APOE4 or gender demonstrated no interactions (P > 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Analysis based on the Mantel-Haenszel estimator suggested no heterogeneity of odds ratios between strata with and without APOE4 (P > 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	74	5), consistent with the absence of an interaction between A2M and APOE4 in our logistic regression model.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	75	We next turned our attention to possible biological effects of inheritance of the A2M G/G genotype.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Our previous studies of A2M immunohistochemistry in Alzheimer brain suggested that SP in different cases stained with varying intensity (3).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	77	 We explored the possibility that this variability was due to different genotypes by immunostaining eight Alzheimer's disease cases known to be G/G or A/A genotype.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	78	 In all instances, A2M immunoreactivity was present robustly on SP, astrocytes and neurons and no qualitative differences were observed between the genotype groups.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	79	We also explored what effect inheritance of the A2M G/G genotype had on the neuropathological phenotype of Alzheimer's disease (Table 2).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	80	 We have previously used stereological techniques and quantitative image analysis to measure the amount of A[beta] present (amyloid burden) in the neocortical association area surrounding the superior temporal sulcus and the number of neurofibrillary tangles present in the same region (12).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Thirty one of these previously analyzed Alzheimer's disease cases were A2M genotyped and selected for further analysis.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Initial inspection of the data suggested an increase in A[beta] in individuals who were A/G or G/G, with no difference between these two groups.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	83	 A statistically significant increase in A[beta] deposition was seen when comparing the G-containing cases with the non-G-containing cases (8.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The effect appears to be primarily due to the presence of at least one G allele, in that no difference between A/G and G/G genotypes was observed, although our sample size limits the power of this comparison.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	85	 There were no statistically significant differences in neurofibrillary tangle number with G alleles, suggesting a specific effect on A[beta] deposition.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Neuropathological correlates of the A2M genotype Genotype n Amyloid burden (%) Neurofibrillary tangles ( x 103) A/A 10 6.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	87	Exploratory studies of genetic risk factors run the risk of type I errors because of the large number of hypotheses that are either explicitly or implicitly being tested.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Alternatively, type II errors can occur if sample size is insufficient.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In order to overcome some of the difficulties inherent in exploratory studies of genetic risk factors we used independent data sets to first generate, then test the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Two separate control populations gave identical genotype frequencies; our hypothesis testing data set was itself made up of two groups (sporadic AD and probands from a multicenter study of Alzheimer's disease sib pairs and small families) each of which gave essentially identical genotype frequencies and over-representation of the G/G genotype.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The A2M G/G effect was not dependent on APOE genotype and the effect was additive and substantial: the odds ratio of G/G in the presence of an APOE4 allele showed an almost 10-fold increased risk.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Power analysis using the size of effect observed in our combined data set (using ~500 samples) suggests that a group size of 578 controls and 578 Alzheimer's disease patients would be necessary to have an [alpha] of 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	93	05 and a [beta] of 80% for the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is increased from 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	94	The association of the G/G A2M genotype as a risk factor in Alzheimer's disease leads to several interesting mechanistic interpretations.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Previous data have shown that A2M immunostains SP and have implicated A2M in amyloid precursor protein metabolism (13) as well as possible interactions with binding of A[beta] (4) and mediation of degradation of A[beta] (5,6).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	96	 A2M-A[beta] complexes undergo endocytosis via the A2M-r/LRP receptor (14).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	97	 A2M associates with A[beta] and prevents fibril formation (15).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In addition, A2M can be viewed as a (sub)acute phase reactive molecule and as a potent proteinase inhibitor which might participate in the inflammatory response in Alzheimer brain.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Interestingly, A2M has also been implicated as a trophic factor, possibly as a result of binding and transporting a number of polypeptide growth factors and cytokines (16).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Like apoE, A2M may serve as a binding protein for targeting various bioactive molecules to their site of action or clearing them (3).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Finally, the fact that apoE and APP, two other ligands of the A2M-r/LRP receptor are clearly involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, support the plausibility of the idea that an A2M polymorphism might contribute to risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In fact, a polymorphism in A2M-r/LRP itself has recently been reported in two studies to show a genetic association with Alzheimer's disease (17,18).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	103	Although there is a strong biological rationale for the involvement of an A2M polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease, the possibility remains that the genetic association we observe reflects linkage with another mutation or polymorphism either in the A2M gene itself or in a nearby gene on chromosome 12.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The A2M gene resides ~25 cM distal of the marker D12S1042, which yielded the maximal LOD score in a recent linkage study, suggesting that chromosome 12 contains an Alzheimer risk factor (19).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	105	 However, the likelihood that A2M itself is a risk factor is supported by the results of a recent separate study, in which we observed an association between an intronic (5[prime] splice site of exon 18) pentanucleotide deletion (allele 2) within the A2M gene and Alzheimer's disease in a sibship analysis of Alzheimer's disease sib pairs and small Alzheimer's disease families (20).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Our current results extend this observation by showing linkage of a missense mutation in a case-control sample rather than family-based association.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	107	 We are currently studying how the two A2M polymorphisms relate to one another; our preliminary results are consistent with the hypothesis that they act as independent risk factors.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Initial study of a group evaluated for both polymorphisms suggests that the G allele is inherited with the 1 allele; of 70 G chromosomes examined (35 G/G individuals), 97% were allele 1 and 3% were allele 2, compared with an allele 2 frequency of ~15% (P  <  0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	109	005, [chi]2 analysis with Yate's correction).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	110	Taken together, we believe that polymorphisms in the A2M gene may contribute to risk for Alzheimer's disease.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Moreover, these data focus attention on mechanisms of pathophysiology that impact on A2M-r/LRP or its ligands, including clearance mechanisms mediated by A2M-r/LRP (7,14), and suggest that other A2M-r/LRP ligands may be candidate Alzheimer's disease genes as well.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	112	An initial hypothesis generating data set was established from 171 Alzheimer's disease patients with a clinical history of probable Alzheimer's disease and 90 age-compatible control individuals, who were primarily spouses of the patients.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	113	 A second hypothesis testing data set was collected from several sources in an attempt to approximate the >500 patients and controls estimated by power analysis to adequately test the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is over-represented in Alzheimer's disease.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	114	 These individuals included additional cases of 380 sporadic Alzheimer disease and 337 controls matched for site (primarily cognitively tested spouses) collected from the Massachusetts General Hospital Memory Disorder Unit and from a consortium of European Centers (University of Hamburg, Germany, University of Basel, Switzerland and S.

0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	116	Genomic DNA isolated from brain tissue and blood was amplified by PCR in the presence of oligonucleotide sense primer C23 (5[prime]-ATC CCT GAA ACT GCC ACC AA-3[prime]) and antisense primer AS24 (5[prime]-GTA ACT GAA ACC TAC TGG AA-3[prime]), 10 mM Tris-HC1, 50 mM KC1 (pH 8.

0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	118	 The PCR was carried out in a touchdown procedure that stepped down the annealing temperature to increase primer specificity as follows: one cycle at 94 degrees C for 5 min; four cycles at 94 degrees C for 30 s, 65 degrees C for 30 s, 72 degrees C for 1 min; four cycles at 94 degrees C for 30 s, 62 degrees C for 30 s, 72 degrees C for 1 min; four cycles at 94 degrees C for 30 s, 59 degrees C for 30 s, 72 degrees C for 1 min; 20 cycles at 94 degrees C for 30 s, 56 degrees C for 30 s, 72 degrees C for 1 min; one cycle at 72 degrees C for 5 min.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	119	In each reaction mixture, MboI was added to the amplified product of 615 bp and digestion carried out at 37 degrees C for 3 h, producing fragments of 532 (G allele) or 429 bp (A allele).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	120	 The digested product was loaded onto a 2% agarose gel treated with ethidium bromide (0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	121	005%) and electrophoresed for 2 h under constant voltage (150 V), which is sufficient to separate the digested product so that the 532 and 429 bp bands can be distinguished.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	3	The three isoforms are encoded by one gene and differ at one or two amino acid sequence positions.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	4	 ApoE3 has a cysteine at position 112 and a arginine at 158, and apoE2 has cysteines and apoE4 has arginines at both positions (14).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	5	 These sequence differences result in structural and biophysical properties that alter function and hence likely affect disease.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In apoE4, the two modular domains interact in a unique manner known as domain interaction (15-17).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Arg-112 in apoE4 causes the Arg-61 side chain to adopt a different conformation than it has in apoE2 and apoE3, allowing it to form a putative salt-bridge with Glu-255 in the carboxyl-terminal domain (16, 18).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	8	The isoforms also differ in the conformational stability of the amino-terminal domains, which unfold independently from the carboxy-terminal domain and contain the isoform-specific sequence differences (19-22).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The amino-terminal domain of apoE4 is the least resistant to chemical and thermal denaturation and that of apoE2 is most resistant (20, 22).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The amino-terminal domain of apoE4 also most readily forms partially folded intermediates that have characteristics of a molten globule state (21).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	11	Increasing evidence indicates that molten globules are common and mediate a wide variety of physiological processes, including translocation across membranes, increased affinity for membranes, binding to liposomes and phospholipids, protein trafficking, extracellular secretion, and cell cycle regulation (23).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	12	 As one explanation for functional differences among the isoforms in vivo, we and others have suggested that partially folded intermediates provide apoE with greater conformational adaptability to bind to phospholipids (21, 24).

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Gene targeting was used to replace the threonine at the mouse equivalent of position 61 with an arginine (T61R), which resulted in an apoE4-like lipoprotein binding preference (25), a characteristic of domain interaction.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	15	 However, unlike apoE4, T61R mouse apoE folds highly cooperatively and lacks apparent folding intermediates.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	16	 To gain in-sight into how differences in isoform stability affect phenotype and disease, we sought to introduce into T61R mouse apoE the reduced folding stability characteristic of apoE4.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	52	Although the amino-terminal domain of mouse apoE, like that of apoE4, forms a four-helix bundle, there are structural differences.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Alignment of the mouse and human structures along helices 1 and 2 shows that relative to apoE4 helices 3 and 4 (of the amino-terminal domain) of mouse apoE are shifted in a direction roughly parallel to the helical axis of helix 3.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	54	 In addition, helices 1, 2, and 4 are longer in mouse apoE than in apoE4.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	55	 A crystal contact at residue 20 in mouse apoE likely stabilizes the extension of helix 1; in apoE4 no such contact occurs.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	56	 A crystal contact at residue 126 of mouse apoE, which is not seen in apoE4, likely influences the structure of the loop between helices 3 and 4 (residues 120-130).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	57	Two Structural Differences at Positions 83 and 113 Are Mediated by Sequence Differences After exclusion of the crystal contact sites, two key structural differences result from the sequence differences.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The loop between helices 2 and 3 (residues 81-86) forms a tight turn in mouse apoE but is more extended and relaxed in all crystal structures of human apoE (33).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	59	 This difference reflects the cis conformation of Gly-83 in mouse apoE, which cannot be sterically accommodated by Thr-83 in apoE4 (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	60	 In mouse apoE, helix 2 has one more helical turn than apoE4, and the dipoles of helices 2 and 3 are less parallel (Fig.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	66	  The other major difference is at residue 113, where mouse apoE contains asparagine, and apoE4 contains glycine (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Asn-113 in mouse apoE lies in a straight portion of helix 3, but the Gly-113 in apoE4 lies at a pronounced kink and cannot form the same hydrogen bond with Arg-112 that is formed by Asn-113 in mouse apoE (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The result is a reduced local hydrogen bond network (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In addition, because glycines have high configurational entropy, localized flexibility in the middle of helix 3 caused by Gly-113 may account for the lower stability and greater propensity of apoE4 to form partially folded intermediates.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The net effects of both sequence differences at positions 83 and 113 are a greater stabilization of helix 3 and a more parallel alignment of the dipoles of helices 2 and 3 in mouse apoE than in apoE4 (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Thus, these data suggest that these two sequence differences contribute to the differences in the human and mouse urea denaturation curves.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The urea denaturation curves showed that the mutants unfolded in urea more readily than T61R mouse apoE and that the mutations had additive effects in destabilizing the conformation (Fig.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	82	 We introduced apoE4 residues at Q52L and/or H123Q, which occur at sites of crystal contacts, or apoE4 residues M114L and M149L together, which correlate with differences in the packing of the core into T61R mouse apoE.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	83	 These mutations had only marginal effects on the urea denaturation curves (data not shown).

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Introducing the apoE4 residues G94S and N120G or the group of residues N23G, G94S, N120G, P25R, G116V, and Q28L slightly reduced folding cooperativity and stability (Fig.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	88	 This suggests that the additional eight residues in apoE4 play a minor role in stability.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In contrast to mutations G83T and N113G, this collection of seven group mutations have minor effects on the urea denaturation curve.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Upon binding to DMPC vesicles, apoE forms smaller apoE DMPC particles, thereby decreasing the turbidity of the solution (36).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Of the human isoforms, apoE4 clears the turbidity fastest, followed by apoE3 and apoE2 (21).

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	101	This new model of apoE4 will be useful for testing and exploring the cooperative or additive effects of both domain interaction and a lower stability.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Furthermore, because T61R introduces domain interaction into wild-type mouse apoE, a mouse model specific for apoE4-reduced stability but without domain interaction can be made by the mutation E255A (16).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	103	For several other proteins, mutations or conditions that destabilize the native conformation also facilitate the formation of aggregates with properties of amyloid fibrils, which consist of an ordered polymer of -strands (37-39).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Thus, the destabilization of the compactly folded state of apoE, although advantageous for lipid binding, may predispose misfolding into amyloid fibrils.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	105	 This could provide a basis for amyloid formation because amyloid plaques in brains of Alzheimer patients show apoE immunoreactivity (40, 41).

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	4	Received for publication, December 26, 2002, and in revised form, February 14, 2003.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	5	Apolipoprotein E (apoE)1 is a critical ligand for several hepatic lipoprotein receptors, including the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), and for cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (1-3).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Through its interaction with these receptors and with the HSPG-LRP pathway, apoE mediates the catabolism of remnant lipoproteins (4, 5).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In the HSPG-LRP pathway, apoE is postulated to interact initially with cell-surface HSPG and then to transfer to the LRP for internalization (6, 7).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Therefore, the interaction of apoE with HSPG is an initial step in the clearance of apoE-containing lipoproteins from the plasma.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The apoE-HSPG interaction is also involved in the differential effects of the apoE isoforms on neurite outgrowth (8, 9), the existence of a pool of newly secreted apoE on the cell surface (10-12), and the inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated smooth muscle cell proliferation (13).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In addition, several studies suggest that binding of apoE to HSPG may be involved in Alzheimer's disease (5, 14, 15).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	11	ApoE, a 299-amino acid, single chain protein, contains two independently folded functional domains, a 22-kDa N-terminal domain (residues 1-191) and a 10-kDa C-terminal domain (residues 222-299) (2, 16).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The N-terminal domain exists in the lipid-free state as a four-helix bundle of amphipathic -helices and contains the LDL receptor binding region (residues 136-150 in helix 4) (17).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The amphipathic nature of the -helix containing residues 136-150 is critical for normal binding to the LDL receptor (18).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Our recent studies using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) demonstrated that Lys-143 and Lys-146 have unusually low pKa values because of local increases in positive electrostatic potential associated with the region surrounding residues 136-150 (19, 20).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The C-terminal domain is also predicted to be a highly -helical structure and contains the major lipid binding region (21, 22).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The detailed molecular features of the -helices in the C-terminal domain are poorly understood.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	17	The N- and C-terminal domains each contain a heparin binding site (23, 24).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The N-terminal domain site is located between residues 142-147 and overlaps with the receptor binding region (24).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In fact, the HSPG binding activity of apoE variants is significantly decreased by mutations of Arg-142, Arg-145, and Lys-146, indicating that these basic amino acid residues contribute to heparin binding (25).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	20	 A recent study on the interaction between a heparin-derived oligosaccharide and the N-terminal domain of apoE4 found that Arg-142 and -145 form salt bridges with sulfate groups from the octasaccharide fragment (26), consistent with a dramatically reduced binding affinity of apoE4(R142C) and apoE4(R145C) mutants for HSPG (25).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This study also predicted additional interactions between the heparin fragment and Lys-143, Lys-146, and Arg-147.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Most recently, a site-directed mutagenesis study showed that Arg-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Arg-147 are required for high-affinity binding to heparin, with Lys-146 participating in an ionic interaction with the heparin fragment and Lys-143 participating in a hydrogen bond (27).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	23	Materials-- 1,2-dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Pelham, AL), and stock solutions were stored in chloroform/methanol (2/1) under nitrogen at 20  degrees C.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The time-proportional phase-increment method was used to obtain phase-sensitive spectra.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Chemical shifts and line widths for lipid-protein complexes were measured as described (19, 31, 32).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The chemical shifts of [-13C]dimethyl lysine and [-13C]dimethyl terminal amino residues of the complexes were determined as a function of pH.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The pKa values of the [13C]dimethyl lysines were obtained by nonlinear regression fitting of the chemical shifts at different pH values to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) (19, 20).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The sigmoidal equation is Y = (U + W  x  10(X-Xc))/(10(X-Xc) + 1) where Y is the chemical shift, U is the lower limit of the shift, W is the upper limit, X is pH, and Xc is pKa.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	58	Binding of ApoE to Heparin-- The binding of apoE to heparin was assayed using a centrifugation method (24, 33).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	59	 ApoE samples were 14C-labeled to a specific activity of ~1  microCi/mg protein by reductive methylation of lysines with [14C]formaldehyde as described (19, 29, 31).

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	66	pKa Values of Lysines in Full-length ApoE3-- Previously, we used two-dimensional NMR spectra of [13C]dimethyl lysines to study the microenvironments of the eight lysine residues in 22-kDa apoE-DMPC complexes (19, 20).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	67	 In this study, application of a higher field (600 MHz) NMR spectrometer enabled us to evaluate the microenvironments of all 12 lysine residues of full-length apoE3 because of the enhanced resolution of the resonances in the NMR spectrum.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	79	 As expected, the pKa values for eight lysines in the N-terminal domain of full-length apoE3 were the same as those for the 22-kDa fragment of apoE3 reported previously (19).

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	81	 This suggests that Lys-233 may behave similarly and be part of the heparin binding region in the C-terminal domain.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The binding of the 10-kDa fragment to heparin was saturable and depended on the salt concentration (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	85	 The dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated to be 26  microg/ml at 50 mM NaCl and 76  microg/ml at 150 mM NaCl, consistent with a previous report (24).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The maximal binding capacities at both concentrations were similar and corresponded to about 140-170 g of protein/g heparin.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	87	 In contrast, apoA-I did not bind to heparin even at low salt concentration.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	88	 These results indicate that the interaction between the 10-kDa fragment and heparin is electrostatic (36, 37) and the amphipathic characteristics common in helical apolipoproteins (38) are not responsible for heparin binding.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	97	The basic residues (arginine and lysine) in the heparin binding region of the N-terminal domain are key to the interaction with heparin (26, 27, 39).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	98	 We compared the heparin binding activities of the three lysine mutants (K233Q, K242Q, and K262Q) of the 10-kDa fragment to identify the heparin binding site in the C-terminal domain of apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	99	 3, a large decrease in heparin binding was observed only for the 10-kDa (K233Q) variant (maximal binding capacity was 31% of the wild-type 10-kDa fragment) without a change in binding affinity (Kd values for both were 76  microg/ml).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Of the four lysines in the C-terminal domain, only Lys-233 showed a relatively low pKa value (Table I), suggesting that an unusually basic microenvironment around Lys-233 is critical for the interaction between the C-terminal domain and heparin.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	105	 In the lipid-free form, full-length apoE and the 10-kDa fragment bound to heparin with similar affinities, whereas the 22-kDa fragment bound to heparin with much lower affinity (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	106	 When complexed with DMPC, the heparin binding of the 10-kDa fragment was completely abolished, indicating that the C-terminal binding site is masked by lipids (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Instead, the lipidated 22-kDa fragment bound to heparin with high affinity and rather better than full-length apoE.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Although the binding capacity of lipidated full-length apoE3 was much lower than that of the lipid-free form, the binding affinity of full-length apoE3 in both states was similar (Kd for the lipid-free and lipidated forms were 157 and 210  microg/ml, respectively), consistent with the previous observation using surface plasmon resonance analysis (37).

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The mutated proteins were apoE(K146Q) and apoE(K146E), which have N-terminal domains that bind defectively to heparin (27), and apoE3(K233Q) and apoE3(K233E), which are thought to have low heparin binding capacity through the C-terminal site.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Large decreases in heparin binding were observed with apoE(K146E) in both the lipid-free (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	117	 5A) and the DMPC-complexed forms (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	118	 5B), indicating that Lys-146 contributes greatly to the heparin binding of full-length apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	119	 5, A and B, the lipid-free apoE(K146Q) exhibited a much smaller decrease in heparin binding than wild-type apoE3, and apoE(K146Q)-DMPC complexes bound to heparin in a similar manner to the lipid-free form.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	120	 This disparity between apoE(K146E) and apoE(K146Q) variants is probably because of the ionization state of the glutamate residue at pH 7.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	121	4 that is responsible for the difference in the heparin binding activities (27).

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	125	 The data of wild-type apoE3 (dotted line) are also shown for comparison.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	126	In contrast, the K233Q mutation had no effect on the heparin binding activity of either the lipid-free or the lipidated form.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	127	 In the case of the apoE3(K233E) variant, a small decrease in heparin binding was observed in the lipid-free form; complexing with DMPC had virtually no effect on the heparin binding ability of this variant (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	128	 5, C and D), suggesting that the Lys-233 site is unavailable for heparin binding of full-length apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	129	 For wild-type apoE and the apoE(K146E) and apoE(K233Q) variants, the heparin binding of free protein differs from that of the protein-DMPC complexes.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Binding to DMPC results in the opening of the four-helix bundle in the N-terminal domain of apoE (40-42).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Therefore, it is likely that these apoE variants have subtle differences in their final conformations on the DMPC disc that may modulate their heparin binding properties (27).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	132	 This may be the reason why the lipidated K146Q and K223E variants bind somewhat more to heparin than wild-type apoE3.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	133	To further explore the role of the C-terminal domain in the heparin binding of apoE, we used apoE (1-260), a C-terminal truncated variant that is monomeric rather than tetrameric in aqueous solution (21).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Although the C-terminal heparin binding site is conserved in this variant, the heparin binding of apoE (1-260) was significantly lower than wild-type apoE3 and close to that of the apoE3 22-kDa fragment (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	135	 This indicates that tetramerization through the C-terminal domain has a major influence on the heparin binding ability of the lipid-free apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	136	 We also measured the binding of the 12-kDa apoE fragment (2) to heparin to investigate whether the hinge region plays a role in the heparin interaction of the C-terminal domain.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Surprisingly, the heparin binding ability almost disappeared for the lipid-free 12-kDa fragment (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	138	 6), suggesting that the hinge region may mask the heparin binding site of the C-terminal domain.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	139	The interaction between apoE and HSPG is important in several processes, such as lipoprotein remnant clearance (5, 43) and neurite outgrowth (3, 14).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	140	 ApoE has at least two heparin binding sites located between residues 142 and 147 in the N-terminal receptor binding region (24) and less well defined sites in the C-terminal lipid binding region (23, 24).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The N-terminal site has recently been characterized using apoE4 22-kDa fragments and an enzymatically prepared heparin oligosaccharide; Arg-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Arg-147 within this site are involved in the interaction with the heparin fragment (27).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In this study, using site-directed mutagenesis we identified Lys-233 as a key lysine residue in the C-terminal site and also estimated the relative contributions of both sites to the heparin binding of full-length apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Earlier studies using either synthetic apoE peptides or blocking monoclonal antibodies suggested that residues 211-218 (23) and 243-272 (24) contain heparin binding sites.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	144	 The former site is not a factor in the observed binding of the C-terminal 10-kDa fragment to heparin because it is not included in this domain.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	145	 It is also not functional in the 12-kDa fragment because this does not bind to heparin (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Presumably, the small peptide containing residues 211-218 (23) can bind because its conformation is different from when it is present as part of the apoE molecule.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	147	 It is possible that Lys-233 is part of the heparin binding site identified by a blocking antibody with an epitope located between residues 243-272 (24); the presence of the antibody may interfere with the functionality of Lys-233.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	148	Our NMR results imply that among all 12 lysines of full-length apoE3, Lys-143 and -146 in the N-terminal domain and Lys-233 in the C-terminal domain have unusually low pKa values, indicative of high positive electrostatic potential around these residues.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Previous studies showed that this greater positive electrostatic potential around Lys-143 and -146 is involved in the high-affinity binding of the N-terminal domain of apoE to the LDL receptor and heparin.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	150	 In this study, we demonstrated that residue Lys-233 is critical for the heparin binding of the C-terminal domain (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	151	 3), indicating that an unusually basic lysine microenvironment in the C-terminal domain is also involved in the heparin interaction.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	152	 In an amphipathic -helix spanning this region, the basic residues Arg-226, Lys-233, and Lys-240 are aligned, two turns apart, along one side of the helix.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	153	 It is interesting that there are several acidic residues in the amino acid sequence near Lys-233, but they are mostly located on the opposite side of the amphipathic -helix.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Consequently, they do not reduce the positive electrostatic potential around the side chain of Lys-233.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	155	Comparison of the heparin binding abilities of full-length apoE3 and its 22- and 10-kDa fragments yields interesting insights.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	156	 In the lipid-free state, the 10-kDa fragment binds to heparin with higher affinity than the 22-kDa fragment (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	157	 In contrast, the heparin binding of the 10-kDa fragment was completely abolished when complexed with lipid (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	158	 4B), consistent with previous observations showing that the C-terminal site is only available for interaction in the lipid-free state (24, 44).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The C-terminal domain of apoE forms a stable tetramer and is responsible for self-association of apoE in aqueous solution, whereas the N-terminal domain is primarily monomeric (16).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Therefore, the stronger interaction of the C-terminal domain with heparin appears to be because of its tetramerization.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	161	 6, the heparin binding affinity of the apoE3 (1-260) variant, which is monomeric in solution, is much lower than that of wild-type apoE3 and is comparable with that of the 22-kDa fragment, indicating that tetramerization through the C-terminal domain is crucial for the heparin binding ability of the lipid-free apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Multiple sequences of heparin binding peptide enhance heparin binding through cooperativity effects (45).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Similarly, multiple copies of the receptor binding domain are necessary for the high affinity interaction of apoE with the LDL receptor (46, 47).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	164	 In this regard, the different binding affinities of full-length apoE3 and the 22-kDa fragment in DMPC discs (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	165	 4B) may be explained by the difference in cooperativity arising from different numbers of the N-terminal domain per particle.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	166	Despite the strong heparin binding ability of the 10-kDa fragment, the C-terminal site of full-length apoE3 does not appear to be involved in the heparin binding of lipid-free apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	167	 5C, there were only small differences in heparin binding among the lipid-free wild-type apoE3, apoE3(K233Q), and apoE3(K233E) variants, suggesting that, even in the lipid-free state, only the N-terminal site is involved in the heparin interaction of full-length apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	168	 It is not clear why the C-terminal site of the lipid-free apoE is unavailable to interaction with heparin.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	169	 One possible explanation is that the heparin interaction of the C-terminal domain is sterically hindered by the hinge region (residues 192-215), which acts as a spacer connecting the two domains.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Indeed, the 12-kDa fragment, which contains both the 10-kDa domain and the hinge region, bound defectively to heparin (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Thus, interaction between the 10-kDa domain and the hinge region might mask the C-terminal heparin binding site (the basic residues around Lys-233), preventing interaction with heparin.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	172	 A recent fluorescence resonance energy transfer study of apoE3 indicates spatial proximity between the N- and the C-terminal domains in the lipid-free state, with the hinge region tethering the N-terminal domain close to the C-terminal domain (48).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	173	ApoE-containing high density lipoproteins bind to the proteoglycan, biglycan, in arterial walls, and apoE is thought to act as a bridging molecule that traps these particles in atherosclerotic intima (49).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	174	 This binding interaction between apoE and biglycan was shown recently to occur via the C-terminal domain in which the charged residues, especially lysine and arginine between residues 223 and 230, are involved in the binding (50, 51).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	175	 The results of the present study suggest that the unusually basic microenvironment around Lys-233 contributes to the apoE-biglycan interaction.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Recent studies demonstrated that C-terminal fragments of apoE are complexed with amyloid in the brain (52, 53) and that C-terminal-truncated forms of apoE occur in Alzheimer's disease (54).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The presence of apoE proteolytic fragments in vivo raises the possibility that the C-terminal fragment may contribute to Alzheimer's disease by interaction with HSPG in the brain.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	178	In conclusion, we have identified the heparin binding site of the C-terminal domain of apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Our data show that the basic residues around lysine 233 are critical for the heparin binding of the C-terminal domain but are unavailable for heparin binding in full-length apoE even in the lipid-free state.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Thus, it seems that lipid-poor apoE associates with cell surface HSPG only through the N-terminal domain, leaving the C-terminal domain available for binding to lipoprotein particles.

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, there was an association between relative 4 allele frequency in controls and APOE 4 effect (ss =  to 0.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In relation to assumption (a) there is substantial variation in relative APOE allele frequencies (4 to 21%), with considerable heterogeneity evident within geographically proximate populations, population admixture is likely to have resulted in changes in allele frequency over time, and assumption (b) APOE related causes of death are context specific and have changed considerably over the last 30 years.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	9	Conclusion The validity of case-control type studies of the genetic basis of longevity based on the above assumptions is questionable, especially when considerable differences exist in allele frequency by population and when the genes in question interact with environmental factors, which vary by time and place.

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	11	Twin studies of longevity suggest that around 25% of the variation in lifespan in developed countries may be inherited.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	12	1 Understanding the heritability and consequently the biological processes involved in ageing and longevity is one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In the post genomic era and with large DNA resources becoming available within epidemiological studies, we are better placed than ever before to begin to unravel this complex problem.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	14	Epidemiological studies are widely used to look for genes conferring risk to common multifactorial diseases by comparing genotype distributions in cases and controls.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	15	2 More recently case-control designs have been used to identify differences in genotypes or allele frequencies of elderly compared with younger populations.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	16	3,4 Centenarians are typically studied, as these represent survivors, who may lack disease susceptibility genes and genes associated with premature mortality.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	17	 However, specific methodological problems are inherent in studies comparing populations across time periods, which although alluded to in several reviews, have not been adequately addressed in study designs to date.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	18	 We argue that previous claims resulting from these studies may be flawed because they are based on the following assumptions: (a) initial relative allele frequencies in the different age groups are similar, and (b) the risk of mortality conferred by genotype does not depend on year of birth.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	19	Further, due to secular trends in common disease incidence and changes in patterns of exposure to environmental risk factors such as smoking, genetic associations found in such studies are unlikely to contribute to a blueprint for future longevity, unless improvements are made to the methodology used.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	20	 An indication of the type of changes needed is provided in the concluding section of this paper.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	21	It is likely that many genes contribute to longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Candidate genes can be selected from either: (1) those genes implicated in general processes of cellular maintenance and repair, such as superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), which is involved in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis; or (2) genes which confer an increased susceptibility to age-related diseases such as apolipoprotein E (APOE), a gene involved in lipoprotein metabolism and a proposed risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) and Alzheimers disease.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	23	7,8 Since most genetic studies of longevity to date have been of the second type, this paper will focus on studies of disease-risk genes.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	24	Initial gene frequencies in the age cohorts represented in a longevity study are likely to be different and not necessarily represented by frequencies in the younger/control population Population stratification Genetic association studies have received a large amount of negative press recently, mainly due to the lack of repeatability of results and the opportunity for spurious results.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	25	2,9 to 12 One reason for these problems is population stratification and this phenomenon is pertinent to studies of longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Whilst genuine differences between elderly cohorts and younger individuals may exist due to the role of genes in longevity, artefactual results of genetic effects may also arise due to variations in initial relative allele frequency between the two comparison groups, as a result of population admixture.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Although novel mutations are infrequent and diffuse slowly, because the interval between human generations is long, the gene pool of a given population can change considerably in a relatively short period as a result of geographical mobility, ethnic admixing, and selective mating.

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	32	13 Since migration among young adults tends to be for work or education, net inflows are often concentrated in cities, where genetic association studies may be based.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In England the highest levels of in-flow are in the South East.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	34	3% of residents classified themselves as white but not British or Irish in the 2001 census.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	35	13 Whilst genetic association studies usually collect data on ethnic group, they rarely distinguish between Caucasians and hence group together individuals with different countries and regions of origin.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	36	Migration within countries, so that individuals are better placed for work and health care may also have played a role in population mixing over the last century.

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	41	 By addressing the first assumption we are in effect also addressing this dynamic.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Aside from changes in population genetic structure, environmental risk factors for disease have changed considerably during the last 100 years and two populations who were born only a few decades apart are likely to have been exposed to a very different pattern of stressors.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	43	 For this reason such populations will have different susceptibilities to disease regardless of genotype.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Environmental risk factors are unlikely to change the population distribution of genetic variants; unless they offer strong selection against a particular allele in childhood and reproductive years.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Therefore secular trends in genetic susceptibility to diseases of the elderly are not confounded by environment, but rather the environment acts as an effect modifier.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	46	Life expectancy doubled in the first half of the 20th century, largely due to a reduction in malnutrition and childhood infection.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer, which occur later in life, then became the major causes of death in developed countries.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	48	16 This shift in causes of mortality (the epidemiological transition) occurred over a relatively short period.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	49	 It has been suggested that the rise in CHD and cancer incidence in Western countries is a consequence of ageing populations.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	50	 However, the increase in rates of mortality from cancer which took place among men in Britain from 1921 to 1960 can be largely attributed to lung cancer, for which smoking is the main environmental cause.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	51	17 Levels of smoking in Britain reached a peak in the 1960s, followed by a steady decline, although approximately 30% of the adult population continue to smoke (Figure 1)16.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Similarly, national CHD mortality rates rose and fell during the past century.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Deaths from CHD reached a peak in many westernized countries in the 1970s and are now declining (Figure 2).
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	54	18 Hence disease risks have changed over time, because levels of exposure to major environmental causes have changed.

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Patterns of availability and exposure to many of them have changed enormously, with secular socio-economic and cultural trends, over the last 100 years, as we have seen in the case of smoking.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Treatment for disease may also have an impact on mortality rates and will depend on the disease and the year that it is contracted.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	60	APOE and longevity Possibly the most extensively studied gene in relation to longevity is APOE.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The protein encoded by this gene is a ligand for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, other receptors in the LDL receptor gene family, and cell matrix-associated heparin sulphate proteoglycans.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The gene plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism, and has been shown to be associated with CHD risk.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	63	7,19 Three common polymorphic forms of APOE are known to exist: 2, 3, and 4.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The various APOE isoforms produced as a result of this polymorphism interact differently with specific lipoprotein receptors, ultimately altering circulating levels of cholesterol.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	65	 High LDL cholesterol levels are associated with APOE 4 and low levels with APOE 2, with APOE 3 levels being intermediate between the two.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	66	19 The APOE 4 allele has also been associated with an increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	67	8 Although the mechanism is not entirely clear, this association could be due to: (1) effects on amyloid-ss metabolism, (2) effects on neurons or glial cells, including neuronal survival and neurite extension, or (3) effects related to atherosclerosis, cerebral blood flow, or the blood to brain barrier.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	68	19 Since CHD and Alzheimer's disease are common disease of old age, APOE has become a candidate gene for studies of longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Several studies comparing APOE genotypes in elderly versus younger populations have been carried out20 to 34 and an overview of the literature by Gerdes et al.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	70	28 found APOE 4 to be associated with premature death.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	71	To determine how inaccurate assumptions of initial APOE allele frequencies among elderly populations may influence the outcome of gene association studies, and whether any increased risk of mortality conferred by the APOE gene depends on year of birth, and to determine whether published studies have addressed these problems, we carried out a review of all studies comparing APOE allele frequencies in elderly versus younger populations.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	72	Statistical methods Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) were based on published allele frequencies and were calculated, as the proportion of 2 alleles and 4 alleles, in elderly versus control populations using relative 3 allele frequencies as a reference.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The effect of the APOE allele has been shown to be dependent upon genotype.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	74	35,36 However, the expected relative frequency of 22 and 44 homozygotes is low, around 1% and 2.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	75	5% respectively and stable estimates of the effect of these homozygotes on longevity are not possible in small studies.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Relative frequencies of 22 and 44 homozygotes were not available in 3 of the 15 studies reviewed here.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	77	24,29,32 Most studies compare allele frequencies, or combine 22 homozygotes with 32 heterozygotes and combine 44 homozygotes with 34 heterozygotes to give estimates for 2 carriers versus 33 homozygotes and 4 carriers versus 33 homozygotes.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	78	 In using allele frequencies we have weighted the effect size by genotype frequency.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	79	 However, an analysis by genotype instead of allele frequency gave similar results (not shown).
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	80	Random effects models were used to calculate summary OR and standard errors.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Three studies provided genotype/allele frequencies for more than one age group in their control population;22,23,27 data from the different age groups in these studies was combined to give an overall estimate for age less than 80.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Combined relative risks for males and females were presented.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Forest plots were constructed with logarithmic scales.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	84	 To assess the association between the frequency of the 2 and 4 alleles in the control group and the log OR of allele frequency in elderly populations versus controls, we used a Bayesian random-effects meta-regression model fitted using BUGS (WinBUGS 1.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	85	37 This avoids the bias that can be caused by the association between allele frequency and the OR that arises due to sampling error.

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	91	 There were regional variations in APOE allele frequencies with high relative APOE 4 in Northern Europe (15 to 21%), intermediate frequencies in Central Europe (11 to 13%), Asia (8 to 13%) and North America (12 to 15%), and low frequencies in Southern Europe (4 to 6%).
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In elderly people the 4 allele frequencies converged to be more homogeneous (2 to 12%).
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Despite these differences, only 2 out of 15 studies reportedly matched on geographic origin and only one study matched on ethnicity.

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	114	 However, in the case of APOE 4 it is clear that allele frequencies differ widely by population, even among neighbouring countries and between geographically separated populations within the same country, for example between Lapps and Finns.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	115	40 While migration patterns differ by country, there has been substantial internal and international migration in many countries within the last 100 years.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	116	41 These factors are likely to have produced differences in APOE allele frequency by age group within a given geographical area over recent decades.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Migration is particularly prevalent among younger populations and in large university cities,14 where most of these studies were carried out.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Whilst almost all studies showed that there was a deficit of APOE 4 alleles in elderly versus younger populations, heterogeneity in effect size remained, even when populations were stratified by region.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	119	We are able to make inferences based on the biology and epidemiology of APOE which suggests that assumption (b) is invalid, and that any longevity effect may be subject to modification over periods of years or decades, corresponding to the age difference between elderly and control groups.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	120	 APOE plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism, therefore APOE genotype is one influence on the health effects of dietary fat intake.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	121	 APOE is associated with CHD risk, and this is one mechanism proposed to explain the association of APOE with longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	122	 In the last 30 years CHD mortality has decreased substantially in many countries (Figure 2).
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Factors underlying this decrease include changes in diet, smoking, and treatments for CHD.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	124	 In the studies reviewed here the size of APOE 4 effect differed by population, providing further evidence that 4 effects are context dependant.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	125	There appeared to be an association between 4 allele frequency in controls and the effect of 4 on longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Sampling variation is an important potential explanation.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	127	 If by chance the estimated 4 prevalence is above the true prevalence, the former will tend to be high within the distribution and the effect size will tend to be extreme, due to regression to the mean.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	128	 However, relative APOE 4 allele frequency is known to vary by population and the studies reviewed here are not anomalous in this respect.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Among Europeans relative APOE 4 frequencies exhibit a North to South cline.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	130	42 Accordingly, high relative APOE 4 allele frequencies were observed in studies with Northern European participants (15 to 21%) and low frequencies in Southern European studies (4 to 6%).
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Furthermore, the Bayesian approach, which was used to calculate the association between control allele frequency and effect size, avoids the bias that can arise due to sampling error.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	132	It remains unclear whether sampling a younger control population produces valid estimates of initial allele frequencies in the corresponding elderly population.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Migration and population substructure may confound such studies.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	134	 If relative allele frequencies in control populations overestimate the initial relative allele frequencies in the elderly group a spurious estimate of the longevity effect will be obtained.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Migration is likely to change relative allele frequencies substantially when the source and recipient populations have very different allele frequencies.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Because changes in allele frequency in the short term are a function of the difference in frequency and migration rate, large differences can be seen in just one generation.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	137	43 Net immigration from regions with relatively high allele frequency will overestimate the decrease in 4 in the elderly relative to controls.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Conversely net immigration from areas with relatively low allele frequency will underestimate the difference.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	139	 For example in the Canadian study20 the relative APOE 4 allele frequency in the control group was 15.

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	142	 However, 19% of current Canadian residents were not born in Canada.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	143	41 If migrants came from countries with relatively high allele frequencies of 31% as reported among Lapps,44 migration would result in an overestimation of the real initial relative allele frequency 11.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	144	5% and the true 4 effect will be closer to the null 0.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Alternatively, if migrants came from countries or areas of low APOE 4 frequency (frequencies of 5% have been reported in Sardinians)45 the real initial frequency would have been higher at around 17.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	146	6% and the 4 effect will be around 0.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	147	 This simple example of international migration occurring within one generation does not take account of second generation migrants born in Canada or internal migration.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	148	 While it involves somewhat unrealistic assumptions about migration patterns, the example does offer some insight into how migration may influence results from genetic association studies of longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	149	Only 3 out of the 15 studies matched on ethnicity and/or place of birth.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	150	 The remaining studies assumed a static population and an identical gene pool for elderly and younger age groups.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	151	 A meta-analysis including only studies matching on origin or ethnicity, gave a result closer to the null, consistent with an artefactual explanation for the studies failing to take account of genetic heterogeneity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The remaining studies effectively assumed a static population and an identical gene pool for elderly and younger age groups.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	153	A further explanation for the apparent association between 4 prevalence and magnitude of 4 effect on longevity is that the impact is greater in populations with a higher underlying risk of CHD.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	154	 International comparisons suggest that APOE 4 allele frequency may explain some of the geographical variation in CHD risk.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	155	46 In Japan (a low CHD risk population) the ratio for relative 4 frequency in elderly versus younger populations is 0.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	156	58),25 whereas in Finland (a high CHD risk population) this ratio was found to be 0.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	157	23 The difference in CHD risk between Japan and Finland could be due to genetic susceptibility or environmental factors, but more likely a combination of both.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	158	 For example, in Northern Europe high APOE 4 relative allele frequencies have historically been accompanied by high levels of saturated fat intake.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	159	The influence of genetic variation on longevity is a priori an important research question.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Proponents of genetic epidemiology argue that  predicting multifactorial disease outcomes without consideration of epigenetic networks is increasingly seen as naive .
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	161	47 The implication for methodology is that the genetic dimension should be included in risk factor models of chronic disease, and, by extension, of longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	162	 The papers reviewed here focus on a single, genetic effect (the main effect of APOE on longevity) and represent early attempts to develop a genetic perspective in a field that has been dominated by environmental explanations.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	163	 For example, we know that environment, in the broad sense, including behavioural factors, is essential in understanding time trends in both CHD rates (Figure 2) and longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	164	 What is not known is whether single common genetic variations, such as the APOE polymorphism, are important factors that add to the explanation provided by conventional environmental risk factors.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Studies of APOE and longevity reviewed here, which consistently showed an effect of 2 and 4 alleles on longevity, suggest that APOE may have a part to play.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	166	 However, analyses taking simultaneous account of genetic and environmental factors are needed to address this question.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	167	Assumption (a) Initial relative allele frequencies in the different age groups are similar This assumption may not hold when there is considerable variation in allele frequencies by population, and when migration has resulted in changes in population substructure.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	168	Assumption (b) The risk of mortality conferred by genotype does not depend on year of birth.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	169	 This assumption may be invalid when mortality risk conferred by a genotype depends on interaction with environmental or behavioural risk factors, and when the pattern of exposure to such risk factors is closely related to year of birth.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	170	Whilst the studies reviewed here do provide some evidence of a link between APOE and longevity, the problem is that the size of effect depends on the population in question and probably also the time period that the study spans.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The link between the size of APOE effect and relative allele frequency seen in this review is likely to be a result of population differences in underlying disease susceptibility or changes in population structure over time and illustrates the impact of violating the above assumptions.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	172	Future case-control type studies could be improved by at least including comprehensive data on birth origins and exposure to potential confounding factors.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	173	 It is also possible to address concerns about population stratification in case-control studies, by carrying out genome analysis using methods such as genomic control and structured association.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	174	Cohort studies are not subject to the above assumptions, and hence are preferable to a cross-sectional design.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Participants can be selected and followed up over a given time period, during which they will be subject to the same age-related mortality rate.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The cohort studies carried out to date, which have looked at APOE and longevity, tend to have short follow-up periods (typically 5 years),49 to 56 hence they only provide a snapshot of overall survival.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	177	 These studies have reported mixed results, with some documenting null findings for APOE 4 and longevity,50,51 and others showing negative associations in subgroups only.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	178	54 to 56 To address this question adequately cohort studies, ideally birth cohorts, with a long follow-up are required.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	179	Cross-sectional studies of longevity assume that (a) relative allele frequencies are the same in different age cohorts, and (b) risk of mortality conferred by genotypes does not depend on year of birth.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Population admixture may result in considerable population changes in allele frequency over time, if allele frequencies differ substantially by population and if migration is high.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Mortality risk conferred by genotypes may differ if the gene in question interacts with environmental factors, which vary by time and place.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Studies of apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 and longevity show that effect size estimates are associated with relative allele frequency in control populations, hence accurately predicting the impact of APOE on longevity depends on the validity of assumption (a).
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	183	 APOE is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, and this is one mechanism proposed to explain the association of APOE with longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	184	 However, CHD mortality has decreased mortaliy in the last 30 years, largely due to environmental and behavioural factors, hence the effect of APOE on longevity is context dependent.

0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	4	Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) immunoreactivity is consistently present in the senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In vitro, apoE, and in particular its apoE4 isoform, can bind to and promote fibrillogenesis of the amyloid A peptide, the main constituent of senile plaques.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	6	 These findings, together with the strong genetic association between late onset AD and the E4 allele of apoE, have strengthened the hypothesis that apoE may have a central role in the pathogenesis of AD by modulating A cerebral accumulation.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, apoE immunoreactivity is present in all cerebral and systemic amyloidoses tested, and tryptic apoE fragments have been identified in association with amyloid A (AA).
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In order to further elucidate the interaction between apoE and amyloids, we purified AA and amyloid L (AL) fibrils from patients with familial Mediterranean fever and primary amyloidosis, respectively, and studied the association of apoE with AA and AL proteins.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In each case, apoE fragments, detected by Western blot, co-purified with the amyloid fibrils.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Microsequencing analysis identified COOH-terminal fragments of apoE, similar to the 10-kDa fragment produced by thrombin digestion that contains the purported binding region to A.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In vitro co-incubation of AA with purified human apoE resulted in the formation of an SDS-resistant AAapoE complex and a higher degree of polymerization of the AA peptide.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	12	 These findings and similar results obtained from AD senile plaques suggest that 1) the carboxyl-terminal fragment of apoE is complexed to amyloid fibrils and resists proteolysis in vivo and 2) apoE may promote amyloidogenesis through a conformation-dependent interaction regardless of the primary structure of the amyloid precursors.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	13	Amyloidosis is a disorder of protein conformation in which low molecular weight proteins that are soluble under physiological conditions become deposited and accumulate either intact or partially digested in diverse tissues and organs as insoluble amyloid fibrils.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In spite of their biochemical diversity, amyloid proteins adopt a common secondary structure, the -pleated sheet, and form fibrils of similar morphology.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These fibrils are characteristically long straight filaments 5-12 nm wide that share the tinctorial properties of green birefringence after Congo red staining and specific affinity for fluorescent dyes such as Thioflavine S or T.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In addition to these features shared by most types of amyloids, there are several factors consistently associated with this pathological condition that can be viewed as part of the biochemical setting in which amyloid deposition arises and develops.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These include elevated concentration of amyloid precursors in fluids and tissues and the invariable presence of certain amyloid-associated proteins of which amyloid P-component (AP)()(1, 2) , sulfated proteoglycans (3, 4, 5) , apolipoprotein E (apoE) (6, 7) and apolipoprotein J (8) are the most notorious.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Whether these amyloid-associated proteins play an active role by promoting or inhibiting amyloidogenesis or are inert bystanders is at present unknown.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	19	ApoE is a 34-kDa exchangeable apolipoprotein, present in all types of lipoprotein particles, that is involved in cholesterol transport as well as other less defined functions such as nerve regeneration after injury(9, 10, 11, 12) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The recently reported association between certain apoE genetic isoforms and Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition characterized by the massive deposition in the brain of the 39-44-residue amyloid -protein (A)(13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18) , has strengthened the hypothesis that this apolipoprotein may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of this cerebral amyloidosis(19, 20) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Moreover, in vitro binding experiments using human apoE isolated from plasma or recombinant human apoE with synthetic peptides homologous to A have shown that these two proteins can form an SDS-resistant complex with A and promote A fibril formation in vitro(21, 22, 23, 24) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These lines of evidence, together with the immunohistochemical colocalization of apoE and A in the senile plaques and its presence in the intraneuronal amyloid of neurofibrillary tangles(6) , suggest that apoE may play an active role in the pathogenesis of AD by promoting fibrillogenesis.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	23	 However, immunohistochemical studies have shown that apoE is tightly associated with other types of cerebral amyloidosis, including Down syndrome related to A, hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy of Icelandic type, related to a cystatin C variant, and spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob, kuru, and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease that are associated with the prion amyloid(6, 7, 25) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Furthermore, apoE has been immunohistochemically identified within amyloid deposits in systemic forms of the disease such as secondary amyloidosis and familial Mediterranean fever related to amyloid A, immunoglobulin-related primary amyloidosis (AL), and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy due to deposition of transthyretin genetic variants(7) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Noteworthy, apoE is rarely detected in the nonfibrillar monoclonal deposits of light chain deposition disease and light and heavy chain deposition disease, which may be considered preamyloid forms of AL disease(26) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	26	This widespread association of apoE with biochemically and clinically diverse types of amyloidoses suggests that apoE may participate in a general manner in the process of amyloid formation.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In order to gain insight into the biochemistry of the association between apoE and amyloid proteins, we have characterized by Western blot and amino-terminal sequence analysis apoE fragments that co-purified with amyloid subunits from cases of systemic amyloidosis AA and AL.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We also studied the in vitro binding of human apoE isolated from plasma to these amyloid proteins.

0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The ratio of amyloid to apoE in fraction D was determined by densitometry of the Coomassie Blue-stained 12-13-kDa and 26-kDa AL bands and the 8-9 kDa apoE band in a PDI optical densitometer.

0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	130	The failure to detect apoE by direct amino-terminal sequence analysis of COH fraction D, despite the positive apoE immunoreactivity, indicated that it was present in a very low concentration.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Therefore, a similar approach as for RAM AL was used, and proteins were separated on SDS-Tricine gels and transferred to Immobilon membrane.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The upper portion of the 6-8-kDa band of HPLC fraction D yielded two sequences corresponding to the N terminus of amyloid A and to an apoE fragment starting at position 199, respectively (Fig.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	133	 In order to investigate whether intact apoE was present in the crude A and L amyloid fibril fraction before HPLC separation, we performed Western blots using monoclonal antibodies ID7 and 6C5, specific for the amino-terminal domain of apoE.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	134	 A band corresponding to the 34-kDa intact apoE was observed only in association with COH fibrils.

0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The influence of apoE upon AA polymerization was evaluated by detection of the apoE-AA incubation mixture with an anti-AA antibody on Western blots.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	142	 AA alone incubated for 6 h at room temperature in 0.

0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	144	 In contrast, AA co-incubated with apoE at a 1:85 molar ratio (apoE:amyloid) under the same conditions as above resulted in the appearance on the gel of a higher amount of AA dimers, trimers, tetramers, and higher molecular weight components (Fig.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	145	 AA co-incubated with BSA showed no increment in polymerization when compared with AA alone (not shown).
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	146	 When the same experiment was done using RAM AL, no additional bands were present.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	147	 However, most of the amyloid-apoE incubation mixture remained on top of the stacking and running gels as very high molecular weight components (not shown).
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	148	 This result is consistent with a higher degree of aggregation of amyloid AL subunits in the presence of apoE that resisted denaturation by SDS treatment.

0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	168	 In contrast, the 10-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment is less stable, binds to lipoproteins, and mediates lipid-free apoE tetramerization in aqueous solutions(31) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Previously, we published the finding of a tryptic fragment of apolipoprotein E corresponding to residues 270-278 in association with two amyloid A proteins(29) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Our present data extend that observation.

0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	176	We propose that the apoE fragments that co-purify with AA and AL are bound to these amyloid proteins in vivo.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The remainder of the apoE molecule is cleaved by thrombin and/or other serine proteases in situ either before or after the amyloid-apoE complex is formed.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Alternatively, we cannot rule out that apoE was partially degraded during purification.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Intact apoE and apoE fragments, as determined by Western blot analysis, are present in the crude AA and AL fibril fractions before HPLC.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	180	 However, after purification only the carboxyl-terminal apoE fragment co-purifies with the AA and AL amyloids.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	181	 The question of whether the apoE-amyloid association precedes tissue deposition remains to be addressed.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	182	It is likely that the initial formation of stable apoE-amyloid complexes requires the interaction of the amino and carboxyl-terminal domains of apoE.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor through the amino-terminal domain of apoE requires lipid association, largely mediated by the carboxyl end of the molecule(31) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	184	 The interdependence of the domains of apoE is further reflected by the effect that amino acid substitutions within the amino-terminal region have on the association of apoE with diverse lipoprotein classes.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Such association is known to be mediated by the carboxyl terminus of apoE (9) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The apoE3 isoform with a Cys at position 112 preferentially binds high density lipoproteins, whereas the presence of Arg at the same position favors binding to very low density and intermediate density lipoproteins(33, 34) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	187	 A cooperation between domains unique to each apoE isoform has been postulated to explain this selective lipoprotein distribution(35) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Whether a similar mechanism can account for the higher avidity of the apoE4 isoform for A of AD remains to be tested.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	189	ApoE is capable of binding to synthetic A through a strong interaction resistant to SDS(21) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	190	 A similar interaction between apoE and A of the Dutch variant of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a rare form of familial AD, has also been documented (36) (details of apoE-A binding will be published elsewhere).
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	191	 By using a set of truncated recombinants, the purported binding region to A has been located within the carboxyl-end of apoE between amino acids 244 and 272 (21) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Our findings suggest that the binding of this region to A is not specific for this peptide but rather reflects a hydrophobic interaction between apoE carboxyl end and a common conformation shared by different amyloids.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Secondary structure predictions indicate that a putative amphipathic helix with high affinity for lipids (37) is located within the region that co-purifies with amyloid peptides.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Possibly, other exchangeable apolipoproteins sharing similar amphipathic helices can also have amyloid-apolipoprotein interactions.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	195	 It is noteworthy that genetic variants of apoAI can form amyloid in certain hereditary forms of human amyloidosis (38, 39) and that SAA, the precursor of AA, is itself an apolipoprotein associated to high density lipoprotein(40) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	196	 We recently found that apoAI can bind to A and promote A fibrillogenesis in vitro.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	197	()Presumably, in the same way that there is a large number of amyloidogenic precursor proteins that can end as insoluble amyloid fibrils, there is also a group of amyloidogenic apolipoproteins and acute phase reactants that can actively participate in this process either as constituents of fibrils or as modulators of fibrillogenesis.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	198	Our finding of a higher degree of polymerization of AA and AL native peptides upon incubation with apoE together with previous work using synthetic A (22, 23, 24, 36) points to a general role of apoE in amyloidogenesis.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	199	 The molar ratios of apoE and AA used in our in vitro experiments are opposite of those found in plasma in normal conditions for apoE and SAA.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	200	 However, SAA is an acute phase reactant, and its concentration in plasma is capable of rising 1000-fold during tissue injury or inflammation(41) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	201	 AL, in turn, is derived from monoclonal light chains, which are known to have very high levels in the circulation in most of the cases.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Therefore, we believe that the concentrations that we used in vitro can resemble more closely the pathological conditions in which amyloidosis develops than the physiological levels of apoE and amyloid precursors.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	203	ApoE may act as one of a group of pathological chaperones that promote the aggregation of amyloidogenic precursors of diverse primary structure into the -pleated sheet conformation of amyloid fibrils.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The absence of apoE and AP in the nonfibrillar, Congo red negative monoclonal deposits of light chain deposition disease and light and heavy chain deposition disease, which are considered preamyloid forms of AL disease(26) , suggests that apoE and AP may be essential catalysts for the modulation of the amyloid generation process.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	205	 The interaction between apoE and amyloids may also be influenced by other local acute phase reactants such as proteoglycans to which both amyloid precursors and apoE are known to bind(42, 43) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	206	 In spite of this putative widespread role of apoE in amyloid formation, it seems likely that a certain specificity exists between some of the amyloid precursors and apoE genetic isoforms.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Thus far, no preferential associations between systemic amyloidoses and apoE isoforms have been reported; however, the genetic association of AD with apoE4 and the in vitro higher avidity of this isoform for A may reflect such specificity(19, 21) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Alternatively, the apoE4 isoform may participate in the pathogenesis of AD through a different pathway unrelated to A formation or deposition.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	209	Recently it has been reported that apoE can inhibit A aggregation in vitro at concentrations similar to those found normally in biological fluids(44) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	210	 This apparent discrepancy with previous studies could be due to different experimental conditions(22, 23, 24, 36) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	211	 However, it raises the intriguing possibility that apoE may have a dual effect upon fibrillogenesis in vivo depending on the local concentrations of both apoE and amyloid precursors in sites of amyloid formation.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Within physiological levels, apoE may have a protective role on amyloid formation by sequestering soluble amyloid precursors, as has been postulated for A(44) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	213	 However, A appears to be associated to other apolipoproteins (i.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	214	 apolipoprotein J) in biological fluids in vivo(45) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Yet, in tissues in which local membrane repair and lipid turnover are increased, such as after cell injury, apoE is overexpressed and can reach higher concentrations than those found normally in the circulation(10, 11, 12, 46) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Under these circumstances, apoE may have a substantially different effect upon its association with amyloid precursors.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	217	 In this pathological setting, several other factors may affect apoE behavior, such as its state of oxidation, lipid association, the presence of other amyloid/apoE binding proteins, and the stage of the amyloid process(47) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	218	The abnormal amyloid response in each individual will be determined finally by a complex process involving critical concentrations of amyloid precursors and a set of amyloid-associated proteins such as apoE, other apolipoproteins, AP, -antichymotrypsin (22) , and proteoglycans.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	219	 These may act in conjunction with yet undefined tissue-specific factors to modulate the conformational transition of a soluble protein into an insoluble fibril.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	220	 A better understanding of these complex interactions between amyloids and the factors that modulate their formation may open novel strategies for the treatment of the systemic and cerebral amyloid-related diseases.

0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	4	Missense mutations in the presenilin 2 (PS-2) gene on chromosome 1 were sought by direct nucleotide sequence analysis of the open reading frame of 60 pedigrees with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In the majority of these pedigrees, PS-1 and [beta]-amyloid precursor protein ([beta]APP) gene mutations had been excluded.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	6	 While no additional PS-2 pathogenic mutations were detected, four silent nucleotide substitutions and alternative splicing of nucleotides 1338-1340 (Glu325) were observed.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Analysis of additional members of a pedigree known to segregate a Met239Val mutation in PS-2 revealed that the age of onset of symptoms is highly variable (range 45-88 years).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This variability is not attributable to differences in ApoE genotypes.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These results suggest (i) that, in contrast to mutations in PS-1, mutations in PS-2 are a relatively rare cause of FAD; (ii) that other genetic or environmental factors modify the AD phenotype associated with PS-2 mutations; and (iii) that still other FAD susceptibility genes remain to be identified.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	10	Missense mutations associated with early onsetAlzheimer's disease (AD) have been discovered in two related genes termed presenilin I on chromosome 14 (1 ) and presenilin II on chromosome 1 (2 ,3 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Analysis of a number of large data sets have revealed that missense mutations in the presenilin I (PS-1) gene are a frequent cause of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), accounting for perhaps as much as 50% of all cases of early onset FAD (1 ,2 ,4 -6 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In order to determine the frequency of mutations in the presenilin II (PS-2) gene, we undertook a survey for mutations in the open reading frame (ORF) of the PS-2 gene in 60 pedigrees with FAD.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The disease in these families was characterized by the occurrence of AD consistent with the NINDS-ADRDA criteria in at least three closely related subjects, often in more than one generation.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In these pedigrees, the age at onset (range: 35-82 years; 36 with mean age at onset  < = 64 years; 14 with mean age at onset  > = 65 years; 10 with insufficient reliable data on age at onset) overlapped that observed in the pedigrees with known PS-2 mutations (onset between 45 and 72 years).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	15	 To determine the penetrance of PS-2 mutations, we also examined several additional members of the FLO10 pedigree previously described with the Met239Val missense mutation in the PS-2 gene (2 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Our data suggest that missense mutations in the PS-2 gene are a rare cause of AD and that these missense mutations may be subject to the modifying action of other genes or environmental influences.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	17	Fibroblasts, transformed lymphoblasts or peripheral blood samples were obtained from at least one affected member of 60 kindreds with multiple (>3) family members affected by FAD that were ascertained through the familial Alzheimer's disease registry at the University of Toronto, through clinics at the University of Florence and the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Centre, from the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, from French University Hospitals through the National INSERM network of France, and from the Indiana University Alzheimer's Disease DNA Bank and the NIA sponsored repository at the Coriell Institute.

0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Mutations in the PS-1 and [beta]-amyloid precursor protein ([beta]APP) genes had previously been excluded in the majority of these pedigrees by sequencing of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products corresponding to the PS-1 gene and genomic PCR products corresponding to exons 16 and 17 of [beta]APP.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	20	Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of RT-PCR products corresponding to the ORF of PS-2 in these 60 FAD pedigrees failed to uncover any additional mutations beyond the two initial mutations (Asn141Ile mutation in three related kindreds of Volga-German origin, and the Met239Val mutation in the FLO10 pedigree of Italian origin) previously reported in this data set (2 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Specific screening just for the Asn141Ile and Met239Val mutations in a supplemental set of genomic DNA samples from affected probands of 81 Swedish FAD pedigrees also failed to identify further instances of either mutation.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	22	 However, although no pathogenic nucleotide sequence differences were observed, four `silent' nucleotide substitutions were detected (T - >  C at 626 bp/codon 23; C - >  T at 806 bp/codon 147; C - >  T at 1571 bp/codon 402; and G - >  A at 1670 bp/codon 435-sequence numbering from Accession no.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	23	 All of these substitutions occurred at the third nucleotide position of a codon, and would therefore be predicted not to cause a change in the amino acid sequence.

0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Transcripts with and without nucleotides 1338-1340, which reflects the use of an alternate splice donor sequence, were of approximately equal abundance in brain, fibroblasts and leukocytes.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	26	During the investigation of the PS-2 gene in several newly ascertained members of the FLO10 pedigree segregating the Met239Val mutation in PS-2, we identified an additional carrier of this mutation (subject III-20 in Table 1 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Surprisingly, this subject was aged 87 years and had had no evidence for cognitive or memory impairment on serial follow-up over several years until age 84 years when she was noted to become mildly demented, and is now profoundly demented (Mini Mental Status Examination score 4/30) with clinical features that sustain a diagnosis of probable AD by the NINDS-ADRDA criteria.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	28	 A review of clinical data on additional members of the extended pedigree also uncovered two other subjects in the direct lineage of the family who had either historical evidence for late onset AD (subject I-2, the affected grandfather of III-20 who died at 75 years with dementia) or who currently have clinical features consistent with probable AD using the NINDS-ADRDA criteria (subject III-39 onset at 88 years).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	29	 We and others have previously reported that the genotype at the Apolipoprotein E gene can modulate the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with the Val717Ile mutation in [beta]APP (7 ,8 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, in the FLO10 family with the Met239Val mutation in PS-2, ApoE genotypes do not correlate with age of onset (Table 1 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Thus, the very elderly symptomatic subject III-20 (onset 84 years) has the same ApoE genotype ([epsilon]3/[epsilon]3) as three other affected carriers of the Met239Val mutation, all of whom developed symptoms at a younger age (onset 45-72 years).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Moreover, the affected carrier IV-21, with the ApoE genotype of [epsilon]3/[epsilon]4 developed symptoms at an age (48 years) similar to that of his affected sibling IV-18 with an ApoE genotype of [epsilon]3/[epsilon]3 (onset = 45 years) (Table 1 , Fig.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Our sample size is too small to draw reliable conclusions about the presence or absence of interactions between the ApoE genotype and the Asn141Ile mutation (Table 1 ).

0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	39	Although the large cadre of FAD pedigrees reported here does not represent an unbiased survey, the paucity of missense mutations in the PS-2 gene amongst FAD pedigrees in our data set suggests that, in contrast to mutations in the ORF of PS-1, mutations in the ORF of this gene are a rare cause of FAD, at least in Caucasian populations.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	40	 We can confidently exclude mutations in intronic sequences associated with RNA splice sites [indeed only one such mutation which affects splicing of exon 10 of PS-1 has been found in FAD affected subjects (T.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	41	 However, until the 5' UTR and 3' UTR sequences have been searched for pathogenic mutations, we cannot exclude the formal possibility that mutations might exist in these sequences in some of our pedigrees.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Nevertheless, there are two corollaries to the conclusion that PS-2 ORF mutations are rare.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	43	 First, unless a phenotype uniquely associated with or at least enriched in subjects with PS-2 mutants can be found, screening programs for mutations in the ORF of PS-2 are likely to have a low yield.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Second, and more importantly, other as yet unidentified FAD susceptibility loci must exist.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	45	Table 1 Age of onset relative to the genotypes at the ApoE and PS-2 genes Subject.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	46	The age of symptom onset or current age of PS-2 mutation carriers are displayed along with each subject's ApoE genotype.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	47	The other conclusion to be drawn from our data is that the age of symptom onset in subjects with PS-2 mutations is generally older (45-88 years) than that observed for most PS-1 mutations (25-65 years), and is highly variable even amongst affected members of the same pedigree.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	48	 This contrasts sharply with the experience with PS-1 mutations, where the age of onset is generally quite similar amongst affected members of the same family, and often amongst members of different families with the same mutation (1 ,2 ,4 -6 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Because to date all subjects with AD in the FLO10 pedigree have inherited the Met239Val mutation, it is unlikely that the late onset cases represent phenocopies and/or that it represents a polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with a nearby pathogenic mutation.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Consequently, the most parsimonious explanation is that there is a single cause of the disease (the Met239Val mutation) and that the phenotype is modified by other genetic or environmental factors.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The limited number of subjects with the Asn141Ile mutation in our data set prevents rigorous conclusions about any interactions between the ApoE genotype and this mutation.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	52	 However, analysis of a larger data set by T.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Schellenberg also reveals no obvious interaction between the genotypes at ApoE and PS-2 Asn141Ile (manuscript in preparation).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	54	 This absence of a close correlation between the ApoE genotype and age of symptom onset in subjects with PS-2 mutation has two implications.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	55	 First, in view of parallel observations showing no apparent interaction between ApoE genotype and mutations in PS-1 (7 ,9 ,10 ), together with the structural and amino acid sequence similarities of the PS-1 and PS-2 proteins (1 -3 ), it is likely that the functional effect of PS-1 and PS-2 mutations are similar and are either remote from the functional effect of the ApoE [epsilon]4 allele, or affect a biochemical pathway leading to AD which is different from that influenced by ApoE [epsilon]4.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Second, the variation in age of onset in PS-2 mutation carriers argues that other modifying environmental or genetic factors (e.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	57	 other polymorphisms within the presenilin genes or differences in other genes) must exist.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The nature of these other factors remains to be determined.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	59	 However, if these modifying factors can be identified, they might be exploitable as a therapeutic tool.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	60	Subjects with familially clustered Alzheimer's disease (as defined by the occurrence of at least three first or second degree relatives with AD) were recruited from patients referred for the investigation of dementia at the University of Toronto, University of Florence, the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Centre, the Huddinge Hospital of the Karolinska Institute, and French University Hospitals.

0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	260	 48) and inclusion of glia in the culture may be required to see a broader spectrum of the effects of estrogen on neurons in vitro.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	261	 For example, a previous report has shown that both microglia and astroglia must be present to obtain an estrogen-induced increase in ApoE mRNA (38).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Hence, a monotypic cell culture may give a biased interpretation of critical estradiol effects if interactions exist between glia and neurons.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	263	Data from previous studies suggest a direct relationship between ApoE and neurite outgrowth (32, 33, 34, 49, 50).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	264	 We found that a physiological concentration of estradiol had a maximal effect on both ApoE levels and neurite outgrowth.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Our data also suggest a synergistic effect between estradiol and ApoE such that estradiol effects on neurite outgrowth are facilitated by ApoE3 but not by ApoE4.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	266	 ApoE3 alone increased neurite extent by about 30%.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	267	 But when combined with estradiol, neuritic growth increased by 70 to 80%.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	268	 In addition, ApoE2 was significantly more effective than ApoE3 in facilitating neurite outgrowth in the presence of estradiol.

0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Glial-derived ApoE supplies lipids for neuronal membrane synthesis and function.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Our receptor inhibition studies suggest that both ApoE3 and ApoE4 are using low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and HSPG for neurite outgrowth (33, 49).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	279	 However, neuronal growth is slowed or disrupted in the absence of ApoE or in the presence of ApoE4.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	280	 It is worth noting that ApoE4 has been reported to show toxic effects in culture (52) and disrupt microtubule polymerization although at 10-fold higher concentrations of those used in this study (32).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Hence, the less complex neuritic field seen in the cells incubated with ApoE4 may represent a deficiency of lipid in combination with toxic effects of ApoE4.

0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	5	AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE in atherosclerosis research is the characterization of the effects of locally synthesized apolipoprotein E (apoE) within the vessel wall.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Endogenous synthesis and secretion of apoE by macrophages in the vessel wall have been shown to protect against atherosclerosis (22).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Arterial macrophages participate in inflammation, tissue remodeling, and lipid metabolism.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	8	 ApoE, which is synthesized by hepatocytes, adipocytes, and macrophages, mediates lipoprotein metabolism and affects cellular cholesterol homeostasis.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	9	 apoE from macrophages accepts cholesterol from cells in the vessel wall and transports it back to the liver, where the cholesterol can be excreted as bile (3, 9).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This pathway is called the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) system.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The effect of apoE can be due to its cellular or extracellular positioning, and therefore an apoE molecule can mediate cholesterol efflux from the macrophage that originally secreted it (autocrine effect) or from surrounding macrophages (paracrine effect).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The terms "autocrine" and "paracrine," traditionally applied to signaling peptides and hormones, have also been used to describe the actions of mediators with a broad range of functions besides signal transduction (1, 7, 25).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	13	 It can be assumed that for the sake of cholesterol efflux an individual macrophage cannot distinguish the apoE that it secretes from the apoE derived from neighboring cells.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	14	 However, because the endogenous synthesis of apoE causes high spatial proximity, autocrine apoE is at an advantage compared with paracrine apoE.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The spatial proximity advantage of endogenous apoE results in a temporal sequence of autocrine effects occurring before paracrine effects and a concentration gradient from an autocrine compartment (high concentration) to a paracrine compartment (low concentration).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	16	Making comparisons between the autocrine and paracrine effects of apoE synthesized by macrophages has proven difficult.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	17	 For in vitro experiments with cultured macrophages, exogenously applied apoE has been used to approximate paracrine or endocrine apoE (14, 19).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Endogenously synthesized apoE has been used to approximate autocrine apoE (16, 19 to 21).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	19	 These approximations do not consider that a single molecule of an endogenously synthesized mediator can have a series of interactions that employ a combination of autocrine and paracrine mechanisms (4).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	20	The novel methodology discussed here was developed to separate autocrine and paracrine mechanisms by using a simple mathematical model to interpret mediator-induced biological effects.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This study shows that whereas macrophage apoE has both autocrine and paracrine effects on cholesterol efflux, autocrine apoE has smaller but more consistent effects than paracrine apoE.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Whereas macrophage apoE is used to demonstrate this novel methodology, the concepts have applications for separating the autocrine and paracrine effects of many other secreted biological mediators including growth factors, cytokines, and carrier proteins.

0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	131	 This would be expected because the secretion of apoE is a function of time and, therefore, apoE-mediated effects would also be a function of time.

0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	150	 There are 2 compartments in which secreted apoE () is distributed: the juxtacellular space and the extracellular space.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	151	 All endogenously synthesized apoE is initially distributed in the juxtacellular space, where it accepts cholesterol () in an autocrine fashion.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	152	 apoE is eventually distributed into the extracellular space, where it accepts cholesterol in a paracrine fashion that is sensitive to the volume in which the cells are cultured.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Determining the volume-independent effects on cholesterol efflux can distinguish the autocrine actions of apoE from the paracrine actions.

0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	155	Our study suggests that autocrine apoE has advantages that are biologically relevant.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Even when the extracellular space is saturated with apoE, at least 10 to 20% of the apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux is the result of volume-independent interactions of endogenous apoE (Table 1).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	157	 (19) found that with apoE-deficient cells, the exogenous application of apoE at 10 times the concentration of normal endogenous apoE secretion did not increase cholesterol efflux as much as normal endogenous apoE secretion by apoE-producing cells.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The fundamental importance of these media transfer studies is that they show that exogenous apoE (paracrine) is not equivalent to endogenous apoE (autocrine and paracrine).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	159	 For a macrophage with endogenously synthesized apoE, the advantage of autocrine apoE may become critical if homeostasis is challenged by cholesterol loading, if the conditioned space is large (making apoE diluted), if the turnover of conditioned space is high because of interstitial flow, or if a macrophage is isolated from other macrophages.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The interstitial concentration, distribution volume, and turnover of macrophage apoE in the vessel wall are not known.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	161	 These factors are critical for the interpretation of data from in vitro cell culture systems and the generalization of these data to the biology of macrophages in vivo.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	162	 For example, the trend in viability may be related to changes in apoE secretion observed at very low volumes (Fig.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	163	 The log-linear trend in viability (Fig.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	164	 3C) may be due to the relative concentrations of confounding mediators like growth factors and culture gases (e.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	165	, CO2) in varying distribution volumes.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Because apoE is not the only mediator being secreted in our system, it was necessary to subtract the effects of confounding mediators.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	167	 This is why apoE+/+ macrophages were compared with apoE to / to  macrophages and why the specific apoE effect was calculated as apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux (E).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The effects of confounding mediators on cholesterol efflux were minimal (Fig.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Although the major role of apoE is as an extracellular cholesterol acceptor, it is also possible that a portion of the effect of apoE on cholesterol efflux is the consequence of other actions of apoE, such as receptor or proteoglycan binding (17), intracellular cholesterol routing (8), or even stabilization of the cytoskeleton (6).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Irrespective of which ultimate mechanisms or combination of effects may be responsible for the modulation of cholesterol efflux by apoE, these can only occur through either autocrine or paracrine events and are therefore addressed as a whole in our study.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	171	Although the volume dependence of apoE secretion and viability could not explain the volume-dependent trends of apoE-mediated efflux (Fig.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	172	 2C), these data definitely underscore the sensitivity of biological processes to in vitro culture volumes.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Some of the higher-order characteristics of macrophage tissue could be overlooked by in vitro studies with macrophages.

0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	175	 The spatial range of autocrine effect (30) is very important because if another cell is within this range there is the possibility of autocrine cooperation.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	176	 This possibility could be explored by in vitro or in vivo studies on the effects of the geometry and the density of cell aggregates on apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Compared with exogenous lipoprotein-bound apoE of hepatic origin, local secretion of lipid free apoE by macrophages results in decreased atherosclerosis due to a small amount of apoE in a critical location (12, 22).

0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	179	 These chimeric mice had normal plasma apoE but no macrophage apoE production in the vessel walls.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Although immunocytochemical staining of lesions with WT macrophages reveals high apoE levels, these chimeric mice with only plasma apoE had little to no apoE in the lesions.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	181	 The lack of staining for plasma-derived apoE within the artery wall suggests that penetration into clusters of macrophages is limited.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	182	 The macrophage, not plasma-derived apoE, is the primary source of apoE for RCT (5, 12, 22).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Along these same lines, paracrine apoE may not be able to fulfill the critical actions of the small amount of autocrine apoE in the juxtacellular space or possibly even the intracellular space.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	184	 apoE recycling, the internalization and resecretion of apoE (10, 13, 33), has been reported to mediate cholesterol efflux in hepatocytes and in macrophages (13).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The methodology in this study is unable to resolve the "internal autocrine" (31) or "intracrine" (28, 29) mechanism that could be mediated by intracellular apoE.

0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The capacity, concentration, and compartmentalization of the sink affect cholesterol efflux (Fig.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The sink has a capacity (ft) that expands as apoE is secreted.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The sink can be separated into two compartments that are a consequence of the location of apoE in juxtacellular or extracellular space, also described as the secretion layer and the bulk layer, respectively (18, 27).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The dilution of apoE as it moves to the extracellular space diminishes its efficacy.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	191	 ApoE-mediated efflux (E) is a balance between the efflux and influx of cholesterol.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Efflux depends on the sink capacity (ft), the concentration of extracellular apoE (V to 1), and the functional concentration of juxtacellular apoE (C).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Influx depends on the cholesterol in the apoE sink (E) and the functional concentration of juxtacellular apoE (kI).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Decreases in the functional concentration of apoE that contribute to influx (nt) may represent changes in the capacitance of apoE due to accumulation of phospholipids that stabilize cholesterol or to proteolytic alteration of apoE.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	195	 It is also possible that n is an artifact of slight changes in viability or apoE secretion.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In many of the documents that are found by a literature search for the term "autocrine," the terms "autocrine and/or paracrine" describe the proposed mechanism of action.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	197	 It is difficult to quantitatively separate these two mechanisms experimentally.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Traditional approaches to this problem have limitations and rely on simple qualitative assessments.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Traditional methodologies that have been used to study macrophage apoE include characterizing the tissue distribution of apoE (11), measuring the effects of the endogenous synthesis of apoE vs.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	200	 its complete absence (11), and measuring the effects of the endogenous synthesis vs.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	201	 exogenous application of apoE (15, 19).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	202	 These methods are useful in comparative assessments, but they are unable to simultaneously quantify the serial effects mediated by apoE or other secreted biological mediators.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	203	In the present study, we have performed experiments based on the theory that the portion of the endogenous acceptor that mediates autocrine effects cannot be diluted.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Previous studies have utilized experimental strategies similar to the one used in our study.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	205	 (32) performed volume dependence experiments to study whether efflux to exogenous acceptors is proceeded by aqueous diffusion of cholesterol or by acceptor-membrane collisions.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	206	 They found that, for certain types of acceptors, efflux approached a "volume-insensitive plateau," and they proposed that these types of acceptors may have "sites for efficient collisional transfer" (32).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Our studies with endogenously synthesized acceptors suggest that these sites may be a combination of binding sites on the membrane and an enriched aqueous layer around the membrane (i.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	208	 (27) used a theoretical model to study the escape of autocrine signaling ligands into the extracellular space.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	209	 They found in a model of a ligand-receptor signaling system that "varying volume heights shows little effect on ligand concentrations.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	210	" It remains to be seen whether the dilution methodology discussed here can change mediator concentrations over the large dynamic range (many orders of magnitude) of a log-linear dose-response curve such as those seen for ligand-receptor signaling pathways.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	211	In summary, this study separates and quantifies the autocrine and paracrine effects of apoE on cholesterol efflux from macrophages.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	212	 These data suggest that the relative importance of autocrine and paracrine apoE depends on the size of the local distribution volume, with the autocrine effects remaining constant even when the paracrine effects are diminished by the dilution of apoE.

0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	3	Human apolipoprotein E (apoE, protein; APOE, gene),1 a 34-kDa protein coded for by a gene on chromosome 19, plays a prominent role in the transport and metabolism of plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerides through its ability to interact with the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein (1, 2).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	4	 It has been postulated that apoE may also play an important role in the redistribution of cholesterol and phospholipids within the central nervous system (CNS) (3) where apoE is expressed mainly in astrocytes (4, 5).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In vitro and in vivo data suggest that apoE can play a role in neurite outgrowth and sprouting (4, 6-9), however, whether this is due to effects on cholesterol and lipid metabolism is unclear.

0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Overall, the ST content in most brain regions of wild-type (apoE+/+) mice was relatively unchanged after 6 months of age (Fig.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	128	 However, the levels of ST mass in apoE/ mice at 6 and 12 months of age were substantially increased relative to those in apoE+/+ mice of advanced age (Fig.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	129	 In contrast, the ST content in all examined regions of apoE3 transgenic mice were substantially lower compared those found in apoE+/+ mice at ages of 12 months and older, although the ST content in these two types of mice were almost identical at 6 months of age (Fig.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	130	 It was also found that alterations in ST mass mediated by apoE was smaller in cerebellum than that found in cortex or hippocampus at the early ages (Fig.

0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	135	Sulfatide Content in Cultured Astrocyte-secreted ApoE Particles and Human CSF-- To investigate the possible mechanism(s) of apoE-mediated alterations in ST content in the CNS, two experiments were performed.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	136	 First, purified, astrocyte-secreted lipoproteins containing either apoE3 or apoE4 were prepared from cultured astrocytes as described under "Experimental Procedures.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	137	" The ST content in these particles was quantitated by ESI/MS.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	138	 It was found that the ST content in these particles was negligible, although apoE4 particles contained more ST mass than that found in apoE3 particles (731  plus or minus  45 versus 562  plus or minus  22 pmol/mg apoE, respectively).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Second, CSF (which contains CNS-produced apoE-containing lipoprotein particles) samples were collected from age-matched cognitively normal human subjects.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The ST content in the CSF samples was analyzed by ESI/MS.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The ST mass (nmol/mg apoE) in apoE3/E3 homozygous subjects was 46.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	142	3, whereas the level was significantly higher in subjects with one or two alleles of apoE4 (53.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	143	 It should be noted that the ST content in CSF samples from subjects who were either heterozygous or homozygous for APOE4 (3/4 or 4/4) were indistinguishable in this study.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Therefore, it can be concluded that human CSF contains a significant amount of ST and the mass level of ST in human CSF is apoE isoform-dependent.

0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	150	Identification of the ST Carrier(s) in Human CSF-- Examination of the mass levels of ST in both cultured astrocyte-secreted apoE particles and human CSF (see last subsection) suggests two possibilities.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	151	 First, ST molecules are acquired and directly associate with apoE particles in the CNS after apoE particles are secreted from astrocytes.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Alternatively, ST molecules may be influenced by apoE in an indirect fashion but not directly associate and interact with apoE-containing lipoproteins.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Therefore, to understand the one or more mechanisms of apoE-mediated alterations in ST content in the CNS, it is necessary to identify the carrier or carriers of ST molecules.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	154	 The location of ST molecules was first investigated by analyzing ST content in human CSF fractions after gel filtration chromatography.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	155	 It was found that sulfatides co-localized exactly with HDL-like lipoproteins present in human CSF (Fig.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The two most abundant apolipoproteins produced in the CNS (apoE and apoJ) as well as several other apolipoproteins are present in human CSF.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Therefore, experiments were performed to identify the specific carrier(s) of ST in human CSF by immunoprecipitation (see the inset of Fig.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	158	 7B for Western blots) and followed by ESI/MS quantitation of ST content in both supernatants and pellets.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	159	 It was found that most (over 80 mol%) if not all ST molecules were immunoprecipitated with anti-apoE antibodies, whereas ST molecules were not specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-apoJ antibodies (Fig.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	160	 These results clearly demonstrated that ST molecules were specifically associated with apoE-containing HDL-like lipoproteins in CSF and suggested that apoE particles mainly acquired ST in the CNS after secretion from astrocytes.

0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Following immunoprecipitation of CSF, the pellet was also analyzed for apoE and apoJ.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	177	The involvement of apoE in metabolism of phospholipids and cholesterol in the plasma is well known (1, 25).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	178	 To investigate whether apoE influences the mass distribution of brain lipids, we systematically quantified the distribution of lipids including multiple phospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol in different brain regions of wild-type, apoE/, and human apoE transgenic mice.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	179	 We found that there are no significant effects of apoE on the content of all examined lipids with the exception of ST levels, which were dramatically altered in both the apoE knockout and human apoE transgenic mice.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Furthermore, this apoE-mediated alteration in ST content in the CNS is regulated by aging as well as by apoE produced in the brain, because the human apoE transgenic mice only express apoE in brain and still have markedly elevated plasma cholesterol (26).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	181	 The results from the examination of the ST content in astrocyte-secreted apoE particles indicate that apoE can acquire a small amount of ST directly from cells that secrete apoE.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	182	 However, because most brain ST is produced by oligodendrocytes and located in myelin in the CNS, it is likely that the majority of ST in apoE particles in the CNS is acquired from myelin after apoE secretion from its expressed cells.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The major effect of mouse and human apoE appears to be in keeping ST levels in brain at a lower level than that present in the absence of apoE.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	184	 This effect is probably due to apoE-containing lipoproteins facilitating cellular clearance of ST.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Although hydrolysis of ST directly catalyzed by apoE was not observed in this study, apoE-associated ST hydrolysis in vivo can not be completely excluded.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Because we showed that ST directly associates with apoE-containing lipoproteins in CSF, it is likely that transport of ST by apoE particles in brain interstitial fluid and CSF and endocytotic recycling of apoE particles through LDL receptor or LDL receptor family members such as LDL receptor-related proteins (37) are the major pathways by which apoE mediates ST metabolism in the CNS.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	187	The 4 allele of APOE is a strong genetic risk factor for AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, whereas the 2 allele is protective.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Although there are several possible mechanisms as to why these associations exist, there is very strong evidence to suggest that the interaction between apoE and A play an important role in the effect of apoE on AD (see Refs.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	189	 For example, in transgenic animal models that develop AD-like amyloidosis and neuritic plaques, the lack of apoE results in little to no fibrillar amyloid formation nor neuritic dystrophy (14, 39), and the expression of human apoE results in an isoform-specific deposition of amyloid within neuritic plaques with the effect order being apoE4  >  E3  >  E2 (15, 40).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	190	 These effects of apoE on A are likely mediated by interactions between apoE-containing HDL (the form of apoE in brain) and A.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Given these issues, is there any way that sulfatide association with apoE-containing lipoproteins may be involved in apoE-A interactions?.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	192	It has been shown that apoE interaction with A is markedly influenced by the presence of lipids (41-43).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	193	 However, previous work (27) and the data presented here have shown that there is not a quantitative difference in the amount of most phospholipids and cholesterol present in brain or CSF lipoproteins in the presence or absence of apoE or apoE isoforms.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	194	 In contrast to this, we observed a significant isoform-specific difference in ST levels (E4  >  E3) in human CSF lipoproteins.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Although we have not yet explored whether sulfatide levels in apoE particles influence interactions with A, we have shown that a portion of A co-elutes with apoE-containing HDL particles shown here to also contain ST in human CSF (27).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	196	In addition to the effect of apoE and apoE isoform on risk for AD, there is substantial evidence that apoE4 is also a risk factor for poor outcome following certain CNS injuries such as head trauma, multiple sclerosis, and possibly stroke (see Ref.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	197	 How it is that apoE plays a role in these processes remains unclear.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	198	 It is possible that the effect is via an isoform-specific difference in regeneration as has been shown in some in vitro and in vivo models (see Ref.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	199	 It is also possible, particularly in the case of multiple sclerosis and possibly stroke, that apoE is somehow regulating CNS inflammatory processes such as cytokine production as has been seen in some models (e.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	200	Interestingly, numerous studies have shown that sulfatides are ligands for a family of receptor proteins, called selectins, located on activated vascular endothelial cells, leukocytes, and activated platelets (45-51).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Although the relationship between the role of apoE in immunoregulation and sulfatide as a ligand for selectins is unclear, it has been shown that sulfatides are potent anti-inflammatory agents (52).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	202	 This potential relationship likely indicates a possible role of ST in apoE particles as an anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory molecule.

0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	9	Since then, this potential association has been examined in over 40 samples (4, 5) (table 1) from around the world.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Several studies replicated the report of increased risk for I positives, just a few contradicted it, and many found no association with Alzheimer's disease.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	11	 One study suggested an effect of age on the association (6), and another proposed an influence of gender (7).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	12	 An association with onset age of Alzheimer's disease has also been proposed (8).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Cohorts used in the meta-analysis of the ACE* insertion-deletion polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	14	  The association has recently been studied in the longitudinal, observational cohorts of the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) and the Rotterdam Study (9).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Both groups found a suggestion of a gender difference in their results, consistent with a previous report (7).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	16	 We therefore undertook a meta-analysis of studies of the association of the ACE indel with Alzheimer's disease, stratified by gender, by age, by ethnic group, and by apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4) carrier status, using mainly primary data, supplied by authors.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	17	Although three previous meta-analyses of ACE studies had been reported (10 to 12), subsequent studies have now made further data available.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Compared even with the latest meta-analysis (12), 10 more samples from eight studies were available to us (9, 13 to 18, and the above study of the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In addition, all previous meta-analyses were based on published data, that is, largely unstratified, and were thus limited in the interpretations they allowed.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Using primary data, we were able to explore more deeply, searching for sources of heterogeneity.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Two previous stratified meta-analyses of Alzheimer's disease genes (19, 20), based on primary data, have both deepened our understanding.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	22	 (21) have stressed the need to examine sources of heterogeneity in meta-analyses of case-control studies.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	23	 We therefore divided our analysis into two phases: first, a broad overall analysis and, second, the detailed examination of sources of heterogeneity.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	24	 We aimed to discover whether the ACE indel is associated with Alzheimer's disease and, if so, the nature of that association.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	25	Phase 2: examination of heterogeneity We examined six possible sources of heterogeneity.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We performed analyses stratified by age, gender, and APOE*4 status.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	27	 For the age stratifications ( < 65 years, 65 to 75 years, and  > 75 years), we divided the samples into two groups, according to how the ages of cases had been defined, for example, at onset (first group) or at examination or death (second group).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We also conducted analyses restricted to controls and to diagnoses of probable or definite Alzheimer's disease according to criteria of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) (25) or of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) (26) (26 full samples and two part samples).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In separate analyses, we excluded eight samples where Hardy-Weinberg analysis and genotyping methods were compatible with mistyping.

0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In further analyses, samples were placed where possible (34 of 39 samples) in one of three ethnic groups: North European (19 samples); South Caucasian (11 samples), defined here as from the Mediterranean or from the Middle East; and East Asian (four samples), from China or from Japan.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	32	Data analysis and statistical methods Three methods are commonly used to produce odds ratios in genetic association studies: method 1, allelic (i.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	33	 I in this case); method 2, comparing each genotype with one other in turn (e.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	34	 DI); method 3, comparing each genotype in turn with the other two combined.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	35	 All three methods are subject to bias, the degree of bias depending on how imperfectly the model fits reality.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	36	 For instance, method 1 is best suited to testing a codominant model, where there is an allelic dose effect (e.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Method 3, on the other hand, may be used to test either an I-dominant/D-recessive or a D-dominant/I-recessive model.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	38	 We chose to follow the hypothesis-generating study (1) in using method 3, partly because preliminary examination of subsequent studies had shown no evidence of codominance.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	39	 We also used both methods 2 and 3 to examine heterosis (heterozygotes at greater or lesser risk than either homozygote).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Our main approach, method 3, gives an estimate of the risk associated with each genotype when compared with the rest of the population.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	41	Pooled odds ratios were calculated three times, by the fixed-effects method of Mantel and Haenszel (29), by the random-effects method of DerSimonian and Laird (30), and by the Bayesian random-effects method of Warn et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	42	 However, as the results of all three methods were very similar, only those of the first two are shown (table 2).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The methods of meta-analysis permit the accumulation of results across independent studies, even where the number of subjects or the ratio of cases to controls varies considerably, as here in the cohort of Sleegers et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The heterogeneity test was by the method of Armitage (32).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Logistic regression analysis was used to compare odds ratios among ethnic groups.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Funnel plots (33) and cumulative meta-analysis (34) were used to investigate bias.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Analyses were performed using "R" (35) and the package "rmeta" by Thomas Lumley (http://www.

0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Both stratified analyses and linear regression analysis were performed on these data and also on a subset of 10 North European samples, comprising 1,822 cases of Alzheimer's disease.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	92	 No effect of ACE*I carrier status on onset age of Alzheimer's disease and, surprisingly, only a modest effect of APOE*4 carrier status on onset age were seen (data not shown).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	93	Phase 2: examination of heterogeneity We examined six potential sources of heterogeneity: age, gender, race, APOE*4 status, misdiagnosis, and mistyping.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	94	Stratification by gender and by APOE*4 status.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	95	 No significant effects were seen of gender or of APOE*4 status on the associations with Alzheimer's disease, nor did stratification by either of these two factors remove the heterogeneity (data not shown).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	96	 We calculated the odds ratios of Alzheimer's disease for ACE*D homozygotes versus I positives when stratified by age ( < 65 years, 65 to 75 years, and  > 75 years).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Rather little effect of age was seen on the association of D homozygotes with Alzheimer's disease (data not shown), nor was there any reduction in heterogeneity on stratification by age.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	98	 We repeated the overall analyses of the three genotypes, restricting the data to the 28 samples that could be limited to the more rigorous diagnoses of probable or definite Alzheimer's disease according to criteria of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (25) or the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (26).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The odds ratios were similar to those shown in table 2, that is, significant odds ratios by the method of DerSimonian and Laird (30) of 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	100	15 for heterozygotes and a nonsignificant odds ratio of 1.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Heterogeneity remained for D homozygotes (p = 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	102	005) but was no longer significant (p = 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	103	 There were 12 instances of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium in individual studies and four in the six groups of pooled cases and controls analyzed by race (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	104	 We therefore excluded the eight samples where mistyping was considered possible, that is, underreporting of heterozygotes, taking into account both genotyping methods and Hardy-Weinberg analysis.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	105	 We then repeated the overall analyses with the remaining 31 samples.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	106	 The odds ratios were similar to those in table 2, that is, significant odds ratios of 0.

0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	112	 This removed nearly all heterogeneity (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Table 3 shows clear differences among the three ethnic groups.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	114	 There was no overlap whatsoever in allelic frequencies among the three groups.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	115	 North Europeans and East Asians differed in the odds ratios for D homozygotes versus I positives (p = 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	116	0008) and for I homozygotes versus D positives (p = 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	117	 South Caucasians also differed from East Asians in the odds ratio for D homozygotes versus I positives (p = 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	118	 D homozygotes were at reduced risk in all groups, but particularly in East Asians.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Heterozygotes were at increased risk in North Europeans.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	120	 I homozygotes were at higher risk in East Asians, except by Bayesian analysis.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	121	 We further examined heterosis (heterozygotes at greater risk) in North Europeans, by comparing DI with DD and with II in turn.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	122	 We found that heterozygotes were at higher risk than D homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	123	25, 95 percent confidence interval: 1.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	124	45) but not significantly higher than I homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	125	08, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	126	ACE*D homozygotes were at reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (table 2) in each of the three main ethnic groups examined (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	127	 I homozygotes were neutral as regards Alzheimer's disease risk (table 2), except in East Asians, in whom I homozygotes may be at higher risk (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Heterozygotes were at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease overall (table 2) and mainly in North Europeans (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	129	 This example of heterosis will be discussed below.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Very similar results were achieved by three methods: fixed effects, random effects, and Bayesian random effects (refer to Materials and Methods and table 2).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Only genotypic comparisons were made (refer to Materials and Methods), which showed that there was no allelic dose effect, except in East Asians (table 3), and that thus allelic comparisons would have proved less informative.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	132	These findings of odds ratios close to 1, even though significantly different from 1 (tables 2 and 3), suggest either linkage disequilibrium with the true risk factor or confounding by a hidden interaction or both.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The second possibility is discussed below.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Regarding the former, Kehoe et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	135	 (1) in their study of ACE haplotypes gave evidence that the indel may not be the actual risk factor but rather in linkage disequilibrium with a nearby functional polymorphism that is the true risk factor.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	136	 ACE haplotype analysis has also proved of value with other phenotypes, such as enzyme levels (36), insulin levels, myocardial infarction, and obesity (37).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Future Alzheimer's disease studies may do better to examine polymorphisms in the regulatory regions, rather than the indel.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	138	The overall results were consistent with those of Kehoe et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	139	 (1) from 1999 and also with those of the recent meta-analyses of Kehoe et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	140	 (11) from 2003 and of Elkins et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The latter report (12) also suggested an age difference, however, although actual ages were not available to them, only mean cohort ages, and they did not take into account the different ways of defining case ages (refer to Materials and Methods), a strongly confounding factor.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Because of the latter problem, we cannot exclude the possibility that the association might be stronger in younger cases, for example, in those aged less than 65 years at onset or less than 75 years at death.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	143	Heterogeneity Our overall results showed heterogeneity (table 2).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Heterogeneity may be due to differences in sample selection (e.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	145	, in age, gender, or diagnosis) or in methods (e.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	146	, of genotyping), or it may be due to real differences in populations (e.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	147	, in race) or in interactions with other risk factors (e.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	148	 We examined all of these potential sources of heterogeneity.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	149	 We found little effect of age, gender, or APOE*4 status, thus confounding our initial hypothesis.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Both diagnostic and genotyping differences contributed some heterogeneity.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The former was mainly due to the diagnosis of "possible Alzheimer's disease," reported to have a poor record of confirmation at autopsy (38).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The latter was largely due to certain genotyping methods that may lead to underreporting of heterozygotes (27, 28), as shown by Hardy-Weinberg analysis.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	153	However, the greatest source of heterogeneity was ethnic differences.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Ethnic stratification removed nearly all heterogeneity (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	155	 There were clear contrasts among the three ethnic groups examined (North Europeans, South Caucasians, and East Asians) in allelic frequencies and in odds ratios (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The latter might be due to differences in linkage disequilibrium with the true risk polymorphism (see above).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Some of these ethnic differences had previously been pointed out by Panza et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	158	 These contrasts highlight the dangers of combining ethnic groups within a single cohort, even North and South Europeans, as indicated by Panza et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Unfortunately, there was only one cohort of African origin, from the United States (41).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Thus, no conclusions could be drawn about Africans.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	161	Heterosis Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are common in studies of the ACE indel, as previously pointed out by Buss et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	162	 This may be due to either mistyping or heterosis.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Several cases of such disequilibrium were indeed compatible with mistyping.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Most examples of disequilibrium in North Europeans, however, were of an excess of heterozygotes in Alzheimer's disease, which requires another explanation.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	165	 We believe that explanation is heterosis.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Heterosis occurs when heterozygotes show either a greater or lesser association with a given trait than does either group of homozygotes.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	167	 In this case, in North Europeans, both an excess of heterozygotes in Alzheimer's disease and an association of heterozygotes with Alzheimer's disease were found.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Comings and MacMurray (42) have suggested three explanations for heterosis, of which their second can be applied here.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	169	 This proposes that heterosis may follow from the inadvertent combination of two unlike subsets due to a hidden interaction with another, unknown risk factor.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	170	 To test this proposal, we constructed a mathematical model with two equal subsets based on a median split of an unknown factor X (table 4).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The model illustrates how, although heterozygotes may have intermediate odds ratios in each subset, they can emerge with the highest odds ratio when the subsets are combined (i.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The overall results of this illustrative model (table 4) were very close to those of the present meta-analysis (table 2).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	173	 We should stress, however, that heterosis was found only in North Europeans.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Moreover, although heterozygotes were at greater risk than D homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	175	25, 95 percent confidence interval: 1.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	176	45), they were not at significantly higher risk than I homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	177	08, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Thus, partial heterosis better describes this case.

0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	180	  A hidden interaction Partial heterosis in North Europeans suggests an interaction with another risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, another potential source of heterogeneity.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Candidates include cardiovascular risk factors, since many also contribute to Alzheimer's disease risk and since the ACE indel has been associated with cardiovascular risk (43 to 47).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	182	Biologic background Full discussion of the biologic basis of these associations is outside the scope of this mainly analytical study.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	183	 However, we note the associations of the ACE indel and of nearby polymorphisms with various phenotypes, including cardiovascular risk (37, 43 to 47).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	184	 In addition, ACE protein levels are raised in certain brain regions with Alzheimer's disease (48 to 50), the enzyme has been reported to modify ss-amyloid aggregation (51), ACE inhibitors have been reported to maintain memory in aged rats (52) and in human patients (53), and brain-penetrating ACE inhibitors have been associated with both reduced incidence of Alzheimer's disease in elderly hypertensive patients (54) and less cognitive decline in cases with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (55).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	185	 (9) have recently provided evidence from magnetic resonance imaging of increased atrophy in both the hippocampus and amygdala of nondemented women homozygous for the ACE*I allele, together with a modest but significant increase in risk of Alzheimer's disease, independent of vascular factors.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The D allele is associated with raised plasma levels of ACE (2), but that association is thought to be due to linkage disequilibrium with other nearby polymorphisms (3, 36).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	187	 There is an apparent conflict between the benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy and the associations of the indel with Alzheimer's disease risk and pathology and with plasma levels of ACE.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	188	 However, the influence of ACE polymorphisms on brain levels of the enzyme is not yet known and cannot be assumed to reflect the levels in plasma.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	189	 This subject warrants fuller discussion than is possible here.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	190	 A more detailed discussion is given by Kehoe (56), although it will need to be reconsidered and perhaps revised in the light of any interacting factor or factors that may emerge in future studies.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	191	Limitations of this meta-analysis The lack of information from some authors was a limitation, but we obtained full data on 84 percent of subjects.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The quality of diagnosis and of genotyping varied among studies, but our overall results were not changed when these questions were taken into account.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	193	 There was considerable heterogeneity in our initial results.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	194	 However, we found the main sources of that heterogeneity and were able to remove it.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Since cardiovascular factors are strong candidates for a potential interaction with ACE variants, the lack of data available to us on those factors was a limitation, which we hope will be overcome by future studies.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Cardiovascular factors might also have influenced our results through selective mortality.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	197	 However, D homozygotes have only a very slightly increased risk of cardiovascular complications (43 to 47, 57) and little evidence of any association with reduced life span (57 to 62).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Thus, the influence of selective mortality, if any, is likely to be very small and not enough to provide an alternative explanation for our findings.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	199	Conclusions We suggest that this large study has established the ACE indel as a marker of Alzheimer's disease risk, since we found no evidence of bias, we found and removed the main sources of heterogeneity, we excluded various potential interactions, and significant results remained in each of the three ethnic groups examined.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The indel, however, is probably in linkage disequilibrium with the true risk polymorphism (11).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	201	 There were marked contrasts among the three ethnic groups studied (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	202	 We also found evidence of an interaction with another risk factor in North Europeans.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Potential interactions with other factors than age, gender, and APOE*4 status should be examined, particularly interactions with cardiovascular risk factors.

0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	15	Apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene polymorphism plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, but in addition has recently also been suggested to regulate inflammation, as measured by levels of C-reactive protein [2].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The gene for apoE is polymorphic, presenting with three common alleles (2, 3, 4) at a single gene locus on chromosome 19.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These alleles form six genotypes: E2/2, E3/2, E4/2, E3/3, E4/3 and E4/4, of which E3/3 is the commonest and E4/3 the second commonest in most populations.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The presence of the apoE 4 allele is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease and Alzheimer's disease [reviewed in 3].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	19	Circulating testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels have recently been found to be associated with the apoE genotype and women carrying the apoE 4 allele thus to be more susceptible to the development of some diseases associated with the menopause [4].

0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	21	 We hypothesized that apoE could be a candidate gene for susceptibility to pSS and, further, that the genetic polymorphism of apoE could exert an effect on markers of inflammation in patients with pSS.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Hence, the aims of the present study were to investigate in a well-characterized group of Finnish Caucasian patients with pSS the effect of the polymorphism of apoE gene on susceptibility to and severity of pSS, particularly on markers of inflammation and age of onset of pSS.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	23	Clinical methods A careful clinical examination together with an in-depth interview with the patients, covering previous diseases, duration of sicca symptoms and existence of recurrent salivary gland swellings, had recently been conducted with these patients [8].

0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The number of diagnostic criteria for pSS did not differ between these patient groups (data not shown).
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The histological grade in labial salivary gland biopsies was lower in apoE 4 carriers than in non-carriers (grade 3 to 4 in 56 vs 80%, P = 0.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	65	Discussion Genetic variation of the apoE gene influences susceptibility to coronary heart disease and sporadic Alzheimer's disease, apoE 4 being the allele with the strong association.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Recently, genetic variation in the apoE gene was also found to affect the degree of inflammation by influencing serum CRP levels in dyslipidaemic middle-aged men [2].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Surprisingly, however, it was the patients carrying the apoE 4 allele, known to be associated with inflammation, who were found to have lower CRP levels than the others [2].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	68	In patients with pSS, chronic inflammation is present, as shown by markedly elevated ESR levels, pronounced hypergammaglobulinaemia and elevated IL-6 levels.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	69	 We therefore hypothesized that genetic polymorphism of the apoE could have an effect on markers of inflammation in patients with pSS.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	70	 However, this proved not to be the case: first, no differences were found in the apoE genotype or allele frequencies between pSS patients and healthy controls.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Moreover, the apoE 4 allele did not influence the levels of CRP in patients with pSS.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	72	 This finding might be explained by the fact that pSS is known to belong to a group of autoimmune diseases with a modest or even absent CRP reaction [10].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	73	 However, in addition to lack of differences in CRP levels, no differences emerged in any other well-established markers of inflammatory activity, including plasma IL-6, TNF- and IgG between apoE 4 carriers and non-carriers.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The apoE 4 carrier state was also not associated with clinical features of the disease.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Labial salivary gland histology, a marker of severity of inflammation in pSS, was even milder in apoE 4 allele carriers compared with non-carriers.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	76	We found that the age at disease onset was significantly lower in pSS patients with the apoE 4 allele than in those without this allele.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Similarly, it has been noted that the effect of the apoE 4 allele on coronary atherosclerosis [11] and Alzheimer's disease [12] is age-dependent.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Moreover, in recent studies, apoE polymorphism has also been found to affect the age at onset of infectious diseases [13, 14].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	79	 ApoE polymorphism was found to affect the age of becoming infected with Plasmodium falciparum in children from Ghana [13] and to have a possible role in protection against the early stages of malaria [14].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Epstein to Barr, cytomegalovirus or retrovirus infections have been proposed to act as triggering agents in the development of pSS in genetically susceptible subjects [15].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	81	 There are no data on apoE polymorphism and susceptibility to or age at disease onset related to these infections.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	82	 We do not know the background to the significant association between apoE 4 and earlier disease onset of pSS.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	83	 One might speculate, however, that this association could be mediated, for example, through a possible effect on the time-point of a triggering viral infection.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	84	A further speculative explanation for the earlier age at onset of pSS, particularly in female subjects carrying the apoE 4 allele, might be a relation to hormonal factors, which in view of the strong female predominance among patients with pSS are also believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of pSS [15].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	85	 The gender bias and the concomitant characteristic late age of disease onset in pSS have been difficult to interpret, as oestrogens have been considered to favour autoimmunity and androgens to protect from it.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Carriers of apoE 4 have been held to be more susceptible to the development of some diseases associated with menopause, as they have been found to have higher serum DHEA and testosterone levels than women not carrying this allele [4].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Furthermore, an interaction between oestrogen and apoE in the Alzheimer's disease process has been observed; in a recent study apoE polymorphism influenced binding to the oestrogen receptor and altered transcriptional activity in response to oestrogen [16].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	88	We have demonstrated that apoE polymorphism does not affect susceptibility to pSS or plasma inflammatory indices in patients with pSS, but there is a clear association between apoE 4 allele and early onset of pSS.

0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	6	Received for publication, February 3, 2004 , and in revised form, March 29, 2004.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	7	Lipid removal by apoA-I involves a cAMP-inducible active transport pathway (2) and is known to be mediated by the ATP-binding cassette transporter-1 (ABCA1/ABC-1) (3).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These transporters are membrane proteins that utilize ATP hydrolysis to transport substrates across membranes (4).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Mutations in ABCA1/ABC-1 cause Tangier disease (TD), a severe HDL deficiency syndrome characterized by very low plasma levels of HDL and apoA-I, accumulation of cholesterol in tissue macrophages, and a predisposition to atherosclerosis (5 to 7).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Fibroblasts from subjects with Tangier disease show impaired cholesterol and phospholipid release to lipid-free apolipoproteins (8).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In addition, inhibition of ABCA1 expression or activity inhibits lipid efflux to apoA-I in normal fibroblasts (3, 6).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	12	Properties additional to induction of cholesterol efflux may contribute to the anti-atherogenic effect of apoA-1.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Human atherosclerotic lesions contain apoE protein and mRNA, especially in association with macrophage foam cells (9).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Secretion of apoE by macrophages may protect against atherosclerosis, as indicated by the effects of transplantation of apoE-expressing bone marrow into apoE-null mice (10, 11).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This may depend upon enhanced local clearance of cellular lipids and/or inhibition of local inflammatory responses, in addition to lowering plasma concentrations of atherogenic plasma lipoproteins.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Recent studies demonstrated that apoA-I stimulates both apoE secretion and cholesterol efflux from human and mouse foam cell macrophages (12, 13).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Stimulation of apoE secretion by apoA-I and by HDL is most likely post-transcriptionally regulated and is observed for both endogenous apoE (macrophages) and recycled apoE (hepatocytes) (12 to 15).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Recent studies indicate that ABCA1 may be involved in basal apoE secretion (16).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, the requirement for ABCA1 activity in apoA-I-induced apoE secretion has never been reported.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	20	In this study we provide evidence that apoA-I-stimulated apoE secretion is mechanistically distinct from its stimulation of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	21	 We demonstrate that apoA-I promotes secretion of a mobile pool of apoE, which is otherwise destined for intracellular degradation, that this process does not require interactions between the C terminus of apoA-I and the plasma membrane and occurs normally in macrophages of patients with Tangier disease, implying independence from ABCA1 activity.

0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	358	01 relative to control media) and control HMDM (3.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	359	01 relative to control media), achieving the same total apoE secretion from TD1-HMDM and HC1-HMDM.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	360	 Thus, despite severely impaired ABCA-1-mediated cholesterol efflux, apoA-I stimulated apoE secretion normally from TD macrophages.

0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	368	 Basal cholesterol efflux was similar in the four subjects (0.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	369	 ApoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux from TD2 cells was severely impaired relative to all other family members, confirming dysfunctional ABCA1.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	370	 Despite this, apoA-I strongly and equally increased apoE secretion from all macrophages, including TD2-HMDM.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	371	 These findings support our structural studies and clearly dissociate apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux via ABCA1, from apoA-I-induced apoE secretion.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	372	In previous studies, including our own, the secretion of apoE after exposure of cells to HDL or apoA-I has been concurrent with the efflux of cholesterol (12 to 15,60).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	373	 However, cyclodextrin-stimulated cholesterol efflux in itself does not induce apoE secretion, and acute inhibition of apoE synthesis and secretion with cycloheximide does not inhibit cholesterol efflux to apoA-I (13).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	374	 The latter observations dissociate stimulation of apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux and apoE secretion.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	375	 A similar dissociation was earlier reported for HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux and apoE secretion (61).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	376	 We have investigated in detail the structural and functional requirements for apoA-I-induced apoE secretion and identify these as being quite distinct from those required for apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	377	ApoA-I does not increase macrophage apoE mRNA levels, and pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that apoA-I stimulates secretion of newly synthesized apoE, confirming that apoA-I-stimulates apoE secretion post-transcriptionally.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	378	 Modeling of pulse-chase data indicated that human macrophages contain a larger mobile pool of apoE (Em), and a lesser, more stable pool of apoE (Es).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	379	 Previous studies indicate that such heterogeneous pools of apoE may include apoE on the cell surface (47).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	380	 Pronase treatment of human macrophages under our experimental conditions indicates that only a small proportion of Es is on the cell surface.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	381	2 Em is, on the basis of our biotin-labeling and 4  degrees C displacement studies, in part derived from the cell surface pool of apoE, and apoA-I increases secretion and concurrently diminishes degradation of apoE from this pool.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	382	 However, as the biotin-labeled pool represents only a minor proportion of total apoE secreted ( < 2%), its quantitative significance is unclear.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	383	 These data are consistent with either continual displacement of apoE from the cell surface with its recycling and ongoing replenishment from intracellular pools (41), or is consistent with two sources of secreted apoE, a smaller cell surface pool and a larger intracellular pool, both of which are mobilized by apoA-I.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	384	It is clear that the structural requirements for apoA-I-mediated apoE secretion are distinct from those required for cholesterol efflux.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	385	 Our studies of recombinant (pro-)apoA-I molecules demonstrate that deletion of the C terminus of apoA-I enhances apoE secretion whereas it impairs cholesterol efflux and phospholipid efflux.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	386	 This is remarkable as all previous studies of apoA-I function have emphasized the importance of its lipid binding C-terminal domain for functional integrity and for binding to the extracellular matrix of the cell surface (62).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	387	 That C-terminal deletion enhances apoE secretion suggests that apoA-I does not bind to extracellular matrix to achieve this (62).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	388	 This is consistent with our previous studies indicating that heparinase pretreatment does not inhibit apoA-I-mediated apoE secretion from primary macrophages (13).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	389	The central domain of apoA-I regulates LCAT activity (63) and HDL-mediated inhibition of macrophage homing to atherosclerotic plaque (64).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	390	 Deletion of this central region of apoA-I (d123 to 166) was the only modification that decreased the stimulation of apoE secretion by apoA-I.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	391	 As this domain affects apoA-I flexibility (29), it suggests that for whole apoA-I, flexibility is more important than lipid affinity in inducing apoE secretion.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	392	 It is unlikely to contain an epitope specific for apoA-I-induced apoE secretion given that -helical peptides away from this domain, and other apolipoproteins, also induced apoE secretion.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	393	 Whether apolipoprotein flexibility is also important for other apolipoproteins, e.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	394	 apoA-II, apoA-IV, and apoEs, is unknown.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	395	Systematic comparison of individual -helical peptides of apoA-I identified that only the C-terminal -helical peptide was capable of independently inducing cholesterol efflux from primary human macrophages, consistent with earlier studies (50).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	396	 In contrast, all -helical peptides stimulated apoE secretion.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	397	 As cholesterol efflux to peptides is related to their lipid affinity (50), this property does not appear to determine induction of apoE secretion.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	398	 Stimulation of apoE secretion appears to be a general structural property of -helical proteins and peptides, which, in the case of whole apoA-I, can be enhanced by overall protein flexibility and inhibited by lipid binding to the plasma membrane.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	399	One of our most striking observations was the enhanced secretion of apoE to apoA-I-POPC discs relative to apoA-I.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	400	 This was not observed with apoA-II, which stimulated apoE secretion to the same extent in free or lipid-bound state.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	401	 The difference in response to lipidation of apoA-I and apoA-II is interesting given that cholesterol efflux to both apolipoproteins increased with lipidation.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	402	 Apolipoprotein-mediated apoE secretion may allow subsequent binding of secreted apoE to exogenous phospholipids, and this could explain some apparent synergy between apoA-I and POPC.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	403	 However, association of apoE with apoA-I- or apoA-II-POPC discs would be expected to require displacement of apoA-I or apoA-II and/or to increase the apparent size of POPC-containing particles, neither of which were found on non-denaturing gel electrophoresis.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	404	 The absence of synergy between apoA-II and POPC therefore suggests conformational changes unique to apoA-I occur during its lipidation.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	405	 We suggest that apoA-I exposes more polar, non-lipid bound residues as a POPC disc than does apoA-II, and that this enhances interaction with exposed residues of apoE on the cell surface, or with undefined plasma membrane sites critical for stimulating vesicular trafficking of apoE to the cell surface.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	406	ApoA-I, A-II, A-IV, E3, and apolipoprotein-phospholipid discs all stimulated apoE secretion efficiently, indicating stimulation of apoE secretion is of broad relevance in vivo.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	407	 The ability of apoE to stimulate apoE secretion is highly significant, as local (autocrine) secretion of apoE in the artery wall could mediate further apoE secretion from neighboring cells, independently of the requirement for plasma-derived HDL species.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	408	 ApoE4 increases the risk of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease relative to apoE3 (65).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	409	 Reduced local stimulation of apoE secretion by apoE4 in the artery or in the CNS might contribute to disease states associated with the apoE4 phenotype.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	410	 ApoE4 differs from apoE3 in a single amino acid substitution, arginine instead of cysteine in position 112.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	411	 This confers a more positive apoE charge, and causes conformational change to the N-terminal helix of apoE4, as a salt bridge forms between Arg112 and Glu109, and this alters the conformation of Arg61, which interacts with Glu255 (55).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	412	 E4 also differs from E3 and E2 in lacking the potential for disulfide formation and self-association.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	413	 In a previous study, Smith et al.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	414	 (2) identified that the binding of E2, E3, and E4 to RAW macrophages, and the cholesterol efflux induced by these isoforms, were the same.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	415	 Our studies confirmed similar efflux to the various apoE isoforms, supporting that differences in inducible apoE secretion cannot be explained by altered efflux, or binding.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	416	 A recent study indicates that apoE4 has a higher lipid affinity than other apoE isoforms (56), and in this respect, these data support our observations that C-terminal deletions of apoA-I, which diminish its lipid affinity enhance its ability to induce apoE secretion.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	417	That apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux and apoE secretion are independently regulated was directly confirmed by apoA-I-stimulated apoE secretion in two unrelated subjects with clinical, molecular, and cellular phenotype of Tangier disease.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	418	 Despite impaired ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux and severely reduced basal apoE secretion, apoA-I stimulated apoE secretion normally.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	419	 Recent studies have shown that apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux via ABCA1 is linked to accelerated secretory vesicular transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, and this is absent in Tangier disease fibroblasts (66).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	420	 As apoA-I stimulated apoE secretion normally from Tangier disease macrophages, we conclude that apoA-I must stimulate a distinct pathway of apoE secretion unrelated to its interactions with ABCA1 or its stimulation of cholesterol efflux.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	421	 As apoE secretion induced by apoA-I is severalfold greater than basal apoE secretion, ABCA1-independent secretion is likely to be quantitatively more important than that related to ABCA1 activity.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	422	 To our knowledge these findings represent the first reported non-ABCA1-mediated cellular process mediated by apoA-I.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	423	It is unlikely that apoA-I stimulates apoE secretion by directly inhibiting lysosomal or proteasomal degradation of apoE.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	424	 ApoE is degraded in the lysosomal and proteasomal compartments (67) (68), and, although direct inhibition of lysosomal and cysteine proteases does inhibit apoE degradation, this does not increase apoE secretion (58).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	425	 The possibility that apoA-I exchanges with cellular apoE such that apoA-I is degraded in place of apoE also seems unlikely, as the mass of apoA-I degraded corresponds to  < 30% of the mass of apoE secreted from human macrophages during time course experiments.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	426	3 It is more likely that apoA-I promotes apoE secretion by inhibiting its trafficking to degradatory compartments such as the lysosome and proteasome, or by stimulating vesicular traffic to the plasma membrane analogous to effects described in fibroblasts (66).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	427	 Although HDL stimulates a range of protein kinase C-dependent and -independent signaling pathways, these are not necessarily activated by apoA-I (69), and the mechanisms by which apoA-I regulates vesicle traffic in general, and protein secretion in particular, require further investigation.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	428	We conclude that apoA-I-mediated apoE secretion has structural requirements distinct from those regulating the stimulation of cholesterol efflux, facilitated by the central hinge region of apoA-I but inhibited by its C-terminal domain, and is independent of macrophage ABCA1 activity.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	429	 This represents a novel, ABCA-1-independent, positive feedback process for secretion of anti-atherogenic, cholesterol-efflux-inducing apoE by -helix-containing molecules.

0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Participants were asked to discuss their history of severe hypoglycemia with family, partners, or friends before completing questionnaires to improve accuracy of estimates.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The total number of lifetime episodes, frequency of episodes, and total numbers of hypoglycemic seizures, coma, and episodes requiring medical intervention were recorded.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	42	 DNA was extracted from venous blood from all subjects using standard methods.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	43	 APOE genotyping was performed using a PCR-restriction fragment-length polymorphism assay as described by Wenham et al.

0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Severe hypoglycemia was dichotomized into two groups (group 1 = naive to severe hypoglycemia; group 2 = previously exposed to severe hypoglycemia) based upon the total number of previous episodes.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	47	 APOE genotype was categorized into two groups (4-, 4+).
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	48	 MANCOVA was used to determine the significance (P) and magnitude (Eta2) of the variables  effects on cognitive performance.

0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	54	 The subgroups had similar premorbid intellectual ability (NART) and similar exposure to severe hypoglycemia.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Those possessing 4 were slightly older (P = 0.

0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	59	 The APOE 4 allele was associated with a disadvantage in current intellectual performance (WAIS-R performance test score, P = 0.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	60	072) and a trend toward poorer frontal lobe and executive functions (Borkowski Verbal Fluency, P = 0.

0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The relative disadvantage associated with APOE 4 appeared to be sex-specific (APOE x sex interaction: F = 2.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Because of the sex specificity, MANCOVA thereafter was performed separately for men and women, using a similar model but excluding sex as a between-subjects factor.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	64	 APOE genotype significantly influenced cognitive ability in women but not in men (Table 4).
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Women with APOE 4 exhibited a significant cognitive disadvantage affecting current intellectual performance (WAIS-R performance test score, P = 0.

0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	71	 There was no statistical evidence of a detrimental interaction between APOE genotype, previous exposure to severe hypoglycemia, and cognitive ability (APOE x severe hypoglycemia interaction: F = 0.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The cognitive ability of subjects with the APOE 4 allele, subdivided into those exposed previously to severe hypoglycemia (n = 15) and those with naive to severe hypoglycemia (n = 6), is shown in Table 2.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	73	 No significant difference in cognitive ability was demonstrated between the subgroups, although the numbers of subjects in this analysis are too small to be confident of a nonsignificant difference (Table 4).
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	74	Laboratory and clinical evidence supports the concept of 4-associated premature cognitive aging in diabetes.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Elderly people with type 2 diabetes and the 4 allele exhibit greater cognitive decrement (23) and an accelerated cognitive decline (24) compared with age-matched 4 healthy control subjects; APOE from people with diabetes is irreversibly glycated and exhibits less in vitro bioactivity (25) when compared with nondiabetic control subjects.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	76	 APOE bioactivity appears to have clinical relevance, as outcomes from a variety of cerebral pathologies are poorer in individuals possessing the least biologically active E4 isoform (8).
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	77	 As the present study did not include a healthy comparator group, the notion that APOE 4 is associated with premature cognitive aging in type 1 diabetes is speculative at present, whereas this has been demonstrated in type 2 diabetes (23,24).
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	78	The present study did not support the hypothesis that polymorphism of the APOE gene may contribute to the susceptibility to hypoglycemia-induced cognitive decrement in people with type 1 diabetes.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The number of subjects in each 4 subgroup (n = 15 with previous severe hypoglycemia vs.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	80	 n = 6 hypoglycemia naive) does not give sufficient power to allow definitive conclusions, and further, appropriately powered investigation is required to evaluate this hypothesis.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Irrespective of the influence of APOE alleles, cognitive performance was unaffected by severe hypoglycemia per se, consistent with the conclusions of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (3) and the Stockholm Diabetes Intervention Study (4), in which many participants had type 1 diabetes of relatively short duration, but conflicting with retrospective cross-sectional studies (2) that examined older subjects with diabetes of long duration.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	82	In conclusion, the data in this modestly powered study suggest that APOE 4 confers a cognitive disadvantage in young women who have type 1 diabetes.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Further investigation is required to verify these findings and to determine whether the APOE 4 allele is associated with premature or accelerated cognitive aging in people who have type 1 diabetes, the diabetes-specific factors that may be mediating any such disadvantage, and the possible interaction with sex.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, October 14, 2004.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	4	ApoE comprises a single polypeptide chain of 299 amino acid residues and contains two independently folded functional domains, a 22-kDa N-terminal domain (residues 1 to 191) and a 10-kDa C-terminal domain (residues 222 to 299) (2, 13).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The N-terminal domain is folded into a four-helix bundle of amphipathic -helices and contains the LDLR binding region (around residues 136 to 150 in helix 4) (14, 15).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The C-terminal domain also contains amphipathic -helices that are involved in binding to lipoprotein particles (2, 16, 17).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Both the N- and C-terminal domains contain a heparin binding site (18, 19).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The N-terminal domain site is located between residues 136 and 147, overlapping with the LDLR binding region (20, 21), whereas the C-terminal site involves basic residues around lysine 233 (22).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Although both sites are functional in the separated fragments, only the N-terminal site is available for interaction in both the lipid-free and lipidated states of the intact apoE molecule (22).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	10	In humans, apoE is a polymorphic protein with three major isoforms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, each differing by cysteine and arginine at positions 112 and 158 (11).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	11	 ApoE3, the most common form, contains cysteine and arginine at these positions, respectively, whereas apoE2 contains cysteine and apoE4 contains arginine at both sites.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Both apoE3 and apoE4 bind with equally high affinity to the LDLR, but apoE2 has defective binding to the LDLR and is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia (23).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	13	 ApoE4 is associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease and is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (3, 24, 25).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	14	A cluster of arginine and lysine residues located on the polar face of the fourth amphipathic -helix in the N-terminal bundle represents the binding site for cell-surface receptors (2).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Despite the apparent accessibility of these basic residues, interaction of apoE with lipid is necessary for its high affinity binding to the LDLR (26).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Recent studies indicate that lipid binding induces opening of the helix bundle in the N-terminal domain (27, 28); this increases exposure of lysines 143 and 146 to the aqueous phase and thereby enhances interaction with acidic elements of the LDLR (29).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Disruption of the amphipathic -helix spanning residues 140 to 150 abolishes LDLR binding, indicating that this structural motif in apoE is critical for function (30).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In contrast to binding to the LDLR, the stringency for binding of apoE to the LRP or HSPG appears to be less severe.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Lipid association of apoE is not required for binding to the LRP (31) or HSPG (22, 32), although the same apoE domain spanning residues 136 to 150 is involved in the binding (21, 33).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	20	 ApoE2 that is highly defective in LDLR binding activity ( < 2% of normal apoE3 activity) has significant binding activity to LRP (40 to 50% of apoE3) (23) and HSPG (50 to 90% of apoE3) (6).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The detailed molecular features that control high affinity binding of apoE to the LRP and HSPG are not yet defined fully.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	22	Previously, we have characterized the effect of point mutations of the basic residues present in the heparin binding sites on the equilibrium parameters defining interaction of apoE with heparin (22).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	23	 To predict the distribution of apoE to different receptors, such as LDLR, LRP, and HSPG, however, it is also important to establish the kinetics of apoE-receptor association and dissociation because receptor/ligand interactions at the cell surface do not occur at equilibrium.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In this study, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were employed to determine the affinity and kinetics of the interaction of engineered apoE molecules in the lipid-free and lipidated states with heparin.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Using this approach, we provide novel insights into the mechanism of apoE/heparin interaction.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	26	Expression and Purification of Proteins The full-length human apoE2, apoE3, apoE4 and their 22-kDa, 12-kDa, and 10-kDa fragments were expressed and purified as described previously (34).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	27	 All mutants of apoE were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The cDNA was ligated into a thioredoxin fusion expression vector pET32a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) and transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 star (DE3) (Invitrogen).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The resulting thioredoxin-apoE fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (28).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	30	 For the apoE3 22-kDa (L141K/K143L/K146L/L148K) mutant that was expressed as insoluble protein, the proteins were solubilized from the cell pellet using 6 M urea (30).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The apoE preparations were at least 95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In all experiments, the apoE sample was freshly dialyzed from 1% -mercaptoethanol and 6 M guanidine HCl solution into Tris buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The disulfide-linked apoE4 22-kDa mutant was dialyzed from 6 M guanidine HCl solution to maintain interhelical disulfide bonding (27).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	34	 DMPC complexes with the apoE3 22-kDa variants were prepared as described previously (29).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	35	SPR Measurements Experiments were performed on Biacore-X and -2000 SPR instruments (Biacore, Inc.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	36	 A streptavidin SA sensor chip was pretreated with three consecutive 5- microl injections of 50 mM NaOH in 1 M NaCl to remove nonspecifically bound contaminants.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	37	 For immobilization of heparin on a SA chip, an injection of biotinylated heparin (10  microg/ml) in Tris buffer was made at a flow rate of 5  microl/min followed by a 10- microl injection of 2 M NaCl.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Typically, 30 to 200 resonance units of heparin were immobilized, and the effects of mass transport were not significant because of the low surface density of ligand (35).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	39	 An untreated flow cell was used as a control.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	40	 For kinetic measurement of apoE interaction with heparin, a 30- microl injection of the apoE sample was passed over the sensor surface at a flow rate of 10  microl/min.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	41	 At the end of the sample plug, the same buffer was passed over the sensor surface to facilitate dissociation.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	42	 After 3 min of dissociation time, the sensor surface was regenerated for the next sample using a 10- microl pulse of 2 M NaCl.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The resultant sensorgrams were analyzed using BIAevaluation software (version 4.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The response curves of various analyte concentrations were globally fitted to either the 1:1 Langmuir model or the two-state binding model described by the following equation (36,37),.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	45	 1) where the equilibrium constants of each binding step are K1 = ka1/kd1 and K2 = ka2/kd2, and the overall equilibrium binding constant is calculated as KA = K1(1 + K2) and Kd = 1/KA.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	46	 In this model, the analyte (A) binds to the ligand (B) to form an initial complex (AB) and then undergoes subsequent binding or conformational change to form a more stable complex (ABx).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	47	 For the apoE 10- and 12-kDa fragments, binding responses in the steady-state region of the sensorgrams (Req) were also plotted against analyte concentration (C) to determine the overall equilibrium binding affinity.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The data were subjected to nonlinear regression fitting according to the following equation,.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	51	 After dialyzing from 1% -mercaptoethanol and 6 M guanidine HCl solution, the apoE sample was diluted to 25  microg/ml in Tris buffer (pH 7.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	52	 For the apoE/heparin mixture sample, apoE was mixed with heparin (apoE:heparin ratios of 0.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The kinetic data were not fitted well by a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, as indicated by the large value of the goodness of fit (2 = 100) (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	66	 However, significantly improved fit (2 = 7.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	67	4) was obtained using a two-state binding model, indicating that binding of apoE to heparin involves either a sequential two-step process or some conformational change (36, 37).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The response curve of heparin binding of the apoE3 22-kDa fragment also showed two-state binding kinetics (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Changing the injection time revealed that the dissociation rate was progressively decreased after longer injection (contact) time (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	70	 3A, inset), indicating that the stability of the initial apoE-heparin complex increases over time (36, 37).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Such an effect of contact time on dissociation rate was not seen in the apoE 10-kDa binding to heparin, because the contribution of the second binding step to the overall process was very small (Fig.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	123	 To examine the possibility that similar requirements are necessary for heparin binding, we used two apoE3 22-kDa mutants for SPR measurements.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	124	 The first was a (K143R/K146R) mutant in which the conservative substitution of two lysines with arginines decreases the affinity for the LDLR to 30% of the WT value.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	125	 The second was a (L141K/K143L/K146L/L148K) mutant in which the exchange of lysines and leucines (which disrupts the -helical structure spanning residues 140 to 150 without altering the net charge) eliminates binding to the LDLR (30).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Because lipid association is required for the high affinity binding of apoE to the LDLR (26), we used discoidal complexes of apoE 22-kDa fragments for SPR measurements to compare their LDLR binding abilities.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	127	 The apoE3 22-kDa fragment-DMPC discoidal complex displayed a second order higher first association rate constant than the lipid-free protein, resulting in much higher affinity binding to heparin (cf.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Among apoE isoforms complexed with DMPC, there was no significant difference in association and dissociation rate constants and equilibrium affinity (Table II).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The mutation (K143R/K146R) had no effect on the kinetics and affinity for binding to heparin, indicating that charge specificity of basic residues is not required for effective binding to heparin.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	130	 In contrast, the (L141K/K143L/K146L/L148K) mutant exhibited much lower responses in heparin binding than the WT apoE3 22-kDa fragment in the lipidated state (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	131	 8), suggesting that the amphipathic nature of the -helix spanning residues 140 to 150 is critical for the heparin binding of apoE.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Interestingly, this mutation led to an increased favorable free energy of binding in the second step as well as a decrease in free energy of the first step (Fig.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	142	Two-step Mechanism of Binding of ApoE to Heparin Our SPR data indicate that the binding of apoE to heparin is a two-state process involving sequential binding and/or a conformational change.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	143	 It is known that, when a protein binds to heparin, it can induce a change in conformation within heparin and/or the protein (43).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	144	 For the interaction between antithrombin and heparin, the initial interaction induces a conformational change in antithrombin that enables additional interactions between antithrombin and heparin, resulting in stronger binding (44).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	145	 There is also evidence that the relatively flexible 2-sulfoiduronic acid residue in heparin can change its conformation upon protein binding, resulting in a better fit and enhanced binding (43).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	146	 However, our CD measurements for the apoE/heparin mixture demonstrated that heparin binding does not induce a change in the secondary structure of apoE (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Taken together with the SPR data for the triple interhelical disulfide-linked apoE4 22-kDa mutant showing two-state binding to heparin, it appears that the two-state apoE/heparin interaction observed in SPR measurements is not due to any major conformational change in apoE upon heparin binding.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	148	The most dominant type of interaction between heparin and proteins is ionic; clusters of basic residues on proteins form ion pairs with spatially defined acidic groups in heparin (45).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	149	 In fact, molecular modeling for the interaction between the heparin binding site of apoE and heparin fragment suggested that eight polar residues including Lys-146 directly contact with sulfate or carboxyl groups on the heparin chain (21).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Thus, the large reductions in the association rate and favorable free energy in the first binding step for Lys-146 mutants (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	151	 6) are consistent with the first step involving fast electrostatic interaction between basic residues in apoE and acidic groups in heparin.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	152	 In addition, analysis of the dependence of Kd values on sodium chloride concentration (data not shown) using the protein/polyelectrolyte interaction theory (46) indicated that there are 3.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	153	7 charged residues, respectively, involved in the electrostatic component of the overall and the first binding process in the apoE/heparin interaction.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	154	 The similarity in these two values also supports the idea that electrostatic interaction is involved in the first binding step.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	155	Besides the ionic interaction, it is known that there is a significant contribution to the binding to heparin by nonionic interactions such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in some cases (45).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	156	 In fact, molecular modeling of the apoE/heparin interaction predicts formation of hydrogen bonding between some residues such as Lys-143 in apoE and heparin, and also hydrophobic interaction between the shallow groove of the -helix of apoE and the saccharide chains of heparin (21).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	157	 In this regard, the significant increase in the contribution of the second step to the free energy of binding observed for the (L141K/K143L/K146L/L148K) mutant (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	158	 9), in which disruption of the amphipathic -helix in the heparin binding region destabilizes the N-terminal helix bundle and exposes the hydrophobic surface (30), implies that hydrophobic interaction between apoE and heparin contributes to the second binding step.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	159	 In addition, we found that SPR data of the interaction of brain natriuretic peptide with heparin, in which the major contribution to the free energy of binding comes from hydrogen bonding interaction (47) displayed two-state binding, and the first binding step contributed most of the overall free energy of binding (data not shown).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	160	 This suggests that hydrogen bonding may be involved mostly in the first binding step.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	161	Structural Requirements in the Receptor Binding Region of ApoE for Heparin Interaction Although lipid association is required for high affinity binding of apoE to the LDLR (26), lipid-free apoE can bind effectively to heparin (Table I).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	162	 In addition, apoE2 that is highly defective in LDLR binding (23) exhibited similar heparin binding activity to apoE3 in both lipid-free and lipidated states (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	163	 These results are consistent with previous observations that the requirements for the high affinity binding of apoE to HSPG/heparin are less stringent than for binding to the LDLR (6).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	164	 It has been suggested that the multiple basic residues in the receptor binding region (residues 136 to 150) of apoE are required to have a particular orientation for optimal binding to the LDLR (48).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Indeed, comparison of the structure of residues 135 to 151 between lipid-free and lipid-associated apoE showed a significantly different curvature and that the basic residues are less scattered, forming a better aligned and more elongated hydrophilic surface in the lipidated form (49, 50).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	166	 In addition, our nuclear magnetic resonance studies (29, 51) demonstrated that lipid interaction increases positive electrostatic potential around lysines 143 and 146 and that these effects are much less in apoE2.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Taken together, it appears that the enhanced electrostatic potential around residues 136 to 150 in apoE, required for the interaction with the LDLR, is not necessary for the high affinity binding to heparin.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	168	Previous studies of the relative strengths of heparin binding of arginine and lysine demonstrated that the former binds 2.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Indeed, we found from SPR measurements that the lipid-free substitution mutant (K143R/K146R) displayed a 2.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	170	6 times higher affinity to heparin than WT (data not shown).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	171	 However, as shown in Table II, this double substitution of lysines with arginines had no effect on the kinetics and affinity of the binding of lipidated apoE to heparin, although this mutant exhibits much reduced binding affinity to the LDLR (30).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	172	 It follows that there is no preference between lysine and arginine at these positions for the heparin binding of lipid-associated apoE.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Disruption of the -helical structure in region 140 to 150 by the mutation (L141K/K143L/K146L/L148K) greatly affected the kinetics of binding to heparin (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	174	 8 and Table II), but this mutant still displayed overall heparin binding affinity similar to WT (Table II).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	175	 This suggests that an amphipathic -helical structural motif in the receptor binding region of apoE is not critical for the effective binding to heparin; this is in contrast to the situation with LDLR binding.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Such somewhat surprising results may arise because the appropriate arrangement of basic residues required for the interaction with heparin is still maintained in the discoidal complex of this mutant.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Presumably, cooperative binding through multiple copies of the heparin binding sites of apoE molecules is important in determining the heparin binding ability of apoE bound to lipid particles (22).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	178	Implications for the Sequestration Role of HSPG in Remnant Lipoprotein Metabolism Our SPR kinetic data for the apoE/heparin interaction provide novel insights into the mechanism of the HSPG-LRP pathway for remnant lipoprotein uptake by cells (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	179	 In this pathway, apoE is postulated to interact initially with cell-surface HSPG and then transfer to the LRP for internalization (6).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Because only limited kinetic parameters for the apoE/LRP interaction are available (33), we can only compare our kinetic parameters of binding of lipidated apoE to heparin with those to the related LDLR (53, 54).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Because of the fast association of lipidated apoE in the first binding step to heparin through long range and nondirectional ionic interactions (Table II), it follows that apoE-enriched remnant particles can be captured rapidly by the abundant HSPG on the cell surface.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Fast dissociation in this step is likely to allow a rapid transfer of remnant particles to the LRP associated closely with HSPG (55).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The LRP could then retain the remnant particles at the cell surface until endocytosis occurs because of the very slow dissociation rate of the apoE-receptor complex (10 to 5 s to 1) (53).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Such a process would be more efficient than direct binding of remnant particles in solution to the LRP, because remnant particles concentrated on the cell surface could diffuse in two dimensions by rapidly exchanging between HSPG binding sites until they collide with the LRP to form the LRP-remnant particle complex.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	185	 This lateral diffusion on the cell surface is reminiscent of the "scooting mode" proposed for the interfacial reaction of phospholipases (56).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	186	 It is also possible that some initial complexes of HSPG-remnant particle would undergo the second binding step, forming a more stable complex for internalization without LRP involvement.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The apoE-enriched remnant lipoproteins are first captured through the fast association of apoE with cell-surface HSPG.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Because of the fast dissociation rate of this interaction, remnant lipoproteins are rapidly transferred to the LRP to form a stable complex (characterized by slow dissociation) for endocytosis.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Some initial complexes of HSPG-remnant particle would undergo the second binding step, forming a more stable complex for internalization.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	192	  In summary, we have characterized the kinetics and affinity of the interaction of apoE with heparin using SPR.

0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	3	A series of recent studies used adenoviruses expressing full-length and truncated genomic apoE sequences to correct the high cholesterol profile of the apoE-deficient (apoE to / to ) mice.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	4	 It was shown that overexpression of full-length apoE (by infection of mice with 1 to 2 x 109 pfu) did not correct the high cholesterol levels of the apoE to / to  mice, in contrast, it increased VLDL triglyceride secretion and induced hypertriglyceridemia (12 to 16).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Overexpression of apoE3 or apoE4 also aggravated the hypercholesterolemia in apoE2 knock-in mice (17).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However the high cholesterol profile of apoE to / to  mice or the apoE2 knock-in mice was corrected by infection with truncated apoE forms lacking different segments of the carboxyl-terminal domain (12 to 17).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The hypertriglyceridemia induced by full-length apoE was independent of the apoE phenotype and mouse strain and could be corrected by overexpression of lipoprotein lipase (15).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In normal C57BL6 mice overexpression of full-length apoE induced combined hyperlipidemia characterized by high cholesterol and high triglycerides levels, whereas truncated apoE forms did not change the plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels of these mice (13).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Finally, truncated apoE forms could not correct the high cholesterol profiles of the apoE to / to  x LDLr to / to  double-deficient mice but did not induce hypertriglyceridemia, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal region of apoE is responsible for the hypertriglyceridemia (15, 16).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Use of a series of apoE deletion mutants extending from amino acid 1 to amino acids 185, 202, 229, or 259 mapped the region responsible for the hypertriglyceridemia between amino acids 260 and 299 of apoE (12 to 17).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	11	 This region contains two hydrophobic stretches of amino acids between residues 261 to 269 and 276 to 283.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	12	In the present study, the hydrophobic residues of both regions were mutated to alanines and the functions of the mutant apoE forms were studied in vivo using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This analysis showed that residues Leu-261, Trp-264, Phe-265, Leu-268, and Ala-269 can account for the apoE-induced hypertriglyceridemia.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Furthermore, the 261 to 269 apoE sequence is responsible for displacing apoA-I from the HDL region, leading to reduction in plasma apoA-I and HDL levels.

0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	133	 These studies have shown that neither the full-length apoE2 or apoE4 nor the truncated apoE2 to 202 or apoE4 to 202 corrected the high cholesterol profiles of the apoE to / to  x LDLr to / to  double-deficient mice (15).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	134	 These data and other observations with full-length apoE2 suggest strongly that apoE-mediated lipoprotein clearance in mice is carried out mainly by the LDL receptor (15).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	135	 In the absence of this receptor, lipoprotein receptor-related protein, other apoE recognizing lipoprotein receptors, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (22, 23) are not sufficient to clear the lipoprotein remnants, which accumulate in the plasma of the double-deficient mice (15).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	136	 In addition to the role of apoE in cholesterol homeostasis in circulation, plasma apoE levels correlate with plasma triglyceride levels in humans (24).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	137	Hypertriglyceridemia is also induced in mice by overexpression of human apoE (12 to 15, 25).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	138	 However, our recent studies have shown that hypertriglyceridemia did not occur when mice were infected with adenoviruses expressing truncated apoE forms lacking the 260 to 299 carboxyl-terminal domain (12 to 16).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	139	 This set of experiments also showed that when the truncated apoE forms were co-expressed with the full-length apoE forms, they had a dominant effect and normalized the cholesterol levels of the apoE to / to  mice (15).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	140	These findings suggested that when full-length apoE is bound to triglyceride-rich VLDL particles, its receptor binding domain may be masked, thus preventing the direct apoE-mediated clearance of the VLDL particles prior to lipolysis.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	141	 In contrast, when truncated apoE is bound to triglyceride-rich VLDL particles, its receptor binding domain may be exposed and may allow direct clearance of the VLDL particle (15).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	142	The current study was designed to map the residues in the carboxyl-terminal region of apoE, which are responsible for hypertriglyceridemia.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The rationale was that identification of these residues may lead to the generation of a recombinant apoE form with improved biological functions.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	144	 We have focused on two regions of apoE between residues 260 and 299, which contain hydrophobic amino acids.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The first region includes amino acids Leu-261, Trp-264, Phe-265, Leu-268, and Val-269, and the second region includes amino acids Trp-276, Leu-279, Val-280, and Val-283.

0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	147	gov) showed that both regions are highly conserved among mammalian species.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	148	 An in vivo adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of the two apoE mutants established unequivocally that the hydrophobic residues of apoE between amino acids 261 to 269 can account to a large extent for the induction of hypertriglyceridemia.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Hypertriglyceridemia did not occur in mice infected with an adenovirus expressing apoE4-mut1 where these residues were changed into alanines.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	150	 In contrast, infection of mice with an adenovirus expressing apoE4-mut2, where the hydrophobic residues between amino acids 276 and 283 were substituted by alanines, resulted in milder hypertriglyceridemia as compared with mice infected with the apoE4-expressing adenovirus.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	151	It appears that the hydrophobic residues within the 261 to 269 as well as the 276 to 283 regions, affect the secretion of VLDL triglycerides.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Mutations of these residues into alanines reduced the rate of hepatic VLDL triglyceride secretion to 27% of that caused by wild-type apoE4.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	153	Our data also showed that an increase in the levels of the plasma lipoprotein lipase by co-infection with recombinant adenoviruses expressing the human lipoprotein lipase corrected the apoE-induced dyslipidemia in apoE to / to  mice that overexpress full-length apoE4.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	154	 This finding suggests that under the condition of apoE overexpression the activity of lipoprotein lipase becomes rate-limiting for the clearance of the hypertriglyceridemic VLDL.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Substantial but less severe hypertriglyceridemia is also observed by the overexpression of apoE4-mut2, which is also corrected by co-infection with the lipoprotein lipase-expressing adenovirus.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The difference in the severity of the hypertriglyceridemia between WT apoE4 and apoE4-mut2 may be related to the increased VLDL triglyceride secretion caused by the WT apoE4.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	157	An important clue on the nature of the hypertriglyceridemic lipoprotein particles that accumulate in the plasma of the mice is provided by the clearance of apoE in mice co-infected with wild-type or mutant forms of apoE- and LpL-expressing adenoviruses.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	158	 ApoE was cleared in mice treated with apoE4 and LpL, partially cleared in mice treated with apoE4-mut2 and LpL, and was unaffected in mice treated with apoE4-mut1 and LpL.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The average apoE levels with or without treatment with lipoprotein lipase 2 to 6 days postinfection changed from 125 mg/dl to 10 mg/dl for apoE4, 150 mg/dl to 40 mg/dl for apoE4-mut2, and remained the same (170 mg/dl) for apoE4-mut1.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The findings indicate that wild-type apoE4 resides on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles and following the hydrolysis of the triglycerides of these particles by LpL, apoE4 is recognized and cleared as a component of the remnant particles by the LDL-receptor.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	161	 It appears that the majority of the mutant apoE4-mut1 may reside in another population of triglyceride-poor particles that are not cleared by the LDL receptor.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Finally, the apoE4-mut2 may be partitioned in triglyceride-rich particles that are processed by LpL and cleared by the LDL receptor and triglyceride-poor particles that are not cleared by the LDL receptor.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	163	 It is possible that the mutations introduced in apoE4-mut1 and to a lesser extent in apoE4-mut2 may have promoted the formation of triglyceride-poor apoE-containing lipoprotein particles that accumulate in the HDL region of these mice.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	164	A very significant finding of this study is that apoE4 and apoE4-mut2 (W276A, L279A, V280A, and V283A) displaced apoA-I from HDL and promoted the formation of discoidal HDL.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	165	 In contrast, apoE-mut1 (L261A, W264A, F265A, L268A, and V269A) did not displace apoA-I from the HDL region and did not affect the formation of spherical HDL particles.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The findings suggest that when WT apoE4 or apoE4-mut2 is overexpressed, they may influence the formation or the stability of HDL.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The effect of the apoE mutations on the biosynthesis and catabolism of VLDL and HDL is summarized in Fig.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	168	At the present time, it is not clear whether apoE overexpression interferes with the biogenesis of HDL through a pathway that involves the ABCA1 transporter or whether it affects its stability by displacing apoA-I from the surface of HDL.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Both processes are expected to reduce the levels of HDL.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The undesirable property of WT apoE to reduce plasma HDL levels can be overcome in the recombinant apoE4-mut1, were the hydrophobic residues in the 261 to 269 region were mutated into alanines.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	171	The ability of recombinant apoE forms such as apoE4-mut1 to clear cholesterol without inducing hypertriglyceridemia or interfering with the formation of spherical HDL, makes them attractive therapeutic agents to correct remnant removal disorders.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Therapeutic forms of apoE may involve pure recombinant protein associated with liposomes and potential gene therapy in the future.

0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We suggest that BCHE-K, or a nearby gene on chromosome 3, acts in synergy with APOE[epsilon]4 as a susceptibility gene for late-onset AD.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	11	Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is expressed in most human tissues (1 ), yet its function is unknown.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	12	 BChE activity in the brain increases with age over 60 years and is elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (2 ,3 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Histochemically reactive BChE is associated with amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and with amyloid angiopathy in AD (4 -8 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	14	 We have looked for possible associations of AD with two of the more common human variants of the gene for BChE (BCHE), the atypical allele and the K variant (BCHE-K).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The latter has a point mutation at nucleotide 1615 (GCA - >  ACA) which changes Ala539 to threonine and the catalytic activity is reduced by a third (9 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	16	 BCHE-K is thought to have an allelic frequency of ~0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	17	After 178 subjects had been genotyped, three control subjects out of 104 and three AD cases out of 74 were identified as heterozygotes for the atypical BCHE allele.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Thus, no association was found between histopathologically confirmed AD and the atypical allele of BCHE.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Two out of the six atypical BCHE heterozygotes were carriers of BCHE-K.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	20	Altogether, 282 Caucasian subjects were genotyped for BCHE-K and for APOE alleles.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	21	 BCHE-K was more common in late-onset AD cases than in early-onset AD cases, other dementias or controls (Table 1 ).

0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	28	Taking account of an individual's carrier status for APOE [epsilon]4 produced striking results.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In subjects >65 years without APOE [epsilon]4, the allelic frequency of BCHE-K was 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	30	14 in 22 confirmed AD cases and 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	31	 There was thus no association of BCHE-K with late-onset AD in subjects lacking an APOE [epsilon]4 allele.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In APOE [epsilon]4 carriers, however, BCHE-K allelic frequencies in subjects aged >65 years were 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	33	18 in 52 confirmed AD cases and only 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	34	03 in 32 controls; in subjects aged >75 years the frequencies were 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	35	23 in 24 confirmed AD cases and 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These results gave odds ratios of confirmed AD of 6.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	37	8 for BCHE-K in APOE [epsilon]4 carriers aged >65 years and >75 years, respectively (Table 2 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	38	 For comparison, we give in Table 3 the odds ratios of confirmed AD for APOE [epsilon]4 in BCHE-K carriers.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	39	 It can be seen that an individual's BCHE-K status markedly influences the strength of the effect of APOE [epsilon]4.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Table 4 shows the striking differences between cases and controls in the proportions of subjects who carry both BCHE-K and APOE [epsilon]4 alleles.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	41	All these findings indicated an interaction between BCHE-K and APOE [epsilon]4, which we confirmed by logistic regression analysis.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	42	 We fitted several logistic regression models to the data and found that a parsimonious model with only APOE [epsilon]4, BCHE-K and their interaction gave an adequate fit (residual deviance: 5.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In this model, APOE [epsilon]4 and its interaction with BCHE-K were significantly associated with AD, but BCHE-K by itself was not.

0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	67	In order to examine further the strength of the interaction between BCHE-K and APOE [epsilon]4, we give in Table 5 the odds ratios of confirmed AD for subjects with different combinations of these two genes, taking subjects who have neither gene as the reference.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In subjects over 65 years, the odds ratio in those who only carry BCHE-K was 1.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	69	1 and in those with only APOE [epsilon]4 it was 3.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	70	 This gave a predicted odds ratio of 4.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	71	2 in subjects with both genes, on the assumption of independent effects of the two genes, compared with the observed value of 30.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	72	 In subjects over 75 years, the predicted odds ratio was 1.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	73	7, but the observed odds ratio was 36.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	74	 We therefore suggest that there is strong synergy between these two alleles in late-onset AD.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	75	That APOE [epsilon]4 is a risk factor for AD is well established (12 ,13 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that BCHE-K is associated with a further increase in the risk of late-onset AD in APOE [epsilon]4 carriers.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The effect could be due to linkage disequilibrium with another gene on chromosome 3, conceivably transferrin, whose C2 variant was reported to be more common in 20 clinically diagnosed AD cases than in the general population (14 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	78	2 (15 ), while the gene for transferrin is at 3q21-q25 (16 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	79	 On the other hand, the effect on late-onset AD might be mediated by BCHE-K itself.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	80	There are various potential interactions between BChE and apolipoprotein E (apoE).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Both proteins are produced in quantity in the liver and secreted into the circulation (1 ,17 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Not only apoE, but probably also BChE, interact with lipoproteins (18 ,19 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Both proteins are found in astrocytes (20 ,21 ) and in other glia, BChE in oligodendrocytes (22 ) and apoE in microglia (23 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Both proteins occur in AD in plaques, intra- and extracellular neurofibrillary tangles and in association with amyloid angiopathy (7 ,8 ,24 ,25 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Furthermore, both BChE and apoE have been implicated in certain models of neurite growth (26 -31 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	86	 In the case of apoE, there are differences between the E3 and E4 isoforms (29 -31 ) and, in the case of BChE, it has been suggested that the nature of the attached sugar residues may be important (26 -28 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	87	 It should be noted that the K variant of BChE has an additional threonine residue at position 539, but whether this is a potential O-glycosylation site (or, indeed, a phosphorylation site) remains to be shown.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Furthermore, a threonine residue has a high propensity for [beta]-sheet formation (32 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In lysozyme, conversion of an isoleucine residue to threonine causes amyloidosis (33 ), as does conversion of an alanine residue to threonine in transthyretin (34 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	90	The evidence cited provides pointers for future work to test the hypothesis that BChE and apoE may interact and that this interaction is influenced by their allelic variants.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Implications for clinical genetics.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	92	Replication of our findings is particularly important since ~6% of the Caucasian population carry both BCHE-K and APOE [epsilon]4, assuming respective allelic frequencies of 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Thus, subject to confirmation of our results, several millions of the elderly who carry both these genes are at high risk of developing AD, especially when aged over 75 years.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	94	 As pointed out by Roses (36 ), the ability to identify such at-risk individuals has major social and ethical implications.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Since APOE [epsilon]4 is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it will be important to see whether carriers who also have BCHE-K are at greater risk of cardiovascular disease.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Such a study would not only have clinical relevance but could also increase our understanding about the role of vascular risk factors (37 ) in the aetiology of AD.

0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	4	Received August 9, 2004; Accepted September 11, 2004.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	5	Possession of the 4 allele of the APOE gene (encoding ApoE4) is the only undisputed genetic risk factor for the common, late-onset, form of Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), increasing risk in a dose-dependent manner (5,6).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, the 4 allele is neither necessary nor sufficient for expression of the disease, and a large proportion of 4 homozygotes surviving to 80 years do not show cognitive impairment (7).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The 2 allele (encoding ApoE2) confers a protective effect (8).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	8	It has been postulated that, in addition to the structural changes in ApoE, cis-acting variation within APOE regulatory sequence might also contribute to disease susceptibility, by influencing gene expression.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Transgenic mouse models indicate that APOE dosage can significantly influence pathological hallmarks of human Alzheimer's disease, including amyloid deposition and neuritic degeneration (9,10).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Furthermore, that cis-acting regulatory variants in human APOE have the potential to influence LOAD susceptibilty is suggested by a study in which variation in quantitative measures of peripheral lipid metabolism were better explained by considering genotype data from additional polymorphic sites in the vicinity of APOE, rather than 2 to 4 status alone (11).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	11	 It should, however, be noted that the implications of that study for Alzheimer's disease are unknown, as it is unclear if those aspects of APOE function as indexed by peripheral lipid metabolism are relevant to LOAD pathogenesis.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Moreover, the extent of cis-acting influences on APOE expression in human brain is also currently unclear.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	13	A powerful method for investigating cis-acting influences on gene expression involves comparing the relative level of each mRNA transcript in individuals who are heterozygous for an expressed polymorphism.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This  within-subjects  approach can allow detection of genuine cis-acting effects, whilst controlling for the trans-acting factors than can confound measures of total expression between samples.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	15	 One such study, using an RFLP-based assay, reported evidence for intrinsic effects of epsilon status on APOE mRNA expression in brain, with 3 expression being greatly increased relative to 4 in 34 heterozygotes (12).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Elevated 3 expression was observed in both LOAD cases and controls, although, in the former, the magnitude of the difference was smaller.

0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Although not a comprehensive survey of different brain regions, analysis of the frontal and temporal cortex yielded no evidence for differences by neuroanatomical region.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	97	The relatively small difference in allele ratio observed in 34 heterozygotes in this study is in stark contrast with the findings of a previous study (12), where an RFLP-based design was used.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In that study, a large increase was observed in the level of 3 relative to 4 mRNA in both control and LOAD samples, although smaller differences were seen in the LOAD group.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Our data are more compatible with those of a subsequent study (13), in which no major differences in the expression of the two alleles were found in either control or LOAD 34 heterozygotes.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	100	 It is also notable that, in the subsequent study (13), an average 4% relative increase in 4 expression was found, with a maximum of 22%.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Using an RFLP-based design similar to the previous study, they also showed that estimation of allele ratio using this method is critically dependent on the number of PCR cycles (due to digestion-resistant heteroduplex formation), suggesting that the former results were due to artefact.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The primer extension method used in the present study is unaffected by this problem and thus the present data are likely to provide a more accurate estimate of relative allelic expression of brain APOE.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	103	The small increase in 4 expression observed in this study could possibly reflect an intrinsic effect of the alleles on transcription efficiency or RNA stability.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Alternatively, the finding may reflect strong LD between the 2 to 4 conferring haplotype and an untested regulatory variant, of which there may be many (11).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Increased representation of the 4 allele is unlikely to have resulted from differences in PCR or primer extension efficiency, as this is controlled (and corrected for) by concurrent assay of genomic DNA under the same conditions.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Although a genomic control cannot be applied to limit potential confounding from differential RT efficiency, neither is this phenomenon likely to explain the observed differences for 34 heterozygotes, as inter-individual differences in ratios were largely preserved between separate RT reactions.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	107	Our finding of increased expression of the 4 allele at the RNA level is consistent with a recent study in which the encoded ApoE4 isoform was found to account for an elevated proportion of total ApoE protein in the CSF of 34 heterozygotes (21).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	108	 This finding is in contrast to measures of ApoE4 in plasma (2,21), where it is associated with lower protein expression, suggesting important allele-specific differences in the CNS and periphery in the control of synthesis and/or degradation of ApoE.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	109	The magnitude of 4 over-expression was found to be virtually identical between the initial sample and the sample of confirmed LOAD cases.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The initial sample was not selected to be a specific control group for the LOAD sample, and although it did not contain any individual with a diagnosis of AD, it is possible that some individuals might have developed the disease had they survived to old age.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	111	 However, that no differences were observed between this sample and confirmed LOAD cases is consistent with previous comparisons using age-matched control groups in terms of both relative 4 RNA expression (13) and the relative level of ApoE4 protein (21), suggesting that, if there are common risk factors for LOAD that influence risk of disease by altering APOE expression, they do not selectively interact to markedly increase the expression of specific APOE mRNA species.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	112	Though significant, the influence of cis-acting polymorphisms on steady-state levels of APOE mRNA in cerebral cortex is small, with a maximum relative difference in expression observed in this study of 25%.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The 56 APOE heterozygotes assayed in this study provided  > 99% power to detect the effect of a distinct regulatory variant occurring in the general population at a frequency of 0.

0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	115	 This degree of power effectively excludes the existence of even fairly rare polymorphisms in and around APOE, exerting large direct effects on net APOE mRNA expression.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	116	The third objective of this study was to determine if APOE mRNA levels in vivo are influenced by polymorphisms that affect transcription activity in vitro, and which have, in several studies, been associated with LOAD.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Stratification of observed 4/3 allele ratios according to heterozygosity for the promoter polymorphisms indicated a very small but statistically significant effect of the  to 219G > T polymorphism on allelic expression, consistent with it having a functional effect in brain.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	118	 The  to 219T allele has previously been associated with reduced transcriptional activity in vitro (17) and with reduced plasma ApoE in vivo (22).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	119	 The present finding of a reduced ratio of 4/3 expression when the probability is that the 4 allele is in phase with the  to 219T allele, and the 3 allele in phase with the  to 219G allele, suggests that the  to 219T allele also decreases APOE expression in brain.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	120	 As with measures of total expression, our data do not allow us to distinguish between direct and indirect association, but the consistency of our finding with in vitro studies suggests that this is a direct effect.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	121	The conditional probabilities for diplotypes suggest that, for 15% of  to 219G > T heterozygotes (i.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	122	 two of the 13), the higher expression  to 219G allele is in phase with 4 in 34 individuals.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	123	 As we do not know which, if any, individual diplotypes in this analysis are misclassified, we cannot accurately assess the impact of this on our estimate of the magnitude of effect.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	124	 However, if we assume that the two heterozygotes displaying the least reduction in 4/3 ratio are misclassified, we obtain an estimate of the maximum possible size of the effect.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Excluding these from analysis reveals a mean net effect of the 219T allele of a 6% reduction in relative 4 expression.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	126	 We stress that this analysis provides a guide to the maximum effect; we cannot conclude that the effect is of this size because we have no compelling case to exclude any single individual from the analysis.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	127	The  to 491A allele of the  to 491A > G promoter polymorphism has been reported to show higher transcriptional activity in vitro (17), and to be associated with increased measures of total APOE expression in plasma (23) and brain (24).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	128	 In the present study, heterozygosity at this site did not significantly influence relative 4 expression in any one direction.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	129	 It should be noted, however, that power to detect a small, directional effect would have been diminished by the small sample size and low predicted consistency of phase.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Interestingly, although only a single observation of all assayed samples, the one showing the greatest elevation in relative 334C (4) expression (25%) was also the only sample in which, with high probability (0.

0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	132	Our study illustrates the importance of complementing in vivo and in vitro work.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	133	 In vitro work requires analysis of the effects of variants in alien genomic and cellular contexts, and therefore the findings must be examined for compatibility in vivo.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Nevertheless, without in vitro work, while associations can be observed, it is impossible to attribute in vivo effects on expression to specific variants.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	135	 This would require that the effect of all other cis-acting variants on the same haplotype be controlled for effectively an impossible task, as the relevant variants could be legion, and distributed across large genomic sequences.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	136	To summarize, using a relatively large series of brain samples, we have demonstrated that any common influences on APOE expression attributable to cis-acting polymorphism are small.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	137	 We have also effectively excluded the existence of even fairly rare cis-acting haplotypes of large effect.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Of the variance that does occur, most is accounted for by the 4 haplotype, with the 4 allele of APOE being expressed at a significantly higher level than 3.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	139	 This is highly reproducible and appears to be independent of AD status.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	140	 We have also shown that the  to 219G promoter allele is associated with higher expression of APOE mRNA in vivo, a finding compatible with previous in vitro studies.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Our study provides important functional in vivo plausibility to the existing body of association data, suggesting that the  to 219T promoter polymorphism may modulate risk of AD independent of APOE epsilon status (16).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	142	 However, though demonstration of functionality enhances the case, strong genetic support from samples that are larger than are currently available to any single group is now required to force the conclusion that the extremely small effects we have observed are relevant to LOAD susceptibility.

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	5	Received for publication, February 24, 2005 , and in revised form, April 25, 2005.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	6	In 1993, the 4 allele of apoE was found to be a genetic risk factor for the most common form of AD (late-onset AD) as well as for cerebral amyloid angiopathy, whereas the 2 allele was shown to be protective (3).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Abundant data suggest that apoE is linked to AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy due to its ability to act as an A chaperone (4) and influence A metabolism.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	8	 By acting as an A-binding molecule, apoE influences the amount of A deposition and the conformation in which A aggregates, as well as A clearance and toxicity in vivo (5 to 8).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Furthermore, the level of apoE in the brain directly influences all of the aforementioned processes (5 to 8).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	10	 For example, APP transgenic mice lacking apoE develop less A deposition and virtually no fibrillar A deposits (5, 9, 10).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Thus, understanding the cellular events and receptors that regulate apoE levels in brain may give important insights into AD pathogenesis.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	12	ApoE is expressed at high levels in the liver and the central nervous system (CNS), where it is present in lipoprotein particles.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Furthermore, apoE in the CNS is derived from within the CNS and not the plasma (11).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	14	 However, in the CNS, apoE-containing lipoproteins differ from those found in the periphery in both the amount of sialation and, perhaps more importantly, the type of lipoprotein particle it associates with (12).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In the plasma, apoE is in both very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and a subset of high density lipoproteins that also contain other apoproteins.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In contrast, CNS apoE is in high density lipoprotein-like lipoproteins that are secreted primarily by astrocytes and, when released by cells, contain apoE as their sole apolipoprotein constituent (12, 13).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Despite this information, whether specific apoE receptors regulate the level of apoE in the brain or mediate apoE-dependent clearance of apoE-binding proteins is unknown.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Nearly 20 years ago, Brown and Goldstein (14) elucidated the role of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoproteins in plasma, including apoE.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Subsequently, other members of the LDLR family have been identified.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Many are expressed in brain, and they have been shown in vitro to bind and endocytose lipid-rich lipoproteins that contain apoE (15).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	21	 To determine whether LDLR family members influence the level of CNS apoE and A metabolism, an AD mouse model was recently bred to mice lacking the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) (16).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	22	 An increase in A aggregation and deposition was found in these mice.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	23	 RAP is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein known to influence the folding and level of all LDLR family members, and in this study, levels of both LDLR-related protein (LRP) and LDLR were examined and found to be reduced in the brain of mice lacking RAP (16).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Additionally, overexpression of a functional LRP mini-receptor in the PDAPP model led to an increase in the levels of soluble A at advanced stages of deposition, but with no detectable change in A deposition measured histologically (17).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Thus, whether other LDLR family members are responsible for brain apoE metabolism and whether they play a role in regulating A levels in vivo remains unclear.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Herein, we investigate the role of LDLR in regulation of CNS-derived apoE as well as on brain A levels in a mouse model of AD.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	27	Animal and Tissue Preparation For analysis of tissue and plasma cholesterol and CSF apoE, 3-month-old Ldlr+/+ and Ldlr-/- mice, both on an identical C57BL/6J background, were used (23).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	28	 For analysis of human apoE isoforms, Ldlr-/- mice were first bred to wild-type SJL mice to generate Ldlr+/- mice on a mixed C57BL/6J x SJL background.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	29	 These mice were then bred to human APOE-expressing mice (24) that have been maintained on the same C57BL/6J x SJL background such that all mice analyzed for human apoE experiments were on an identical background.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	30	 For A analysis, we utilized the PDAPP mice that overexpress human APP751 with a familial AD mutation at position 717 (APPV717F) under control of the neuron-specific platelet-derived growth factor promoter (25).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We crossed PDAPP+/-, Ldlr+/- mice with Ldlr+/- mice to generate PDAPP+/-, Ldlr+/+ and PDAPP+/-, Ldlr-/- mice (littermates) on the same mixed genetic background as described previously (7).

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Our current results suggest that although the LDLR regulates extracellular levels of apoE in the brain, a 50% increase in the level of murine apoE over endogenous levels is not sufficient to alter A levels at young ages or the early stages of A deposition in PDAPP mice at 10 months of age.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	180	 This may represent a ceiling effect of the level of murine apoE or indicate that a larger increase in the level of murine apoE may be necessary to effect a change in A levels in this model.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Alternatively, other pathways of apoE-mediated clearance of A play a much larger role in the metabolism of A such as LRP or bulk flow along interstitial fluid drainage pathways.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Unfortunately, Lrp-/- mice die in early embryonic stages, and thus the effect of endogenous LRP on brain apoE levels is difficult to assess as shown in this study.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Additionally, the LDLR may play a role in A deposition only at later stages of deposition, as was found for LRP in PDAPP mice (17).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	184	 It is also possible that the LDLR may differentially regulate human apoE isoforms in the CNS to a greater extent than murine apoE and therefore influence A levels and deposition.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	185	 It is interesting that independent of the effect of the LDLR, the level of apoE in the CSF of human APOE2 mice is significantly higher than that in APOE3 or APOE4 mice.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	186	 This suggests that in humans, LDLR may play a more important role in regulating CNS apoE levels and AD pathogenesis.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Studies of human CSF have reported no significant differences in the level of human apoE between individuals expressing APOE3 or APOE4 alleles, but the level of CSF apoE in APOE2/2 homozygous individuals has not been assessed, to our knowledge.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Given that APOE2 has been associated with a decreased risk for developing AD, an intriguing possibility is that the absolute level of apoE present in the brain of these individuals could account for the decrease in risk.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Human and murine apoE differ by 25% at the amino acid level, and human apoE isoforms and murine apoE isolated from VLDL have been shown to differentially bind the LDLR (33).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Using the PDAPP mouse model, previous studies from our group have shown that expression of human apoE isoforms under the control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter results in a significant delay in deposition compared with mice expressing endogenous murine apoE (7, 32).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	191	 More recently, the same human apoE knock-in mice used in this study were crossed to PDAPP mice, and both a delay in A deposition and an isoform-dependent effect on A deposition (E4  >  E3 E2) were found (38).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Additionally, we have recently replicated this result in the APPsw mouse model of AD utilizing the same APOE3 and APOE4 knock-in mice used in this study (39).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Clearly, human apoE isoforms affect A metabolism and deposition differently than murine apoE, but whether this is due to altered clearance and/or structure of A in vivo remains to be determined.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Determining the role of LDLR or other receptors or clearance pathways in the brain that are also involved in regulating apoE levels is central to understanding how apoE influences A metabolism and AD pathogenesis.

0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	6	ABCA1 transports cellular cholesterol and phospholipids from cells onto high density lipoproteins (HDL) in plasma (4, 5).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In humans, loss-of-function mutations in ABCA1 cause Tangier's disease (6 to 9), which is characterized by accumulation of cholesterol in lymphatic tissues and increased catabolism of abnormally lipidated HDL, resulting in very low levels of plasma HDL and HDL-associated apolipoproteins A-I (apoA-I) and A-II (apoA-II) (10, 11).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	8	 ABCA1 knock-out mice (Abca1-/-) have been produced, and the mice have a similar phenotype as patients with Tangier's disease (12).

0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The most abundant apolipoprotein in the CNS is apolipoprotein E (apoE), which is produced within the CNS, primarily by astrocytes and to some extent microglia (13 to 17).

0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	12	 By analyzing brain tissue, CSF, plasma, and primary astrocyte cultures from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice, we determined that deletion of ABCA1 markedly affects metabolism of apoE and cholesterol in the CNS and in nascent lipoprotein particles secreted by cultured astrocytes.

0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	99	  Lipids in CSF and Cortex of Abca1-/- Mice Since the major function of ABCA1 outside the CNS is transport of cholesterol and phospholipids onto HDL, we examined whether ABCA1 deficiency altered the levels of cholesterol and phospholipids within the CNS.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	100	 We found that total cholesterol in CSF was reduced by 24% in Abca1-/- mice as compared with wild type littermates (Fig.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	101	 This is likely because ABCA1 deficiency results in decreased levels of HDL, the lipoprotein class that normally carries some proportion of cholesterol in the CSF.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In contrast to CSF, total cholesterol levels in brain tissue (cortex) were not significantly different between Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice (Fig.

0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	112	Lipoprotein Particles from CSF and Astrocyte Conditioned Media of Abca1-/- Mice In addition to evaluating the effects of ABCA1 deficiency on the levels of lipids and apoE in the CNS in vivo, we studied apoE- and apoA-I-containing lipoproteins in CSF and nascent apoE-containing lipoproteins produced by astrocytes to examine how ABCA1 deficiency affected their properties.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	113	 We determined the size distribution of apoE- and apoA-I-containing lipoproteins in mouse CSF by non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	114	 As we have described previously (21), apoE in CSF of wild type mice was in HDL-like particles 10 to 17 nm in diameter with the most abundant sizes being between 13 and 16 nm (Fig.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	115	 ApoE particles from Abca1+/- CSF were similar in size to wild type.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	116	 However, in addition to apoE levels in CSF from Abca1-/- being markedly reduced, apoE was present within particles that had a size distribution that was different from wild type mice.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	117	 In addition to having a population of particles between 13 and 16 nm in diameter, CSF from Abca1-/- mice also had a population of smaller apoE-containing particles that were 7 to 8 nm in diameter, suggesting that they were poorly lipidated.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	118	 ApoA-I was also greatly reduced in CSF from Abca1-/- mice, and the small amount that was there was present in particles of 7.

0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	120	Because Abca1-/- mice have both very low CSF apoE levels and altered particle size distribution, this led us to investigate whether there was a primary alteration of nascently produced apoE-containing HDL from astrocytes, the cells that produce the majority of apoE in the CNS.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	121	 We compared total cholesterol and apoE in ACM derived from primary astrocyte cultures from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice and found that total levels of apoE in ACM did not vary by Abca1 genotype (Fig.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	122	 However, the levels of total cholesterol were significantly lower in Abca1-/- ACM (Fig.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	123	 This suggests that apoE is secreted at normal levels by Abca1-/- astrocytes, but the apoE is not normally lipidated in the absence of ABCA1.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	124	To examine the extent of lipidation of apoE-containing particles, ACM was subjected to size analysis by non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting for apoE.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	125	 This demonstrated apoE-containing lipoprotein populations of 12, 11, and 8 nm in ACM from Abca1+/+ mice but much smaller lipoproteins in ACM from Abca1-/- mice of 7.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	126	 These data suggested that apoE-containing particles from Abca1-/- ACM were likely very lipid-poor.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	127	To analyze the lipid composition of astrocyte-secreted lipoproteins, ACM was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	128	 ApoE ELISAs and cholesterol assays of the different fractions demonstrated that lipoproteins from Abca1-/- ACM contain less apoE, are smaller, and have markedly less cholesterol than Abca1+/+ ACM (Fig.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Lipoprotein-associated apoE was reduced in Abca1-/- ACM by 80% as compared with Abca1+/+ ACM.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	130	 As expected, 75% of the apoE in the Abca1+/+ ACM was in fractions 31 to 41, corresponding to the HDL size range.

0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	143	 AFM is a tool of choice because it allows for characterization of the three-dimensional shape of nanoparticles under nearly physiological conditions.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Its use to study lipoprotein particles and the protocols needed to obtain reliable volume measurements were recently described elsewhere (31).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The AFM images obtained demonstrate that the most abundant apoE-containing particles in Abca1-/- ACM are significantly smaller than in Abca1+/+ ACM (Fig.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	146	Although the alterations in CNS apoE levels were profound, differences in total CNS lipids were more subtle and present only in CSF.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Brain tissue from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice had no differences in free cholesterol, esterified cholesterol, and phospholipids and showed no evidence of lipid deposition by histological staining.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	148	 These results suggest that ABCA1 does not play a major role in regulating global cellular lipid levels in brain tissue in vivo and that this regulation is performed by additional molecules.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	149	 However, CSF from Abca1-/- mice had significantly reduced cholesterol, showing that ABCA1 is important in regulating extracellular lipid levels in the CNS.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	150	Conditioned media collected from primary cultures of astrocytes derived from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice showed that although total levels of apoE secreted by astrocytes are not affected by Abca1 genotype, secretion of cholesterol into the media is markedly reduced in Abca1-/- cultures, which is consistent with ABCA1 having a role in transporting astrocyte-derived cellular cholesterol onto lipoproteins.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	151	 This function may occur in the astrocyte secretory pathway or extracellularly.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Analysis of nascent lipoprotein particles isolated from conditioned media of primary astrocyte cultures demonstrated that Abca1-/- astrocytes secrete apoE-containing particles of markedly smaller size with reduced cholesterol and apoE, demonstrating that ABCA1 is required by the main cellular producer of apoE in the CNS to normally lipidate apoE.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Of the apoE produced by CNS cells such as astrocytes that reach the CSF of Abca1-/- mice, a fraction of the particles present were also abnormally small, although some were of normal size.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Thus, there appears to be a mechanism that does not require ABCA1 to lipidate some apoE that reaches the CSF.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	155	 However, the fact that CSF apoE levels in Abca1-/- were 2% of normal suggests that the non-ABCA1 mediated pathway is inefficient and that most apoE particles produced in the absence of ABCA1-mediated lipidation are rapidly metabolized in the CNS.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	156	ApoE and apoJ are the two major apoproteins produced by astrocytes, and each is secreted into unique apoE- or apoJ-only containing particles (33).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	157	 ApoE secreted by astrocytes is present in particles that contain approximately an equal mass of apoE, cholesterol, and phospholipids (21).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Furthermore, virtually all cholesterol and phospholipids secreted by astrocytes are associated with apoE (33).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	159	 In contrast, apoJ secreted by astrocytes has very little associated cholesterol or phospholipids (21) and we found that it was present at normal levels in the brains of Abca1-/- mice.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Thus, apoJ particles are stable in the absence of ABCA1, possibly because they are normally lipid-poor and do not require extensive lipidation for stability.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	161	These data demonstrate that complete loss of ABCA1 profoundly affects apoE levels in the CNS.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Additionally, since Abca1+/- mice had intermediate apoE levels, more subtle alterations in ABCA1 gene dosage and/or functionality may affect apoE metabolism.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	163	 The Apoe genotype is a major risk factor for both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (34 to 36).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	164	 The Apoe genotype may also influence neurologic prognosis after intracerebral hemorrhage (37), traumatic brain injury (38), and multiple sclerosis (39).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The effects of apoE on AD and CAA are likely to be mediated in large part by the role of apoE role as an amyloid- (A) chaperone that influences A clearance and fibrillogenesis (40).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	166	 In amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice that develop many of the pathological changes seen in AD and CAA, the level of apoE, regardless of species or genotype, markedly influences the time of onset, conformation, and amount of the A peptide that accumulates in the brain with age (41 to 45).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	167	 For example, when amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice were crossed to Apoe-/- mice, animals lacking apoE had almost no fibrillar A deposition, neuritic plaques, or CAA, and Apoe+/- mice had less than 50% as much A-related pathology as Apoe+/+ mice (41 to 44).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	168	 These results show that alterations in CNS apoE levels by as little as 50% have massive effects on AD-like pathology in the CNS.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Since ABCA1 regulates both the level of apoE as well as its state of lipidation, modulation of ABCA1 levels or function is likely to directly influence apoE/A interactions along with A deposition and its negative consequences in the brain.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	170	 In addition to the effects of ABCA1 on apoE, recent studies also suggest that ABCA1 can influence cellular A production (46 to 48).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	171	 These effects are likely independent of apoE since alterations in ABCA1 expression levels affect A in some cell types that do not express apoE.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Several studies also suggest a direct link between Abca1 polymorphisms and risk for AD (32, 49, 50).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	173	In summary, we have shown that ABCA1 is required for normal CNS apoE levels in vivo as well as production of normally lipidated apoE-containing lipoproteins by astrocytes.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Since apoE levels in the CNS profoundly influence AD and CAA pathology in vivo, modulation of ABCA1 function and levels may be a novel therapeutic target for AD, CAA, and other diseases of the CNS.

0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received June 1, 1998 Revised and Accepted July 8, 1998.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	4	Possession of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) [epsis]4 allele is the most frequently associated genetic susceptibility factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Recently, new polymorphisms in the regulatory region of the APOE gene have been described.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We analysed the effects of three of these mutations (-491 AT, -427 CT and Th1/E47cs) on disease risk in a large case-control study, and tested their impacts on APOE allelic expression in brain tissues.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The Th1/E47cs T allele was associated with an increased risk of occurrence of AD, while the -491 T allele was associated with a decreased risk, independently of the APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 polymorphism effect.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, the impact of the Th1/E47cs mutation was the strongest.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The -427 CT polymorphism was not associated with the disease.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In AD subjects heterozygous for the [epsis]4 allele, analysis of allelic expression showed that the relative expression levels of the [epsis]4 allele were higher than those of the corresponding controls.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Consistent with epidemiological data, the relative level of expression of the [epsis]4 allele was modified accordingly to the presence or absence of the two main promoter polymorphisms, indicating, in vivo, the deleterious effect of the Th1/E47cs T allele and the protective effect of the -491 T allele in population.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	12	 These data indicate that in addition to the qualitative effect of the APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 polymorphisms on the AD occurrence, the quantitative variation of expression of these alleles due to functional APOE promoter mutations, is a key determinant of AD development.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	13	The presence of at least one apolipoprotein E (APOE) [epsis]4 allele is a major genetic susceptibility factor for late-onset familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This risk factor accounts for ~45-60% of cases (1).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Indeed, the [epsis]4 allele is associated with an increased risk of AD in an allele dose dependant manner (2,3).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Conversely, the [epsis]2 allele protects against the disease (4,5).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The mechanisms by which apoE isoforms are implicated in human nervous system physiology and influence the pathogenesis of AD, are not fully understood (2,6-8).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The effect of the APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 alleles may not be due only to the intrinsic biochemical properties of the isoforms coded by these alleles.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Other genetic variants influencing APOE allele expression may account for the increase or decrease in the level of risk of AD.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This hypothesis is supported firstly by preliminary observations of the relative overexpression of the [epsis]4 allele compared with the [epsis]3 allele in the brain of patients with AD, compared with controls (9).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Secondly, Th1/E47cs and -491 AT polymorphisms located in the APOE promoter have been described and associated with AD risk (10,11).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Moreover the effect of these two polymorphisms on AD occurrence was described separately in case-control studies.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This prompted us to analyse the relative contribution of these two promoter polymorphisms, and also a third, located at position -427 of the APOE promoter together with the [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 alleles, towards AD risk in a large case-control study (509 controls and 573 AD cases).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Furthermore, we investigated the possible influences of the two main polymorphisms on APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 allelic relative expression in brain tissues, to approach their in vivo functionality, in brain samples from 49 AD cases and 45 controls.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	25	As expected, possession of the [epsis]4 allele was strongly associated with AD [odds ratio (OR) = 5.

0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	34	 To eliminate possible confounding effects of the APOE [epsis]4 allele on the association of the Th1/E47cs and -491 AT polymorphisms with AD, we controlled the effects of each allele using logistic regression adjusted for the presence or absence of the [epsis]4 allele.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	35	 After adjustment, the risk associated with possession of at least one Th1/E47cs T allele persisted (OR = 1.

0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	37	 This observation suggested that the effect of the Th1/E47cs T allele is independent of that of the [epsis]4 allele, while the -491 T allele is not.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, since the Th1/E47cs G and [epsis]2 alleles are in complete disequilibrium (Table 2), we also performed a logistic regression including both protective and deleterious effects of [epsis]2 and [epsis]4 alleles, respectively.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The risk associated with the Th1/E47cs T allele still persisted (OR = 1.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	40	If we assume that the level of expression of the APOE alleles is increased or decreased due to cis mutations in the promoter region, this hypothesis has two major implications: (i) promoter mutations may modulate the expression of the APOE alleles leading to an increase or decrease of the deleterious or protective risk associated with the [epsis]4 or [epsis]2 allele, respectively; and (ii) given that what determines the risk is the importance of the relative level of expression of both alleles of APOE, as suggested by preliminary data (12), the promoter mutations will have differential effects detectable mainly in APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 heterozygous individuals.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	41	 To verify these assumptions, we studied the OR of developing AD for APOE heterozygous and homozygous individuals, using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex and the presence of at least one -491 T and one Th1/E47 T allele.

0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	58	 In order to test this hypothesis, we obtained 94 AD or control brain tissues heterozygous for the APOE and measured the percentage of the expression level of the three APOE alleles.

0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	60	 As suggested by preliminary data (9), there was a clear and consistent increase in the relative [epsis]4 allelic expression between [epsis]3[epsis]4 patients and [epsis]3[epsis]4 controls (34.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	61	 A significant decrease in the relative [epsis]2 expression was demonstrated in [epsis]2[epsis]3 AD brains compared with [epsis]2[epsis]3 controls (32.

0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	68	The previous epidemiological data suggest that the -491 AT polymorphism and the Th1/E47cs polymorphism may be good candidates to mediate these allelic distortions.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In particular, estimation of the OR associated with the combination of the [epsis]4 and the Th1/E47cs T allele on the same chromosome indicate an estimated increased risk of 1.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	70	7 for the heterozygous [epsis]3/[epsis]4 individuals presenting this haplotype, as described previously (10).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Thus, if the [epsis]4 allele is associated with the Th1/E47cs T allele on the same chromosome, while the [epsis]3 allele is associated with the Th1/E47cs G allele on the other, the relative [epsis]4/[epsis]3 mRNA ratio should be significantly increased and associated with AD.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Conversely, if both [epsis]4 and [epsis]3 alleles are under the control of the same Th1/E47cs allele, either G or T, the level of expression should be similar.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Thus, we expected a stronger distortion in Th1/E47cs heterozygotes than in homozygotes.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	74	 This argument is clearly illustrated by our experimental data (Table 3).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The same approach is valid for the -491 AT mutation.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	76	The influence of both polymorphisms on relative mRNA expression level could be observed only in cases (Fig.

0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	82	The deleterious effect of the Th1/E47cs T allele and the protective effect of the -491 T allele described recently (10,11) were confirmed by this large case-control study.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	83	 These effects were obvious in the APOE heterozygous population, but not in the homozygous population.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	84	 These data are not surprising for two reasons: (i) we would expect that APOE [epsis]4 homozygotes with high expressing promoter alleles on both chromosomes, had a higher risk of developing AD than [epsis]4 homozygotes with low expressing promoter alleles.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	85	 However, the small size of the [epsis]4/[epsis]4 control population did not allow such an impact to be brought forward; (ii) as a consequence, the measured OR in [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 homozygous individuals mainly depended on the [epsis]3/[epsis]3 population.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	86	 No effect was found in the latter population whatever the studied promoter polymorphism.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Furthermore, the apoE3 isoform is considered as the isoform having the lesser effect on AD pathology.

0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	89	We did not confirm the deleterious effect of the -491 AA genotype described in the [epsis]3[epsis]3 Spanish population (11).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	90	 This discrepancy may be explained by the significant difference in the -491 AT genotype distribution observed between the Spanish and the French or American control populations.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Since the AD genotypic frequency was similar in the three studied populations, the deleterious effect of the AA genotype in the [epsis]3[epsis]3 group may only be due to the distribution in the Spanish control population.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	92	When the impacts of these two promoter polymorphisms and the APOE [epsis]4 allele were studied simultaneously in a multiple logistic regression model, we demonstrated that only the Th1/E47cs T allele modified the risk of developing AD independently of the [epsis]4 allele, suggesting that the -491 polymorphisms may play a weaker role compared with Th1/E47cs in the development of AD.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The location of both polymorphisms in the regulatory region of the APOE gene, their effects on the transcriptional activity in hepatoma cells (12) and their impacts in AD population, prompted us to test the hypothesis that they may modulate the APOE expression levels in brain and, therefore, be partly responsible for the marked allelic distortion of the APOE mRNA we observed in AD brain compared with controls in all the heterozygous genotypes.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Indeed, the [epsis]4 allele was overexpressed in [epsis]3[epsis]4 and [epsis]2[epsis]4 AD cases and the [epsis]2 allele underexpressed in [epsis]2[epsis]3 AD cases compared with their respective controls.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Consistent with the effects deduced from the case-control study, the [epsis]4 allele expression in AD brain was also correlated with the polymorphisms of the regulatory region of the APOE (Fig.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	96	 2): the Th1/E47cs T allele may increase the relative expression of the [epsis]4 allele in AD, while the -491 T allele may decrease it.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	97	Because numerous studies reported contradictory findings in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concerning apoE protein level, it is difficult to speculate on the link between APOE mRNA and apoE protein levels (13-17).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	98	 However, as suggested by Yamada et al.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	99	, the APOE expression may be decreased by an [epsis]4 gene dosage in AD: the [epsis]3 homozygous AD cases expressed more APOE mRNA than the [epsis]4[epsis]4 AD cases, the [epsis]3[epsis]4 presenting an intermediate mRNA level (18).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	100	 A similar trend was found for proteins in AD brains (14) or in plasma (J.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Poirier, personal communication), indicating that both the protein and mRNA levels may be directly correlated during the disease.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Underlining the importance of apoE level, the APOE expression has been shown to correlate with A[beta] peptide deposition in transgenic mice (19,20).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	103	This observation may be very important, since previous reports showed that the APOE gene expression was increased between 2- and 3-fold in AD brains compared with controls regardless of the APOE genotype (18,21).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	104	 In [epsis]3[epsis]4 AD cases, both the [epsis]3 and [epsis]4 alleles would be overexpressed, but the [epsis]4 allele, due to the promoter mutations, being still more overexpressed than the [epsis]3 allele.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Exacerbation of APOE [epsis]4 expression level may foster the intrinsic deleterious effect of the apoE4 isoform in AD for instance in promoting A[beta] aggregation (2,6,22).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	106	This expression level modulation may be intended not only for neurodegenerative disease, but also for neural development.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Indeed, we observed a strong underexpression of the [epsis]4 allele compared with the [epsis]3 allele in controls.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Although the role of apoE during maturation and ageing is not completely understood yet, the fact that apoE deficient homozygous mice exhibit reversible dendritic alterations and significant learning deficits in the Morris water maze, suggests neurotrophic capabilities for apoE (23-25).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	109	 However, the abilities of each isoform may be different since the apoE4 isoform does not have the same effects as the apoE3 isoform on neurite outgrowth (26).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	110	 For instance, apoE3, but not apoE4, may stabilize the neuronal cytoskeleton (7).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	111	A global assessment of the modulation of APOE expression is difficult.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Indeed, to date, five polymorphisms have been described in the APOE promoter region (10,12).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Two of the three polymorphisms studied, seem to play a role in AD.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	114	 The two remaining have allelic frequencies  < 1% (12), and therefore cannot explain the effects observed in the case-control and mRNA studies.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	115	 However, it remains possible that other unknown polymorphisms modulate the APOE mRNA level.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	116	 These new mutations may be far away from the promoter polymorphisms, for instance in the brain tissue specific element (27,28).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The interaction between all the putative polymorphisms modifying APOE expression will be very difficult to model.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Various combinations of different mutations may confer a large APOE expression heterogeneity at two levels: (i) the absolute level of APOE expression and (ii) the percentage of expression of one allele compared with the other in heterozygous individuals, adding to the complexity of the association between APOE and AD.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Therefore, the variation of the APOE expression induced by the APOE promoter polymorphisms may partly explain the heterogeneity of the impact of the [epsis]4 allele in different ethnic groups (1,29).

0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	4	Received March 30, 2004; Accepted June 15, 2004.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	5	APOE 4 was first shown through association studies to be a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease, presumably through its role in conferring high circulating cholesterol levels, mainly in the form of LDL, in individuals with one or more copies of the allele (3,4).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Subsequently, APOE 4 was found to be associated with increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) (5,6).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Furthermore, the presence of one or more 4 alleles decreases the age of disease onset by as much as 10 years (7).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	8	One hypothesis as to the link between APOE genotype, cardiovascular disease and AD involves the contribution of cholesterol homeostasis to both diseases and the role of APOE in this process.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Several studies have implicated a role for cholesterol in the production of Ass, the primary constituent of senile plaques in the AD brain (8 to 12).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	10	 High serum cholesterol levels in mice transgenic for APP, the precursor protein for the Ass peptide, correlate with increased brain Ass levels and a more severe plaque load (13,14).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Retrospective epidemiological studies have demonstrated a decreased AD risk in human populations on statin therapy to lower cholesterol levels (reviewed in 15), although this effect may be indirect, as several studies have shown that statins do not alter the Ass levels in serum (16,17).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Several studies have reported an association of elevated serum cholesterol levels with AD risk and levels of Ass (18,19), independent of APOE genotype.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Other studies, however, have failed to demonstrate a correlation between serum cholesterol levels and AD development (20).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	14	 APOE 4 may affect AD risk by conferring high cholesterol levels and thereby increasing Ass production.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	15	 AD patients with an 4 allele have increased levels of Ass1 to 40 in their brains and CSF, and have more extensive plaque pathology (21,22).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Interestingly, the 2 allele, which confers low cholesterol levels, is also considered to be protective against AD development (7).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	17	Several APOE transgenic mouse models have been generated in efforts to gain insight into the role of APOE in AD (23 to 26).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	18	 These models utilize various promoters to drive the expression of human APOE cDNAs in neurons and glia.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	19	 This approach has several limitations concerning the regulation of APOE in both the brain and the periphery.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	20	 First, most APOE transgenic studies have attempted to normalize APOE levels in the APOE 3 or 4 transgenic lines with respect to each other (23) or to endogenous levels (24).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, several human studies suggest that levels of APOE vary with genotype and may impact AD pathogenesis.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Second, all APOE transgenic lines have been bred onto the Apoe-null background, which confers high circulating cholesterol levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Given the role of Apoe in peripheral cholesterol metabolism and the growing evidence for cholesterol levels influencing brain Ass metabolism, it is unclear how the absence of Apoe affects AD pathology in these animals.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Importantly, there has been no consensus about the impact of APOE genotype on AD pathogenesis from these studies, perhaps owing to the complications of different promoters and altered levels of APOE in the brain, combined with the complications of a mixed genetic background in these models.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	25	APOE knock-in (KI) mice provide unique model for understanding how each APOE allele behaves in the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We have obtained these mice, previously published by Hamanaka et al.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	27	 (27), in order to further characterize the behavior of human APOE alleles in a defined genetic background.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We present APOE protein abundance, cholesterol and lipoprotein data from young animals expressing APOE 2, 3 and 4 on a defined C57BL/6J background.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	29	 We demonstrate significant differences in protein abundance, which mirrors the human data, as well as significant differences in serum cholesterol levels in the absence of an effect on APP processing.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The presence of APOE significantly increases levels of both Ass and cholesterol in brain, irrespective of allele.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This genomic-based mouse model provides evidence that neither cholesterol levels nor APOE abundance alone is sufficient to influence Ass metabolism in young animals.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	32	Protein abundance in APOE KI mice The levels of steady-state APOE in brain, liver and serum of the three KI mouse lines were determined by western blot analysis using a human-specific APOE antibody.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Parallel western blots of recombinant E2, E3 and E4 serial dilutions (6.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	34	5, 25, 50  microg of protein) were run to determine the affinity of this antibody for each isoform.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Standard curves of fluorescent units for each isoform revealed little difference in detection.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	36	 E4 appeared to be detected slightly less well (data not shown).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Levels of APOE protein in each KI animal were compared with a standard homogenate (or serum standard) from a homozygous 3 KI animal.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Figure 1 illustrates the differences in APOE levels compared across lines as the ratio of steady-state levels of each sample relative to the standard.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	39	 APOE 2 KI animals had an average 2-fold higher steady-state level of APOE in both brain and fasted liver when compared with 3 KI and 4 KI animals (Fig.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	40	 All three lines had significantly different levels of APOE in the brain.

0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	42	 2 KI animals demonstrated a 2-fold increase in the level of brain APOE by this method as well (P < 0.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	43	001), although E3 and E4 were not significantly different.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The difference shown by western blotting in the 3 and 4 lines may be explained by the slightly lower affinity of the antibody for recombinant E4.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The level of APOE in fasted serum of 2 KI animals was also significantly higher than those found in 3 KI and 4 KI animals by western blotting (Fig.

0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	62	  Cholesterol metabolism in APOE KI mice To examine how each allele affects cholesterol metabolism in the mouse, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured after a 6 h fast using an enzymatic assay.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Analysis of cholesterol levels in more than 20 animals of each genotype and of mixed sex demonstrated an inverse relationship between genotype and phenotype relative to the human data.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The 2 KI animals had both the highest cholesterol (mean 234 mg/dl) and triglycerides (mean 115 mg/dl).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	65	 In contrast, the 4 KI animals had the lowest cholesterol (mean 67 mg/dl), whereas the 3 KI animals did not significantly differ from B6 wild-type animals (Table 1).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Triglyceride levels in the 3 KI, 4 KI and B6 animals were statistically indistinguishable.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Fasted serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels by APOE genotype   To further understand how the different APOE isoforms participate in peripheral cholesterol metabolism in the mouse, we generated lipoprotein profiles by FPLC for each KI line.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The distribution of APOE and cholesterol was analyzed for each profile.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Fasted serum from three animals of the same sex was pooled for analysis of each genotype; no sex difference was apparent (data not shown).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The profiles for each genotype are shown in Figure 2.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	71	 APOE 3 KI and 4 KI profiles do not differ from that of B6 wild-type animals, in that the majority of circulating cholesterol is found in the HDL fraction, whereas the VLDL and LDL/IDL fractions are minimal.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	72	 In contrast, the 2 KI profiles demonstrated that, although the levels of HDL cholesterol remained equal to that found in the other lines, the cholesterol distribution extended to the LDL/IDL fraction and had the highest level in the VLDL fraction.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Thus, the increased total cholesterol levels in the 2 KI mice were due to an increase in VLDL and LDL/IDL cholesterol.

0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The absence of APOE in the VLDL fractions of Apoewt, 3 KI and 4 KI is distinct compared with the abundance of APOE in the 2 KI profile.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The majority of APOE in the 4 KI profile is found in the HDL fraction in contrast to the 3 KI and Apoewt profiles, which show the majority of APOE and Apoe in the LDL/IDL fraction.

0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	160	 These cholesterol data lend further evidence to the hypothesis that peripheral and brain cholesterol levels are independently regulated.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	161	APOE abundance Much is known about APOE biology in humans, particularly its role in lipid metabolism.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	162	 APOE is primarily synthesized in the liver and brain; additional sites include the adrenal gland and kidney (38,39).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	163	 APOE genotype has been shown to correlate with APOE abundance in the periphery (33,40 to 42); the 2 allele confers high APOE, whereas the 4 allele confers low APOE, with respect to 3 levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	164	 The effect of APOE alleles on APOE abundance in the brain and CSF is less clear owing to conflicting reports, with many studies concentrating on the abundance of APOE in AD brains relative to controls, irrespective of APOE genotype (35,43,44).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	165	We demonstrate by both western blot analysis and ELISA that the steady-state levels of APOE in tissues and serum from the three KI lines are genotype-dependent and reflect the human data for serum APOE levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	166	 2 KI animals have significantly higher levels of APOE in all tissues examined (P < 0.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Our findings, particularly the data from brain, illustrate the innate differences in the behavior of the three human APOE alleles in the mouse, arguing for the relevance of a genomic-based APOE model in understanding APOE function.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The differences in brain APOE levels in our KI mice may have important implications for how APOE influences pathology development in an AD mouse model.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	169	 A recent report by Sullivan et al.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	170	 (45), showing that brain APOE levels are genotype-independent in a different set of APOE KI animals contradicts these data.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	171	 However, their reported APOE lines contain a neo cassette in the targeted allele that may affect protein expression.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	172	 An additional difference is the inclusion of human APOE intron 1 in the targeted allele of their mice, which may contain additional endo genous regulatory elements.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Further comparisons between their mice and ours will be necessary to determine the innate differences between the two models.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	174	APOE and cholesterol metabolism in mice In addition to protein levels, we show that APOE genotype also impacts cholesterol levels in the periphery.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	175	 The 4 KI animals have fasted cholesterol levels that are slightly below those of B6 wild-type animals, whereas the 2 KI animals have 2-fold higher cholesterol levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The 3 KI and B6 wild-type cholesterol levels do not significantly differ.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	177	 These data recapitulate what has been shown in other APOE KI models (46 to 48), but are opposite from the findings in humans, where the 4 allele is associated with high and 2 with low cholesterol levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	178	 These data highlight the innate differences in mouse and human cholesterol metabolism, which include the utilization of different lipoproteins to transport cholesterol.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Our data also contrast with the initial report of the 4 KI mice by Hamanaka et al.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	180	5-fold increase in levels of circulating cholesterol relative to wild-type controls.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	181	 This discrepancy in the data may be attributed to several factors.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	182	 The first, and perhaps most notable, is the difference in genetic background between these two studies.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Several lines of evidence demonstrate a strong genetic component to cholesterol metabolism in the mouse (46 to 48).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	184	 This complex trait involves genes that work both in an additive manner as well as epistatically (49).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Our analysis of cholesterol in these KI mice over subsequent backcrosses further argues for background effects, as demonstrated by comparing the cholesterol levels in the 4.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	186	40 animals at the N8 backcross generation (Table 1 versus Fig.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Second, the KI mice that we report no longer transmit the neo cassette in the targeted allele.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Although there is no direct evidence to suggest that the presence of neo affects the function of APOE or cholesterol metabolism in these mice, this cannot be ruled out.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Finally, the differences in diet or methodology between the two studies may also impact the reported cholesterol levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	190	Further characterization of lipoprotein profiles from our reported 3 and 4 KI mice demonstrated that the majority of cholesterol distributed to the HDL fraction, similar to B6 wild-type animals.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	191	 These data suggest that the presence of human APOE 3 or 4 does not disrupt mouse cholesterol metabolism, an observation also made by Maeda and colleagues (50 to 52).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Comparison of these profiles with that published by Hamanaka et al.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	193	 highlights a further distinction between their 4 KI model and that characterized here.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	194	 In contrast to our data, Hamanaka et al.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	195	 showed cholesterol distributed to all lipoprotein classes in the 4 KI mice, including VLDL and LDL.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	196	 This profile is actually most similar to that of the 2 KI animals presented here.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	197	 These animals have significantly higher cholesterol levels and appear to transport the excess circulating cholesterol in the VLDL and LDL fractions, suggesting an impaired cholesterol metabolism.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	198	 The noted increase in triglyceride levels in these 2 KI animals also suggests the development of type III hyperlipoproteinemia, a complex disorder characterized by high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which affects 10% of humans homozygous for the 2 allele (53).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	199	 It has been suggested by Sullivan et al.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	200	 and others (51,54) that this condition manifests itself in 2 KI mice owing to the presence of additional genetic factors in the mouse genome that interact with the 2 allele.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	201	Qualitative western blot analysis of 3 and 4 KI FPLC profiles demonstrated that the behavior of E3 in mice maintained on a low cholesterol diet follows that of endogenous Apoe, found mainly in the IDL/LDL, with some in the HDL fraction; E4 appears to be enriched in the HDL fraction.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	202	 This observation may reflect another difference between mouse and human cholesterol metabolism.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	203	 The E4 isoform has a greater affinity for large lipoproteins, which in humans are chylomicrons and VLDL.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	204	 E2 and E3, on the other hand, prefer smaller lipoproteins and are primarily found associated with HDL, the smallest lipoprotein class.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Importantly, mouse plasma is enriched in a large, Apoe-rich HDL that is absent in normal human plasma (36).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	206	 It may be that E4 has a preference for these particles over the other two isoforms.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Our mice do not show an enrichment of APOE in VLDL, as observed by Maeda and colleagues.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	208	 This discrepancy with our data may be explained by differences in genetic background or diet.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Further comparisons between these two sets of APOE KI models, including levels of protein, will be required to thoroughly explain these results.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	210	Cholesterol and APP processing In order to identify the effects of each APOE allele on APP processing and Ass production, particularly with regard to cholesterol metabolism and APOE abundance, we crossed the APOE KI animals to R1.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Several studies have established a link between cholesterol and APP processing (10,55,56).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	212	 (13) demonstrated that cholesterol influences the cleavage of APP by beta-secretase in vivo, with hypercholesterolemia increasing CTFss levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	213	 However, neither levels of holo APP nor CTFs were altered in the APOE;R1.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The lack of an effect on APP processing in the 2 KI animals was unexpected, considering their high serum cholesterol levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	215	Analysis of Ass1 to 40 levels in these animals provided further evidence that serum cholesterol alone is not enough to affect APP processing at this young age.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Given the strong evidence for high cholesterol levels increasing Ass production (13) we predicted that the 2 KI animals, with a 2-fold increase in total serum cholesterol, would demonstrate much higher levels of Ass than the 3 KI and 4 KI mice.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	217	 However, similar to the CTF data, the levels of Ass1 to 40 in brain were indistinguishable across lines.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	218	 There are several possible explanations for these results.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	219	 First, the data we present here come from 28-day-old animals, an age just post-weaning and prior to sexual maturity.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	220	 It is possible that the ability of cholesterol to affect APP processing and Ass metabolism is time- or age-dependent.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Successful diet studies have chronically fed mice high cholesterol diets for several weeks (13,14).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Chronic exposure to high serum cholesterol levels for several weeks or months may be required to affect Ass metabolism in the APOE;R140 animals.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Assaying levels of Ass1 to 40 in older animals will be useful to further understand the age component of cholesterol effects and APOE on APP processing.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	224	Second, we show that peripheral cholesterol metabolism does not affect CNS cholesterol regulation.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Despite the differences in serum cholesterol in the three APOE;R1.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	226	40 lines described in this manuscript, brain cholesterol levels are indistinguishable in these animals.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	227	 This finding is supported by a large body of evidence demonstrating that cholesterol metabolism in the periphery is fundamentally different from and independent of that in the central nervous system, involving different lipoproteins and apolipoproteins (57 to 59).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	228	 This argues against an effect of peripheral cholesterol on processes in the brain.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	229	40 animals demonstrate significantly increased brain cholesterol levels over R1.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	230	40 animals with endogenous Apoe; brain cholesterol levels in the E3.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	231	R140 animals were also greater than those of R1.

0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	233	 These data correspond with significant increases in brain Ass1 to 40 levels in the APOE;R1.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	234	40 animals, suggesting that brain cholesterol levels in particular may have a significant impact on Ass production.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Notably, one diet study increased brain cholesterol in addition to Ass levels (14).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Our data argue for the independent roles of APOE in peripheral and CNS cholesterol metabolism, and furthermore suggest a distinction between APOE and endogenous Apoe effects on both murine brain cholesterol metabolism and steady-state Ass levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	237	APOE and Alzheimer's disease This manuscript highlights the first report of an APOE mouse model that utilizes endogenous regulation to study native APOE levels and cholesterol metabolism in relation to Alzheimer's disease.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Importantly, the correlation between APOE genotype, APOE steady-state levels and cholesterol metabolism observed in humans is uncoupled in the KI mice.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	239	 This allows us to further dissect two aspects of APOE function that may impact the development of AD, cholesterol metabolism and Ass clearance.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	240	 APOE abundance in the brains of 4 KI animals is low, but these animals have normal serum cholesterol levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	241	 These animals allow us to study the effects of low APOE levels in the absence of high cholesterol, which is often observed in humans who inherit an 4 allele.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Likewise, the 2 KI animals have both high serum cholesterol and high brain APOE levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	243	 These animals are useful to determine the effects of high cholesterol independent of low APOE levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Future experiments will assess the effects of both age and diet in the APOE;R1.

0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	4	Received for publication, December 18, 2002, and in revised form, January 23, 2003.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	5	Plasma remnant lipoproteins are the metabolic end products of intestine-derived chylomicrons and hepatocyte-derived very low density lipoprotein (1-3).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Apolipoprotein (apo)1 E mediates the uptake of remnants in the liver by binding to the LDL receptor (LDLR), the LDLR-related protein (LRP), and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (4-7).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Inefficient clearance leads to the accumulation of remnants in plasma and contributes to premature atherosclerosis (8, 9).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	8	The liver is the major source of plasma apoE; extrahepatic tissues, primarily macrophages, contribute up to 10% of plasma levels (10).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Hepatocyte-derived apoE has been proposed to promote remnant clearance and uptake through a two-step process referred to as secretion-capture (3, 11, 12).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In the first step, a portion of newly secreted apoE interacts with HSPG and remains bound to hepatocyte cell surfaces; the remainder is released into the space of Disse, where it serves to enrich lipoproteins (11-13).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The presence of apoE on hepatocytes is thought to promote the trapping, or sequestration, of remnants (6, 11).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In support of this mechanism, distinct dynamic pools of apoE on hepatocyte cell surfaces have recently been reported in vitro (14).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In the second step, sequestered remnants are further enriched with hepatocyte-derived apoE and are internalized into hepatocytes through processes mediated by receptors, including the LDLR and the LRP (7, 15-19), or through interactions with HSPG alone (11, 20, 21).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	14	 When apoE/HSPG interactions are disrupted in vivo by intravenous heparinase infusion, remnant clearance is severely inhibited, supporting the importance of the secretion-capture role of apoE in remnant clearance (22, 23).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	15	The importance of hepatically synthesized and localized apoE, and thus the secretion-capture role of apoE, has recently been questioned (24).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Moreover, evidence from mouse models expressing apoE exclusively from extrahepatic sources suggests that hepatic apoE expression is not absolutely required for remnant clearance or for normal plasma cholesterol levels (25-27).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Finally, it is not clear whether hepatic apoE expression is required for remnant clearance in mice lacking the LDLR (24, 28, 29).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	18	We previously reported (30) the generation of hypomorphic apoE (hypoE) mice that express reduced levels of Arg-61 apoE, which is similar to human apoE4 in that it displays apoE4 domain interaction.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The reduction in apoE levels is caused by a neomycin (neo) cassette flanked by loxP sites in Apoe intron 3.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, the expression pattern of the hypomorphic allele remains normal, with the liver producing the majority of apoE in these mice (30).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Excision of the neo cassette by Cre-mediated gene repair restores normal expression of the allele in all tissues (31).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Despite having only 2-5% of wild-type plasma apoE levels, hypoE mice display a nearly normal lipoprotein profile.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	23	 However, in Apoe/ mice with similar plasma apoE levels after transplantation with varying amounts of wild-type bone marrow, remnants accumulate (32).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	24	 It was not until plasma apoE levels exceeded 10% of wild-type levels that remnant levels approached normal.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The more efficient remnant clearance in hypoE mice suggests the importance of hepatocyte-derived apoE and the secretion-capture role of apoE.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	26	Hepatocyte-derived ApoE Mouse Model-- The generation of hypoE mice, or the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, has previously been described (30).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Briefly, a neo cassette flanked by loxP sites was inserted into Apoe intron 3 by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells to help follow the replacement of the human equivalent of Thr-61 by an arginine, aimed at creating a model of apoE4 (31).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The presence of the neo cassette in Apoe intron 3 results in reduced apoE mRNA levels in all tissues and organs (30).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The apoE mRNA levels in the liver, brain, and spleen in targeted mice are ~5% of those in wild-type mice, resulting in plasma apoE levels equal to 0.

0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	115	Immunohistochemical analysis of liver sections demonstrated that the hepatocyte-derived apoE model contained significant levels of hepatically localized apoE, whereas the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model did not.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	116	 The hepatically localized apoE in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model likely originated mostly from hepatocytes, as the expression pattern of the hypomorphic Apoe allele in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model is normal, with the liver producing the majority of apoE in these mice (30).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	117	 However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the hepatically localized apoE in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model originated in the periphery.

0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	120	 The 8-fold greater accumulation of apoB48-containing remnants in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model is also consistent with the site of apoE synthesis influencing remnant clearance, despite both models having similar levels of plasma apoE.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	121	 In the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, low levels of hepatic apoE synthesis overcome to a significant degree the deficiency in remnant clearance seen in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	122	 In contrast to wild-type mice and similar to Apoe/ mice, both models had equally low levels of plasma apoB100.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	123	 The low levels of plasma apoE in the two models apparently failed to sufficiently enrich apoB48-containing remnants with apoE, causing them to become poor competitors with apoB100-containing LDL for binding to the LDLR.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	124	Alternatively, the reduced levels of apoB100 in both models may result from decreased apoB100 secretion by the liver.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	125	 However, hepatic apoE expression has been reported to influence the production rate of both apoB48 and apoB100 in mice (35).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	126	 The finding that the levels of apoB48 are far greater in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model than in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, emphasizes the importance of hepatically derived and localized apoE in remnant clearance, as the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model likely secretes reduced levels of apoB48, similar to Apoe/ mice (35).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Thus, a direct assessment of apoB secretion rates in both models will be necessary to confirm this possibility.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Lastly, remnant clearance in both models may have been influenced by the recently described recycling pathway of apoE in liver hepatocytes (36).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	129	 However, as only 6% of internalized apoE was reported to be re-secreted by hepatocytes, the pathway likely plays a minor role in mediating remnant clearance in our models that have very low levels of plasma apoE.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	130	Directly comparing remnant clearance in both the hepatocyte-derived and non-hepatocyte-derived apoE models confirmed the conclusions drawn from the steady-state plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels, which indicate that hepatocyte-derived apoE is more effective than non-hepatocyte-derived apoE in remnant clearance.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	131	 When compared with wild-type mice, the initial phase of remnant clearance was similarly reduced in both mouse models and comparable with apoE null mice.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	132	 As the initial phase likely reflects the binding and sequestration of remnants on hepatocyte cell surfaces in the space of Disse, the levels of apoE molecules per remnant as well as the levels of hepatically localized apoE in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model do not appear to contribute significantly to this process.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Moreover, the differences in lipoprotein pool sizes in the models did not affect the rapid initial clearance of remnants.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	134	 However, the near normal level of remnant clearance after 3 h only in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, suggests that hepatically derived and localized apoE contribute substantially to a slower component of remnant clearance, which likely represents liver-uptake.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Indeed, livers from the hepatocyte-derived apoE model contained 70  plus or minus  5% of normal 125I levels, whereas livers from the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model contained only 38  plus or minus  4%.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	136	In the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, apoE-poor remnants sequestered on hepatocytes likely become enriched with newly secreted apoE in the space of Disse or by the passive exchange from existing hepatically localized apoE, allowing for accelerated receptor-mediated internalization through the LDLR and the LRP or through HSPG alone.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	137	 However, in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model, a large proportion of sequestered apoE-poor remnants likely redistribute to and accumulate in the circulation due to the absence of apoE-enrichment in the space of Disse and inefficient receptor-mediated uptake.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	138	Studies of remnant clearance in an isolated mouse liver perfusion model have recently questioned the importance of hepatic synthesis and localization of apoE and thus the importance of the secretion-capture role of apoE in remnant clearance (24).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Livers from Apoe/ mice cleared an infused bolus of apoE-containing rat chylomicron remnants as efficiently as those from wild-type mice, which, unlike livers from Apoe/ mice, had abundant levels of apoE localized on hepatocyte cell surfaces (24).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	140	 More recent data from this model suggested that apoE/HSPG interactions on hepatocyte cell surfaces are not required for efficient remnant uptake (29).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Rather, apoE/LRP interactions were proposed to mediate the direct sequestration and internalization of remnants.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	142	Interestingly, and in parallel to the results observed in the mouse liver perfusion model (24), the absence of hepatically localized apoE in both the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model and in Apoe/ mice did not influence the early phase of remnant clearance relative to the hepatocyte-derived apoE model.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Indeed, all three of these mouse models displayed similarly delayed initial rates of remnant clearance relative to wild-type mice.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	144	 However, a shortcoming of the liver-perfusion model is that the results cannot necessarily be extrapolated to explain the steady-state levels of remnants in mice.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	145	 For example, in apoE null mice, the perfused liver effectively cleared an infused bolus of remnants, whereas at steady-state the mice accumulate remnants in plasma.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In contrast, our in vivo models directly focus on the steady-state levels of remnants in mice.

0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In the CNS, the 4 ApoE allelic form was identified and shown to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (9).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	7	ApoE is thought to be important in the normal functioning of neural tissue and in response to injury, although the exact mechanisms are not clear.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	8	 It has been shown to be synthesized and secreted by both astrocytes (6,11) and monocytes (12,13).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The finding that ApoE is in neurons in the brain (14) is explained by the presence of ApoE receptors and reflect the uptake of the molecule (15).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Using a spinal cord injury model (16), we previously showed that both ApoE mRNA and protein levels are upregulated after spinal cord injury in the mouse (17).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	11	The effects of knocking out the ApoE gene have been studied in mice (18).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Creation of the knockout involved the insertion of the neomycin resistance gene by homologous recombination in place of exon 3 and part of intron 3 of the ApoE gene.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Mice that were heterozygous for the knockout gene were reported to be healthy at 3 months of age and produce homozygous knockouts at the expected frequency.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These homozygous knockout progeny appear healthy despite the absence of ApoE in their plasma.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	15	In the present study, we show evidence for two additional mouse sense transcripts generated from the ApoE gene, which could be transmembrane proteins, and an antisense transcript which has an open reading frame in exon 4 that is conserved between mouse and human.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The antisense protein falls within the region of the epsilon 4 allele that has been linked to the familial onset form of Alzheimer's disease (9,19).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	17	 We also demonstrate the expression of one sense and antisense ApoE transcripts in ApoE knockout mice.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Furthermore, we show that these transcripts are upregulated in B6 mice after spinal cord injury and follow the upregulation of ApoE itself.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Finally, we find that for one of the additional sense transcripts and the antisense transcript, corresponding RNAs exist in human.

0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Thereafter, the amino acid sequence is identical to ApoE S1.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Starting transcription in such a manner upstream of exon 2 transforms the secretory signal peptide into a transmembrane helix.

0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The corrected sequence of ApoE S3 still predicts an open reading frame; however, the resulting amino acid sequence is entirely different from ApoE S1 even in the shared part of exon 4 because ApoE S3 is using a different reading frame.

0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	107	 For AS1 (lanes 1 and 2), RT was carried out using primer 44F.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Both RT reactions were PCR amplified using primers 69F and 40R.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Control reactions were performed in the absence of RT.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	110	  The use of specific RT and PCR primers revealed that both ApoE S3 and ApoE AS1 are expressed in liver of the knockout (Fig.

0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	129	 PCR shown in (C) was carried out with primer pair 52F and 41R to show levels of ApoE S1; in (D) with 44F and 40R for ApoE S3.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	130	 In (E), the RT was primed with 45F and amplified with 46F to 46R for demonstrating levels of expression of ApoE AS1.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	131	 To normalize, we included a gene-specific primer for GAPDH (48R) in all the RT reactions and background correction levels were obtained by amplifying GAPDH with (47F to 47R).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	132	 (F) To exclude that the levels seen are due to different levels in genomic background, we included an experiment on samples that lacked the enzyme in the RT reaction amplifying genomic ApoE and GAPDH.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	133	  Real-time RT to PCR on RNA extracted from injured C57BL/6 mice actually reveals an increase in expression of both of these species as early as 4 days post-injury with maximal expression at around 2 weeks (Fig.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	134	 At their highest level, ApoE S1 and ApoE S3 are 10-fold upregulated compared with normal levels.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	135	 In contrast, ApoE AS1 is 100-fold upregulated.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	136	Detection of ApoE S2 protein through western blot analysis As ApoE S2 protein includes the ApoE S1 protein sequence, antibodies against ApoE S1 will also bind to ApoE S2.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Therefore, a western blot was exposed to ApoE antiserum.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	138	 In addition to the 34 kDa band depicting ApoE S1 in mouse liver and serum (Fig.

0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	141	 As ApoE S2 protein should not be present in the ApoE knockout, specificity was demonstrated by including knockout samples as negative controls on the blot.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Binding to both the 34 and 40 kDa proteins is absent in ApoE knockout mice, demonstrating specificity.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Even though ApoE S2 protein could not be detected in the liver by western blot analysis, it is likely that it is secreted by the liver because ApoE S2 message is almost exclusively expressed in the liver of the organs investigated.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	144	 One cannot, however, rule out that another organ not represented in Figure 2 is the source of the protein.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	145	 It is possible that the protein levels in liver are just below the detection limits of the western blot analysis, though the protein is secreted into the blood where it accumulates and can be detected.

0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	162	The presence of human ApoE AS1 was demonstrated by RT primed with 3F followed by PCR with primer 8F to 1R (lane 1, Fig.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Two products were amplified by this reaction, and after sequencing, the lower band was confirmed as originating from ApoE AS1 message.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	164	 The upper band is not a product of the ApoE gene.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	165	 If translated, the human and mouse proteins are highly conserved.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	166	One set of ApoE transcripts that we identified code for putative transmembrane proteins, one of which is frame shifted, the other is an antisense RNA.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Both sense and antisense messages have sequences recognized as translation start sites and therefore could exist as protein.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Examples demonstrating the expression of antisense message have been shown for a variety of genes (reviewed in 28 and 29) including urocortin (30), cardiac troponin (31) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (32).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The scenario we describe here for ApoE most closely resembles that of bFGF expression.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The bFGF gene locus is known to be transcribed into multiple mRNA products, including at least one antisense transcript.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	171	 This antisense transcript may be involved in regulating gene expression by hybridizing the sense transcript while still in the nucleus and perhaps affecting developmental patterns and tissue differentiation (32).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The bFGF transcript isolated from Xenopus could also, however, be translated into a 25 kDa protein of as yet unknown function (33).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	173	 At this point, it is unclear whether any of our newly identified ApoE transcripts, including the antisense transcript, are in fact translated except for ApoE S2 protein that is found in the serum.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Beyond being translated into a protein, all the transcripts could participate in regulating each other's levels through a process like RNAi.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	175	Marking yet another similarity with bFGF, the antisense transcript is present in both human and mouse (33).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	176	 For the ApoE antisense transcript, we can say that the reading frame is also open in humans and, consequently, there is the possibility that an antisense message is actually translated into a protein.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The protein predicted from sequence M10065 has 198 amino acids and has a signal peptide predicted by the SignalP-3.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	178	0 HMM program (34) with a probability of 0.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	179	 In contrast, in the mouse AS1 protein, the same program predicts a signal peptide with a probability of only 0.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Even deleting the first 21 amino acids in the mouse protein that the human protein lacks increases the probability only to 0.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Therefore, even though the human sequence probably enters the secretory pathway, the mouse sequence seems to lack a signal peptide.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	182	0 HMM are focusing on prediction of classical signal peptides, one cannot exclude the presence of other signal motifs in the mouse protein.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	183	The ApoE antisense protein is encoded by exon 4, the exon that accounts for the three major allelic variants in humans.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	184	 These allelic variations of the sense protein are defined by the substitution of an arginine (a positively charged polar amino acid) for a cysteine (a non-polar amino acid) at positions 112 and 158 of the protein (35,36).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	185	 In the putative antisense protein, an arginine is substituted for a histidine, both positively charged polar amino acids.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Therefore, these two variants are probably affecting the function of the antisense protein less than that of the sense protein and are therefore more conservative in the antisense direction.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	187	 However, as studies of allelic variations and their implications in disease have always been conducted in reference to the sense protein, other more prominent variations (Table 1) might lead to functional and more relevant changes.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	188	 One dramatic change is the variation at positions 3817 to 3819 (sequence position in reference to M10065).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The substitution of TAG to GCT on the antisense strand opens the reading frame, so translation can continue for another 113 amino acids.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The E4 allele as published by Paik et al.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	191	 (36) contains a stop codon at positions 3817 to 3819.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	192	 However, at this point, it is not clear if the allelic variation that opens the reading frame is linked with any of the major allelic forms like the E4, E3 or E2 genotype (for some of the observed haplotypes, see Table 1 in 37; for other relative frequencies of ApoE sequence variants within the E4, E3 and E2 genotypes, see Table 3 in 38).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Therefore, an involvement of the putative antisense protein in diseases correlated with the allelic variants cannot be excluded.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	194	 For example, in Alzheimer's disease, the specific molecular pathway by which ApoE modifies the expression of this disease remains elusive (19).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Furthermore, other sequence variations in the different alleles (34) that are conservative in the sense direction might lead to amino acid substitutions or even stop signals in the antisense direction.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Sequence variations of the human ApoE gene (accession no.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	197	: M10065) in relation to ApoE S1 and AS1 protein in intron 3 and exon 4   Even though our sequence work thus far suggests that human ApoE S2 is translated to the same protein as ApoE S1, allelic variation might cause an open reading frame similar to the one seen in C57BL/6 mice, leading to the presence of a transmembrane version of ApoE.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	198	Knockout organisms are created to investigate any phenotypic changes that may take place in that organism in the absence of a gene.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Our data suggest that the genetic manipulation used to generate the ApoE knockout has only eliminated the expression of ApoE S1 and ApoE S2 transcripts.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	200	 We found that both ApoE S3, a putative transmembrane protein with a sequence completely different than that known for the ApoE protein, and ApoE AS1, a protein potentially produced from an antisense transcript, are still expressed in the knockout.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	201	 This is possible because the region of the gene responsible for these transcripts, in particular exon 4, has not been disrupted by the insertion of the neo gene in the knockout.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The roles of these transcripts are currently unknown.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	203	 In addition, further work must be done to determine whether they are translated in vivo.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	204	An indication of a potentially important role for both the ApoE S3 and ApoE AS1 antisense messages in CNS disease comes from data in our mouse spinal cord injury model (16,17).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	205	 In response to spinal injury, both of these transcripts are upregulated and follow the expression pattern of ApoE S1.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	206	 However, as ApoE AS1 is 10-fold more upregulated than either ApoE S1 or S3 it might also be involved in influencing their translation.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Again, it would be useful to know if either of the alternate mRNAs is translated in response to spinal injury.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	208	ApoE is a lipoprotein, a class of proteins responsible for carrying cholesterol and other fats through the bloodstream as little packages and essential for the normal breakdown of these molecules.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	209	 In particular, ApoE is a major component of specific lipoproteins called very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	210	 A major function of VLDLs is to remove excess cholesterol from the blood and carry it to the liver for processing.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Maintaining normal levels of cholesterol is essential for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and stroke.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	212	 There are at least three slightly different versions of the ApoE gene.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	213	 The major versions, or alleles, are called 2, 3 and 4.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The most common allele is 3, which is found in more than half of the population.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Researchers have found that most people with familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition that causes very high levels of cholesterol and an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, have two copies of the 2 allele.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	216	 This allele seems to be one of several genetic factors that play a part in this disorder.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	217	 In addition, ApoE allelic version 4 is a risk factor for coronary artery disease.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	218	 People who inherit at least one copy of the ApoE 4 allele have an increased risk of developing type 2 Alzheimer's disease, which first appears later in life.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Studies have shown that people who inherit two copies of ApoE 4 have the highest chance of developing the disease.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	220	 It is not yet known how this allele affects a person's risk of Alzheimer's disease; however, it has been found that it increases the number of amyloid plaques, which are characteristic of the disease (9,19).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	221	Finally, EST evidence for an ApoE alternative splice variant in human does exist (41).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	222	 One EST corresponds to the last exon, which is different for ApoE S2 and S3.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	223	 This has been validated by RT to PCR which showed that it is expressed in lung cancer but not as strongly as in normal tissue.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	224	In conclusion, the ApoE protein may play a vital role in the occurrence of a diverse group of maladies.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	225	 It now appears that the ApoE gene can be characterized by a complex expression pattern with multiple start sites in the sense and antisense direction.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	226	 As they all have an open reading frame, these transcripts may be translated into proteins.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Work must be done to determine whether the antisense transcript is involved in regulating expression post-transcriptionally, is translated into a novel protein or both.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	228	 In addition, given the significance of exon 4 in the various allelic versions of ApoE, a knockout of this exon may give insight into its role.

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received October 28, 1997; Revised and Accepted December 19, 1997.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	4	The [epsis]4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), one of the main allele of APOE polymorphism, is a major risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	5	 However, several data suggest that genetic factors, within the APOE locus, may also modulate the risk associated with this polymorphism.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We look for new mutations in the APOE promoter, susceptible to modify the risk associated with the APOE [epsis]4 allele.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We characterised a G[rarr]T mutation at -186 bp of the APOE gene TATA box, named Th1/E47cs.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This new polymorphism is located in a consensus sequence of a potential transcriptional (Th1/E47) factor binding site.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We studied the impact of this new polymorphism with those of other markers of the APOE locus in a large case-control study and observed that Th1/E47cs modulated the influence of the APOE [epsis]4 allele on the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	10	The apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), a key player of the lipid transport, exists as three main alleles in the general population: [epsis]2, [epsis]3 and [epsis]4.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These polymorphisms correspond to mutations in the coding sequence of the APOE gene resulting in amino acid substitutions (Arg and Cys) at positions 112 and 158 of the protein.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This gene is located on chromosome 19 at position q13.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The implication of chromosome 19 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) was suspected on at least three occasions (1-3) before the report of an association between late-onset AD and the APOE [epsis]4 allele (4).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Numerous studies confirmed this finding and extended this observation to early-onset AD (5-7).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	15	 It is now established that carrying an [epsis]4 allele increases the risk of AD in an allele dose dependent manner and shifts the age of onset of the disease to earlier ages (8).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Conversely, bearing an [epsis]2 allele confers a protection against the disease (5,9,10).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Thus, the APOE genotype appears as an important biological marker for AD susceptibility accounting for between 45 and 60% of AD genetic variability.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	18	Several biological mechanisms have been proposed to underlie this association.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The E4 isoform would facilitate or not limit the amyloid substance deposition (11,12).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This isoform may not protect against oxidative stress, in contrast to the E2 isoform (13).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	21	 It has also been suggested that the E2 and E3 isoforms would prevent the aggregation of Tau protein by limiting abnormal phosphorylation leading to the constitution of paired helical filament, while the E4 isoform would not (14).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	22	However, none of these hypotheses fully explained why as many as 50% of homozygous subjects who survive until 80 years, do not develop AD.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This observation suggests that other factors should influence the APOE associated risk.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Indeed, other genetic and environmental factors such as family history, gender, smoking, oestrogen, cholesterol level or other polymorphisms located in APOE receptor genes for instance (15-20), may modify the APOE associated risk.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, recent reports suggest that additional genetic factors within the APOE locus itself may also modulate this risk.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Firstly, a genetic study of markers in the vicinity of the APOE locus demonstrated that a combination of three polymorphisms increases the estimation of the APOE associated risk of AD compared with APOE polymorphism alone (5).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Secondly, a distortion of the allelic expression of the APOE gene is observed in the brain of affected patients; indeed, the relative expression of the [epsis]4 allele is increased 1.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	28	5-fold in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 bearer AD patients, compared with [epsis]3/[epsis]4 bearer controls (21).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	29	Together, these data suggest the potential existence of one or more additional genetic susceptibility factors in the APOE sequence, modifying the risk associated with the APOE [epsis]4 allele in the occurrence of AD.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Detailed sequence analyses and a study of the APOE locus are needed to characterise such additional genetic factors.

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	32	To go further in this hunt for other polymorphism(s), we sequenced the 375 bp upstream of the APOE TATA box and detected a new polymorphism whose impact on AD risk, together with the APOE [epsis]4 allele was investigated in a large case-control study.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	33	Sequencing the 375 bp upstream to the TATA box of APOE, we found a (G[rarr]T) polymorphism at position -186 of the TATA box, located in a potential consensus binding sequence of the Th1/E47 heterodimer transcriptional factor (Fig.

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	59	We estimated the haplotypes generated by these four polymorphisms using the myriad haplotype algorithm.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Among the 16 theoretical haplotypes, 15 were observed (Table 3a).

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	91	If we assume that the level of expression of the APOE alleles is increased due to cis mutations in the promoter region, this hypothesis has three major implications: (i) the promoter mutation may modulate the expression of the APOE alleles leading to an increased deleterious risk for [epsis]4 and to an increased protective effect for [epsis]2; (ii) given that what determines the risk is the importance of the relative level of expression of both alleles of the APOE, this promoter mutation will have a differential effect in APOE heterozygous and homozygous genotypes; (iii) the effect of the cis mutation in heterozygous individuals will depend on the phase of this polymorphism with the APOE [epsis] alleles (i.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In heterozygous Th1/E47cs and APOE [epsis]4 genotype bearers, the [epsis]4 allele may be combined either with the Th1/E47cs T or G allele.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	93	 One of these combinations may increase the relative expression level of the [epsis]4 allele and decrease the relative expression level of the [epsis]3 allele, the other combination having the inverse influence.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Thus, in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 genotype bearers, the risk of developing AD will be different between the Th1/E47cs heterozygous and homozygous individuals.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	95	 To test these assumptions, we studied the gender and age adjusted OR for developing AD for Th1/E47cs heterozygous genotype bearers compared with homozygous Th1/E47cs individuals.

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	112	Recently, the hypothesis of other(s) mutation(s) nearby the APOE gene was fuelled by new physiological data: a difference in the allelic expression of the APOE gene was observed (19), suggesting that non-coding polymorphism(s) in the regulatory regions of the APOE gene could modify the risk of developing AD.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Looking for such new polymorphisms, we found a (G[rarr]T) polymorphism located at position +7 of a degenerative E-box consensus (Fig.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	114	 1) (23), that influenced the effect of APOE polymorphisms on AD in the expected way.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	115	The Th1/E47cs and 1E1 polymorphisms were associated with AD when studied separately.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Although a strong linkage disequilibrium existed between the [epsis]4, Th1/E47cs T and 1E1 G alleles, the effect of each of these polymorphisms persisted when introduced in the same logistic regression model.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	117	 This observation suggested that the risk associated with the APOE [epsis] alleles may be modulated according to their combination with other polymorphisms.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	118	 To have at least one Th1/E47cs T or 1E1 C allele significantly modified the risk of developing AD in the whole population.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Furthermore, the impact of the [epsis]4 allele seemed decreased, suggesting that part of its effect may be attributed to the promoter polymorphisms.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Another argument was brought forward when estimating the risk associated with the phase.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	121	 The estimated risk of developing the disease for the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 genotype bearers was not similar according to the combination of the Th1/E47cs and APOE [epsis] alleles on the same chromosome.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	122	 These results were in accordance with our previous data which suggest that the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 individuals will preferentially develop AD, because they expressed the [epsis]4 allele at a greater level.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Thus, a cis mutation in the APOE promoter, may favour the relative expression level of the [epsis]4 allele, and potentially the deleterious action of the E4 isoform.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	124	The Th1/E47cs polymorphism was characterised into a binding site of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, E47.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	125	 This factor E47 belongs to the class A proteins which are ubiquitously expressed and form combinatorial interactions with the class B proteins to control tissue-specific gene expression (24).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	126	 In particular, E47 is expressed in brain, associated with multiple class B protein and is implicated in the development and maintenance of the mammalian nervous system (25-27).

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	130	Nevertheless it is essential to determine, in vitro and in vivo, the functionality of this transcriptional factor sequence binding.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Furthermore, the effect of this new polymorphism susceptible to modulate the risk associated to the APOE alleles must be confirmed by other epidemiological studies and a more profound analysis will have to be performed to determine the haplotypes.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	132	 In conclusion, The Th1/E47cs polymorphism, located within a putative regulatory element of the APOE promoter could contribute to the APOE expression level but other polymorphisms in the regulatory sequences of this gene may exist and a more extended screening of these regulatory regions needs to be developed.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The regulation of the APOE gene could be very important for deciphering the mechanisms of the involvement of the APOE alleles, in particular to better define subjects at higher risk of developing AD.

0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received July 25, 1997; Revised and Accepted August 2, 1997.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	4	The APOE [epsis]4 allele is a strong genetic susceptibility factor for Alzheimer's disease.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Interaction with other biological factors may modulate the effect of the apoE isoforms.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, previous work suggested that other genetic variability within the APOE locus, influencing the effect of the [epsis]4 allele, may exist.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Such variability could modify the expression of the APOE gene and, in particular, the level of expression of APOE alleles could be an important determinant of disease pathogenesis.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	8	 To test this hypothesis we examined the levels of expression of APOE in heterozygotes with AD and in controls, using a new method of semi-quantitation.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We report that relative [epsis]4 mRNA expression is increased in AD compared with controls and suggest that genetic variability in the neural expression of APOE contributes to disease risk.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	10	The [epsis]4 allele of the APOE gene is a major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) (1), and is also implicated as a risk factor for early-onset disease in some populations (2,3).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Previous studies have described [epsis]4 homozygotes as having a higher risk of developing disease than [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, individuals bearing one or two [epsis]4 alleles, do not inevitably develop the disease.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Detailed genetic analysis around the APOE locus has suggested the existence of other genetic variability in this region which could contribute to disease risk (4).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	14	 There are two possible explanations for these observations: (i) there is another genetically variable locus in the vicinity of the APOE gene involved in the pathogenesis of the disease; (ii) there is a genetic variability in the control of expression of the APOE gene (4).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	15	There has been little examination of the mRNA expression of APOE in AD (5,6).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The available evidence suggests that APOE expression is increased by neuronal damage (7,8) and that the bulk of the expression occurs in astrocytes (5).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This expression is believed to be part of a compensatory mechanism aimed at aiding reafferentation and reactive synaptogenesis (9).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Only a few studies have examined the expression of the apoE protein in AD cases and controls relative to the APOE genotype (9,10).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	19	 have suggested that the amount of apoE protein could be inversely correlated to the number of [epsis]4 alleles carried by subjects: higher levels were observed in [epsis]3 homozygotes, lower in [epsis]4 homozygotes and intermediate levels in [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes (10).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	20	We hypothesised that, since [epsis]4 homozygotes have a higher risk of developing disease than [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes, and a high proportion of individuals with the latter genotype reach a greater age without developing AD, a likely explanation of this was that there was genetic variability in neural expression at the APOE locus and that [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygote individuals who were high [epsis]4 expressors and/or low [epsis]3 expressors were more likely to develop AD than individuals with high [epsis]3 expressors and/or low [epsis]4 expressors.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	21	The identification of the APOE allele transcription products is easily achieved by RT-PCR, using restriction fragment length polymorphism.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	22	 We developed a semi-quantitative assay to measure allelic expression of APOE mRNA by RT-PCR using silver staining (11).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This method of quantitation has been applied to brains of heterozygote subjects collected at various centres and used to assess the percentage of [epsis]4 mRNA expression in [epsis]3[epsis]4 and [epsis]2[epsis]4 subjects and [epsis]2 mRNA expression in [epsis]2[epsis]3 individuals.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This has been carried out both in AD cases and controls.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	25	We selected a series of [epsis]3[epsis]4, [epsis]2[epsis]4, [epsis]2[epsis]3 AD cases (n = 14) and controls (n = 12) in order to measure the relative level of expression of the APOE allele in the frontal cortex (Fig.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We observed that [epsis]3 mRNA expression was consistently greater than [epsis]4 mRNA expression in all cases (Fig.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In addition, there was a clear and consistent difference in the [epsis]4 allelic expression ratio between AD cases and controls (Fig.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	28	 2), with AD cases showing a higher relative expression of [epsis]4 mRNA than controls (34.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Regarding the other heterozygous genotypes, the small size of each group prevented us from reaching any definite conclusion.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Nevertheless, a trend towards the same situation as observed in the [epsis]3[epsis]4 group could be noted, an increase in the expression of the [epsis]4 allele in the [epsis]2[epsis]4 group (42.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	31	2% in the only control), whereas nothing was apparent in the [epsis]2[epsis]3 group (39.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	32	4% in the only AD case versus 45.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Furthermore, a difference in the allelic expression ratio between [epsis]2[epsis]4 and [epsis]3[epsis]4 AD cases was observed, since [epsis]2[epsis]4 patients showed a 1.

0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The [epsis]2 mRNA percentage was measured in the [epsis]2[epsis]3 population and the [epsis]4 mRNA percentage in the [epsis]3[epsis]4 and [epsis]2[epsis]4 population.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The average level of expression is indicated by a bold line in each category.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	40	 For each brain sample, RT-PCR and semi-quantitation was repeated three times.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	41	It is important to note that measurement of the ratio of expression of the two alleles in heterozygotes is likely to be a much more robust measurement than the determination of absolute levels of mRNA expression in the same tissue, since the latter will be profoundly affected by post-mortem delay, agonal state and cell population and density.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	42	As can be seen in Figure 2, the level of expression of the [epsis]3 allele is consistently higher than that of the [epsis]4 allele in the AD group as well as in the control group.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	43	 These data suggest that there is either differential stability of the different mRNA species, or that there is genetic variability in the expression of the two alleles in disequilibrium with the coding polymorphism.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	44	 However, in addition there was a clear and consistent difference in the [epsis]4 allelic expression ratio between AD cases and controls.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	45	 These results are consistent with the notion that part, at least, of the genetic risk of developing AD encoded at the APOE locus relates to the expression of this protein in the brain.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	46	 It would seem that heterozygote individuals who express a relatively high proportion of the [epsis]4 allele are at greater risk for developing disease than those expressing a relatively low proportion.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The observation that the different alleles of APOE are not equally expressed may be of importance in the formulation of hypotheses relating to the role of APOE in the pathogenesis of AD in general.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	48	 At present, there is much speculation and experimentation designed to determine the nature of the role of the different alleles of APOE in the pathogenesis of AD.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	49	 As previously suggested, the E4 isoform may facilitate (12) or not limit (13) the amyloid substance deposition.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	50	 This isoform would not protect against oxidative stress, conversely to the E2 isoform (14).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Finally, it has been suggested that the E2 and E3 isoforms may prevent the aggregation of Tau protein, while the E4 isoform may not prevent the paired helical filament formation (15).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	52	 However, these hypotheses are based on the premise that the APOE allele isoforms are equally expressed and present at similar concentrations in the brain.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	53	 These isoform-specific differences could be enhanced by a different representation of each isoform in an individual.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	54	To date, it seems difficult to link APOE mRNA and apoE protein levels.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Several studies had explored this issue reporting contradictory findings in brain (10,16), cerebrospinal fluid (17,18) and plasma (19).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	56	 But even if the apoE level was tested according to the APOE genotype, none of the previous studies have been able to determine the relative ratio between the different isoforms and thus our results are not comparable with them.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The development of isoform-specific monoclonal antibodies would help to determine whether the variation that is observed in our population is also present at the protein level (20).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	58	There are two major findings in our work.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	59	 First, that the expression of the [epsis]3 allele is consistently higher than the expression of the [epsis]4 allele.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Second, that the expression of the [epsis]4 allele beyond a certain level seems to greatly influence the vulnerability of an individual to Alzheimer's disease.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	61	It is interesting to note that APOE is up-regulated as a consequence of an insult.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	62	 showed an increase in the level of expression of APOE mRNA in rat after lesioning of the cerebral cortex (6).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	63	 showed that APOE mRNA was increased in AD brains (5).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Together these results support an event, which may lead to an increase of the APOE mRNA and, in parallel, a distortion of the allelic expression.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The distortion of the allelic expression may be specific to brain, and possibly restricted to certain areas (21).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	66	 This suggests a neural genetic susceptibility for AD associated with the APOE gene.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	67	Interestingly, Templeton reached a similar conclusion using a cladistic analysis of our previously reported genetic data (4).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Using haplotype data from markers surrounding the APOE locus, including the APOE polymorphism, Templeton showed that the coding polymorphism in the APOE gene was not sufficient to explain the increased risk for AD (22).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Our data suggest that the influence of non-coding polymorphism on ApoE expression may supply the rest of the answer.

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received May 21, 1998; Revised and Accepted August 18, 1998.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	3	While the [epsis]4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE, gene; ApoE, protein) is widely accepted as a major genetic risk factor for the late onset form of Alzheimer's disease (AD), recent evidence points to variations in ApoE levels as another important factor.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	4	 We have previously reported that a common variant in the regulatory region of APOE (-491A) is associated with risk for late onset AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In this report we analyze the association of another APOE promoter polymorphism (-427T/C) with AD in two case-control clinical samples and demonstrate a correlation between APOE promoter transcriptional activity and risk for AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The association studies show that the allelic variant (-427C) and the haplotype [-491A-427C] of the APOE promoter are associated with increased risk for AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Study of the transcriptional activity of the common haplotypes defined by combination of the -491 and -427 alleles indicated that the risk for late onset AD positively correlates with transcriptional activity of the APOE gene, suggesting that increases in the local expression of ApoE could be responsible for the association of APOE promoter polymorphism with AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	8	Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, exists in both familial and sporadic forms.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Genetic studies have led to the identification of three genes, [beta]-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (1), presenilin-1 (2) and presenilin-2 (3), which, when mutated, can cause autosomal dominant forms of familial AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, mutations in these three genes are responsible for only a small fraction of AD cases, while the vast majority of patients with AD presents with a late age at onset and shows non-Mendelian inheritance.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The absence of Mendelian inheritance indicates that late onset AD is a complex disease in which genetic and non-genetic factors are likely to be interacting.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The [epsis]4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE, gene; ApoE, protein) has been associated with an increased risk of developing AD (4).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, many AD cases have no APOE [epsis]4 alleles.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Thus it is likely that there are additional AD risk factors, both genetic and environmental, still to be identified.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	15	We have screened for genetic variability in the proximal promoter region of APOE (nt -1017 to +406) and observed three new polymorphic sites (-491, -427 and -219) (5) and a previously described one (+113) (6) within this region.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	16	 We have recently reported that one of these variants (-491A) is associated with risk for AD (7).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	17	 We now report that the allelic variant -427C of the APOE promoter is also associated with AD, whereas we found no significant association of -219 and +113 polymorphisms with risk for AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Results from others have suggested that the -219 polymorphism acts as a modifier of ApoE4- associated risk (8).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Study of the transcriptional activity of the haplotypes defined by combination of the -491 and -427 alleles indicates that the risk for late onset AD correlates with transcriptional activity of the APOE gene.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	20	During our screening of the transcriptional regulatory region of the APOE gene a novel polymorphic site (-427T/C) was identified (5).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The possible genetic association of this polymorphism with risk for AD was studied in a Spanish case-control sample, in which we had previously observed an association between the polymorphism at position -491 of the APOE promoter and risk for AD (7).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	22	The genotype and allele distributions for the -427T/C polymorphism are shown in Table 1.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The TC genotype and the C allele were more frequent, although differences did not achieved statistical significance, in the AD group than in the controls, suggesting that they were associated with an increased risk for AD [odds ratio (OR) 1.

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	30	In order to determine whether the variation in risk for AD associated with the -427T/C polymorphism was independent of the risk conferred by ApoE4, the sample was stratified on the basis of the absence or presence of the ApoE4 allele (Table 1).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	31	 No difference in the frequency of the -427C allele or the -427TC genotype was observed between the AD patients and controls bearing one or two ApoE4 alleles, but the -427C allele was clearly associated with increased risk for AD in individuals bearing no ApoE4 alleles (OR 3.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Similarly, the -427TC genotype was associated with a >3-fold increase in risk for AD in the same subpopulation (OR 3.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	33	45), indicating that the variation in risk for AD conferred by the -427T/C polymorphism is only apparent in individuals not carrying any ApoE4 allele.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The same trend was observed in the US group of individuals bearing no ApoE4 alleles (OR 1.

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	36	Since the -427T/C and -491A/T polymorphisms are located very close to each other within the proximal 5[prime]-flanking region of the APOE gene and both of them appeared to be associated with risk for developing AD, we analyzed their effect on AD risk when combined into haplotypes.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	37	 We first analyzed the [-491-427] haplotype distribution in both the Spanish and US samples.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	38	 A combined digestion of an APOE fragment spanning nt -512 to -285 with DraI and AluI was performed, which allowed identification of the four haplotypes and the 10 genotypes defined by the combination of the -491 and -427 alleles.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Haplotype [A-T] [-491-427] was the most common, followed by [T-T] and [A-C].
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	40	 No subjects with the T-C haplotype were found in either sample.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The distribution of these haplotypes in genotypes was close to that expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ([chi]2 test, P > 0.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Furthermore, no statistically significant evidence of linkage disequilibrium between these polymorphisms was detected ([chi]2 test, P = 0.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The most frequent genotype was [A-T]/[A-T], followed by [A-T]/[T-T] and [A-T]/[A-C]; these three genotypes accounted for >92% of both the Spanish and St Louis control populations.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The frequency of genotypes [T-T]/[T-T] and [A-C]/[T-T] was  < 5% and the frequencies of the other genotypes ranged from 0 to 2%.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The distribution of the major haplotypes and genotypes in the Spanish and St Louis samples is shown in Table 2.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	46	Since our previous study had revealed differences in transcription associated with the -491 polymorphism (5,7), we then examined the functional characteristics of the major [-491-427] haplotypes present in our populations.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The APOE proximal promoter activity of the three haplotypes ([T-T], [A-T] and [A-C]) was measured in U87 human astrocytoma cells using the same luciferase-based transient transfection system employed in our previous studies (5,7,19).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	48	 As shown in Figure 1, transcriptional activity of haplotypes [A-T] and [A-C] were increased by 30 and 100%, respectively, over that of haplotype [T-T], suggesting that the presence of the alleles conferring increased risk for AD (-491A and -427C) is associated with increased constitutive levels of APOE promoter activity in human astrocytoma cells.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The three haplotypes [T-T], [A-T] and [A-C] were thus named minus (-), even (x) and plus (+), respectively, according to their transcriptional activity.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Additional information was obtained using oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the -491 and -427 allelic forms in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, with freshly prepared nuclear extracts from U87 cells.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	51	 As shown in Figure 2, one of the three specific band shifts detected by the 427T probe (arrows) was not detected by the 427C probe, suggesting that the T->C substitution hinders binding of the probe to a nuclear protein.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	52	 This finding is in agreement with the data obtained in our previous work using the 491 probes (7) and strongly suggests that differential transcriptional activities of the three [-491-427] haplotypes encountered in astrocytoma cells are a consequence of differential binding to nuclear proteins present in these cells.

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	66	 A strong association between AD risk and promoter activity of the three predominant genotypes (x-, xx and x+) was observed in the Spanish non-ApoE4 individuals; taking as reference the x- individuals, the risk for AD was found to increase 6- and 18-fold in xx and x+ individuals, respectively.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Statistical significance of these data was evaluated by a logistic regression model.

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Although the association was less impressive than that encountered in the Spanish population, a similar dependence of OR for developing AD and promoter activity of the three predominant genotypes was detected in the non-E4 subpopulation (Table 3).

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	78	In this paper we report an association between polymorphisms in the proximal region of the APOE promoter and risk for AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	79	 We have previously reported association of homozygosity for the -491A allele with risk for AD (7).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Here we show that the -427C allele is also associated with risk for AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Furthermore, combination of these two alleles into the [-491A-427C] haplotype generates a high risk for AD, in particular in the Spanish population, in individuals bearing no ApoE4 alleles.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The same effect is observed in the St Louis sample, although the relative risk was lower than in the Spanish sample.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The difference in relative risk is most probably attributable to differences in the frequencies of APOE promoter haplotypes in the two control populations, since the two AD samples show very similar frequencies of promoter haplotypes.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	84	 It is well documented that population-based differences in ApoE4 allele frequency (9,10) give rise to population differences in relative risk for AD associated with this allele.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Consistently, in our samples the OR associated with ApoE4 in the Spanish population (8.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	86	3) was more than double that in the St Louis sample (3.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Based on these data, we anticipate that there will be wide variation in the relative risk for AD associated with the APOE promoter polymorphism in different populations, as has already been noted for the ApoE4 allele (11).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Dividing the sample on the basis of the presence or absence of ApoE4 revealed that the promoter polymorphisms and ApoE4 are independent risk factors.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Indeed, the risk due to the promoter polymorphism was most prominent in individuals without ApoE4 alleles.

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Regulation of APOE expression has been investigated thoroughly in hepatoma cells, where it has been shown that the elements required for efficient expression are located in the 5[prime] proximal region and in the first intron (16-18).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	97	 More recently, we have demonstrated that this region also drives efficient expression of APOE in astrocytoma cells (19).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The data presented in this report strongly suggest that allelic polymorphism in the transcriptional regulatory region of APOE may contribute to differences in the levels of ApoE synthesis by astrocytes.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Specifically, our data indicate that the single base substitutions corresponding to the -491 and -427 APOE polymorphic sites produce differences in transcriptional activity of the APOE promoter due to differential binding of nuclear proteins.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	100	 It is well documented that single nucleotide changes within a promoter region can dramatically affect transcriptional activity mediated by transcription factors (20-22).

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	102	 the higher the expression of ApoE, the higher the risk for AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	103	 There is increasing evidence suggesting that increased levels of ApoE are associated with AD pathogenesis.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Several studies have reported that ApoE levels are elevated in the brain and in plasma from AD patients (23-25).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Intracellular accumulation of ApoE has also been correlated with neuronal cell death and intracellular A[beta] stabilization (26).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Recent studies have also demonstrated that the level of ApoE expression can modify both the cytotoxic effects of ApoE and the propensity of A[beta] to deposit in the murine brain.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	107	 ApoE at concentrations found in the cerebrospinal fluid protects neuronal cells from A[beta] peptides, while higher ApoE concentrations could lead to neuronal cell death (27).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Crossing APOE knockout mice with mice overexpressing a human mutant APP gene indicates that A[beta] deposition correlates positively with ApoE dose and suggests that ApoE may facilitate A[beta] peptide deposition in vivo (28).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	109	Despite the evidence implicating ApoE4 as the single most important genetic determinant of susceptibility to late onset AD, its pathogenic role is not well understood.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The amino acid substitutions associated with the E2, E3 and E4 ApoE isoforms lead to differences in the predicted three-dimensional structure of ApoE that are likely to alter the functional properties of the molecule.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Several potential mechanisms of action of ApoE4 on AD risk have been proposed, based on the ApoE isoform-specific differences observed in several assays developed in brain cells (28-35).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	112	 However, to date there is no adequate explanation for the variation in risk for AD associated with the different ApoE isoforms.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	113	Based upon data presented here and elsewhere we suggest that there are two independent mechanisms by which AD risk can be modified in the APOE gene.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	114	 The first involves variants in the coding region that alter the functional properties of the ApoE molecule, while the second involves promoter region variants that result in quantitative differences in ApoE expression.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	115	 These two factors are associated with AD risk independently, i.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	116	 each one can produce risk by itself, but may interact with each other resulting in an overall risk for individuals bearing both ApoE4 and high expressing APOE promoter forms that would depend on the relative contribution of each of these two risk factors.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	117	In summary, our data strongly suggest that risk for AD associated with APOE promoter polymorphisms directly correlates with the transcriptional activity of the gene.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Further, we speculate that increases in the local expression of ApoE, due to the APOE promoter polymorphisms, could lead to enhanced deposition of A[beta] peptide in the brain, thus explaining the increased risk for AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	119	 If this is correct, then drugs that either control ApoE synthesis or inhibit A[beta] production or deposition may be useful in the treatment of AD.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Involucrin, an early marker of terminal differentiation, is a soluble protein precursor of the cross-linked cornified envelope (CE) and is synthesized in the keratinocytes of the upper spinous layers (Watt, 1983; Eckert et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	6	, 1981; Rice and Green, 1979; Steinert and Marekov, 1997).
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In hyperproliferative diseases like psoriasis, premature expression of involucrin is found in the lower spinous layers (Thewes et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Another main component of the CE is loricrin.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	9	 It is expressed in a later stage of differentiation (Watt, 1983) and is cross-linked to other epidermal proteins such as cystatin, elafin or filaggrin.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	10	The extracellular lipids of the barrier, predominantly ceramides, are synthesized in the keratinocytes, stored in the epidermal lamellar bodies and secreted into the intercellular space of the stratum corneum (Elias, 1983).
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Beside its structural role, ceramide is known as an important intracellular signal mediator for various cytokines, in particular tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (Liu et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	12	, 1997; Perry and Hannun, 1998).

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	17	 We detected high levels of sphingomyelinase and ceramides after barrier disruption as well as a significant delay in barrier repair in TNF-R55-deficient mice (Jensen et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In understanding the various biological effects of ceramides, it is important to know their direct intracellular targets.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	19	Recently, we found that the aspartatic protease cathepsin D (CTSD) is a novel specific intracellular binding protein for ceramide, derived from acid sphingomyelinase (Heinrich et al.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	21	 CTSD is the main aspartatic protease of endolysosomes.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	22	 It is synthesized and translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum as an inactive pre-proenzyme (52 kDa), processed into an enzymatically active, intermediate proenzyme (48 kDa) and finally converted into the mature form of 32 kDa in the lysosomes (Fujita et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	23	 CTSD is involved in the proteolytic activation as well as proteolytic degradation of intracellular proteins (Diment et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Increased levels of CTSD are correlated with tumor cell invasion and metastasis in malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma and human breast cancer (Kageshita et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Reports suggest that CTSD may play a role in the metastasizing process of malignant cells because of their destructive effects on the extracellular matrix.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Therefore, CTSD activity was used to predict recurrence in breast cancer (Tandon et al.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Afterwards they exhibited progressive atrophy of the intestinal mucosa, followed by massive intestinal necrosis and profound destruction of lymphoid cells.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The mice died in a state of anorexia at the age of 4 weeks, though lysosomal bulk proteolysis was maintained, possibly due to compensatory activation of related lysosomal proteases (Saftig et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	33	In the skin CTSD plays a role in both extracellular and intracellular catabolism.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In hyperproliferative skin disorders such as psoriasis, increased expression of the mature form of CTSD has been reported, returning to normal after resolution of the psoriasis by psoralen and long-wave ultraviolet radiation (PUVA) light treatment (Kawada et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	35	 It was suggested that CTSD may be involved in the control of cell differentiation during normal development.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	37	 CTSD enzyme is active at an acid pH (maximum at pH 3) and may work at the transition of the stratum granulosum to stratum corneum, because the stratum corneum produces an acid environment (pH 5.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Despite these results, function and cellular substrates of CTSD in epidermal differentiation are still unknown.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	39	In the present study we explored the functional role of CTSD in the skin during permeability barrier repair and epidermal differentiation using keratinocyte cell culture, wild-type and CTSD-deficient mice.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In particular, we examined the functional role of CTSD in the activation of keratinocyte TG1 as a key enzyme for the processing of CE proteins such as involucrin, loricrin and filaggrin during epidermal differentiation.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	254	 First, we performed in vitro studies determining the protein expression and activity of CTSD in primary and in differentiated, stratified (organotypic) cultured keratinocytes.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	255	 We found a significant increase in CTSD protein levels and an increase in the enzymatic activity of CTSD in differentiated compared to primary keratinocytes, suggesting a function of CTSD during epidermal differentiation in vitro.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	256	To explore a possible link between CTSD and epidermal differentiation in vivo, we investigated the epidermal expression and the enzymatic activity of CTSD after experimental skin injury during permeability barrier repair in wild-type mice.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	257	 We found significantly increased epidermal expression of the active intermediate as well as the mature form of CTSD 3 hours and 5 hours after permeability barrier disruption, caused by increased processing and increased synthesis of the enzyme.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	258	 In accordance, we noted a significant increase of epidermal CTSD enzyme activity at different times after skin injury.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Topical application of pepstatin A, an inhibitor of CTSD (Heinrich et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	260	, 1999), prevented an increase in the protein expression and in the activity of CTSD and significantly delayed permeability barrier repair after experimental disruption.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	261	 These results clearly show involvement of CTSD in the epidermal repair process after injury.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	262	The kinetics of CTSD processing and activation, as demonstrated by increased expression at 1-5 hours after treatment, corresponded to the activation of sphingomyelinase and the amount of epidermal ceramides after barrier perturbation (Jensen et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	263	 In our previous study, a significant increase in acid sphingomyelinase activation and an elevated epidermal ceramide content 1-4 hours after barrier disruption was demonstrated (Jensen et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	264	, 1999), thus acid sphingomyelinase-derived ceramide may be linked to CTSD activity during permeability barrier repair.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	265	The epidermis follows a programmed transformation of keratinocytes from the proliferating basal cells to the spinous, then to the granular and to the horny layers where the permeability barrier resides and finally desquamation occurs.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Starting in the granular layer, aspartatic proteinases such as CTSD are activated in the lysosomes where they participate in the massive degradation process accompanying cornification.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	269	 CTSD was reported to activate TG1 and thereby contribute to the enzymatic processes during cornification (Negi et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	270	 These findings were supported and extended by our in vitro and in vivo results: we found CTSD-dependent activation of TG1 in a keratinocyte membrane preparation and, furthermore, the activity of TG1 was severely diminished in the epidermis of CTSD( to / to ) mice when compared to wild-type mice.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	271	 The enzymatic activity of TG1 correlated with the expression of a 35 kDa protein in wild-type mice, as detected by immunoblotting.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	272	 This 35 kDa protein was undetectable in the epidermis of CTSD( to / to ) mice, where we observed the expression of a 150 kDa TG1 protein instead.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	273	 There was less of this protein in CTSD(+/ to ) mice and none in wild-type control mice.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	274	 These observations suggest the involvement of CTSD in the processing of a higher molecular weight precursor to generate an enzymatically active 35 kDa TG1 form (see model in Fig.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	288	Epidermal differentiation including the formation of the CE proteins involucrin and loricrin, are crucially involved in permeability barrier repair (Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	289	 The soluble CE protein involucrin is expressed in the spinous layer at an early stage in keratinocyte differentiation.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	291	The link between CTSD-dependent activation of keratinocyte TG1 and the expression of CE proteins was confirmed in CTSD( to / to ) mice.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	292	 In these mice, we found significantly reduced involucrin and loricrin protein levels after experimental skin injury in parallel to a reduced activity of TG1.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	293	 These results are in agreement with the effects observed after application of the CTSD inhibitor pepstatin A (data not shown).
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Since a high molecular mass TG1 precursor protein was present in CTSD( to / to ) but not in wild-type mice, CTSD appears to mediate the proteolysis of the enzymatically inactive TG1 to the active enzyme.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Thus, the deficient mice also reveal a functional link between CTSD expression, maturation and activation of TG1, and the appearance of involucrin and loricrin in the epidermis.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	296	Morphologically, the CTSD( to / to ) mice exhibited epidermal hyperkeratosis as a sign of disturbed epidermal differentiation.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	297	 The skin symptoms may be explained by a diminished ability of the corneocytes to bind intercellular lipids, caused by the reduced expression of involucrin and loricrin in the stratum corneum.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Previously, it was shown that the CE proteins, in particular involucrin, covalently bind -hydroxy ceramides.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	301	 These disruptions started at the interface of the stratum granulosum/stratum corneum, the place where normally the lipid bilayers extrude their lipids into the intercellular space.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Ultrastructural analysis of the epidermis in CTSD( to / to ) mice revealed broadening of the distances between the SC layers, with only a faint staining of the CE and thickened corneocytes in the axial direction.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	303	 This demonstrates the influence of CTSD on corneocytes and possibly on lipid organization in the stratum corneum.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Together, the morphological findings suggest an important role for CTSD in epidermal differentiation.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	305	To evaluate the consequences of CTSD deficiency and reduced TG1 activity in more detail, we analyzed the distribution of various epidermal keratins and CE proteins by immunohistology.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	308	 However, in these models we also found an increase in the expression of the proliferation-associated keratin K6 (and also K16) (Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage et al.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	327	 The authors suggested that the ichthyosiform skin phenotype in TG1 deficiency develops massive hyperkeratosis as a physical compensation for the defective cutaneous permeability barrier (Kuramoto et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	328	 A compensatory mechanisms maintaining skin barrier function in the absence of a major CE protein was also described in a loricrin-deficient mouse model (Koch et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Also, targeted ablation of the murine involucrin gene did not show defects in barrier function.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	330	 These mice developed normally, possessed apparently normal epidermis and hair follicles and generated CEs that could not be distinguished from those of wild-type mice (Djian et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	331	 The complexity and redundancy of epithelial barrier function has been discussed by Steinert (Steinert, 2000).
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	332	 Our CTSD( to / to ) mouse model has a broader impact on skin morphology than either involucrin or loricrin deficiency.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Notably, there are similarities between the skin of CTSD( to / to ) mice, the skin of TG1( to / to ) mice and the human skin disease lamellar ichthyosis.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	334	 In lamellar ichthyosis a mutation in the TG1 gene resulting in a reduction in epidermal involucrin was described (Hohl et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	335	 The similarities are explained by the strongly reduced TG1 expression in the skin of CTSD( to / to ) mice.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	336	In the initial characterization of the CTSD-deficient mice atopic changes of the ileal mucosa leading to an insufficient mucosal barrier were observed.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	337	 The limit between epithelium and central connective tissue normally formed by a basement membrane was undetectable in these mice (Saftig et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	338	 Together, these results prove the importance of CTSD for barrier function and for epithelial differentiation in different organs.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	339	In summary, our in vitro and in vivo results suggest a crucial involvement of the aspartate protease CTSD in the activation of keratinocyte TG1 and in the regulation of the CE protein expression during epidermal differentiation, which is summarized in a model shown in Fig.

0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	4	The contribution of estrogens to the prevention of neurodegenerative disorders has attracted considerable attention over the last few years as a result of conflicting data from clinical trials, some of which have shown protective effects of postmenopausal estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy (HRT), whereas others (including the recently concluded Women s Health Initiative trial) have revealed no significant benefit.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Although the reason for these apparently discrepant results remains the subject of heated debate, a growing body of evidence suggests that individual women may exhibit variable neuroprotective responses to HRT, in part because of interactions with other known risk factors for neurodegenerative disease.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	6	 One such risk factor, which modulates the effects of HRT on rates of cognitive decline in aging women, is the expression pattern of allelic variants of apolipoprotein E (apoE).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	7	 (1) in this issue of Endocrinology indicates why this may be the case.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Trophic effects of the natural ovarian estrogen, estradiol-17ss, on neurite growth in cultured mouse cerebral cortical neurons are reported to be critically dependent on apoE expression.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Moreover, responses to estradiol-17ss are shown to be dependent on the type of apoE present: whereas estradiol-17ss is neurotrophic in the presence of human apoE 2 or apoE 3, the apoE 4 variant, which has been associated with the progression of late onset Alzheimer s disease, does not support this response.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	10	The concept that HRT might have beneficial effects on the aging brain evolved initially from studies in laboratory animals.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Almost 3 decades ago, estradiol-17ss was shown to exert neurotrophic effects in tissue explants derived from the developing mouse hypothalamus and preoptic area (2).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Synaptogenic effects of estradiol-17ss were later demonstrated to occur in the adult brain, including regions of the brain, such as the hippocampus, that are important for cognitive function (3, 4).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In various models of neuronal damage, natural and synthetic estrogens were reported to enhance cell survival (5), whereas estradiol-17ss treatment was shown to enhance nonamyloidogenic processing of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (6).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Estradiol-17ss was also found to have positive effects on maintenance of the neurotransmitter systems that undergo degeneration in Alzheimer s disease (7) and Parkinson s disease (8).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Taken together, these observations provided strong mechanistic support for the concept that postmenopausal HRT might slow or prevent neurodegenerative processes.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	16	Clinical trials have, in general, provided only mixed support for this hypothesis while simultaneously highlighting the potential health risks of long-term postmenopausal HRT use (1, 9, 10, 11).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Part of the problem appears to be that in human beings, unlike laboratory animals, effects of HRT may be confounded by a variety of other factors, which modulate or oppose the actions of the hormones.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	18	 One particularly important genetic factor appears to be the expression pattern of apoE.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Expression of different apoE alleles had previously been demonstrated to affect the risk of atherosclerosis (12) as well as the rate of progression of several human neurodegenerative diseases (13, 14), including Alzheimer s dementia (15).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Intriguingly, patterns of apoE expression were also found to significantly influence responses to HRT (16).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	21	The mechanism underlying this interaction remained uncertain.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	22	 One possibility was that it might reflect the known effects of apoE expression on atherosclerotic processes (12), with cerebral vascular compromise secondarily affecting the rate of cognitive decline (16).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	23	 An alternative hypothesis, however, was suggested by studies aimed at elucidating the effects of estradiol-17ss on apoE expression in nerve cells.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Studies in mice demonstrated that expression of apoE in different brain regions varied with stage of the female reproductive cycle (17), consistent with the hypothesis that estradiol-17ss might induce apoE expression in the brain, as had already been demonstrated for apoE in blood (18).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Addition of apoE 3 was found to produce effects like those of estradiol-17ss on cultured neurons (19).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Moreover, neuroprotective effects of estradiol-17ss were abolished in transgenic mice homozygous for deletion of the apoE gene (20).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These observations raised the possibility that apoE might represent an integral component of the mechanisms mediating trophic responses of neurons to estrogen exposure.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	28	 (1) demonstrate that this is indeed the case.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The growth-promoting effects of estradiol-17ss not only depend on the expression of apoE, they are also highly dependent on the nature of the apoE subtype.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In cultured cells from the adult mouse cerebral cortex, estradiol-17ss increased both apoE levels and neurite outgrowth.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The hormone had no effect on neurite outgrowth from mice lacking the apoE gene, or when only apoE 4 was exogenously supplied.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	32	 ApoE 2, an apoE variant that has been associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer s disease and increased age of onset, increased neurite length more than apoE 3 in the presence of estradiol-17ss.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Cultures from mice transgenic for human apoE 3 were capable of responding to estradiol-17ss, whereas those from mice expressing only apoE 4 were relatively insensitive.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Similarly, apoE 3 was accumulated in neurons to a greater extent than apoE 4 and was more effective in facilitating neuronal uptake of fatty acid.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	35	 These data are consistent with the hypothesis that apoE may play an integral role in supporting the neurotrophic effects of estradiol-17ss and that patterns of apoE expression may have a profound impact on the sensitivity of the brain to estrogen action.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	36	These observations have important implications for future studies on the effects of HRT.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	37	 If expression of specific apoE alleles is required for estrogen to exert neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects, the pattern of apoE allele expression is likely to be important in determining the effectiveness of estrogen-based HRT.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Synergism between apoE subtype expression and the effects of HRT has already been demonstrated with respect to the progression of atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women, for which estrogen use appears to be particularly beneficial in patients with no apoE 4 allele (12).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The same situation may well be true for effects on neurodegenerative processes.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	40	 (16) administered cognitive function tests over a number of years to women who were either taking estrogen-based HRT, had taken HRT at some time in the past, or who had never used HRT.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	41	 In the women who did not express the apoE 4 variant, postmenopausal estrogen use reduced the risk of age-related cognitive impairment by almost 50%, compared with the women who never used estrogen.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	42	 By contrast, apoE 4-positive women did not show a significant estrogen response (16).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	43	 These data are consistent with the hypothesis that analysis of apoE variant expression may be predictive of whether HRT is likely to have long-term beneficial cognitive effects.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	44	 One of the key questions that remains to be answered is the extent to which the data presented by Nathan et al.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	45	 (1) can be extrapolated to the normal brain.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	46	 used cultures of dispersed neuronal and glial cells from the adult mouse cerebral cortex.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	47	 It will be important in future to determine whether the effects of estrogens on the aging brain involve comparable apoE-dependent mechanisms.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Published evidence is consistent with the view that effects of estradiol-17ss on the recovery of the mature brain from injury require apoE.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Thus, in mice, enhancement of synaptic sprouting by estradiol-17ss in response to an entorhinal cortex lesions is dependent on apoE expression (21).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	50	 However, neuronal damage, perhaps including the cellular damage inevitably incurred during the preparation of primary cell cultures, may result in reexpression of estrogen receptor mechanisms that are normally expressed only in development (22).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Hence, it remains to be established whether these findings can be extrapolated to the regulation of neuronal growth and survival in the uninjured brain.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	52	 (1), in dementia or after trauma, degeneration and repair may be in dynamic balance, with cognitive decline occurring when degenerative processes predominate.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	53	 However, significant trophic responses to estradiol-17ss are also observed under conditions in which neurodegeneration is probably minimal (3, 4).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	54	 These responses may contribute to the effects of estrogens on cognitive performance (23).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	55	 It remains to be determined whether apoE is involved in the trophic actions of estradiol-17ss under normal physiological, as opposed to pathological, conditions.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	56	A second question is how apoE is regulated by steroids other than estradiol-17ss.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	57	 A wide range of estrogens and progestins have been used for HRT in postmenopausal women (10, 11).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	58	 It remains to be determined how these different steroids affect apoE expression.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	59	 The question of the specificity of the apoE response is critical because of the possibility that some combinations of hormonal agents could abrogate the beneficial effects of natural estrogens.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	60	 For example, Nilsen and Brinton (24) have reported that whereas progesterone and 19-norprogesterone both potentiate the neuroprotective effects of estradiol-17ss, the opposite effect is observed with medroxyprogesterone acetate, the synthetic progestin used in the Women s Health Initiative trial.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Whether or not apoE expression is affected by other steroids is also important because of the fact that estradiol-17ss is not the only hormonal steroid with neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Recent work suggests that androgens may confer protection against neurodegenerative processes.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Men with higher free testosterone levels appear to have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer s disease (25), whereas reduced levels of the principal adrenal androgen, dehydroepiandrosterone, have been reported in Alzheimer s disease patients (26).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	64	 In laboratory studies, androgens and progestins have been reported to elicit neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects under a variety of experimental conditions (24, 27, 28).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Although in some cases these effects may involve either interactions with estrogen or intermediate estrogen biosynthesis, in others they clearly do not (27).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	66	 An intriguing hypothesis for future study is that apoE expression may represent a common link in steroid-activated neurotrophic responses.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	67	 If so, effects of androgens, like those of estrogens, may be influenced by apoE genotype.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Interestingly, this possibility has already been raised by preliminary clinical studies, which demonstrated interactions between testosterone and apoE 4 expression in men with Alzheimer s disease, as well as an association between apoE 4 and circulating testosterone levels in men without the disease (29).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	69	 These observations raise the possibility that the relationship between apoE expression and gonadal steroids may be multifactorial, with the apoE 4 allele directly affecting the risk of neurodegenerative disease via effects on neuronal growth and survival, as well as indirectly via reductions in testicular androgen secretion.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	70	Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the observations of Nathan et al.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	71	 (1), however, is the potential for development of novel strategies for replacement therapy designed to directly target the regulation of neural apoE expression.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The adverse effects of conventional HRT are primarily associated with responses that do not involve the brain, including alterations in coagulation factors, enhancing the risk of stroke, as well as trophic effects on the reproductive organs, resulting in increased risks for breast and endometrial cancer (10, 11).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	73	 If regulation of apoE expression is indeed a critical component of the mechanisms mediating neuroprotective responses to estradiol-17ss, direct targeting of apoE regulation in the brain might mimic the beneficial central effects of this hormone without the adverse risks associated with conventional HRT.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Such an approach seems at least potentially feasible, because the receptor systems mediating the effects of estrogens on central apoE synthesis may well be different from those found in nonneural estrogen target organs.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Thus, estradiol-17, an estrogen with weak systemic hormonal activity, is fully capable of inducing apoE synthesis and release in mouse cerebral cortex and cultured glial cells (30, 31).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	76	 As a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of estrogen on apoE expression evolves, it may be possible to identify agents that will selectively up-regulate apoE expression in the brain with no significant adverse effects on tissues elsewhere in the body.

0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	7	Molecular epidemiologic studies have presented seemingly contradictory results concerning a potential role of CTSD polymorphism in Alzheimer s disease (6 to 19).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	8	 There is also controversy on whether this polymorphism may interact with the apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4), which is the best known genetic determinant for sporadic Alzhei-mer s disease (20).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Single studies may have been underpowered to detect interactions or even overall effects.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Given the amount of accumulated data, we deemed it important to perform a quantitative synthesis of the evidence using rigorous methods.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Thus, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of all available studies relating the CTSD polymorphism to the risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	12	Case-control studies were eligible if they had determined the distribution of CTSD genotypes in Alzheimer s disease cases (regardless of age of onset) and in a concurrent control group of dementia-free subjects using a molecular method for genotyping.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Cases with Alzheimer s disease were eligible regardless of whether they had a family history of Alzhei-mer s disease or not.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	14	 However, we excluded family-based studies of pedigrees with several affected cases per family, because their analysis is based on linkage considerations.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	15	Data extraction Two investigators independently extracted data and reached consensus on all items.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The following information was sought from each report: authors, journal and year of publication, country of origin, selection and characteristics of Alzheimer s disease cases and controls, demographics, ethnic group of the study population, eligible and genotyped cases and controls, and number of cases and controls for each CTSD genotype.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	17	 For studies including subjects of different ethnic groups, data were extracted separately for each ethnicity, whenever possible.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Furthermore, we examined whether matching had been used, whether there was specific mention of blinding of the personnel who performed the genotyping to the clinical status of the subjects, and whether the genotyping method had been validated.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	19	Meta-analysis The primary analysis compared Alzheimer s disease cases with controls for the contrast of T versus C alleles.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This analysis aims to detect overall differences.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	21	 We also examined the contrast of extremes (homozygotes), T/T versus C/C.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Finally, we examined the contrast of T/T versus (C/T + C/C) and the contrast of (C/T + T/T) versus C/C.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These contrasts correspond to the recessive and dominant effects, respectively, of the T allele.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	24	The odds ratio was used as the metric of choice.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	25	 For each genetic contrast, we estimated the between-study heterogeneity across all eligible comparisons using the chi-square-based Q statistic (36).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Heterogeneity was considered significant for p  <  0.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Data were combined using both fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) and random-effects (DerSimonian and Laird) models (37).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Random effects incorporate an estimate of the between-study variance and tend to provide wider confidence intervals, when the results of the constituent studies differ among themselves.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In the absence of between-study heterogeneity, the two methods provide identical results.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Random effects are more appropriate when heterogeneity is present (37).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	31	We also performed cumulative meta-analysis (38) and recursive cumulative meta-analysis (39, 40) to evaluate whether the summary odds ratio for the T versus C contrast changed over time as more data accumulated and whether the strength of the association changed when the first hypothesis-generating study was excluded from the calculations (41).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Inverted funnel plots and the Begg-Mazumdar publication bias diagnostic (nonparametric correlation coefficient) (42) evaluated whether the magnitude of the observed association was related to the variance of each study, that is, whether large studies gave different results compared with smaller ones (43).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Finally, we evaluated whether the summary results were different when the analysis was limited to studies with more intensive efforts to exclude Alzheimer s disease from controls (those that clearly performed neuropsychological testing for all controls).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	34	Previous investigations have alluded to the possibility that the T allele may interact with the APOE*4 allele in conferring susceptibility to Alzheimer s disease (7, 9).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Thus, we also evaluated the effect of T allele carriage on the risk of Alzheimer s disease separately for APOE*4-positive and APOE*4-negative subjects.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Moreover, we evaluated the genetic effect conferred by the presence of APOE*4 separately in subjects carrying the T allele and those not carrying the T allele.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Odds ratios were combined with fixed and random effects models, as described above.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	38	 When these data were not reported, we communicated with the primary investigators to obtain this information, whenever possible.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	39	Analyses were performed with SPSS 11.

0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Characteristics of studies included in the meta-analysis   Specific matching for age was described in five studies (10, 12 to 15).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	44	 One study also matched for sex (10).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Only one study (7) specifically mentioned blinding of the personnel who performed the genotyping.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Appropriate molecular methods for genotyping were used.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	47	 All studies used polymerase chain reaction, and two studies (14, 18) also used dynamic allele-specific hybridization.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	48	Meta-analysis database The eligible studies summarized in table 2 included a total of 3,175 cases with Alzheimer s disease and 3,334 controls, of whom 3,174 and 3,298, respectively, had genotype data.

0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Overall, the prevalence of T/T homozygosity was 0.

0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The distribution of genotypes in control groups was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all studies.

0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	67	 There was no significant between-study heterogeneity.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	68	 No evidence of an association with Alzhei-mer s disease was discerned also when the recessive model was examined for the effect of T, while a trend for an association was seen in the dominant model (by random effects, OR = 1.

0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	106	 The results of meta-analyses may be affected by methodological problems and potential biases in the designs of the constituent studies.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Nondifferential misclassification errors may dilute the strength of an observed association.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Alzheimer s disease cases were generally selected according to appropriate criteria.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	109	 However, some young control subjects may have developed Alzheimer s disease at older ages.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The choice of an appropriate age window for assessing a postulated genetic risk factor for Alzheimer s disease is difficult.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Studies of younger subjects may be more suitable for identifying risk factors that result in early onset Alzhei-mer s disease.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Conversely, selection of younger subjects may be less appropriate, if the influence of the postulated genetic risk factor is more important in late-onset Alzhei-mer s disease.

0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Our analyses addressed interactions with APOE*4, the major known genetic determinant of Alzhei-mer s disease.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Interactions with other genetic or environmental factors have not been studied.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	119	 The trend for a stronger effect of APOE*4 in the presence of T allele carriage is interesting in the light of data suggesting that T carriage may affect the general intelligence (5).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	120	 However, subgroup and interaction analyses should be interpreted cautiously, since differences between subgroups may occur by chance (49) and their validation would require studies with even larger sample sizes than the several thousand included in this meta-analysis.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Finally, population stratification may theoretically have affected the results of the constituent studies in the meta-analysis (50), since we documented that the frequency of the T allele varied considerably among the different ethnic groups or even among the different ethnic groups of European descent.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	122	 However, most studies were strictly ethnically defined, so the population stratification effect is unlikely to have been of any considerable magnitude.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	123	Because of the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer s disease worldwide, it is crucial to identify genetic risk factors for this neurodegenerative disease.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Thus, the list of identified polymorphisms that may influence the risk of Alzheimer s disease is continuously expanding (23, 29), but most of the reported associations of candidate genes to date remain nonreplicated or at least controversial after subsequent investigation.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Early and small genetic association studies may come up with spurious findings (41, 51, 52).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Even when genetic associations are replicated, usually they do not have a major public health impact that would lead to screening recommendations (53).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Nevertheless, such knowledge could improve our understanding about the pathogenesis of complex diseases such as Alzheimer s disease.
