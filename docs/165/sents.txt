0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	5	We have reported previously (Michikawa, M., Fan, Q.-W., Isobe, I., and Yanagisawa, K. (2000) J. Neurochem. 74, 1008-1016) that exogenously added recombinant human apolipoprotein E (apoE) promotes cholesterol release in an isoform-dependent manner. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this isoform-dependent promotion of cholesterol release remains undetermined. In this study, we demonstrate that the cholesterol release is mediated by endogenously synthesized and secreted apoE isoforms and clarify the mechanism underlying this apoE isoform-dependent cholesterol release using cultured astrocytes prepared from human apoE3 and apoE4 knock-in mice. Cholesterol and phospholipids were released into the culture media, resulting in the generation of two types of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-like particles; one was associated with apoE and the other with apoJ. The amount of cholesterol released into the culture media from the apoE3-expressing astrocytes was ~2.5-fold greater than that from apoE4-expressing astrocytes. In contrast, the amount of apoE3 released in association with the HDL-like particles was similar to that of apoE4, and the sizes of the HDL-like particles released from apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes were similar. The molar ratios of cholesterol to apoE in the HDL fraction of the culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes were 250  plus or minus  6.0 and 119  plus or minus  5.1, respectively. These data indicate that apoE3 has an ability to generate similarly sized lipid particles with less number of apoE molecules than apoE4, suggesting that apoE3-expressing astrocytes can supply more cholesterol to neurons than apoE4-expressing astrocytes. These findings provide a new insight into the issue concerning the putative alteration of apoE-related cholesterol metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.

The decreased levels of cellular cholesterol have been shown to reduce A production in vitro (6) and in vivo (7). Previous studies have also shown the association of cholesterol accumulation with mature senile plaques (8) and neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons (9). Additionally, a recent study (10) has suggested that an increased cholesterol level in the membrane facilitates amyloid fibril formation through formation of GM1 ganglioside-bound A, a putative endogenous seed. These findings suggest that increased cellular cholesterol levels induce high amyloid -protein (A) production and subsequent AD development..

Previous studies have shown that increased dietary cholesterol levels reduce A secretion (15) and that increased cellular cholesterol levels inhibit the A-mediated cell toxicity (16, 17). On the other hand, the effect of A on cellular cholesterol metabolism has also been investigated (18). Our recent studies have shown that not monomeric but oligomeric A affects cholesterol metabolism (19) and eventually reduces cellular cholesterol levels (20). In addition, cholesterol deficiency has been shown to promote tau phosphorylation in vitro (21, 22) and in vivo (23). These findings suggest that the involvement of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD is dualistic. The elevated levels of cellular cholesterol contribute to AD development by elevating A secretion; however, the increasing amount of oligomerized A reduces cellular cholesterol levels, which in turn may promote the progression of AD pathologies..

Astrocytes and microglia are known to synthesize apoE (28, 29), which generates HDL-like particles with cellular lipids in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and culture media (25, 26, 30, 31). These apoE-lipid particles are assumed to supply cholesterol to neurons in an apoE receptor-mediated manner (32, 33). Previously, we have reported (34) that exogenously added recombinant human apoE promotes cholesterol release in an isoform-dependent manner. However, the mechanism underlying the isoform-dependent cholesterol release mediated by apoE remains undetermined. It is known that the majority of apoE in CSF and conditioned culture media is associated with lipids (31, 35), and that the characteristics of lipid particles generated by the addition of exogenous apolipoprotein and those generated by endogenous apolipoprotein are different. HDL-like particles generated by the addition of exogenous apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) (36) and apoE (34) have a low amount of cholesterol, whereas HDL-like particles formed with endogenous apoE are cholesterol-rich (37). These lines of evidence led us to determine whether the endogenous apoE-mediated cholesterol release from cultured astrocytes is isoform-specific and, if it is the case, to characterize the molecular mechanism underlying the isoform-dependent lipid release. In this study, we investigated the endogenous apoE-mediated cholesterol release from astrocytes isolated from human apoE3- and apoE4 knock-in mouse brains. We found that apoE3 has the ability to generate similarly sized HDL-like particles with less amount of apoE than apoE4. These findings may provide the basis for studies to relate cholesterol with AD pathogenesis.

In brief, brains of postnatal day 2 mice were removed under anesthesia. The cerebral cortices from the mouse brains were dissected, freed from meninges, and diced into small pieces; the cortical fragments were incubated in 0.25% trypsin and 20 mg/ml DNase I in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, and 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4) at 37  degrees C for 20 min. The fragments were then dissociated into single cells by pipetting. The dissociated cells were seeded in 75-cm2 dishes at a cell density of 1  x  107 in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 10 days of incubation in vitro, astrocytes in the monolayer were trypsinized (0.1%) and reseeded onto 6-well dishes.

A discontinuous sucrose gradient was prepared in a 14  x  89-mm ultracentrifuge tube (Ultraclear, Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) from the bottom to the top, with 2 ml of sucrose at a density of 1.30 g/ml, 3 ml at 1.20 g/ml, 3 ml at 1.10 g/ml, and 4 ml at 1.006 g/ml medium. The sample in the sucrose gradient was then centrifuged in an SW41-Ti swing rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) at 4  degrees C for 48 h at 160,000  x  gav. Following density gradient centrifugation, 12 1.0-ml fractions were collected with a micropipette from the top gradient. The densities of the fractions were determined by measuring the weight of 100  microl of each fraction using a micropipette. The final fraction was stirred to resuspend the pellet.

The separated proteins were transferred onto Immobilon membranes with a semidry electrophoretic transfer apparatus (Nihon Eido, Tokyo, Japan) using a transfer buffer (0.1 M Tris, 0.192 M glycine, and 20% methanol). Blots were probed for 4 h at room temperature with a goat anti-apoE polyclonal antibody, AB947 (1:2,000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and a goat anti-apoJ antibody (1: 2,000; Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). Band detection was carried out with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). For determination of the concentration of apoE released into the culture medium, signals corresponding to apoE of each sample in the immunoblot membrane were quantified by densitometry with NIH image software, with varying concentrations of synthetic apoE protein (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) as standards. Standard signals were demonstrated to be linear in the range of apoE protein amounts from 0 to 2  microg per lane. The apoE concentrations in the conditioned culture media within this range were used for analysis. For detection of the oligomeric apoE protein in the conditioned culture media, Western blot analysis was performed under nonreducing conditions. Aliquots of each conditioned culture medium of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes were mixed with the same volume of the 2 x  nonreducing Laemmli buffer consisting of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 4% SDS, and 0.01% bromphenol blue, but no -mercaptoethanol, and analyzed by Western blotting as described above..

After centrifugation, the sample was subjected to density gradient ultracentrifugation with a discontinuous sucrose gradient as described above. Two milliliters of the HDL fraction (fraction number 4) in a Centricon YM10 tube (Millipore) was further concentrated to 200  microl in a JA-20.1 rotor using a Beckman J-25I ultracentrifuge at 4  degrees C for 2 h at 5,000  x  g. The concentrated conditioned culture medium was then subjected to nondenaturing 4-20% TBE (pH 8.3)-buffered PAGE to evaluate the particle size heterogeneity of the apoE fractions. Ten microliters of apoE-lipid particles (unboiled and nonreduced) containing 10% sucrose and 0.02% bromphenol blue was applied onto 4-20% gradient gel. Native high molecular weight protein standards (Amersham Biosciences) were used as size standards (43). Electrophoresis was performed at 4  degrees C with a prerun of 15 min at 125 V before the entry of samples into the stacking gel, followed by migration at 100 V for 8 h. The separated apoE that migrated as a lipid-apoE complex was transferred onto Immobilon membrane with a semidry electrophoretic transfer apparatus (Nihon Eido, Tokyo, Japan) using a transfer buffer (0.1 M Tris, 0.192 M glycine and 20% methanol). Separated proteins were probed for 4 h at room temperature with a goat anti-apoE polyclonal antibody, AB947 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) (1:2000).

After centrifugation, the sample was subjected to density gradient ultracentrifugation with a discontinuous sucrose gradient as described above. Two milliliters of the HDL fraction (fraction number 4) in a Centricon YM10 tube (Millipore) was further concentrated to 200  microl in a JA-20.1 rotor using a Beckman J-25I ultracentrifuge at 4  degrees C for 2 h at 5,000  x  g. The concentrated conditioned culture medium was then subjected to nondenaturing 4-20% TBE (pH 8.3)-buffered PAGE to evaluate the particle size heterogeneity of the apoE fractions. Ten microliters of apoE-lipid particles (unboiled and nonreduced) containing 10% sucrose and 0.02% bromphenol blue was applied onto 4-20% gradient gel. Native high molecular weight protein standards (Amersham Biosciences) were used as size standards (43). Electrophoresis was performed at 4  degrees C with a prerun of 15 min at 125 V before the entry of samples into the stacking gel, followed by migration at 100 V for 8 h. The separated apoE that migrated as a lipid-apoE complex was transferred onto Immobilon membrane with a semidry electrophoretic transfer apparatus (Nihon Eido, Tokyo, Japan) using a transfer buffer (0.1 M Tris, 0.192 M glycine and 20% methanol). Separated proteins were probed for 4 h at room temperature with a goat anti-apoE polyclonal antibody, AB947 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) (1:2000).

Because apoE3 contains cysteine at residue 112 and apoE4 does not, the higher ability of apoE3 to promote lipid release may be caused by its increased number of helical segments due to the formation of disulfide-linked dimers. To examine this possibility, we performed immunoblot analysis of the conditioned culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes under reducing and nonreducing conditions. In the absence of -mercaptoethanol, the conditioned culture media of apoE3-expressing astrocytes contained oligomers, mainly dimers and less amount of tetramers, in addition to monomers, whereas those of apoE4-expressing astrocytes contained monomers (Fig. 7a). Obviously, the band representing apoE3 dimer was higher than the expected one (Mr = 68,400). Because it is known that serum apoE3 forms homodimers that migrate anomalously on SDS gel under nonreducing conditions (45), this may also be the case for apoE3 dimer in the conditioned culture media.

Although we have found no apoE isoform-dependent differences in size between the apoE3 and apoE4 lipid particles, nor in the total amount of released apoE between apoE3 and apoE4 astrocytes, the apoE3-specific enhancement of lipid release from the cells was observed. These results indicate that apoE3 has a higher ability to generate apoE lipid particles with less numbers of apoE molecules per particle than apoE4, suggesting that apoE3-expressing astrocytes could supply more cholesterol to neurons than apoE4-expressing astrocytes, thereby supporting neuronal plasticity and promoting neuronal regeneration..

ApoE is one of such apolipoproteins, and the effects of apoE on cholesterol release have been examined in various cell systems (51-54). This apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol release results in the generation of pre--HDL, which contains apolipoproteins, cellular cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine. Recent studies (31, 37) have demonstrated that HDL-like particles in association with exogenous or endogenous apoE are also generated in the cultured medium of the central nervous system cells such as astrocytes and neurons. In addition, we have found that the addition of exogenous apoE promotes lipid release from the central nervous system cells generating HDL-like particles in an apoE isoform-dependent manner (34). Consistent with our previous findings using exogenous apoE, the present study also shows that the amount of lipids released from apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes is apoE isoform-dependent, with the order of potency being apoE3  >  apoE4. However, the mechanism underlying this isoform-dependent cholesterol release remains undetermined..

0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	59	Therefore, the next question to be addressed is what is the mechanism underlying the apoE isoform-dependent cholesterol release. We found that the amount of lipids released from apoE3-expressing astrocytes is ~2.5-fold greater than that from apoE4-expressing astrocytes, whereas the amount of apoE3 released is similar to that of apoE4. One possible explanation to this may be that each particle contains equal amount of apoE proteins; however, particles containing apoE3 contain ~2.5-fold greater amounts of lipids than those containing apoE4. Another possible explanation may be that each particle contains equal amounts of lipids, but apoE3-containing particles contain lower numbers of apoE molecules than apoE4-containing particles. This implies that apoE3 has the ability to form lipid particles with a lower number of apoE molecules than apoE4, and thus to generate ~2.5-fold greater numbers of apoE-lipid particles than apoE4 with the same number of apoE molecules. Between these two possibilities, our experiment favors the latter because, as shown in Fig. 6 and Table II, the sizes of particles in both conditioned culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes are similar..

0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	61	The apoE isoform-dependent difference in the association of lipoprotein particles may be explained in terms of the mechanism underlying the apoE isoform-specific formation of apoE oligomers; apoE3 protein forms dimers, and apoE4 does not. This difference may be because apoE3 has cysteine at position 112 of the N-terminal domain, whereas apoE4 has arginine at the same position. Previous studies have shown that the number and the length of amphiphilic helices are responsible for determining the ability of a given apolipoprotein to promote lipid release (44, 49, 55). Interestingly, human apoA-II is known to form disulfide-linked dimers and exhibit stronger ability to promote lipid release than monomeric apoA-II (44). These lines of evidence allow us to postulate that the higher ability of apoE dimers than apoE monomers to promote lipid release may explain the greater amounts of lipids released in the conditioned culture media of apoE3-expressing astrocytes than apoE4-expressing astrocytes. Based on this assumption, we propose a model of the isoform-dependent association of apoE with lipid particles (Fig. 8). Consistent with our present results, previous studies have revealed the conformational adaptability of apoE the N-terminal domain as a function of lipid availability (56) or the presence of competitor apolipoproteins (for review see Ref. 57). In these studies, a model of two possible conformations of apoE on spherical lipid particles was proposed; at a high apoE concentration, the N-terminal domain is displaced from the lipid surface to form a helix bundle in a closed conformation, whereas at a low concentration on the surface, the four helix bundles of the N-terminal domain are in an open conformation, and all the helices are in contact with the lipid surface. Based on these lines of evidence together with our findings that an apoE3-containing HDL-like particle contains approximately one-half the number of apoE molecules compared with an apoE4-containing particle, it may be possible that the apoE isoform-dependent conformational change occurs on the surface of lipid particles; the N-terminal domain of apoE3 is in an open conformation, whereas that of apoE4 is in closed helix bundle conformation..

The present data indicate that apoE3 has the ability to generate similarly sized apoE lipid particles with less number of apoE molecules than apoE4. Based on these findings, we propose a model showing that one apoE4-containing lipid particle contains ~2-fold numbers of apoE molecules compared with an apoE3-containing lipid particle..
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	64	Another possible explanation may be the preferential association of apoE isoforms with lipoproteins; apoE4 preferentially associates with very low density lipoprotein, whereas apoE3 associates with HDL. This assumption is based on the facts that the N-terminal domain modulates the lipid-binding preference elicited by the C-terminal domain (58, 59) and that the interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains is responsible for this isoform preference (60, 61). It has been suggested that in apoE4, the interaction of arginine 61 with glutamic acid 255 may stabilize an extended helical structure in the carboxyl terminus that is best accommodated on a less curved very low density lipoprotein surface, whereas this interaction does not exist in apoE3, which therefore lacks stability and has shorter helices and preference for HDL (61, 62). Based on these lines of evidence, apoE3 may preferentially bind to an HDL particle with a lower number of apoE molecules to stabilize the particle, whereas apoE4 has less binding efficacy to an HDL particle, which requires higher numbers of apoE molecules to stabilize the particle. Because the physical properties of apoE are assumed to influence its functions (i.e. how it associates with lipid particles and stabilizes them), the apoE-isoform-dependent difference in the stability among the 22-kDa N-terminal fragments of apoE (63) may be involved in the isoform-dependent binding efficacy of apoE to HDL particles..

0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	66	Previous studies (48-50, 54) have demonstrated that various cells generate cholesterol-rich HDL-like particles with exogenous apolipoproteins. However, this is not the case with astrocytes, because we and other researchers have found that generation of HDL by endogenous apoE and by exogenous apoE is differently regulated in cultured astrocytes; HDL-like particles that are generated with exogenous apolipoproteins have low amounts of cholesterol (34, 37), whereas HDL-like particles generated with endogenous apoE are cholesterol-rich (37). In support of these findings, the present study has shown that apoE-lipid particles generated by the endogenously synthesized and released apoE are cholesterol-rich, compared with those generated by the addition of exogenous apoE (34). Because the amount of apoE that is free from lipid particles in the cultured medium and CSF is below detection limit (see Ref. 31 and this study) (Fig. 4, a and b), these results suggest that under physiological conditions, cholesterol-rich lipid particles associated with endogenous apoE are the major cholesterol source for neurons in the central nervous system. In this regard, it is of interest to note that apoE3-expressing astrocytes could supply more cholesterol in the form of apoE lipid particles to other cells including neurons with comparable levels of apoE secretion than apoE4-expressing astrocytes. Under the steady-state conditions, the lipid metabolisms in the central nervous system appear similar between the brains of apoE3 and apoE4 knock-in mice; the concentrations of free and esterified cholesterol in the postnuclear supernatant, plasma membrane, and endoplasmic reticulum of the brain homogenate are similar (64). However, under different conditions such as during recovery phases after brain injury and cell damage, endogenous apoE-mediated generation of HDL-like particles could play a critical role in cholesterol delivery to neurons, which are an essential material for axonal regeneration and synapse formation (65-68). Actually, previous studies (69, 70) have demonstrated that traumatic brain injury is the most robust environmental risk factor for development of AD. These lines of evidence may allow us to postulate that the apoE isoform dependence of the development of AD may be explained by the apoE isoform-dependent ability in the cholesterol supply to neurons after injury and cell damage, leading to neuroregeneration.

0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION 2003: A GOOD VINTAGE... CONCLUSION REFERENCES   The research of Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetics has been extremely prolific over the past decade, and currently more than 10 genes are reported to show either positive or negative evidence for disease association per month. Here, we review all 90 studies from 2003 reporting a total of 127 association findings between candidate genes and AD. While most positive results were largely contradictory, we identified three loci on chromosomes 6p21, 10q24, 11q23 that yielded positive results in three or more independent studies, in addition to the well-established AD association with the gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE). Based on these data, we suggest that it may be prudent for investigators to pay closer attention to issues such as power, replicability and haplotype structure prior to initial publication. This should serve to greatly decrease the likelihood of false positive and false negative findings reported in future years..
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	4	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION 2003: A GOOD VINTAGE... CONCLUSION REFERENCES   Several characteristics make the search for novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) genes particularly promising. First, and most importantly, the heritability of AD is high. This has been demonstrated in various studies examining familial segregation of the disease over the past decades (1 to 3). Accordingly, the probability of actually finding relevant disease-causing or predisposing genes is relatively high as well, possibly even more so than for other genetically complex neuropsychiatric disorders, like Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia or affective disorders (4). Thus far, in AD this has been achieved for four genes (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, APOE), but only variation in the latter also plays a significant role in the most common late-onset form of the disorder (see below). Fully penetrant mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2, on the other hand, lead to rare early-onset familial forms of AD via an increased generation of Ass42 and ss-amyloid deposition, a major neuropathological hallmark of the disease. Secondly, there is direct evidence, based on simulation as well as empirical data, for the presence of additional AD risk genes besides APOE. For instance, a recent simulation study predicted the existence of four to seven additional AD genes when searching for age of onset modifiers simulating a variety of different disease and inheritance models (3). This number corresponds well with empirical data obtained in full genome searches, which overlap on 11 chromosomes, six of which show  significant  results in at least one study (Table 1). Finally, the progressive neurodegeneration gradually leading to cognitive decline and dementia in AD patients exhibits distinct and well-established histopathological features upon post-mortem examination, allowing for the verification of  clinical  AD (5). Currently, the accuracy of a clinical AD diagnosis is near or beyond 90% in academic centers (6 to 8). This allows for a significant reduction of the number of phenocopies in study populations using published research criteria, and thereby increases the power of subsequent genetic or epidemiological analyses..
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	5	View this table:    Table 1. Overview of concordant linkage/association regions observed in full genome screens published until 2003   These disease-specific characteristics, together with the advent of relatively inexpensive and powerful high-throughput genotyping technologies, and the near completion of the human genome sequence have led to a steep increase in the number of laboratories studying the genetics of AD worldwide. To date, no less than 12 full-genome screens using linkage- or association-based methodologies have been published for AD, some using overlapping or identical samples, but each employing different sets of genetic markers and/or analytic strategies (8 to 19) (Table 1). On the other hand, the number of locus-specific, candidate gene-based AD association studies has now become nearly intractable. Over the course of 2003, more than 10 genes were reported to show either positive or negative evidence of association with different AD phenotypes per month in peer-reviewed journals as listed on NCBI's  PubMed . Despite these vast efforts, no single gene has yet emerged to attain nearly the degree of replication and consistency that has been observed by literally hundreds of laboratories studying the association of APOE-4 and AD. In this review, we present and discuss the findings of all genetic AD association studies published in 2003 (excluding those explicitly searching for the causes of early-onset familial AD cases, i.e. private mutations). Using these data as an example, we then attempt to pinpoint the methodological difficulties that are likely to underlie the remarkable failure to replicate genetic findings using current approaches..
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	6	   2003: A GOOD VINTAGE FOR AD GENETICS? TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION 2003: A GOOD VINTAGE... CONCLUSION REFERENCES   Genome screens As outlined above, the year 2003 has been almost unprecedented in terms of the number of studies attempting to unravel the causes of AD genetics. Three full-genome screens (8,18,19), using both association and genetic linkage methods, have been added to the nine studies already reported in the literature for late-onset AD. A study-by-study comparison using a P-value of 0.01 as cut-off reveals a total of 16 regions on 11 chromosomes that yield positive signals across at least two studies with markers no further than 25 Mb apart (Table 1). Interestingly, all chromosomes with the strongest and most consistent signals, i.e. 6, 9, 10, 12, 19 and 21, had already been implicated at least 3 years earlier, but received further support in 2003. Based on these criteria the only  new  AD region to emerge in 2003 is on chromosome 2p23 to 24, at a position between 19 and 29 Mb. Interestingly, this region was only implicated in studies using association methods and only in fairly isolated and homogeneous populations (i.e. the Finns and Wadi-Ara) (14,18). Note that inclusion and exclusion criteria applied here are arbitrary and as such may overestimate the total number of positive signals. They do, however, allow the comparison across a multitude of methodologically divergent approaches and should facilitate the interpretation of analyses based on actual candidate genes..
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	7	Candidate gene studies Searching  PubMed  (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/) with keywords  alzheimer* AND (association OR associated)  for all papers published between January 1 and December 31, 2003, retrieved a total of 1037 studies (on December 28, 2003), of which 90 directly deal with genetic association between candidate polymorphisms and AD. As can be seen in Table 2, these studies examined a total of 55 genetic loci ( locus  being a set of markers within the same 5 Mb genomic interval) on 20 different chromosomes. A total of 55 analyzed genes within these loci were found to be  positive  (as judged by the authors), while 68 tested  negative . Interestingly, even 10 years after its discovery, the largest number (n=18) of reports focusing on a single gene dealt with the association between APOE and AD, using new polymorphisms, new samples/ethnic groups or new phenotypes. When these studies were not considered, a total of 38 positive and 67 negative papers remained..
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	8	View this table:    Table 2. Overview of chromosomal loci tested for genetic association with AD in 2003   If 2003 represents one of the most prolific vintages for late-onset AD genetic studies, the next most pressing question is: did the large quantity of studies also dilute the quality of the product, perhaps even making for an unpalatable quaff? The answer, in our opinion, is yes, at least in the majority of cases. There is growing consensus that the success rate and reliability of genetic association studies in complex diseases depend on the fulfillment of several criteria (20,21), three of which are discussed in more detail below. These are in addition to the  classic  requirements of at least plausible biological and/or positional candidacy for any investigated locus, as well as direct proof of pathophysiological consequences of any positive disease association. While the former criterion is fulfilled for the vast majority of AD candidate genes investigated thus far, the latter condition has been more elusive. This is due to several factors that generally bedevil the study of genetic association in complex diseases, such as linkage disequilibrium with the actual (and functionally relevant) disease-modifying variant, small effect sizes (which impede the detection of significant effects using basic molecular and biochemical assays), and possibly the involvement of as yet unknown pathophysiological mechanisms. The situation of APOE-4 in AD serves as a good example: while the genetic association per se has been extremely well established over the past decade, there is still no consensus as to how this association translates pathophysiologically (22,23)..
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	9	Thus, before attempting to uncover the  functional consequences  of any putative new disease association, we propose that more emphasis must be placed on criteria that allow for a better distinction between false-positive as well as false-negative findings prior to initial publication..
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	10	Power: does the sample size and structure enable the investigators to detect effect sizes of only moderate or small extent? While this is an obvious concern in reports with a negative outcome, the power of a study also governs the rate of false positive findings, i.e. the probability that an observed significant association is indeed genuine and not only observed by chance (24 to 26). Other factors influencing the ability to detect meaningful effects include the attributable risk of the polymorphism to the overall genetic variance, degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the associated allele and the actual disease predisposing variant, mode of inheritance and, to a lesser extent, disease prevalence. While these variables are, of course, difficult to estimate when the true disease gene is unknown, power for any given sample size can fairly easily be calculated for a variety of possible and plausible scenarios. In practice, however, this still remains the exception. A recent study estimated that the minimal number of cases and controls sufficient to achieve 80% power at =0.05 is usually far greater than 200 when the actual disease allele is not tested directly, even under the most favorable of circumstances (26). It is interesting that, regardless of these estimates, 20% of all studies published in 2003 have still used smaller sample sizes and thus are probably not suitable for use in reaching any reliable conclusion..
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	11	Replicability: has the result been validated/replicated in an independent sample of sufficient size? While there have been reports of  significant  associations between putative candidate genes and AD on every chromosome in the human genome over the past 10 years (27), none of these findings with the exception of APOE-4 has yet been replicated consistently. Many a seemingly  positive  result could (and should) have been validated in an independent dataset prior to its first publication, as several authors have long been suggesting in guidelines for the proper  quality control  of genetic association findings (20,21,25,28,29). The current inflation of probable false-positive reports may have been avoided if independent replication had been sought earlier. If an independent sample cannot be found in-house, the establishment of at least temporary  consortia  between collaborative laboratories to test each other's positive signals prior to publication would represent an easy and effective means to restore credibility. Upon our review of the 2003 AD genetics literature, less than 20% of all studies either referred to findings in two or more independent samples at once, or were published in tandem with independent reports investigating the same candidate genes and/or genetic variants..

0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	13	Haplotype structure: have the authors made attempts to elucidate the structure of the underlying haplotype architecture? The more current and systematic assessment of haplotype structures at various regions throughout the genome in the past 3 to 4 years has emphasized the importance of performing haplotype- or systematic LD-analyses when searching for novel complex disease genes (30,31), especially when effect sizes are expected to be lower than those conferred by APOE-4. In addition to increasing the power of the analyses, this approach also reduces the number of statistical tests that need to be performed, which should lead to a further decrease of false-positive findings. Several very recently published complex disease associations would have been impossible to observe, without thorough assessment of the underlying haplotype architecture (32 to 34). Along these lines, recent studies on APOE have shown that this locus would have been easily identified by means of haplotype analysis alone, even without the prior knowledge of the 4 polymorphism (35,36). Yet, in 2003 only about one-third of all studies investigated more than one polymorphism per locus. Only half of these carried out a more or less  thorough  assessment of haplotype structure (i.e. four or more polymorphisms per gene)..

Most likely, many of the observed discrepancies across studies could be explained by a lack of methodological thoroughness. Nonetheless, there were three loci, in addition to APOE, that tested positive across at least three studies (on chromosomes 6p21, 10q24, and 11q23; Table 2). These loci are covered in the remainder of this review..

0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	17	Chromosome 6p21 This chromosomal region was implicated as harboring a putative AD gene as early as 1980, based on an association finding between variants in the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex region (HLA-A, at 30 Mb) and AD in a small case to control study (37). Two other potential AD candidates map within this 5 Mb interval, the genes encoding the hereditary haemochromatosis protein (HFE, at 26 Mb) and the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA, at 31 Mb). While in 2003 two studies reported significant evidence of association with the latter two genes (38,39), two other studies did not confirm these findings (40,41). Another candidate gene located in this region, HAPA1B, has been found to be associated with certain neuropsychological variables (42), but not disease risk itself (43). Finally, one study investigated variation in onset age as a function of the HLA A2-allele in a small sample of AD patients, but did not find any significant effects (44). A literature search for association studies with any of these genes including the years before 2003 yielded at least 15 positive studies, while 10 reports found no evidence of a genetic involvement of these factors. While there has been some evidence for a direct involvement of TNFA in Ass-production and toxicity (45), direct proof for a pathogenetic relevance for any of the other genes/proteins remains to be seen. Furthermore, the full-genome screens for AD genes have consistently yielded signals on 6p21 residing between 39 and 42 Mb, whereas the associated genes map 10 Mb further proximal. Thus, while there is increasing evidence supporting the existence of a putative AD locus on 6p21 in general, the possibility that the actual disease gene has not yet been identified cannot be excluded, despite the overlapping positive results from this year and past studies..

0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	19	Chromosome 10q24 Of the six candidate loci analyzed in the region between 10q21 and 10q25 in 2003, three were reported to be associated with AD phenotypes across multiple samples (i.e. CDC2/VR22, TNFRSF6/IDE and GSTO1/2). The only locus found to be associated by more than one group of investigators is located between 90 and 94 Mb and encompasses the genes TNFRSF6 (90 Mb) and IDE/KIFF11/HHEX (46 to 48). Probably the best candidate on biological grounds is IDE, encoding the insulin degrading enzyme (protein: IDE). This metalloprotease has been shown to degrade monomeric Ass before it can aggregate into oligomeric forms and, ultimately, into ss-amyloid plaques (49). While several issues of the proposed mode of action still remain controversial (e.g. the precise cellular location of Ass cleavage, relevance of IDE function/dysfunction on the development of AD), there are now a number of animal models available showing the predicted effects in vivo (50 to 52). Before 2003, there were two papers published showing allelic association with microsatellite markers in this region (53,54), while two reports did not find association with IDE variants or nearby markers and AD (55,56). Note that the data on one of the negative studies (55) actually largely overlaps with the positive paper by Edland et al. (46), with the important exception that the authors of the first paper did not account for potential interactions between IDE and APOE 4-status. This may be crucial, since the latter study only found a significant effect of IDE on AD risk in individuals lacking the APOE 4-allele. Clearly, more studies on independent samples of sufficient size are necessary to further elucidate the potential role of IDE variants on the development of AD in the more general population..
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	20	In addition to the IDE locus, a total of four other genes on the long arm of chromosome 10 were found to be associated with AD. Two of these (CDC2 and VR22) map 30 Mb proximal of IDE, while the other two (GSTO1/2 and PRSS11) map 10 to 30 Mb distal. While none of these associations has yet been confirmed in independent AD samples, it is noteworthy that two of these genes were also found to be associated in other neurodegenerative illnesses, frontotemporal dementia (CDC2) (57) and Parkinson's disease (GSTO1/2) (58), potentially suggesting a more common pathway leading to neuronal cell death across these syndromes. CDC2 encodes for the cell division cycle 2 protein which is involved in the phosphorylation of both tau and APP, and is found in neurons bearing neurofibrillary tangles. GSTO1 and 2 encode for glutathione S-transferase omega-1 and -2, which are involved in the physiological response to oxidative stress, and may in particular be responsible for regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines like IL1-ss. Thus, while these are all plausible AD candidate genes on positional as well as biological/biochemical grounds, further studies are still necessary to elucidate their proposed roles in influencing the risk and/or age-at-onset for AD in the general population..

Yet, there were a total of three studies showing significant association with an AD candidate gene in 2003: BACE, encoding the ss-site APP cleaving enzyme (ss-secretase) (59 to 61). This protein is an excellent AD candidate on biochemical grounds as it is only after the ss-secretase cleavage of APP that Ass can be liberated from its precursor via -secretase cleavage. Most interestingly and in contrast to all other putative AD associations discussed above there appears to be a high degree of consistency with respect to the site and allelic nature underlying these findings: all positive studies, including the initial report by Nowotny and colleagues published in 2001 (62), observe over-representations of the G-allele of a synonymous SNP located at codon 262 (in exon 5) in AD cases as compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, in all of these studies the observed effect was most pronounced in carriers of the APOE 4-allele, yielding significantly elevated odds ratios ranging from 2 to 7..

0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	24	In contrast to these four positive associations, there is an equal number of studies in the literature showing no apparent effects of this BACE polymorphism and AD. However, it must be pointed out that one of these only studied early-onset familial AD cases (63), and the remaining studies did not account for the potential interaction with the APOE 4-allele (64 to 66). Unless this is done, similar to the situation encountered for the variants tested in IDE (see above), no firm conclusions can be reached as to whether or not the exon 5 polymorphism in BACE is a genetic risk factor for AD in these samples. Thus, of the three known APP-cleaving enzymes and associated proteins [- (ADAM9,10 and 17), ss- (BACE, BACE2) and -secretase (PSEN1, APH1A, NCSTN, PEN2)], most of which have already been tested for genetic association with AD phenotypes, BACE currently shows the most promise of being a genuine and relevant risk factor for late-onset AD. As is the case for all other putative AD genes, more studies using sufficiently sized samples and appropriate analytic strategies need to be performed before more general conclusions can be reached. Note, that the first study examining the putative genetic role of BACE in late-onset AD in 2004 also reports a significant effect of the exon 5 polymorphism in a case-control sample of Chinese origin (67)..

CONCLUSION REFERENCES   While the year 2003 has been extremely productive in terms of studies examining potential associations between candidate genes and AD phenotypes, the vast majority of results as in previous years remains controversial. While in some cases this could be due to factors that are disease-specific (e.g. larger than anticipated genetic heterogeneity and/or very small effect sizes of individual risk alleles), a good proportion of these controversies are probably caused by methodological issues. Based on recent empirical and simulation data regarding the genetic make-up of complex diseases and the power of association studies in general, we propose that more attention should be paid to: (i) providing power estimates based on the structure of the analyzed sample for a variety of effect sizes and allele frequencies; (ii) replicating any positive signal in at least one independent population of sufficient size and power prior to initial publication; and (iii) thoroughly assessing the haplotype structure of any investigated locus, especially before reaching any negative conclusions. Together with statistical techniques that take into account potential interactions with other genetic and non-genetic factors, and that allow for an adequate correction of multiple comparisons, adherence to these criteria should ensure the successful distinction between clinically relevant and irrelevant/false-positive findings. Eventually, as in a good vintage of wine, this strategy will elevate the quality of AD genetics research to be on par with its quantity..

0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   ABCA1 is a cholesterol transporter that is widely expressed throughout the body. Outside the central nervous system (CNS), ABCA1 functions in the biogenesis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), where it mediates the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoprotein (apo) A-I. Deficiency of ABCA1 results in lack of circulating HDL and greatly reduced levels of apoA-I. ABCA1 is also expressed in cells within the CNS, but its roles in brain lipid metabolism are not yet fully understood. In the brain, glia synthesize the apolipoproteins involved in CNS lipid metabolism. Here we demonstrate that glial ABCA1 is required for cholesterol efflux to apoA-I and plays a key role in facilitating cholesterol efflux to apoE, which is the major apolipoprotein in the brain. In both astrocytes and microglia, ABCA1 deficiency reduces lipid efflux to exogenous apoE. The impaired ability to efflux lipids in ABCA1-/- glia results in lipid accumulation in both astrocytes and microglia under normal culture conditions. Additionally, apoE secretion is compromised in ABCA1-/- astrocytes and microglia. In vivo, deficiency of ABCA1 results in a 65% decrease in apoE levels in whole brain, and a 75-80% decrease in apoE levels in hippocampus and striatum. Additionally, the effect of ABCA1 on apoE is selective, as apoJ levels are unchanged in brains of ABCA1-/- mice. Taken together, these results show that glial ABCA1 is a key influence on apoE metabolism in the CNS..

A major biochemical function of ABCA1 is to transport cholesterol and phospholipids from the plasma membrane of peripheral cells to lipid-free or lipid-poor apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) during reverse cholesterol transport (1), a process that constitutes an initial step in the biogenesis of high density lipoproteins (HDL)1 in the peripheral circulation. Mutation of one ABCA1 allele causes familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia (FHA), a mild disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by reduced plasma HDL levels (4). Mutation of both alleles of ABCA1 results in Tangier Disease (TD), which is characterized by a nearly complete absence of plasma HDL, deposition of intracellular cholesterol esters, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (4-6). Conversely, overexpression of ABCA1 in mice increases plasma HDL and protects against atherosclerosis (7-9)..

Nearly all brain cholesterol is synthesized in situ, as quantitative analyses show that essentially no cholesterol crosses the blood-brain barrier (21). In contrast, the brain cannot degrade cholesterol, and excess cholesterol must be delivered to the peripheral circulation for eventual excretion via the liver. Approximately 6-7 mg of cholesterol leaves the human brain each day after conversion to 24S-hydroxycholesterol, which easily traverses the blood-brain barrier (22-24)..

Astrocytes and microglia are the cells within the CNS that synthesize and secrete apolipoproteins that transport lipids within the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (25-27). Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is the major apolipoprotein in the brain, and is also a component of several lipoproteins in the peripheral circulation including HDL, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and chylomicrons (28-30). In humans, apoE exists as one of three allelic variants that contain either a cysteine or arginine residue at amino acids 112 and 158 (31). Liver transplantation experiments in humans have shown that the allelic variant of apoE in plasma is converted to that of the donor, whereas apoE in the CSF retains the allelic identity of the recipient, illustrating that CNS and non-CNS apoE pools are synthesized independently (32). Additionally, brain perfusion experiments in guinea pigs have shown that radiolabeled apoE administered into the peripheral circulation demonstrates very low blood-to-brain transport (33), providing additional support for independent regulation of CNS and non-CNS apoE pools. ApoJ is a second major CNS lipoprotein that, unlike apoE, easily traverses the blood-brain barrier and associates with HDL in the periphery (26, 33, 34). ApoE and apoJ are synthesized and secreted from astrocytes and microglia, and expression of both apoE and apoJ are induced in response to CNS injury or disease (24, 26). ApoE is thought to coordinate the mobilization and redistribution of cholesterol in the repair and maintenance of neuronal membranes and myelin (35-37), whereas apoJ may function as a cytoprotective extracellular chaperone (38). In contrast to apoE and apoJ, apoA-I is primarily taken up into the brain from outside the CNS, and is believed to be involved in the maturation of lipoprotein particles in the CSF (26, 39)..

0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	14	In 1993, apoE was discovered to be an important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a finding that has now been replicated in over 100 studies. Inheritance of apoE4 increases the risk of AD in a dosage-specific manner and may act by decreasing the age of onset of AD (40, 41). In contrast, inheritance of apoE2 appears to protect from AD and is associated with a later age of onset (42). Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain how apoE participates in the pathogenesis of AD, including roles for apoE in the formation, deposition, or clearance of the A peptides that constitute amyloid plaques (43-51). For example, apoE binds A in vivo and is required for amyloid deposition (50-53). Furthermore, apoE affects deposition of A in an isoform-specific manner, such that mice expressing human apoE4 develop at least 2.5-fold more A deposits than mice expressing human apoE3 per unit area (45, 49, 53, 54). Interestingly, replacement of the murine apoE with any of the human apoE isoforms completely suppresses A deposition compared with wild-type mice expressing endogenous murine apoE (49, 55), suggesting that distinctions between human and murine apoE may play important roles in A deposition and/or clearance. Compared with apoE, the role of apoJ in AD is less well understood, although it is known that apoJ also binds A and has been suggested to play a major role in transporting A across the blood-brain barrier (33, 34)..

Furthermore, lack of ABCA1 expression decreases apoE secretion from glial cells in vitro. In vivo, this impairment of apoE secretion by astrocytes and microglia results in a decrease in apoE levels by 65% in whole brain lysates of ABCA1-deficient mice, with hippocampus and striatum being the most severely affected regions.

Whether ABCA1 functions similarly in CNS cells is not yet completely understood. Previous work has shown that ABCA1 is expressed in glia and neurons in the brain (10, 17) and that LXR/RXR stimulation of primary glia promotes cholesterol efflux to apoA-I and apoE3 (18). However, the specific role of ABCA1 in promoting cholesterol efflux from glial cells is not yet clear because expression of other genes in addition to ABCA1 are also induced by LXR/RXR treatment (56, 67, 68).

As expected, ABCA1 is required for astrocytes to efflux cholesterol to exogenous apoA-I. Under our experimental conditions, wild-type astrocytes displayed a 2.5-fold increase in cholesterol efflux upon apoA-I addition, whereas ABCA1-/- astrocytes did not show higher efflux to apoA-I compared with baseline (p  >  0.05) (Fig. 1B and Table I). In wild-type astrocytes, addition of apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 resulted in a 2.3-2.6-fold increase in cholesterol efflux, which is similar in magnitude to that elicited by apoA-I. In contrast, the cholesterol efflux elicited by each apoE isoform was 30% less in ABCA1-/- cells compared with wild-type astrocytes when corrected for differences in baseline efflux (Table I). These observations suggest that ABCA1 in astrocytes facilitates lipid efflux to exogenous apoE. However, ABCA1 is not absolutely required to efflux cholesterol to apoE, as residual efflux activity between 1.5-1.8-fold remained in the absence of ABCA1. These observations suggest that genes in addition to ABCA1 also contribute to cholesterol efflux from astrocytes. Comparison among apoE isoforms suggested that apoE2 was a less effective cholesterol acceptor than apoE3 or apoE4 for both wild-type and ABCA1-/- astrocytes, whereas no significant differences were observed in efflux to apoE3 and apoE4 (Fig. 1B). Compared with wild-type astrocytes, ABCA1-/- astrocytes were significantly impaired in their ability to efflux cholesterol to apoA-I and each apoE isoform (p  <  0.001, Table I)..

Because our experiments were conducted in the absence of LXR/RXR stimulation in order to selectively examine the effect of ABCA1 on cholesterol efflux, it is possible that under these conditions astrocytes express all components of the pathway necessary for efficient cholesterol efflux to apoA-I, whereas additional factors may be required to elicit a strong efflux response to apoA-I in microglia..

To assess the role of ABCA1 in apoE secretion from glial cells, we first determined the levels of intracellular apoE as well as the levels apoE secreted into conditioned medium. Initial experiments were conducted using medium conditioned for 72 h, where no differences in secreted apoE levels were observed between wild-type and ABCA1-/- glia (data not shown). Because both astrocytes and microglia express apoE receptors and are known to take up and resecrete apoE, we hypothesized that, at 72 h, apoE in the medium may have arisen from both newly synthesized apoE as well as resecreted apoE. We therefore examined apoE secretion from both astrocytes and microglia after 6 and 8 h, respectively, in order to minimize the effect of resecreted apoE. For each well, intracellular GAPDH levels were used to control for small variations in the total number of cells per well. Intracellular levels of apoE were equivalent in wild-type and ABCA1-/- astrocytes (Fig. 3, A and B, p = 0.72).

To assess the role of ABCA1 in apoE secretion from glial cells, we first determined the levels of intracellular apoE as well as the levels apoE secreted into conditioned medium. Initial experiments were conducted using medium conditioned for 72 h, where no differences in secreted apoE levels were observed between wild-type and ABCA1-/- glia (data not shown). Because both astrocytes and microglia express apoE receptors and are known to take up and resecrete apoE, we hypothesized that, at 72 h, apoE in the medium may have arisen from both newly synthesized apoE as well as resecreted apoE. We therefore examined apoE secretion from both astrocytes and microglia after 6 and 8 h, respectively, in order to minimize the effect of resecreted apoE. For each well, intracellular GAPDH levels were used to control for small variations in the total number of cells per well. Intracellular levels of apoE were equivalent in wild-type and ABCA1-/- astrocytes (Fig. 3, A and B, p = 0.72). In contrast, ABCA1-/- conditioned media contained 50% less apoE than wild-type (Fig. 3, A and C, p = 0.0005). As well, the proportion of total apoE released over 8 h into conditioned medium from primary wild-type and ABCA1-/- astrocytes was determined.

0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	82	There are several potential mechanisms by which ABCA1 may affect apoE metabolism, which may or may not be linked functionally to lipid efflux. ABCA1 is known to cycle between the plasma membrane and late endosomal compartments (74) and, in addition to the plasma membrane, it has been suggested that ABCA1 may efflux cholesterol from late endosomes and lysosomes (65). Moreover, apoA-I has been recently reported to be internalized and resecreted during ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux (75). An increasing body of evidence indicates that internalized apoE does not undergo complete degradation and that it is resecreted (75-77). For example, nascent lipoproteins recovered from livers of apoE-/- mice transplanted with wild type bone marrow, a model in which circulating apoE is derived exclusively from macrophages, showed that up to 60% of internalized apoE may be reutilized under physiological conditions (78). Recently, HDL3 was shown to stimulate the recycling of internalized apoE and to act as an extracellular acceptor for recycled apoE in hepatoma cells (76). In this study, apoE recycling was accompanied by cholesterol efflux and involved internalization of HDL3-derived apoA-I and its targeting to endosomes containing cholesterol and apoE (76). Taken together, these observations suggest the possibility that apoE secretion and recycling may be coupled to cholesterol efflux and that ABCA1 may play a role in this process..

For example, plasma membrane-associated ABCA1 may function to transport cholesterol and phospholipids to various extracellular apolipoprotein acceptors, whereas intracytoplasmic ABCA1 may primarily participate in intracellular lipid trafficking. Additionally, it is known that apoE requires prenylation in order to be efficiently secreted (79), suggesting the possibility that any impact of ABCA1 on prenylation pathways might also affect apoE secretion.

Loss of ABCA1 affects apoE levels most severely in the hippocampus and striatum, whereas cortex and thalamus are moderately affected by ABCA1 deficiency. ApoE levels in the cerebellum are minimally reduced in ABCA1-/- mice compared with wild-type controls. We hypothesize that defective secretion of apoE from astrocytes and microglia is a key factor that underlies the reduced apoE levels in vivo. In the absence of ABCA1, both astrocytes and microglia secrete less apoE, and the intracellular pool of microglial apoE available for secretion is also lower. Interestingly, elimination of ABCA1 had no effect on apoJ levels, suggesting that ABCA1 selectively regulates apoE metabolism rather than having a general effect on other brain-derived apolipoproteins. To our knowledge, whether deficiency of human ABCA1 results in changes in CNS or CSF levels of apoE has not been determined..

Loss of ABCA1 affects apoE levels most severely in the hippocampus and striatum, whereas cortex and thalamus are moderately affected by ABCA1 deficiency. ApoE levels in the cerebellum are minimally reduced in ABCA1-/- mice compared with wild-type controls. We hypothesize that defective secretion of apoE from astrocytes and microglia is a key factor that underlies the reduced apoE levels in vivo. In the absence of ABCA1, both astrocytes and microglia secrete less apoE, and the intracellular pool of microglial apoE available for secretion is also lower. Interestingly, elimination of ABCA1 had no effect on apoJ levels, suggesting that ABCA1 selectively regulates apoE metabolism rather than having a general effect on other brain-derived apolipoproteins. To our knowledge, whether deficiency of human ABCA1 results in changes in CNS or CSF levels of apoE has not been determined..
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	88	The in vivo reduction of brain apoE levels, coupled with the reduced ability of ABCA1-/- glia to maintain normal levels of cholesterol efflux and apoE secretion in vitro, suggests that ABCA1 deficiency may impair normal brain function, particularly in response to injury or disease. ApoE expression is known to be induced in glial cells in response to neuronal injury, where it is believed to participate in lipid transport processes involved in repairing neuronal membranes (36, 80). Because ABCA1 deficiency results in region-specific reductions in apoE levels in brain, it is possible to speculate that ABCA1 may play a role in recovery from a variety of neurological insults by facilitating lipid mobilization via apoE..

0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	90	Our observation that ABCA1-/- mice have a significant reduction in apoE levels in brain creates a paradox for predictions about the role of ABCA1 in AD. In this study, we provide the first direct evidence that glial ABCA1 affects apoE metabolism in vivo and in vitro. Reduced levels of apoE in ABCA1-/- brains may predict a greater susceptibility to neuronal injury due to decreased lipid-mediated repair pathways, yet lower levels of apoE may also delay amyloid deposition. In addition to glial ABCA1, neuronal ABCA1 may also participate in AD by affecting A generation. At present, it is controversial whether ABCA1 increases or decreases A generation, as two in vitro studies reported that increased ABCA1 expression reduced A production (18, 81), whereas a third study reported the opposite finding (19). Genetic variations in ABCA1 have been reported to alter the susceptibility to AD (82, 83), although additional studies are necessary to fully validate these results. Clearly, understanding the contributions of ABCA1 to AD will require in vivo studies in which the contribution of glial and neuronal ABCA1 to the pathogenesis of AD can be evaluated in an appropriate physiological context..

0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	92	In summary, we demonstrate that glial ABCA1 is a key participant in apoE metabolism. We show that selective disruption of ABCA1 reduces cholesterol efflux to exogenous apoE and impairs apoE secretion from both astrocytes and microglia. As a result, ABCA1-/- glia accumulate lipids under normal culture conditions. In vivo, ABCA1 is required to maintain normal levels of apoE in brain. Further, the effect of ABCA1 is specific to apoE and is independent of HDL and apoA-I levels. Taken together, our observations provide a clear and direct link between ABCA1 and apoE metabolism in brain..

0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	3	Apolipoprotein E (apoE), particularly the e4 allele, is genetically linked to the incidence of Alzheimer's disease. In vitro, apoE has been shown to bind -amyloid (A), an amyloidogenic peptide that aggregates to form the primary component of senile plaques. In previous work, we demonstrated that apoE3 from tissue culture medium binds to A with greater avidity than apoE4 (LaDu, M. J., Falduto, M. T., Manelli, A. M., Reardon, C. A., Getz, G. S., and Frail, D. E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23403-23406). This is in contrast to data using purified apoE isoforms as substrate for A (Strittmatter, W. J., Weisgraber, K. H., Huang, D. Y., Dong, L.-M., Salvesen, G. S., Pericak-Vance, M., Schmechel, D., Saunders, A. M., Goldgaber, D., and Roses, A. D. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 8098-8102). Here we resolve this apparent discrepancy by demonstrating that the preferential binding of A to apoE3 is attenuated and even abolished with purification, a process that includes delipidation and denaturation. We compared the A binding capacity of unpurified apoE isoforms from both tissue culture medium and intact human very low density lipoproteins with that of apoE purified from these two sources. The interaction of human A- (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40) -peptide and apoE was analyzed by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western immunoblotting for either A or apoE immunoreactivity. While the level of the apoE3A complex was 20-fold greater compared with the apoE4A complex in unpurified conditioned medium, apoE3 and apoE4 purified from this medium bound to A with comparable avidity. Moreover, using endogenous apoE on very low density lipoproteins from plasma of apoE3/3 and apoE4/4 homozygotes, apoE3 was again a better substrate for A than apoE4. However, apoE purified from these plasma lipoproteins exhibited little isoform specificity in binding to A. These results suggest that native preparations of apoE may be a more physiologically relevant substrate for A binding than purified apoE and further underscore the importance of subtle differences in apoE conformation to its biological activity..

ApoE is also expressed in the brain (1) and in response to injury in both the peripheral (2) and central nervous (3) systems. In humans, apoE has three major isoforms, E2 (Cys, Cys), E3 (Cys, Arg), and E4 (Arg, Arg), which are products of three alleles at a single gene locus. The presence of cysteine in apoE2 and apoE3 allow these isoforms to form disulfide-linked dimers. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the apoE e4 allele is present with increased frequency in patients with sporadic (4) and late-onset familial (5) Alzheimer's disease (AD). Due primarily to this genetic linkage, the role of apoE in the pathogenesis of AD is being actively pursued..

The physiological mechanism by which apoE contributes to AD pathology may be by means of an isoform-specific interaction with A.

Unpurified preparations of VLDL were used within 2 weeks of isolation. Purification of apoE from this lipoprotein fraction and from concentrated conditioned medium was carried out according to standard procedures (13) . Briefly, the conditioned medium and lipoproteins were dialyzed against 0.01% EDTA, lyophilized, and delipidated in CHCl:MeOH (2:1). Delipidated proteins were pelleted in MeOH and solubilized in 6 M guanidine, 0.1 M Tris, 0.01% EDTA (pH 7.4), and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol.

Previously, using unpurified apoE from conditioned medium, we showed that the amount of the apoE3A complex was much greater compared with the apoE4A complex (7) .

The major differences between these two studies are the source of apoE (plasma versus secreted by cultured cells) and whether the apoE protein was purified prior to use in the binding assays. In this study, we examined whether these differences could account for the discrepancy between these two reports regarding apoE isoform-specific binding to A. We compared the A binding capacity of unpurified apoE from both conditioned medium and intact human VLDL from plasma of apoE3/3 and apoE4/4 homozygotes with the A binding capacity of apoE purified from these two sources.

0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	19	We first examined the effect of purification of apoE from conditioned medium on the formation of apoEA complexes. ApoE3 and apoE4 were purified from the medium of transfected HEK-293 cells, and the binding of this material to A was compared with the binding of unpurified apoE from medium (Fig. 1). Prior to purification, the amount of the apoE3A complex (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 2) was 20-fold greater compared with the apoE4A complex ( lane 4). These results are consistent with our previous data that demonstrated that this preferential binding of A to apoE3 is maintained over time, pH range, and concentration of apoE and A (7) . Purification of the apoE isoforms from this medium resulted in a decrease in A binding to apoE3 (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 6) and an increase in A binding to apoE4 ( lane 8). To determine whether an auxiliary component that influences the isoform specificity of apoE binding to A is present in the medium of HEK-293 cells, we reconstituted purified apoE with mock-transfected conditioned medium. The isoform specificity of apoE binding to A was not restored to pre-purification levels, indicating that purification does not remove a component present in the medium that confers the preferential binding of A to apoE3 (compare Figs. 2 and 1 A, lanes 5-8)..

Sources of apoE were as follows: conditioned medium of transfected cells (apoE3, lanes 1 and 2; apoE4, lanes 3 and 4) and purified from conditioned medium (apoE3, lanes 5 and 6; apoE4, lanes 7 and 8). Samples were run in nonreducing Laemmli buffer on 10-20% SDS-Tricine gels, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane, and probed with 4G8 antibody ( A) or apoE antiserum ( B)..

Similar to the results using unpurified apoE from conditioned medium, we observed an 20-fold difference in the amount of the apoE3A complex (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 2) compared with the apoE4A complex ( lane 4) when using intact VLDL particles as the source of apoE. As with purification of apoE from medium, purification of apoE from the VLDL fraction of human plasma attenuated the preferential binding of apoE3 to A (Fig. 3 A and B, lanes 6 and 8). The level of A binding to both apoE4 and apoE3 dimer was increased after purification of apoE from plasma. In apoE3/3 plasma, the apoE immunoreactive species migrating slightly higher than the apoEA complex (55 kDa) is the apoE3-apolipoprotein A-II heterodimer (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2).() The autoradiographs shown in Figs. 1 and 3 are representative of several experiments with similar results using different apoE-containing preparations. While some variation in the purification-mediated loss of preferential apoE3 binding to A was observed, in general, purification of apoE from both medium and plasma abolished isoform-specific binding to A..

However, the contribution of the apoE3-A complex in their time course data is difficult to discern since the blots were probed for apoE and A immunoreactivity simultaneously (10) . Therefore, we repeated the time course study using purified plasma apoE isoforms and probed for A (Fig. 4 A) and apoE (Fig. 4 B) immunoreactivity individually. Similar to the results obtained by Strittmatter et al. (10) , apoE4 monomer did form a complex with A at a faster rate compared with apoE3 monomer. However, when the apoE3 dimer-A complex was taken into account, the total binding of A to apoE3 and apoE4 remained comparable across time..

Purification may result in a change in the oxidative state of apoE that influences its binding to A. Although the apoE isoforms are subject to the same conditions while undergoing purification, oxidation could be specific to the Cysin apoE3. This could affect conformation-dependent binding of apoE to A, either directly or via interaction of other amino acids with this residue. However, apoE3 dimer, particularly in its purified form, readily binds A, indicating that at least oxidation of cysteine does not seem to adversely affect apoE3 A complex formation. In addition, oxidation provides no obvious explanation for the increase in A binding to purified apoE4 monomer..

In each of the unpurified preparations used here, apoE was lipid-associated. ApoE from human plasma was in the VLDL fraction, while the majority of apoE in conditioned medium was in a high density lipid fraction.() Purified apoE has been shown to require lipid to restore its biological activity in other assay systems, presumably by allowing the denatured protein to refold to its functional conformation. These apoE activity assays include such diverse functions as receptor binding and modulation of neuritic growth. While purified apoE is unable to displace I-labeled low density lipoprotein (LDL) from LDL receptors (16) , high affinity binding is restored when apoE is added in the presence of a variety of lipid particles, including phospholipid vesicles (17) . Similarly, the binding of purified apoE to LDL receptor-related protein is enhanced by the addition of -migrating VLDL (18) . In primary dorsal root ganglia cultures, purified apoE3 and apoE4 have no effect on neuritic growth.

Avid binding of apoE3 to soluble A in the neuropil could lead to enhanced clearance or altered fibril formation, both of which could prevent the conversion of A into a neurotoxic species. Since lipid-associated apoE3 and apoE4 bind the LDL receptor and LDL receptor-related protein with equal affinity (18) , efficient uptake and clearance of A may depend on its preferential binding to apoE3. Alternatively, purified apoE3 and apoE4 are known to differ with respect to their effect on A fibril formation (20, 21, 22) , suggesting that native apoE may play an even greater isoform-specific role in the extracellular aggregation of A due to differences in A binding characteristics. Finally, there is evidence that A-induced toxicity in hippocampal neurons is attenuated by the addition of rabbit apoE (23) , leading to the intriguing possibility that human apoE may contribute to A-induced toxicity in an isoform-specific manner..

ApoE is an apolipoprotein, and as such, its endogenous conformation requires lipid. It is therefore not surprising that the type of apoE preparation used can affect the results.

0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	3	Within the central nervous system, apolipoprotein E (apoE) synthesis is increased in response to nerve injury, a finding that may reflect a role for apoE in neuronal remodeling. Recent studies show that apoE3 promotes and apoE4 inhibits neurite outgrowth in cultured neuronal cells. Interestingly, these isoform-specific effects are observed only when apoE is presented to cells in the presence of an exogenous lipid source such as rabbit -very low density lipoprotein (-VLDL), making it difficult to discern the biologically active form of apoE or to understand the role of the lipid source. In the present study we tested whether a cell-derived lipidated form of apoE can alter neurite outgrowth in the absence of -VLDL by constructing Neuro-2a cell lines expressing high levels of apoE. Our results showed that endogenous apoE3 stimulated neurite outgrowth, whereas the endogenous apoE4 isoform was neutral. Furthermore, -VLDL antagonized the stimulatory effects of the endogenous apoE3. Characterization of the secreted apoE3 indicated that the neurite outgrowth-stimulating activity could be recovered from culture medium with an anti-apoE immunoaffinity column and was present in a poorly lipidated particle with a density between 1.19 and 1.26 g/ml. These results indicated that the biological activity of apoE3 in stimulating neurite outgrowth was inherent in the cell-derived apoE particle and was not dependent on either (a) an interaction of apoE3 with an artificial lipid source or (b) independent actions of apoE3 and -VLDL..

ApoE plays a key role in cholesterol homeostasis by mediating the hepatic clearance of plasma cholesteryl ester-rich VLDL and chylomicron remnants. In contrast to other apolipoproteins, which are synthesized only in liver and gut, apoE is expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types including abundant expression by steroidogenic cells and astrocytes of the brain (1-4). ApoE is present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at 5-10  microg/ml, which is approximately 5-10% of its plasma concentration (5, 6). The endogenous lipoproteins in CSF are predominantly HDL-like particles that arise from astrocyte-derived apoE in addition to apoAI, which presumably crosses the blood-brain barrier (7, 8). The role of brain apoE is not known, although its expression appears to be correlated with nerve injury and neuronal remodeling (8-13)..

0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	8	The three common isoforms of human apoE result from cysteine-arginine interchanges at residues 112 and 158 (14). ApoE3 contains cysteine at residue 112 and arginine at residue 158. ApoE2 contains 2 cysteines, whereas apoE4 contains arginines at these residues. A correlation between the apoE 4 allele and late-onset familial Alzheimer's disease has been identified (15-17). However, the role of apoE in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease is still unknown. There is evidence that apoE interacts with protein components of both pathologic features of Alzheimer's disease (amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) in an isoform- specific manner (18, 19). In addition, purified delipidated apoE will stimulate isoform-specific differences in neurite outgrowth when added to neuronal cells in culture (14, 20, 21). A murine neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro-2a, exposed to delipidated apoE3 has significantly longer neurite extensions when compared with either control cells or cells treated with apoE4 (14). The delipidated apoE4 isoform has an inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth that correlates with destabilization of microtubular arrays (14). Interestingly, these isoform-specific differences are only observed when an exogenous lipid source (rabbit -VLDL) is added along with the delipidated apoE isoforms. Neither the rabbit -VLDL, which contains abundant rabbit apoE, nor the human apoE alone alters neurite outgrowth..

Multiple lipid sources (VLDL, triglyceride-rich emulsions, HDL, and HDL-like CSF lipoproteins) can substitute for -VLDL to propagate similar isoform-specific differences (21-23). However, a puzzling aspect of these studies is that CSF lipoproteins fail to induce a difference in neuritogenesis unless they are enriched with exogenous human apoE (23), even though the CSF HDL-like particles already contain apoE (7, 23).

To test this possibility we constructed Neuro-2a cell lines that secrete higher levels of the apoE isoforms. These cells produced a minimally lipidated apoE3 that stimulated neurite outgrowth in the absence of exogenous lipid. Under identical conditions, apoE4 had no effect on neurite outgrowth, indicating that the E4 isoform was neutral and not inhibitory. Furthermore, exogenous -VLDL antagonized the stimulatory effects of cell-derived apoE3. Thus, these studies identified a minimally lipidated form of apoE that was biologically active in promoting neurite outgrowth..

Fig. 4A shows representative confocal images from the three cell lines at the conclusion of the 96-h assay in the absence of -VLDL. Strikingly, the cells secreting apoE3 had substantially longer neurite extensions than either the apoE4 or control cells. To quantify these differences, multiple images were saved from three independent experiments and analyzed for neurite length. Fig. 5A demonstrates that the apoE3-secreting cell line had significantly longer neurites (214%, p = 0.0001 versus control) than either control (set to 100%) or apoE4-secreting cells (114%) in the absence of -VLDL. The data were further analyzed to ascertain whether the observed mean differences were indicative of uniform behavior within the cell population or due to a minor subpopulation of cells with dramatically longer neurites. Fig. 5B illustrates that the distribution of neurite lengths was shifted throughout the cell population in the apoE3-secreting cells, whereas the apoE4-secreting cells were nearly indistinguishable from the control cells..

Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and nonspecifically stained with acridine orange. Multiple confocal images for each treatment in all three cell lines were captured using a 20  x  objective and analyzed in the Image Tool program. Neurite extensions were determined by measuring the longest neurite outgrowth from 60 to 90 responsive cells (cells containing a neurite that is at least 1 cell diameter in length). A shows the average neurite extensions from three independent experiments both in the absence and presence of -VLDL (error bars indicate standard error). The level of significance of the differences was calculated for the apoE3-secreting cells compared with control Neuro-2a cells in the absence of -VLDL (*, p = 0.0001) and for the apoE3-secreting cells in the absence of -VLDL compared with apoE3-secreting cells in the presence of -VLDL (**, p = 0.0005). These data were analyzed to determine the percentage of total cells (N) expressing neurites of defined lengths in the absence of -VLDL (B) or in the presence of -VLDL (C).

Table I shows some variation in secreted apoE, yet the neurite extension results for these clones were consistent with isoform-specific modulation that was relatively unaffected by the small differences in secreted apoE. For example, the 1C and 1E4C clones showed identical apoE concentrations at 48 h, and the 1E4C apoE concentration differed from the 1C concentration only by 20% at 96 h. Nevertheless, the apoE3-expressing 1C clone showed a stimulation of neurite outgrowth (p = 0.0001), whereas the apoE4-expressing 1E4C clone did not. These data indicate that the cell-derived apoE3 stimulated neurite outgrowth in the absence of -VLDL, whereas under identical conditions, apoE4 was neutral..

Surprisingly, the addition of -VLDL to the extension assays reduced apoE3 neurite extensions compared with the apoE3 extensions in the absence -VLDL. As shown in Fig. 5A, -VLDL reduced neurite outgrowth in apoE3-expressing cells from 214% of control to 128% of control (p = 0.0005), whereas -VLDL had no significant effect (p  >  0.05) on neurite outgrowth in the control Neruo-2a and apoE4-expressing cell lines. As shown in Fig. 5C, -VLDL appeared to normalize the neurite length distribution for the three cell lines. Thus, -VLDL inhibited neurite outgrowth in the apoE3-expressing cells (p = 0.0005) but had no effect on control or apoE4-expressing cells (p  >  0.05)..

Alternative possibilities were that the effect was due to intracellular apoE or was an indirect result of high level apolipoprotein secretion which might perturb lipid homeostasis within the cell. To test these possibilities, we isolated the secreted apoE3 from conditioned medium by affinity chromatography with monoclonal antibody 1E. A series of five trans-addition experiments were performed in which the isolated apoE3 (30  microg/ml) was incubated with parental Neuro-2a cells in a 48-h extension assay. Fig. 6A illustrates that the immunopurified apoE3 maintained its ability to stimulate a significant increase in the average neurite length (154% of control, p = 0.0002). Furthermore, the population distribution of neurite lengths for the cells treated with the purified apoE3 closely resembled the distribution seen in the transfected apoE3 cell line in the absence of -VLDL (Fig. 6B)..

Therefore, the lipidation state of apoE secreted by Neuro-2a cells was determined by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Both secreted apoE isoforms floated at a density of 1.19 to 1.26 g/ml, indicating a poorly lipidated particle (Fig. 7, A and B). None of the secreted apoE had a density typical of apoE-containing plasma HDL (Fig. 7C), and secreted apoE was shifted to higher density upon delipidation (Fig. 7D).

0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	62	We produced high expressing apoE3 and apoE4 Neuro-2a cell lines to test whether cell-derived apoE could exhibit isoform-specific stimulation of neurite outgrowth in the absence of an exogenous lipid source. ApoE3 stimulated neurite outgrowth in the absence of -VLDL or other exogenous lipid sources. Furthermore, cell-derived lipidated apoE3 isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography was active in promoting neurite outgrowth in parental Neuro-2a cells. Nathan et al. (14) discovered that the co-addition of purified delipidated apoE and -VLDL to Neuro-2a cells elicits isoform-specific differences in neurite outgrowth, effects also seen in other cell lines and primary neuronal cultures (20-23, 33). Interestingly, these isoform-specific effects could not be duplicated by apoE addition alone. Similarly, Neuro-2a cell lines that express low amounts of apoE isoforms also required -VLDL to elicit effects on neurite outgrowth (22). It was unclear from these studies whether apoE3 stimulates neurite outgrowth independently but in concert with an exogenous lipid or whether an active form of apoE was formed only when it was combined with the exogenous lipid source. Our results indicated that the biological activity of apoE3 in stimulating neurite outgrowths was inherent in the cell-derived lipidated particle and was not dependent on either (a) an interaction of apoE3 with an artificial lipid source or (b) independent actions of apoE3 and -VLDL on Neuro-2a cells..

0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	64	We demonstrated that cell-derived apoE4 was neutral when challenged in a neurite extension assay in the absence of -VLDL. Although some studies have implicated apoE4 as being inhibitory to neurite outgrowth in the presence of an artificial lipid source (14, 22), other studies support the conclusion that apoE4 is neutral. Holtzman et al. (21) showed an apoE3 enhancement of neurite outgrowth in the neuronal cell line GT1-1 trk9 only in the presence of -VLDL and nerve growth factor but no significant difference between apoE4-treated cells and controls under the same conditions. Experiments with GT1-1 trk9 cells give similar results when HDL-sized particles from human CSF are substituted for -VLDL (23). In further studies, Puttfarcken et al. (34) showed that bulk conditioned medium from HEK-293 cells stably expressing either apoE3 or apoE4 isoforms are moderately stimulatory in primary hippocampal cultures. These experiments (21, 34) as well as the present results argue that the apoE4 isoform is devoid of neurite-stimulating activity but is not inhibitory when presented to cells alone, in combination with exogenous lipids, or as a cell-derived lipidated particle..

0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	66	When present in the neurite extension assay, -VLDL antagonized the stimulatory effect of apoE3, an effect that was not detected in previous studies in which -VLDL was required for the effect of delipidated apoE (14, 20-23, 33). It may be that in experiments with delipidated apoE, -VLDL acts as a lipid source to facilitate formation of an active apoE particle and at the same time antagonizes the action of the lipidated apoE. In this case, the level of apoE3-stimulated neurite outgrowth would depend on the balance between these two factors. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the antagonism observed in the present study is a nonspecific cytotoxic effect because -VLDL alone modestly stimulated neurite outgrowth (111%), an effect also observed by others (14, 20, 22). The antagonism by -VLDL may reflect sequestration of secreted apoE or competition at a cellular receptor site..

Because this minimally lipidated form of apoE was biologically active in the absence of an exogenous lipid source, it was unlikely that the neurite outgrowth stimulation reflects an action of apoE to simply deliver lipid to the cell for membrane formation. We speculate that apoE acted extracellularly to direct neurite extension or as a paracrine factor to stimulate neurite growth..
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	69	How does the lipidated apoE3 particle stimulate neurite outgrowth although apoE4 remains neutral? The LDL receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) bind apoE containing lipoproteins and are expressed by neuronal cells (35-37). Evidence from several studies implicate LRP in the apoE isoform-specific stimulation of neurite outgrowth (21, 22, 38). In particular, inhibition of the apoE3 effect on neurite outgrowth by anti-LRP antibodies provides strong evidence for the involvement of LRP. However, binding studies with the LRP show no isoform-specific differences between apoE3 and apoE4 (27). This discrepancy may be resolved by recent reports of other apoE receptors. A new apoE receptor has been described which localizes to neurons and has a high homology to the LDL receptor (39). Additional brain-specific receptors with high homology to the LRP (40) and the LDL receptor (41) also have been identified. The present findings that a cell-derived form of apoE3 is active in stimulating neurite outgrowth will permit both physical characterization of the particles and analysis of isoform-specific interactions with these recently described neuronal receptors..

Despite appropriate transfusion and chelation therapy and low ferritin levels, patients still develop organ failure, heart failure being the main cause of death. This study was designed to determine whether the decreased antioxidant activity of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 allele could represent a genetic risk factor for the development of left ventricular failure (LVF) in -thalassemia homozygotes. A total of 251 Greek -thalassemia homozygotes were studied. Patients were divided in three groups: group A (n = 151) with no cardiac impairment, group C (n = 47) with LVF, and 53 patients with LV dilatation and normal LV systolic function constituted the group B. DNA was obtained from all patients, and the polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the polymorphism at the APOE locus. The APOE allele frequencies were compared with those of a Greek control sample of 216 healthy blood donors. Patients with no cardiac impairment had an APOE 4 allele frequency (7.9%) not different from population controls (6.5%, P  >  .05), while patients with LVF had a significantly higher frequency of APOE 4 (12.8%) than the controls (P  <  .05, odds ratio = 2.11, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 4.32). The APOE 4 allele may represent an important genetic risk factor for the development of organ damage in homozygous -thalassemia..

Via the iron-driven Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions, the nontransferrin plasma iron, in its bivalent or trivalent form, has a high toxicity through the formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH.).25 This leads to peroxidative damage of membrane lipids and proteins. Imbalance between production of oxygen free radicals and antioxidant defense mechanisms can result in oxidative stress and human disease.26 In the heart, the imbalance between free radicals and antioxidant mechanisms is manifested as impaired function of the mitochondrial inner-membrane respiratory chain resulting in abnormal energy metabolism expressed clinically with fatal cardiomyopathy. Apart from iron overload, it has been recently shown by our group that myocarditis appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of LVF in a certain number of patients with homozygous -thalassemia.27 As shown in animal models, oxygen free radicals may also contribute to the pathogenesis of infectious myocarditis.28,29.

The normal cases of group A and the severely affected cases of group C had clear clinical and echocardiographic characteristics and were easily distinguished. Patients of group B were characterized by LV dilatation and good LV function. In these cases, LV and left atrial (LA) dilatation could possibly represent the first step of LV dysfunction without overt LV decreased contractility, or a compensatory mechanism due to anemia. Some of these patients will eventually develop LVF..

0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	44	The results of the functional polymorphism at the APOE locus in our study suggest that the 4 allele may be a genetic risk factor for the development of LVF (and other organ damage) in homozygous -thalassemia. It represents the first demonstration of a genetic factor unlinked to the  globin gene cluster contributing to the clinical manifestations of the disease. The 4 allele could represent a predictive marker for development of LVF in patients with -thalassemia major and LV dilatation (our patient group B), suggesting a closer follow-up of such patients. As the APOE 4 frequency was found in only 12.8% of patients with homozygous -thalassemia and LVF, it is obvious that other genetic and environmental factors, as for instance, the number of transfusions, iron overload, chelation therapy, and viral myocardial inflammation, play a role in the development of organ damage. The fact that patients in groups B and C, as shown in Table 1, did not have either higher ferritin levels or were transfused more inadequately than those without cardiac impairment, supports the role of APOE 4 allele as a genetic risk factor for LVF development. Furthermore, some patients of group A with 4 allele could still develop LVF. Additional evidence for the relationship between the 4 allele and heart disease comes from an analysis of patients homozygous for the 4 allele, of whom three had LVF and one LV dilatation, but numbers in this category are small. The increase in the 4 allele frequency among patients with cardiac disease comes with a reduction in 3 rather than 2 allele frequency, but the 2 allele frequency is already very low in the Greek population,22 and other factors may influence the level of this allele..

0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	46	As the APOE 4 allele was found in patients of advanced age with no cardiac impairment, the presence of the 4 allele does not guarantee the development of LVF in -thalassemia. In addition, as more than 85% of patients with LVF do not carry the 4 allele, this is neither a necessary prerequisite for the development of LVF. This is equivalent to the association of APOE 4 with Alzheimer's disease, where the association has been confirmed in almost 100 studies around the world.30 A consensus statement on APOE genotyping in Alzheimer's disease concluded that APOE genotyping can be used as an adjunct to other diagnostic tests, but that prospective investigations of dementia as a function of APOE genotype are needed,31 and something similar might apply to -thalassemia..

0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	53	The finding of an increased frequency of APOE 4 allele in -thalassemia homozygotes with LVF provides additional evidence to the theory of oxygen free radicals as contributing to the organ damage, due to the recently demonstrated antioxidant and iron binding activity of apoE.14 This suggests that several other genetic loci could be of potential relevance to the oxidative damage of organs in -thalassemia. Such loci include genes modulating genesis of oxygen free radicals (ie, cytochrome C oxidase), genes for scavenger enzymes (superoxide dismutases, catalase), genes regulating mitochondrial DNA replication, structural genes for membrane lipoproteins, and genes involved in DNA repair mechanisms.36 It is noteworthy that mutant mice lacking the Mn-superoxide dismutase enzyme suffer neonatal lethality due to dilated cardiomyopathy.37 Other functional polymorphisms in such genes could be examined for association with organ failure in -thalassemia. It is also believed that genetic susceptibility for a majority of common diseases will be associated with relatively common alleles of one or several loci.38.

0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Variant late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by progressive mental deterioration and blindness, is caused by mutations in a polytopic membrane protein (CLN6) with unknown intracellular localization and function. In this study, transient transfection of BHK21 cells with CLN6 cDNA and immunoblot analysis using peptide-specific CLN6 antibodies demonstrated the expression of a 27-kDa protein that does not undergo proteolytic processing. Cross-linking experiments revealed the presence of CLN6 dimers. Using double immunofluorescence microscopy, epitope-tagged CLN6 was shown to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with no colocalization with the cis-Golgi or lysosomal markers. The translocation into the ER and proper folding were confirmed by the N-linked glycosylation of a mutant CLN6 polypeptide. Pulse-chase labeling of fibroblasts from CLN6 patients and from sheep (OCL6) and mouse (nclf) models of the disease followed by immunoprecipitation of cathepsin D indicated that neither the synthesis, sorting nor the proteolytic processing of this lysosomal enzyme was affected in CLN6-defective cells. However, the degradation of the endocytosed index protein arylsulfatase A was strongly reduced in all of the mutant CLN6 cell lines compared with controls. These data suggest that defects in the ER-resident CLN6 protein lead to lysosomal dysfunctions, which may result in lysosomal accumulation of storage material..

0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs),1 also collectively called Batten disease, are a group of autosomal recessively inherited neurodegenerative diseases that affect both children and adults. The clinical features include loss of vision, seizures, and mental and motor deterioration. Depending on the affected gene, the clinical signs become visible at various developmental stages (1). Currently, eight forms of human NCLs (CLN1 to 8) can be differentiated for which six underlying genes have been identified (2). CLN1 and CLN2 encode for soluble lysosomal enzymes, palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 and tripeptidylpeptidase 1, respectively (3 to 5). CLN3, CLN5, CLN6, and CLN8 represent transmembrane proteins of still unknown function (6 to 10). Although the nature of these CLN genes differs, defects in most of them lead to massive storage of autofluorescent material in lysosomes that has been identified as the subunit c of the mitochondrial ATP synthase (2, 11, 12)..

Binding to Man-6-P-specific receptors, MPR46 and MPR300, allows the segregation from the secretory pathway and transport from the trans-Golgi-network to the endosomal compartment. Because of the low pH, the receptor-ligand complexes dissociate and the enzymes are delivered to the lysosome. Soluble enzymes that escape binding to the MPR in the trans-Golgi network are secreted but can be partially endocytosed after binding to MPR localized at the cell surface and transported to the lysosome (13). CLN3, CLN5, and CLN8 have been localized in lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/ER-Golgi-intermediate compartment, respectively (14 to 16). The subcellular localization of CLN6 is not known. The transport of lysosomal membrane proteins requires tyrosine- or dileucine-based sorting signals (17). Recently, lysosomal targeting motifs have been identified in CLN3 protein (18), whereas the localization of CLN8 in the ER is mediated by a KKXX-ER-retrieval signal (16)..

On the other hand, the N-terminal RRR sequence (amino acids residues 5 to 7) has been detected in the ER type II membrane protein glucosidase I (41), whereas the N-terminal segment of CLN6 encoded by exon 1 (amino acids residues 1 to 28) has been suggested to function as a putative targeting signal for mitochondria (10). To investigate its subcellular localization, an N-glycosylation site was introduced in the predicted second luminal loop. Ile residue 153 was substituted for a Ser (p.Ile153Ser) by site-directed mutagenesis of the CLN6 cDNA changing the sequence Asn-X-Ile to Asn-X-Ser. When the p.Ile153Ser was expressed in BHK21 cells, Western blot analysis revealed an additional band of 33 kDa, which disappeared after deglycosylation with PNGase F or endo H (Fig. 2A). These data demonstrate that the nascent CLN6 polypeptide had been translocated to the lumen of the ER and became accessible to the glycosylation machinery. This was confirmed by double immunofluorescence microscopy. The CLN6Myc protein colocalized with the ER marker protein PDI but not with the lysosomal marker enzyme cathepsin D (Fig. 2B, CtsD)..

In human fibroblasts, CtsD is synthesized as a 53-kDa precursor form (28). A small fraction of the CtsD precursor (in this study =" BORDER="0">3% of total) is secreted (Fig. 4A). The majority of the precursor protein binds to MPRs in the trans-Golgi network and is transported to prelysosomal/endosomal compartments where it is processed to the 47-kDa intermediate form within 2 h after synthesis (42). The intermediate CtsD forms are delivered to lysosomes and are processed to the mature 31- and 14-kDa forms within 6 h after synthesis (Fig. 4A). When South Hampshire sheep fibroblasts were labeled for 1 h with [35S]methionine, a 45-kDa polypeptide was immunoprecipitated with the anti-human CtsD antibody (Fig. 4B). After a chase period of 6 h, only 13 and 16% of the total CtsD were recovered as a 30-kDa mature form from cells and as a 48-kDa form from the media, respectively (Fig. 4B). After metabolic labeling of primary mouse fibroblasts followed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-mouse CtsD antibody, a predominant 45-kDa polypeptide was observed (32). Small amounts (9% of total synthesized CtsD) were detected as a 51 to 48-kDa band in the media (Fig. 4C), suggesting a variable extent of glycosylation. These results show that the sorting and processing of newly synthesized CtsD was not affected in fibroblasts from a CLN6 patient, from OCL6 sheep, or from nclf mice. Additionally, the specific activities of two other lysosomal enzymes, -hexosaminidase and ASA, were comparable in control and human, sheep, and mouse CLN6-defective cells..

Recent studies have revealed additional ER retention signals such as RXR (R = arginine, X = a large neutral or positively charged residue) (46 to 48). Furthermore, the oligomerization of proteins mediated by transmembrane and/or luminal domains forming large homodimeric or heteromeric protein complexes might prevent package into transport vesicles and export from the ER (44, 49, 50).

However, the comparable rates of synthesis, sorting, and proteolytic processing of CtsD in CLN6-defective and control cells as well as similar specific activities of two lysosomal enzymes, -hexosaminidase and ASA, suggest that CLN6 does not limit transport of at least three enzymes to the lysosome. On the other hand, this study shows that the capability to degrade exogenous arylsulfatase A is strikingly impaired in CLN6-defective cells. Whereas the half-life of the newly synthesized ASA has been reported to be  > 40 days (51), the internalized human ASA is rapidly degraded (Ref. 52 and the present study). It is probable that the acidic pH-dependent octamerization cannot be completed by endocytosed ASA resulting in increased lysosomal instability (53). Taking the endocytosed ASA as an index for the delayed degradation in CLN6-defective cells, the results indicate that either specific lysosomal proteases are absent and/or inactive or other lysosomal parameters such as pH or the presence of cofactors are affected. It is of interest that the incubation of N1E.115 neuroblastoma cells with amyloid- protein fragments, the suspected neurotoxic mediator in Alzheimer's disease, led to an increased expression of acetylcholinesterase because of slowed lysosomal degradation.

0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	4	Apolipoprotein (apo) E, a constituent of several lipoproteins, is a ligand for the low density lipoprotein receptor, and this interaction is important for maintaining cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis. We have used a gene replacement strategy to generate mice that express the human apoE3 isoform in place of the mouse protein. The levels of apoE mRNA in various tissues are virtually the same in the human apoE3 homozygous (3/3) mice and their littermates having the wild type mouse allele (+/+). Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in fasted plasma from the 3/3 mice were not different from those in the +/+ mice, when maintained on a normal (low fat) chow diet. We found, however, notable differences in the distribution of plasma lipoproteins and apolipoprotein E between the two groups: -migrating lipoproteins and plasma apoB100 levels are decreased in the 3/3 mice, and the apoE distribution is shifted from high density lipoproteins to larger lipoprotein particles. In addition, the fractional catabolic rate of exogenously administered remnant particles without apoE was 6-fold slower in the 3/3 mice compared with the +/+ mice. When the 3/3 and +/+ animals were fed a high fat/high cholesterol diet, the 3/3 animals responded with a dramatic increase (5-fold) in total cholesterol compared with the +/+ mice (1.5-fold), and after 12 weeks on this same diet the 3/3 animals developed significantly (at least 13-fold) larger atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic sinus area than the +/+ animals. Thus the structural differences between human APOE3 and mouse ApoE proteins are sufficient to cause an increased susceptibility to dietary-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in the 3/3 mice..

0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	6	Apolipoprotein (apo)1 E is important for the transport of cholesterol and triglyceride throughout the body. It is an amphipathic protein that stabilizes the structure of lipoprotein particles via its ability to bind lipid, and it functions as a ligand for lipoprotein receptors, such as the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (1-3). ApoE is a major protein component of chylomicron remnants, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL), but it is not present on low density lipoproteins (LDL). ApoE is also enriched in a subclass of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and functions as an effective ligand for their binding to the LDLR (4)..

0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	8	The human APOE gene is located on chromosome 19 (5) as part of an apolipoprotein cluster that also includes the genes encoding APOCI, APOCII, and APOCIV (6). Multiple tissue-specific enhancers and negative elements have been identified in the region proximal to the gene (7). A distal enhancer, the hepatic control region, that is required for liver expression is located 15 kb downstream of the gene (8, 9). The liver synthesizes approximately 70% apoE found in the body and 20% is found in the brain, and the remainder is synthesized in several tissues including the spleen, lung, heart, ovary, testis, kidney, and skin (10, 11)..

0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	10	Three major APOE alleles, 2, 3, and 4, occur in humans at frequencies of 7.3, 78.3, and 14.3%, respectively (12). These three alleles are distinguished by coding differences at positions 112 and 158 (13). The most common isoform, apoE3, has a cysteine at position 112 and an arginine at position 158; the apoE2 isoform has a cysteine at both positions, whereas the apoE4 isoform has an arginine at both positions. Functionally, the three isoforms differ in their affinity for the LDLR, with apoE3 and E4 exhibiting 100% binding and apoE2 displaying only 1% normal binding affinity (14). Despite the lower affinity of apoE2 for the LDLR, individuals homozygous for 2 typically have lower than normal plasma cholesterol levels, except for the fraction of homozygotes (5-10%) who develop type III hyperlipoproteinemia (15). Individuals homozygous for 4 have higher total plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol compared with 3 homozygotes and are at increased risk for developing coronary artery disease (16). The 4 allele is also associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (17, 18)..
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	11	ApoE isoform-specific effects are important in the etiology of atherosclerosis and other diseases, but appropriate animal models to rigorously investigate these effects are currently lacking. To date, transgenic animals made by pronuclear injection of human DNA have been used to study these effects, but this method produces mice with varying levels of transgene expression due to differences in chromosomal location and copy number, and expression of the endogenous mouse apoE complicates the interpretation of the data (19-24, 47). To overcome these difficulties we have used targeted gene replacement to generate mice that express only the human apoE3 isoform at levels that are in the physiological range. In these mice the coding sequences for mouse apoE were replaced with sequences coding for human APOE3 without disturbing any of the known regulatory sequences. This replacement results in animals with expression of human apoE mRNA, identical in tissue distribution and levels, to that of mouse apoE mRNA in wild type animals..

0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	39	The targeting strategy used to replace the mouse apoE coding exons 2-4 with the human counterpart is illustrated in Fig. 1. Homologous recombination between the targeting construct (Fig. 1B) and the endogenous mouse apoE locus (Fig. 1A) results in a chimeric gene (Fig. 1C) where all the mouse coding sequences have been replaced with sequences coding for human APOE3. This chimeric locus retains all normal mouse regulatory sequences in addition to the non-coding mouse exon one. Identification of correctly modified embryonic stem (ES) cells was by Southern blot analysis with a mouse exon 1 or exon 4 probe (data not shown); ES cell DNA digested with EcoRI and hybridized with the mouse exon 1 probe revealed an 8.3-kb endogenous band and a 7.8-kb targeted band confirming the correct modification of the 5 region; ES cell DNA digested with HindIII and hybridized with mouse exon 4 probe revealed a 7.5-kb endogenous band and a 15-kb targeted band confirming correct modification of the 3 region. The modified locus was transmitted to the F1 generation from chimeras that were made from one of the targeted cell lines. All F1 matings produced normal litter sizes with a normal Mendelian segregation pattern of the modified locus. Genotypes of F2 animals were determined using Southern blot analysis of tail DNA digested with BamHI (Fig. 2A). The nucleotide sequence for codon 112 (TGC) and codon 158 (CGC) in a 3/3 mouse was confirmed using allele-specific PCR (33) on tail DNA. Fig. 2. Southern and Western blot analysis. A, Southern analysis with a mouse exon 4 probe to identify F2 mice carrying the targeted allele. An 11.2-kb hybridizing BamHI fragment indicates the presence of the human APOE3 allele. A 4.8-kb hybridizing BamHI fragment indicates the presence of the mouse apoE allele.

Western blot analysis with anti-human apoE antisera ( huE (p)), which slightly cross-reacts with mouse ApoE, showed that human APOE (34, 200 Da) in 3/3 plasma migrates at the same rate as apoE in human plasma and slightly slower than the mouse apoE (32, 600 Da) in +/+ plasma (Fig. 2B). The absence of mouse ApoE in the 3/3 plasma was confirmed by Western blot analysis with an anti-mouse apoE antibody ( mu (m)), which shows that mouse ApoE is present only in the +/+ and 3/+ samples and not in the 3/3 plasma. In contrast, the anti-human apoE monoclonal antibody ( huE (m)), which does not cross-react with mouse ApoE, shows that human APOE was present only in 3/3, 3/+, and human plasma and not in the +/+ plasma (Fig. 2B).

Northern blot analysis with a mouse exon 4 probe was used to compare the levels of apoE mRNA in the two types of animal (Fig. 3).

A -actin probe was hybridized to the same blot after removal of the apoE probe (lower panels in Fig. 3) to assess the amount of mRNA loaded in each group. In agreement with previous reports (10, 11) apoE mRNA expression was highest in the liver and second in the brain, with lesser amounts in other tissues. No apoE mRNA was detected in muscle. The expression of apoE mRNA in the 3/3 and +/+ animals was essentially indistinguishable in all tissues analyzed, with the exception of small intestine which had reduced levels of apoE mRNA in the 3/3 animals compared with +/+ mice.

Thus, locus-specific sequences and enhancers are not altered except for any possible intragenic control sequences that differ between mice and humans. Therefore, it was expected that tissue-specific expression of the human replacement APOE3 gene would closely parallel that of the endogenous mouse apoE gene. Our mRNA studies show that this expectation was indeed fulfilled, with the exception of intestinal apoE mRNA which was slightly reduced in the 3/3 mice compared with the +/+ mice. The significance of this reduction in intestinal expression is not clear, considering that intestinal apoE expression is very low compared with other tissues and that chylomicrons originating from the small intestine are known to contain very little apoE (34, 35). Differences between the 3/3 and +/+ mice consequently are highly informative as far as function of the apolipoprotein itself are concerned.

0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	81	The dramatic delay in clearance of remnant particles in the 3/3 mice was unexpected since previous studies using transgenic mice expressing human APOE have revealed normal or enhanced clearance kinetics (22, 36). One possible explanation for the observed delay in clearance is that the human APOE3 protein has a lower affinity to mouse LDLR and/or other receptors than mouse ApoE because of species differences in their structures. Mouse and human apoE differ in 30% of their amino acid sequences with most of the differences being at the amino and carboxyl termini (1). The receptor binding domain (residues 136-160) is highly conserved between mouse and human apoE since 21 of 25 residues are identical in this region including seven residues designated as critical for receptor binding (37, 38). The residues that differ have conservative substitutions (e.g. methionine for leucine) that do not affect the net charge or hydrophobicity of the protein and would not be predicted to have any substantial effects on the protein conformation (39). Thus, it must be ascribed to differences outside the receptor binding domain if the affinity for the receptor differs between the mouse and human apoE proteins. Species differences in the receptors that interact with apoE, such as the LDLR, and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, could also contribute to a lower affinity..

One possible explanation for the observed delay in clearance is that the human APOE3 protein has a lower affinity to mouse LDLR and/or other receptors than mouse ApoE because of species differences in their structures. Mouse and human apoE differ in 30% of their amino acid sequences with most of the differences being at the amino and carboxyl termini (1). The receptor binding domain (residues 136-160) is highly conserved between mouse and human apoE since 21 of 25 residues are identical in this region including seven residues designated as critical for receptor binding (37, 38).

It has been postulated that HSPG's are involved in the initial sequestration process that enhances the uptake of apoE containing lipoproteins (40, 41). The interaction of apoE with HSPG's is thought to occur mainly via electrostatic attraction (42). Human APOE3 has a cysteine at position 112 where the mouse protein has an arginine at the equivalent position (mouse apoE residue 104). This charge difference could be significant, even though residue 112 is outside the known heparin-binding domain..

Several proteins are known to interact with apoE and play a role in lipid metabolism. For example, the interaction of apoE with hepatic and lipoprotein lipases mediates/or enhances the catabolism of lipoproteins (41). Lipoprotein particles containing human APOE3 may be less efficient in this type of interaction than mouse ApoE. This would have important consequences in the remodeling and processing phase of lipoprotein catabolism..

In +/+ mice most of the plasma apoE is associated with HDL particles that are presumably the source of apoE used to clear the exogenously added remnants. In the 3/3 animals, however, the majority of plasma apoE3 is associated with large lipoproteins and may not transfer as easily to exogenously added particles. In support of this, we and others (27) have noted that the distributions of apoE among mouse plasma lipoproteins analyzed by FPLC and by ultracentrifugation do not always agree and that apoE associated with HDL are more readily lost by ultracentrifugation. Although the capacity for apoE3 to exchange between different classes of lipoproteins has not been documented, the decreased ability of apoE3 to transfer from large lipoproteins may have important implications..

It is very unlikely that this difference is the result of a mutation unexpectedly introduced into the APOE3 gene during its manipulation because in our work2 we observed that transgenic apoE3 mice, in an endogenous apoE (/) background, had a virtually identical apoE3 distribution pattern as seen in the 3/3 replacement mice. These mice were made by pronuclear injection of a human cosmid clone isolated from a different individual from the one we used to make our mice (24). Similar findings were also reported by Taylor et al. (44) in transgenic apoE3 mice (that also express mouse apoE) which showed that the majority of human APOE3 resided in larger lipoprotein particles using SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis of fractions separated by sequential density ultracentrifugation. In this work the authors also found that mouse ApoE and human APOE co-distributed among lipoproteins. This is different from the results of our FPLC analysis of 3/+ heterozygote plasma which shows that approximately half of the mouse ApoE and only a minor fraction of human APOE3 was associated with HDL (data not shown). It is not known whether the observed differences between our work and Taylor et al. are the result of different techniques used to fractionate the plasma lipoproteins or the result of different levels of human APOE and mouse ApoE expression in the two types of mice. Further characterization of these large apoE3-rich lipoprotein particles is required to understand the observed delay in clearance in the 3/3 animals..

The 3/3 mice are, however, much more susceptible to diet-induced hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis than their +/+ littermates. Possibly, on the high fat diet a postprandial accumulation of -VLDL's occurs that leads to the development of atherosclerosis, as suggested by Zilversmit (45). In human APOE2 homozygous individuals with type III hyperlipoproteinemia, there is an abnormal accumulation of remnant particles that has been suggested to cause accelerated coronary and peripheral vascular disease (46). Even small changes in lipid metabolism that decrease the clearance efficiency of lipoproteins are likely to have dramatic effects on the development of atherosclerosis, and thus the 3/3 animals give us an opportunity to investigate what changes are important..

A2M has been implicated biochemically in binding and degradation of the amyloid [beta] (A[beta]) protein which accumulates in SP. We studied the relationship between Alzheimer's disease and a common A2M polymorphism, Val1000 (GTC)/Ile1000 (ATC), which occurs near the thiolester active site of the molecule. In an initial exploratory data set (90 controls and 171 Alzheimer's disease) we noted an increased frequency of the G/G genotype from 0.07 to 0.12. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is over-represented in Alzheimer's disease in an additional independent data set: a group of 359 controls and 566 Alzheimer's disease patients. In the hypothesis testing cohort, the G/G genotype increased from 0.07 in controls to 0.12 in Alzheimer's disease (P  <  0.05, Fisher's exact test). The odds ratio for Alzheimer's disease associated with the G/G genotype was 1.77 (1.16-2.70, P  <  0.01) and in combination with APOE4 was 9.68 (95% CI 3.91-24.0, P  <  0.001). The presence of the G allele was associated with an increase in A[beta] burden in a small series. The A2M receptor, A2M-r/LRP, is a multifunctional receptor whose ligands include apolipoprotein E and the amyloid precursor protein. These four proteins have each been genetically linked to Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that they may participate in a common disease pathway..

The tetrameric A2M structure undergoes a conformational change upon cleavage of a peptide bond in the bait region by a proteinase and this conformational change traps the proteinase. A2M has been implicated in several pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer's disease. A2M immunostains senile plaques (SP) (1-3) and binds amyloid [beta] protein (A[beta]) 1-42 with high affinity (apparent Kd  <  1.0 nM) (4). Moreover, recent data suggest that a serine proteinase-A2M complex can degrade A[beta] (5) and trypsin-activated A2M efficiently degrades A[beta] in vitro and prevents in vitro formation of thioflavin S-positive A[beta] fibrils as well as A[beta]-induced toxicity of cultured human cortical neuronal cells (6)..

Poller et al. (10) screened 30 normal and 30 pulmonary disease patients for A2M polymorphisms at or near the active site and reported three A2M polymorphisms. The most common occurred 25 amino acids downstream from the thiolester site, interchanging Val1000 (GTC) and Ile1000 (ATC) (10). (Numbering is based on the cDNA sequence which includes a 24 amino acid signal peptide; this corresponds to Val/Ile976 in the mature protein.) Allele frequencies in their 60 probands were 0.3 (GTC) and 0.7 (ATC). No difference in A2M serum levels was associated with the two alleles. This polymorphism is especially interesting because it has the potential to be biologically relevant to the function of A2M as a proteinase inhibitor because it occurs near the thiolester active site of the molecule..

Because of the potential for error due to multiple hypothesis testing, we planned to use the initial data set as an exploratory data set, with the intent to formulate specific hypotheses which would then be tested formally in a second independent data set. We genotyped 90 non-Alzheimer's individuals who had either undergone screening tests with the Blessed dementia scale (11) or whose DNA had been isolated from autopsy material and were demonstrated to not have Alzheimer's disease and 171 individuals who either had a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or neuropathologically proven Alzheimer's disease (Table 1). Genotypes were determined by PCR amplification of DNA and restriction enzyme digestion (Fig. 1). In our control series, the G allele frequency was 0.28 and six of 90 individuals contained the G/G genotype (0.067). In the Alzheimer's disease set, the G allele frequency was 0.32. We noticed that the G/G genotype frequency was increased in the Alzheimer's group at 0.12 (Table 1). These results suggest a possible influence of this A2M polymorphism as a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease..

Power analysis showed that >500 Alzheimer's disease and control individuals would be necessary to have an 80% chance of showing a difference between genotype frequencies of 0.07 and 0.12. We therefore collected cases and controls from several sites in order to approximate this number of samples.

The results from the second data set supported the hypothesis, with G/G genotype frequencies of 0.07 in controls and 0.12 in Alzheimer's disease (P  <  0.05, Fisher's exact test) (Table 1).

We also compared the rate in controls to the subset of 387 clinic-based Alzheimer's disease cases (G/G frequency = 11.4%, P = 0.06) and the subset of 179 familial Alzheimer's disease samples (G/G frequency = 12.7%, P = 0.056) and found essentially equal over-representation of G/G in each. These data support an association of the G/G genotype with Alzheimer's disease..
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	17	We then carried out a series of exploratory analyses using pooled data from all individuals (737 Alzheimer's disease patients and 449 controls). The G/G genotype was present in 11.9% of the Alzheimer patients and 7.3% of the controls (P  <  0.01, Fisher's exact test). The genotype frequency in controls was consistent with a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Age of onset was not different between Alzheimer's disease patients with G/G (70.0  plus or minus  9.2, mean  plus or minus  SD) and non-G/G carriers (70.6  plus or minus  9.1). A multivariate logistic model that controlled for the presence of the APOE4 allele and gender showed an odds ratio of 1.88 (95% CI 1.20-2.95, P  <  0.01) for the presence of A2M G/G genotype. The presence of APOE4 in this model was associated with an odds ratio of 4.21 (95% CI 3.20-5.55, P  <  0.001). The odds ratio of the combination of G/G and APOE4 is 9.68 (95% CI 3.91-24.0, P  <  0.001) relative to those with neither risk factor. To explore whether the G/G-mediated risk was influenced by the presence or absence of APOE4, we stratified the sample by the presence or absence of APOE4. Similar over-representations of the G/G genotype were seen in the strata with or without APOE4, suggesting that the effects of the two risk factors are independent. Multivariate analysis for interaction between the G/G genotype and either APOE4 or gender demonstrated no interactions (P > 0.5 for interaction terms). Analysis based on the Mantel-Haenszel estimator suggested no heterogeneity of odds ratios between strata with and without APOE4 (P > 0.5), consistent with the absence of an interaction between A2M and APOE4 in our logistic regression model..

Our previous studies of A2M immunohistochemistry in Alzheimer brain suggested that SP in different cases stained with varying intensity (3). We explored the possibility that this variability was due to different genotypes by immunostaining eight Alzheimer's disease cases known to be G/G or A/A genotype. In all instances, A2M immunoreactivity was present robustly on SP, astrocytes and neurons and no qualitative differences were observed between the genotype groups..

Thirty one of these previously analyzed Alzheimer's disease cases were A2M genotyped and selected for further analysis. Initial inspection of the data suggested an increase in A[beta] in individuals who were A/G or G/G, with no difference between these two groups. A statistically significant increase in A[beta] deposition was seen when comparing the G-containing cases with the non-G-containing cases (8.8  plus or minus  2.8 versus 6.6  plus or minus  1.9%, P  <  0.03, unpaired t-test). The effect appears to be primarily due to the presence of at least one G allele, in that no difference between A/G and G/G genotypes was observed, although our sample size limits the power of this comparison. There were no statistically significant differences in neurofibrillary tangle number with G alleles, suggesting a specific effect on A[beta] deposition..

Alternatively, type II errors can occur if sample size is insufficient. In order to overcome some of the difficulties inherent in exploratory studies of genetic risk factors we used independent data sets to first generate, then test the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Two separate control populations gave identical genotype frequencies; our hypothesis testing data set was itself made up of two groups (sporadic AD and probands from a multicenter study of Alzheimer's disease sib pairs and small families) each of which gave essentially identical genotype frequencies and over-representation of the G/G genotype. The A2M G/G effect was not dependent on APOE genotype and the effect was additive and substantial: the odds ratio of G/G in the presence of an APOE4 allele showed an almost 10-fold increased risk. Power analysis using the size of effect observed in our combined data set (using ~500 samples) suggests that a group size of 578 controls and 578 Alzheimer's disease patients would be necessary to have an [alpha] of 0.05 and a [beta] of 80% for the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is increased from 0.07 to 0.12 in Alzheimer's disease..

0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	26	The association of the G/G A2M genotype as a risk factor in Alzheimer's disease leads to several interesting mechanistic interpretations. Previous data have shown that A2M immunostains SP and have implicated A2M in amyloid precursor protein metabolism (13) as well as possible interactions with binding of A[beta] (4) and mediation of degradation of A[beta] (5,6). A2M-A[beta] complexes undergo endocytosis via the A2M-r/LRP receptor (14). A2M associates with A[beta] and prevents fibril formation (15). In addition, A2M can be viewed as a (sub)acute phase reactive molecule and as a potent proteinase inhibitor which might participate in the inflammatory response in Alzheimer brain. Interestingly, A2M has also been implicated as a trophic factor, possibly as a result of binding and transporting a number of polypeptide growth factors and cytokines (16). Like apoE, A2M may serve as a binding protein for targeting various bioactive molecules to their site of action or clearing them (3). Finally, the fact that apoE and APP, two other ligands of the A2M-r/LRP receptor are clearly involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, support the plausibility of the idea that an A2M polymorphism might contribute to risk of Alzheimer's disease. In fact, a polymorphism in A2M-r/LRP itself has recently been reported in two studies to show a genetic association with Alzheimer's disease (17,18)..

0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	28	Although there is a strong biological rationale for the involvement of an A2M polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease, the possibility remains that the genetic association we observe reflects linkage with another mutation or polymorphism either in the A2M gene itself or in a nearby gene on chromosome 12. The A2M gene resides ~25 cM distal of the marker D12S1042, which yielded the maximal LOD score in a recent linkage study, suggesting that chromosome 12 contains an Alzheimer risk factor (19). However, the likelihood that A2M itself is a risk factor is supported by the results of a recent separate study, in which we observed an association between an intronic (5[prime] splice site of exon 18) pentanucleotide deletion (allele 2) within the A2M gene and Alzheimer's disease in a sibship analysis of Alzheimer's disease sib pairs and small Alzheimer's disease families (20). Our current results extend this observation by showing linkage of a missense mutation in a case-control sample rather than family-based association. We are currently studying how the two A2M polymorphisms relate to one another; our preliminary results are consistent with the hypothesis that they act as independent risk factors. Initial study of a group evaluated for both polymorphisms suggests that the G allele is inherited with the 1 allele; of 70 G chromosomes examined (35 G/G individuals), 97% were allele 1 and 3% were allele 2, compared with an allele 2 frequency of ~15% (P  <  0.005, [chi]2 analysis with Yate's correction)..

ApoE4 differs from the two other common isoforms (apoE2 and apoE3) by its lower resistance to denaturation and greater propensity to form partially folded intermediates. As a first step to determine the importance of stability differences in vivo, we reengineered a partially humanized variant of the amino-terminal domain of mouse apoE (T61R mouse apoE) to acquire a destabilized conformation like that of apoE4. For this process, we determined the crystal structure of wild-type mouse apoE, which, like apoE4, forms a four-helix bundle, and identified two structural differences in the turn between helices 2 and 3 and in the middle of helix 3 as potentially destabilizing sites. Introducing mutations G83T and N113G at these sites destabilized the mouse apoE conformation. The mutant mouse apoE more rapidly remodeled phospholipid than T61R mouse apoE, which supports the hypothesis that a destabilized conformation promotes apoE4 lipid binding..

One of the common human isoforms, apoE4, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and Alzheimer diseases.

One of the common human isoforms, apoE4, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and Alzheimer diseases. The other two common isoforms, apoE3 and apoE2, each correlate with a lowered risk, respectively, for Alzheimer disease (4-8).

ApoE3 has a cysteine at position 112 and a arginine at 158, and apoE2 has cysteines and apoE4 has arginines at both positions (14). These sequence differences result in structural and biophysical properties that alter function and hence likely affect disease. In apoE4, the two modular domains interact in a unique manner known as domain interaction (15-17). Arg-112 in apoE4 causes the Arg-61 side chain to adopt a different conformation than it has in apoE2 and apoE3, allowing it to form a putative salt-bridge with Glu-255 in the carboxyl-terminal domain (16, 18)..

The loop between helices 2 and 3 (residues 81-86) forms a tight turn in mouse apoE but is more extended and relaxed in all crystal structures of human apoE (33). This difference reflects the cis conformation of Gly-83 in mouse apoE, which cannot be sterically accommodated by Thr-83 in apoE4 (Fig. 4A).

Asn-113 in mouse apoE lies in a straight portion of helix 3, but the Gly-113 in apoE4 lies at a pronounced kink and cannot form the same hydrogen bond with Arg-112 that is formed by Asn-113 in mouse apoE (Fig. 4C). The result is a reduced local hydrogen bond network (Fig. 4C and Table II). In addition, because glycines have high configurational entropy, localized flexibility in the middle of helix 3 caused by Gly-113 may account for the lower stability and greater propensity of apoE4 to form partially folded intermediates. The net effects of both sequence differences at positions 83 and 113 are a greater stabilization of helix 3 and a more parallel alignment of the dipoles of helices 2 and 3 in mouse apoE than in apoE4 (Fig. 4B). Thus, these data suggest that these two sequence differences contribute to the differences in the human and mouse urea denaturation curves..

Based on a comparison of the x-ray crystal structures of the amino-terminal domains of human apoE4 and wild-type mouse apoE, we identified two potential structural differences in the loop connecting helices 2 and 3 (position 83) and the middle of helix 3 (position 113) that likely would affect stability. Although there are several other differences between human and mouse apoE, we found that introduction of human residues G83T and N113G into the loop between helices 2 and 3 and the middle of helix 3 were all that was required to mimic the unfolding behavior of apoE4 (Fig. 7). The destabilized T61R mouse apoE has increased lipid binding properties, demonstrating an analogous functional switch from apoE3-like to apoE4-like. It is interesting that stability of the apoE isoforms (apoE4  <  apoE3  <  apoE2) parallels the relative susceptibility of carriers of these isoforms to Alzheimer disease..

Thus, the destabilization of the compactly folded state of apoE, although advantageous for lipid binding, may predispose misfolding into amyloid fibrils. This could provide a basis for amyloid formation because amyloid plaques in brains of Alzheimer patients show apoE immunoreactivity (40, 41). The apoE isoforms differ in their ability to promote amyloid formation by A. In vitro, co-incubation of purified apoE with A, promotes A fibrillization, and the fibrils are coated with apoE (42). ApoE4 facilitates the formation of a more extensive matrix of A fibrils than does apoE3, as assessed by electron microscopy (42, 43)..

In mouse models of Alzheimer disease (i.e. mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein and human apoE isoforms) apoE4 is more effective in promoting the deposition of A than apoE3 (45-49). Furthermore, in apoE knock-out mice expressing human apoE isoforms, apoE4 drives the nucleation and aggregation of immunopositive A deposits to a greater extent than apoE3 (50).

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	5	Apolipoprotein (apo) E mediates lipoprotein remnant clearance via interaction with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Both the 22-kDa N-terminal domain and 10-kDa C-terminal domain of apoE contain a heparin binding site; the N-terminal site overlaps with the low density lipoprotein receptor binding region and the C-terminal site is undefined. To understand the molecular details of the apoE-heparin interaction, we defined the microenvironments of all 12 lysine residues in intact apoE3 and examined their relative contributions to heparin binding. Nuclear magnetic resonance measurements showed that, in apoE3-dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine discs, Lys-143 and -146 in the N-terminal domain and Lys-233 in the C-terminal domain have unusually low pKa values, indicating high positive electrostatic potential around these residues. Binding experiments using heparin-Sepharose gel demonstrated that the lipid-free 10-kDa fragment interacted strongly with heparin and a point mutation K233Q largely abolished the binding, indicating that Lys-233 is involved in heparin binding and that an unusually basic lysine microenvironment is critical for the interaction with heparin. With lipidated apoE3, it is confirmed that the Lys-233 site is completely masked and the N-terminal site mediates heparin binding. In addition, mutations of the two heparin binding sites in intact apoE3 demonstrated the dominant role of the N-terminal site in the heparin binding of apoE even in the lipid-free state. These results suggest that apoE interacts predominately with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans through the N-terminal binding site. However, Lys-233 may be involved in the binding of apoE to certain cell-surface sites, such as the protein core of biglycan.

Both the 22-kDa N-terminal domain and 10-kDa C-terminal domain of apoE contain a heparin binding site; the N-terminal site overlaps with the low density lipoprotein receptor binding region and the C-terminal site is undefined. To understand the molecular details of the apoE-heparin interaction, we defined the microenvironments of all 12 lysine residues in intact apoE3 and examined their relative contributions to heparin binding. Nuclear magnetic resonance measurements showed that, in apoE3-dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine discs, Lys-143 and -146 in the N-terminal domain and Lys-233 in the C-terminal domain have unusually low pKa values, indicating high positive electrostatic potential around these residues. Binding experiments using heparin-Sepharose gel demonstrated that the lipid-free 10-kDa fragment interacted strongly with heparin and a point mutation K233Q largely abolished the binding, indicating that Lys-233 is involved in heparin binding and that an unusually basic lysine microenvironment is critical for the interaction with heparin. With lipidated apoE3, it is confirmed that the Lys-233 site is completely masked and the N-terminal site mediates heparin binding. In addition, mutations of the two heparin binding sites in intact apoE3 demonstrated the dominant role of the N-terminal site in the heparin binding of apoE even in the lipid-free state. These results suggest that apoE interacts predominately with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans through the N-terminal binding site. However, Lys-233 may be involved in the binding of apoE to certain cell-surface sites, such as the protein core of biglycan.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	7	Apolipoprotein E (apoE)1 is a critical ligand for several hepatic lipoprotein receptors, including the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), and for cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (1-3). Through its interaction with these receptors and with the HSPG-LRP pathway, apoE mediates the catabolism of remnant lipoproteins (4, 5). In the HSPG-LRP pathway, apoE is postulated to interact initially with cell-surface HSPG and then to transfer to the LRP for internalization (6, 7). Therefore, the interaction of apoE with HSPG is an initial step in the clearance of apoE-containing lipoproteins from the plasma. The apoE-HSPG interaction is also involved in the differential effects of the apoE isoforms on neurite outgrowth (8, 9), the existence of a pool of newly secreted apoE on the cell surface (10-12), and the inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated smooth muscle cell proliferation (13). In addition, several studies suggest that binding of apoE to HSPG may be involved in Alzheimer's disease (5, 14, 15)..

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	9	ApoE, a 299-amino acid, single chain protein, contains two independently folded functional domains, a 22-kDa N-terminal domain (residues 1-191) and a 10-kDa C-terminal domain (residues 222-299) (2, 16). The N-terminal domain exists in the lipid-free state as a four-helix bundle of amphipathic -helices and contains the LDL receptor binding region (residues 136-150 in helix 4) (17). The amphipathic nature of the -helix containing residues 136-150 is critical for normal binding to the LDL receptor (18). Our recent studies using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) demonstrated that Lys-143 and Lys-146 have unusually low pKa values because of local increases in positive electrostatic potential associated with the region surrounding residues 136-150 (19, 20). The C-terminal domain is also predicted to be a highly -helical structure and contains the major lipid binding region (21, 22). The detailed molecular features of the -helices in the C-terminal domain are poorly understood..

The N-terminal domain site is located between residues 142-147 and overlaps with the receptor binding region (24). In fact, the HSPG binding activity of apoE variants is significantly decreased by mutations of Arg-142, Arg-145, and Lys-146, indicating that these basic amino acid residues contribute to heparin binding (25). A recent study on the interaction between a heparin-derived oligosaccharide and the N-terminal domain of apoE4 found that Arg-142 and -145 form salt bridges with sulfate groups from the octasaccharide fragment (26), consistent with a dramatically reduced binding affinity of apoE4(R142C) and apoE4(R145C) mutants for HSPG (25). This study also predicted additional interactions between the heparin fragment and Lys-143, Lys-146, and Arg-147. Most recently, a site-directed mutagenesis study showed that Arg-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Arg-147 are required for high-affinity binding to heparin, with Lys-146 participating in an ionic interaction with the heparin fragment and Lys-143 participating in a hydrogen bond (27)..

We demonstrated that the isolated C-terminal domain binds to heparin with higher affinity than the N-terminal domain in the lipid-free state and that an unusual basic microenvironment around Lys-233 is involved in heparin binding. Surprisingly, this C-terminal site is unavailable for heparin binding in both the lipid-free and lipidated states of the intact apoE molecule, suggesting that only the N-terminal site contributes to the interaction of apoE with HSPG in vivo.

As expected, the pKa values for eight lysines in the N-terminal domain of full-length apoE3 were the same as those for the 22-kDa fragment of apoE3 reported previously (19). Lys-233 has a low pKa of 9.4, which is similar to the pKa values of Lys-143 and -146 located in the LDL receptor/heparin binding region in the N-terminal domain of apoE3. This suggests that Lys-233 may behave similarly and be part of the heparin binding region in the C-terminal domain..

The dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated to be 26  microg/ml at 50 mM NaCl and 76  microg/ml at 150 mM NaCl, consistent with a previous report (24).

In contrast, apoA-I did not bind to heparin even at low salt concentration. These results indicate that the interaction between the 10-kDa fragment and heparin is electrostatic (36, 37) and the amphipathic characteristics common in helical apolipoproteins (38) are not responsible for heparin binding..

As shown in Fig. 3, a large decrease in heparin binding was observed only for the 10-kDa (K233Q) variant (maximal binding capacity was 31% of the wild-type 10-kDa fragment) without a change in binding affinity (Kd values for both were 76  microg/ml). Of the four lysines in the C-terminal domain, only Lys-233 showed a relatively low pKa value (Table I), suggesting that an unusually basic microenvironment around Lys-233 is critical for the interaction between the C-terminal domain and heparin..

In the lipid-free form, full-length apoE and the 10-kDa fragment bound to heparin with similar affinities, whereas the 22-kDa fragment bound to heparin with much lower affinity (Fig. 4A). When complexed with DMPC, the heparin binding of the 10-kDa fragment was completely abolished, indicating that the C-terminal binding site is masked by lipids (Fig. 4B). Instead, the lipidated 22-kDa fragment bound to heparin with high affinity and rather better than full-length apoE. Similar results were obtained with POPC, a more physiological phospholipid (data not shown). Although the binding capacity of lipidated full-length apoE3 was much lower than that of the lipid-free form, the binding affinity of full-length apoE3 in both states was similar (Kd for the lipid-free and lipidated forms were 157 and 210  microg/ml, respectively), consistent with the previous observation using surface plasmon resonance analysis (37)..

To examine this hypothesis, we introduced mutations into two lysines of full-length apoE and compared the heparin binding activities of these variants. The mutated proteins were apoE(K146Q) and apoE(K146E), which have N-terminal domains that bind defectively to heparin (27), and apoE3(K233Q) and apoE3(K233E), which are thought to have low heparin binding capacity through the C-terminal site. Large decreases in heparin binding were observed with apoE(K146E) in both the lipid-free (Fig. 5A) and the DMPC-complexed forms (Fig. 5B), indicating that Lys-146 contributes greatly to the heparin binding of full-length apoE. However, as also shown in Fig. 5, A and B, the lipid-free apoE(K146Q) exhibited a much smaller decrease in heparin binding than wild-type apoE3, and apoE(K146Q)-DMPC complexes bound to heparin in a similar manner to the lipid-free form. This disparity between apoE(K146E) and apoE(K146Q) variants is probably because of the ionization state of the glutamate residue at pH 7.4 that is responsible for the difference in the heparin binding activities (27)..

For wild-type apoE and the apoE(K146E) and apoE(K233Q) variants, the heparin binding of free protein differs from that of the protein-DMPC complexes. Binding to DMPC results in the opening of the four-helix bundle in the N-terminal domain of apoE (40-42). Therefore, it is likely that these apoE variants have subtle differences in their final conformations on the DMPC disc that may modulate their heparin binding properties (27).

Although the C-terminal heparin binding site is conserved in this variant, the heparin binding of apoE (1-260) was significantly lower than wild-type apoE3 and close to that of the apoE3 22-kDa fragment (Fig. 6). This indicates that tetramerization through the C-terminal domain has a major influence on the heparin binding ability of the lipid-free apoE. We also measured the binding of the 12-kDa apoE fragment (2) to heparin to investigate whether the hinge region plays a role in the heparin interaction of the C-terminal domain.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	49	The interaction between apoE and HSPG is important in several processes, such as lipoprotein remnant clearance (5, 43) and neurite outgrowth (3, 14). ApoE has at least two heparin binding sites located between residues 142 and 147 in the N-terminal receptor binding region (24) and less well defined sites in the C-terminal lipid binding region (23, 24). The N-terminal site has recently been characterized using apoE4 22-kDa fragments and an enzymatically prepared heparin oligosaccharide; Arg-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Arg-147 within this site are involved in the interaction with the heparin fragment (27). In this study, using site-directed mutagenesis we identified Lys-233 as a key lysine residue in the C-terminal site and also estimated the relative contributions of both sites to the heparin binding of full-length apoE. Earlier studies using either synthetic apoE peptides or blocking monoclonal antibodies suggested that residues 211-218 (23) and 243-272 (24) contain heparin binding sites. The former site is not a factor in the observed binding of the C-terminal 10-kDa fragment to heparin because it is not included in this domain. It is also not functional in the 12-kDa fragment because this does not bind to heparin (Fig. 6). Presumably, the small peptide containing residues 211-218 (23) can bind because its conformation is different from when it is present as part of the apoE molecule. It is possible that Lys-233 is part of the heparin binding site identified by a blocking antibody with an epitope located between residues 243-272 (24); the presence of the antibody may interfere with the functionality of Lys-233..

Previous studies showed that this greater positive electrostatic potential around Lys-143 and -146 is involved in the high-affinity binding of the N-terminal domain of apoE to the LDL receptor and heparin. In this study, we demonstrated that residue Lys-233 is critical for the heparin binding of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 3), indicating that an unusually basic lysine microenvironment in the C-terminal domain is also involved in the heparin interaction. In an amphipathic -helix spanning this region, the basic residues Arg-226, Lys-233, and Lys-240 are aligned, two turns apart, along one side of the helix. It is interesting that there are several acidic residues in the amino acid sequence near Lys-233, but they are mostly located on the opposite side of the amphipathic -helix. Consequently, they do not reduce the positive electrostatic potential around the side chain of Lys-233..

In the lipid-free state, the 10-kDa fragment binds to heparin with higher affinity than the 22-kDa fragment (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the heparin binding of the 10-kDa fragment was completely abolished when complexed with lipid (Fig. 4B), consistent with previous observations showing that the C-terminal site is only available for interaction in the lipid-free state (24, 44). The C-terminal domain of apoE forms a stable tetramer and is responsible for self-association of apoE in aqueous solution, whereas the N-terminal domain is primarily monomeric (16). Therefore, the stronger interaction of the C-terminal domain with heparin appears to be because of its tetramerization. As shown in Fig. 6, the heparin binding affinity of the apoE3 (1-260) variant, which is monomeric in solution, is much lower than that of wild-type apoE3 and is comparable with that of the 22-kDa fragment, indicating that tetramerization through the C-terminal domain is crucial for the heparin binding ability of the lipid-free apoE. Multiple sequences of heparin binding peptide enhance heparin binding through cooperativity effects (45). Similarly, multiple copies of the receptor binding domain are necessary for the high affinity interaction of apoE with the LDL receptor (46, 47). In this regard, the different binding affinities of full-length apoE3 and the 22-kDa fragment in DMPC discs (Fig. 4B) may be explained by the difference in cooperativity arising from different numbers of the N-terminal domain per particle..

As shown in Fig. 5C, there were only small differences in heparin binding among the lipid-free wild-type apoE3, apoE3(K233Q), and apoE3(K233E) variants, suggesting that, even in the lipid-free state, only the N-terminal site is involved in the heparin interaction of full-length apoE. It is not clear why the C-terminal site of the lipid-free apoE is unavailable to interaction with heparin. One possible explanation is that the heparin interaction of the C-terminal domain is sterically hindered by the hinge region (residues 192-215), which acts as a spacer connecting the two domains. Indeed, the 12-kDa fragment, which contains both the 10-kDa domain and the hinge region, bound defectively to heparin (Fig. 6). Thus, interaction between the 10-kDa domain and the hinge region might mask the C-terminal heparin binding site (the basic residues around Lys-233), preventing interaction with heparin. A recent fluorescence resonance energy transfer study of apoE3 indicates spatial proximity between the N- and the C-terminal domains in the lipid-free state, with the hinge region tethering the N-terminal domain close to the C-terminal domain (48)..

This binding interaction between apoE and biglycan was shown recently to occur via the C-terminal domain in which the charged residues, especially lysine and arginine between residues 223 and 230, are involved in the binding (50, 51). The results of the present study suggest that the unusually basic microenvironment around Lys-233 contributes to the apoE-biglycan interaction. Recent studies demonstrated that C-terminal fragments of apoE are complexed with amyloid in the brain (52, 53) and that C-terminal-truncated forms of apoE occur in Alzheimer's disease (54). The presence of apoE proteolytic fragments in vivo raises the possibility that the C-terminal fragment may contribute to Alzheimer's disease by interaction with HSPG in the brain..

Methods Results Discussion Conclusion References   Background Cross-sectional genetic association studies are now widely employed to look for genes which confer longevity. Such studies are based on two assumptions; (a) initial relative allele frequencies in the different age cohorts are similar, and (b) the risk of mortality conferred by genotypes does not depend on year of birth..
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	4	Methods We explored the validity of these assumptions and reviewed 15 cross-sectional studies of common apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphisms and longevity..
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	5	Results Higher relative 2 frequencies, and lower relative 4 allele frequencies were observed in elderly versus younger populations. If assumptions (a) and (b) were correct the estimates for 2 and 4 alleles respectively versus 3 alleles would be 1.34 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.35) and 0.54 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.63) in elderly versus younger individuals. However, there was an association between relative 4 allele frequency in controls and APOE 4 effect (ss =  to 0.45, 95% CI:  to 0.89, 0.00). In relation to assumption (a) there is substantial variation in relative APOE allele frequencies (4 to 21%), with considerable heterogeneity evident within geographically proximate populations, population admixture is likely to have resulted in changes in allele frequency over time, and assumption (b) APOE related causes of death are context specific and have changed considerably over the last 30 years..

However, specific methodological problems are inherent in studies comparing populations across time periods, which although alluded to in several reviews, have not been adequately addressed in study designs to date.

Methods Results Discussion Conclusion References   Centenarians are quite rare and linkage studies require a relatively large number of long-lived sib pairs together with DNA from sibs who died early to avoid acertainment bias. Ideally DNA would also be available from more than one generation. Genetic association studies are therefore more feasible, and are becoming widely used to look for genes which are important in longevity.5,6.

Candidate genes can be selected from either: (1) those genes implicated in general processes of cellular maintenance and repair, such as superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), which is involved in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis; or (2) genes which confer an increased susceptibility to age-related diseases such as apolipoprotein E (APOE), a gene involved in lipoprotein metabolism and a proposed risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) and Alzheimers disease.7,8 Since most genetic studies of longevity to date have been of the second type, this paper will focus on studies of disease-risk genes..

Whilst genuine differences between elderly cohorts and younger individuals may exist due to the role of genes in longevity, artefactual results of genetic effects may also arise due to variations in initial relative allele frequency between the two comparison groups, as a result of population admixture. Although novel mutations are infrequent and diffuse slowly, because the interval between human generations is long, the gene pool of a given population can change considerably in a relatively short period as a result of geographical mobility, ethnic admixing, and selective mating.10.

More recently migration between countries in Europe has become common as a result of constitutional rights established within the European Union. The scale of movement is substantial. Of respondents to the decennial census in England, 13% of the population of England gave their ethnic origin as other than white British in the 2001, compared with 11% in 1991: an increase of 18% in 10 years.13 Since migration among young adults tends to be for work or education, net inflows are often concentrated in cities, where genetic association studies may be based. In England the highest levels of in-flow are in the South East.14 In central London 25.3% of residents classified themselves as white but not British or Irish in the 2001 census.13 Whilst genetic association studies usually collect data on ethnic group, they rarely distinguish between Caucasians and hence group together individuals with different countries and regions of origin..

Approximately 20% of individuals born in England, Scotland and Wales during 3 to 9 March 1958 resided in a different region in 1981 to that of their birth; this resulted in a reduction in interregional variability in ABO blood groups.15 Migration patterns differ widely between countries and time periods, so the scale of problem will depend on the study population..

By addressing the first assumption we are in effect also addressing this dynamic. Aside from changes in population genetic structure, environmental risk factors for disease have changed considerably during the last 100 years and two populations who were born only a few decades apart are likely to have been exposed to a very different pattern of stressors. For this reason such populations will have different susceptibilities to disease regardless of genotype. Environmental risk factors are unlikely to change the population distribution of genetic variants; unless they offer strong selection against a particular allele in childhood and reproductive years. Therefore secular trends in genetic susceptibility to diseases of the elderly are not confounded by environment, but rather the environment acts as an effect modifier..

Chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer, which occur later in life, then became the major causes of death in developed countries.16 This shift in causes of mortality (the epidemiological transition) occurred over a relatively short period. It has been suggested that the rise in CHD and cancer incidence in Western countries is a consequence of ageing populations. However, the increase in rates of mortality from cancer which took place among men in Britain from 1921 to 1960 can be largely attributed to lung cancer, for which smoking is the main environmental cause.17 Levels of smoking in Britain reached a peak in the 1960s, followed by a steady decline, although approximately 30% of the adult population continue to smoke (Figure 1)16. Similarly, national CHD mortality rates rose and fell during the past century. Deaths from CHD reached a peak in many westernized countries in the 1970s and are now declining (Figure 2).18 Hence disease risks have changed over time, because levels of exposure to major environmental causes have changed..

Deaths from CHD reached a peak in many westernized countries in the 1970s and are now declining (Figure 2).18 Hence disease risks have changed over time, because levels of exposure to major environmental causes have changed..

The protein encoded by this gene is a ligand for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, other receptors in the LDL receptor gene family, and cell matrix-associated heparin sulphate proteoglycans. The gene plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism, and has been shown to be associated with CHD risk.7,19 Three common polymorphic forms of APOE are known to exist: 2, 3, and 4. The various APOE isoforms produced as a result of this polymorphism interact differently with specific lipoprotein receptors, ultimately altering circulating levels of cholesterol. High LDL cholesterol levels are associated with APOE 4 and low levels with APOE 2, with APOE 3 levels being intermediate between the two.19 The APOE 4 allele has also been associated with an increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease.8 Although the mechanism is not entirely clear, this association could be due to: (1) effects on amyloid-ss metabolism, (2) effects on neurons or glial cells, including neuronal survival and neurite extension, or (3) effects related to atherosclerosis, cerebral blood flow, or the blood to brain barrier.19 Since CHD and Alzheimer's disease are common disease of old age, APOE has become a candidate gene for studies of longevity. Several studies comparing APOE genotypes in elderly versus younger populations have been carried out20 to 34 and an overview of the literature by Gerdes et al.28 found APOE 4 to be associated with premature death..

Methods Results Discussion Conclusion References   We have reviewed 15 cross-sectional studies of APOE polymorphisms and longevity to determine whether two key methodological assumptions have been addressed. The studies provide direct evidence that size of the genetic effect of interest is sensitive to the relative allele frequency among controls, and that relative APOE 4 allele frequency exhibits wide variation between and within proximate populations. Our inference is that initial allele frequencies are likely to differ between the age cohorts from which the compared groups are drawn, and that assumption (a) is generally invalid. Further, the biology and epidemiology of presumed APOE-related diseases, in particular the great variation in coronary death rates by time and place, provides indirect evidence that the mortality risk conferred by APOE genotype depends on interaction with environmental and behavioural risk factors over the life course. The pattern of these exposures is closely related to the year of birth, and thus assumption (b) is likely to be invalid when gene to environment interaction is important, as is the case for APOE..

However, in the case of APOE 4 it is clear that allele frequencies differ widely by population, even among neighbouring countries and between geographically separated populations within the same country, for example between Lapps and Finns.40 While migration patterns differ by country, there has been substantial internal and international migration in many countries within the last 100 years.41 These factors are likely to have produced differences in APOE allele frequency by age group within a given geographical area over recent decades. Migration is particularly prevalent among younger populations and in large university cities,14 where most of these studies were carried out. Whilst almost all studies showed that there was a deficit of APOE 4 alleles in elderly versus younger populations, heterogeneity in effect size remained, even when populations were stratified by region..

Migration and population substructure may confound such studies. If relative allele frequencies in control populations overestimate the initial relative allele frequencies in the elderly group a spurious estimate of the longevity effect will be obtained. Migration is likely to change relative allele frequencies substantially when the source and recipient populations have very different allele frequencies. Because changes in allele frequency in the short term are a function of the difference in frequency and migration rate, large differences can be seen in just one generation.43 Net immigration from regions with relatively high allele frequency will overestimate the decrease in 4 in the elderly relative to controls. Conversely net immigration from areas with relatively low allele frequency will underestimate the difference. For example in the Canadian study20 the relative APOE 4 allele frequency in the control group was 15.2%. If this represents the allele frequency in the elderly population at birth, 0.53 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.88) is a good estimate for the link between APOE 4 and longevity. However, 19% of current Canadian residents were not born in Canada.41 If migrants came from countries with relatively high allele frequencies of 31% as reported among Lapps,44 migration would result in an overestimation of the real initial relative allele frequency 11.5% and the true 4 effect will be closer to the null 0.76 (95% CI: 0.44, 1.30). Alternatively, if migrants came from countries or areas of low APOE 4 frequency (frequencies of 5% have been reported in Sardinians)45 the real initial frequency would have been higher at around 17.6% and the 4 effect will be around 0.45 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.72). This simple example of international migration occurring within one generation does not take account of second generation migrants born in Canada or internal migration. While it involves somewhat unrealistic assumptions about migration patterns, the example does offer some insight into how migration may influence results from genetic association studies of longevity..

The papers reviewed here focus on a single, genetic effect (the main effect of APOE on longevity) and represent early attempts to develop a genetic perspective in a field that has been dominated by environmental explanations. For example, we know that environment, in the broad sense, including behavioural factors, is essential in understanding time trends in both CHD rates (Figure 2) and longevity. What is not known is whether single common genetic variations, such as the APOE polymorphism, are important factors that add to the explanation provided by conventional environmental risk factors. Studies of APOE and longevity reviewed here, which consistently showed an effect of 2 and 4 alleles on longevity, suggest that APOE may have a part to play. However, analyses taking simultaneous account of genetic and environmental factors are needed to address this question..

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	68	   Conclusion Top Abstract Approaches to studying the... Methods Results Discussion Conclusion References   Our review leads us to the following conclusions in relation to the validity of assumptions (a) and (b).
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	69	Assumption (a) Initial relative allele frequencies in the different age groups are similar This assumption may not hold when there is considerable variation in allele frequencies by population, and when migration has resulted in changes in population substructure..
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	70	Assumption (b) The risk of mortality conferred by genotype does not depend on year of birth. This assumption may be invalid when mortality risk conferred by a genotype depends on interaction with environmental or behavioural risk factors, and when the pattern of exposure to such risk factors is closely related to year of birth..

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	72	Whilst the studies reviewed here do provide some evidence of a link between APOE and longevity, the problem is that the size of effect depends on the population in question and probably also the time period that the study spans. The link between the size of APOE effect and relative allele frequency seen in this review is likely to be a result of population differences in underlying disease susceptibility or changes in population structure over time and illustrates the impact of violating the above assumptions..

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	74	Future case-control type studies could be improved by at least including comprehensive data on birth origins and exposure to potential confounding factors. It is also possible to address concerns about population stratification in case-control studies, by carrying out genome analysis using methods such as genomic control and structured association.48.

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	76	Cohort studies are not subject to the above assumptions, and hence are preferable to a cross-sectional design. Participants can be selected and followed up over a given time period, during which they will be subject to the same age-related mortality rate. The cohort studies carried out to date, which have looked at APOE and longevity, tend to have short follow-up periods (typically 5 years),49 to 56 hence they only provide a snapshot of overall survival. These studies have reported mixed results, with some documenting null findings for APOE 4 and longevity,50,51 and others showing negative associations in subgroups only.54 to 56 To address this question adequately cohort studies, ideally birth cohorts, with a long follow-up are required..

Population admixture may result in considerable population changes in allele frequency over time, if allele frequencies differ substantially by population and if migration is high. Mortality risk conferred by genotypes may differ if the gene in question interacts with environmental factors, which vary by time and place. Studies of apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 and longevity show that effect size estimates are associated with relative allele frequency in control populations, hence accurately predicting the impact of APOE on longevity depends on the validity of assumption (a). APOE is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, and this is one mechanism proposed to explain the association of APOE with longevity. However, CHD mortality has decreased mortaliy in the last 30 years, largely due to environmental and behavioural factors, hence the effect of APOE on longevity is context dependent..

In vitro, apoE, and in particular its apoE4 isoform, can bind to and promote fibrillogenesis of the amyloid A peptide, the main constituent of senile plaques. These findings, together with the strong genetic association between late onset AD and the E4 allele of apoE, have strengthened the hypothesis that apoE may have a central role in the pathogenesis of AD by modulating A cerebral accumulation. However, apoE immunoreactivity is present in all cerebral and systemic amyloidoses tested, and tryptic apoE fragments have been identified in association with amyloid A (AA). In order to further elucidate the interaction between apoE and amyloids, we purified AA and amyloid L (AL) fibrils from patients with familial Mediterranean fever and primary amyloidosis, respectively, and studied the association of apoE with AA and AL proteins. In each case, apoE fragments, detected by Western blot, co-purified with the amyloid fibrils. Microsequencing analysis identified COOH-terminal fragments of apoE, similar to the 10-kDa fragment produced by thrombin digestion that contains the purported binding region to A. In vitro co-incubation of AA with purified human apoE resulted in the formation of an SDS-resistant AAapoE complex and a higher degree of polymerization of the AA peptide. These findings and similar results obtained from AD senile plaques suggest that 1) the carboxyl-terminal fragment of apoE is complexed to amyloid fibrils and resists proteolysis in vivo and 2) apoE may promote amyloidogenesis through a conformation-dependent interaction regardless of the primary structure of the amyloid precursors..

In spite of their biochemical diversity, amyloid proteins adopt a common secondary structure, the -pleated sheet, and form fibrils of similar morphology. These fibrils are characteristically long straight filaments 5-12 nm wide that share the tinctorial properties of green birefringence after Congo red staining and specific affinity for fluorescent dyes such as Thioflavine S or T. In addition to these features shared by most types of amyloids, there are several factors consistently associated with this pathological condition that can be viewed as part of the biochemical setting in which amyloid deposition arises and develops. These include elevated concentration of amyloid precursors in fluids and tissues and the invariable presence of certain amyloid-associated proteins of which amyloid P-component (AP)()(1, 2) , sulfated proteoglycans (3, 4, 5) , apolipoprotein E (apoE) (6, 7) and apolipoprotein J (8) are the most notorious. Whether these amyloid-associated proteins play an active role by promoting or inhibiting amyloidogenesis or are inert bystanders is at present unknown..

The recently reported association between certain apoE genetic isoforms and Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition characterized by the massive deposition in the brain of the 39-44-residue amyloid -protein (A)(13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18) , has strengthened the hypothesis that this apolipoprotein may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of this cerebral amyloidosis(19, 20) . Moreover, in vitro binding experiments using human apoE isolated from plasma or recombinant human apoE with synthetic peptides homologous to A have shown that these two proteins can form an SDS-resistant complex with A and promote A fibril formation in vitro(21, 22, 23, 24) . These lines of evidence, together with the immunohistochemical colocalization of apoE and A in the senile plaques and its presence in the intraneuronal amyloid of neurofibrillary tangles(6) , suggest that apoE may play an active role in the pathogenesis of AD by promoting fibrillogenesis. However, immunohistochemical studies have shown that apoE is tightly associated with other types of cerebral amyloidosis, including Down syndrome related to A, hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy of Icelandic type, related to a cystatin C variant, and spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob, kuru, and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease that are associated with the prion amyloid(6, 7, 25) . Furthermore, apoE has been immunohistochemically identified within amyloid deposits in systemic forms of the disease such as secondary amyloidosis and familial Mediterranean fever related to amyloid A, immunoglobulin-related primary amyloidosis (AL), and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy due to deposition of transthyretin genetic variants(7) . Noteworthy, apoE is rarely detected in the nonfibrillar monoclonal deposits of light chain deposition disease and light and heavy chain deposition disease, which may be considered preamyloid forms of AL disease(26) ..

Briefly, 20 g of spleen tissue were homogenized in 0.15 M sodium chloride and centrifuged at 8,000 g for 30 min at 4  degrees C, and the supernatant was discarded. This procedure was repeated until the supernatant had an absorbance of less than 0.075 at 280 nm. Then the insoluble residue was homogenized in distilled water and centrifuged at 8,000 g at 4  degrees C for 1 h. The amyloid fibrils that appear as a mucoid mass in the upper layer were dialyzed against water and lyophilized. After lyophilization, AA protein was purified on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (see below). AL fibrils were solubilized in 3 ml of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 M Tris, 0.17 M dithiothreitol, pH 10.2 and stirred for 48 h at room temperature. Then 1 ml of 2 M guanidine hydrochloride, 4 M acetic acid was added, and the solution was applied to a column (2.5 180 cm) consisting of 1:1 (wt) Sephadex G-75 and Sephadex G-100 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), equilibrated with 5 M guanidine hydrochloride, 1 M acetic acid. AL amyloid fragments isolated by size exclusion chromatography and AA fibrils were subjected to reverse phase chromatography on a Deltapak C column (0.78 30 cm, Waters) with a gradient of 30-80% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2.5. The column eluents were monitored at 214 nm, and protein peaks were pooled and lyophilized..

In addition, minor bands of approximately 8-9 kDa were present in fractions C and D (Fig. 2b). Western blot analysis of the same fractions using anti-apoE antibody and visualized by chemiluminescence detection revealed a major band at 8-9 kDa and a minor 24-kDa component in fraction D (Fig. 2c). The failure to detect apoE by direct amino-terminal sequence analysis of RAM fraction D, despite the positive apoE immunoreactivity of this fraction, indicated that it was present in a very low concentration. Therefore, the HPLC fractions A, B, C, and D were run on SDS-Tricine gels and transferred to Immobilon membrane, and the bands were excised and subjected to amino-terminal sequence analysis. Amino-terminal sequence of the 8-9-kDa component of fraction C revealed that it was a fragment of AL starting at position 1 (not shown).

A major protein band of 6-8 kDa was present in all the fractions, and a minor 16-kDa component, which may be a polymer of the 6-8-kDa peptide, was detected in fractions B and C (Fig. 4b). Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the HPLC fractions revealed only one residue per cycle. The sequence was identical to serum amyloid A protein (Fig. 3). No additional sequences were identified. When the same fractions were subjected to Western blot using anti-apoE antibody, the fluorogram revealed a broad band at 8-9 kDa in fraction D (Fig. 4c). Immunoreactivity of this band was completely suppressed after adsorption of the antiserum with purified human apoE, reflecting the specificity of the reaction.

Under nondenaturing conditions in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, this complex resulted in a shift of the electrophoretic mobility of apoE (Fig. 5b). No complex formation was detected when apoE was incubated with 20  microg of ubiquitin. The influence of apoE upon AA polymerization was evaluated by detection of the apoE-AA incubation mixture with an anti-AA antibody on Western blots. AA alone incubated for 6 h at room temperature in 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4, showed mainly monomeric forms and minor polymeric components after SDS-PAGE. In contrast, AA co-incubated with apoE at a 1:85 molar ratio (apoE:amyloid) under the same conditions as above resulted in the appearance on the gel of a higher amount of AA dimers, trimers, tetramers, and higher molecular weight components (Fig. 5c). AA co-incubated with BSA showed no increment in polymerization when compared with AA alone (not shown). When the same experiment was done using RAM AL, no additional bands were present. However, most of the amyloid-apoE incubation mixture remained on top of the stacking and running gels as very high molecular weight components (not shown). This result is consistent with a higher degree of aggregation of amyloid AL subunits in the presence of apoE that resisted denaturation by SDS treatment..

A similar interaction between apoE and A of the Dutch variant of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a rare form of familial AD, has also been documented (36) (details of apoE-A binding will be published elsewhere). By using a set of truncated recombinants, the purported binding region to A has been located within the carboxyl-end of apoE between amino acids 244 and 272 (21) . Our findings suggest that the binding of this region to A is not specific for this peptide but rather reflects a hydrophobic interaction between apoE carboxyl end and a common conformation shared by different amyloids.

Possibly, other exchangeable apolipoproteins sharing similar amphipathic helices can also have amyloid-apolipoprotein interactions. It is noteworthy that genetic variants of apoAI can form amyloid in certain hereditary forms of human amyloidosis (38, 39) and that SAA, the precursor of AA, is itself an apolipoprotein associated to high density lipoprotein(40) . We recently found that apoAI can bind to A and promote A fibrillogenesis in vitro.()Presumably, in the same way that there is a large number of amyloidogenic precursor proteins that can end as insoluble amyloid fibrils, there is also a group of amyloidogenic apolipoproteins and acute phase reactants that can actively participate in this process either as constituents of fibrils or as modulators of fibrillogenesis..

A similar interaction between apoE and A of the Dutch variant of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a rare form of familial AD, has also been documented (36) (details of apoE-A binding will be published elsewhere). By using a set of truncated recombinants, the purported binding region to A has been located within the carboxyl-end of apoE between amino acids 244 and 272 (21) . Our findings suggest that the binding of this region to A is not specific for this peptide but rather reflects a hydrophobic interaction between apoE carboxyl end and a common conformation shared by different amyloids.

The molar ratios of apoE and AA used in our in vitro experiments are opposite of those found in plasma in normal conditions for apoE and SAA. However, SAA is an acute phase reactant, and its concentration in plasma is capable of rising 1000-fold during tissue injury or inflammation(41) . AL, in turn, is derived from monoclonal light chains, which are known to have very high levels in the circulation in most of the cases. Therefore, we believe that the concentrations that we used in vitro can resemble more closely the pathological conditions in which amyloidosis develops than the physiological levels of apoE and amyloid precursors..

The absence of apoE and AP in the nonfibrillar, Congo red negative monoclonal deposits of light chain deposition disease and light and heavy chain deposition disease, which are considered preamyloid forms of AL disease(26) , suggests that apoE and AP may be essential catalysts for the modulation of the amyloid generation process. The interaction between apoE and amyloids may also be influenced by other local acute phase reactants such as proteoglycans to which both amyloid precursors and apoE are known to bind(42, 43) . In spite of this putative widespread role of apoE in amyloid formation, it seems likely that a certain specificity exists between some of the amyloid precursors and apoE genetic isoforms. Thus far, no preferential associations between systemic amyloidoses and apoE isoforms have been reported; however, the genetic association of AD with apoE4 and the in vitro higher avidity of this isoform for A may reflect such specificity(19, 21) . Alternatively, the apoE4 isoform may participate in the pathogenesis of AD through a different pathway unrelated to A formation or deposition..

This apparent discrepancy with previous studies could be due to different experimental conditions(22, 23, 24, 36) . However, it raises the intriguing possibility that apoE may have a dual effect upon fibrillogenesis in vivo depending on the local concentrations of both apoE and amyloid precursors in sites of amyloid formation. Within physiological levels, apoE may have a protective role on amyloid formation by sequestering soluble amyloid precursors, as has been postulated for A(44) . However, A appears to be associated to other apolipoproteins (i.e. apolipoprotein J) in biological fluids in vivo(45) . Yet, in tissues in which local membrane repair and lipid turnover are increased, such as after cell injury, apoE is overexpressed and can reach higher concentrations than those found normally in the circulation(10, 11, 12, 46) . Under these circumstances, apoE may have a substantially different effect upon its association with amyloid precursors. In this pathological setting, several other factors may affect apoE behavior, such as its state of oxidation, lipid association, the presence of other amyloid/apoE binding proteins, and the stage of the amyloid process(47) ..

In the majority of these pedigrees, PS-1 and [beta]-amyloid precursor protein ([beta]APP) gene mutations had been excluded. While no additional PS-2 pathogenic mutations were detected, four silent nucleotide substitutions and alternative splicing of nucleotides 1338-1340 (Glu325) were observed. Analysis of additional members of a pedigree known to segregate a Met239Val mutation in PS-2 revealed that the age of onset of symptoms is highly variable (range 45-88 years). This variability is not attributable to differences in ApoE genotypes. These results suggest (i) that, in contrast to mutations in PS-1, mutations in PS-2 are a relatively rare cause of FAD; (ii) that other genetic or environmental factors modify the AD phenotype associated with PS-2 mutations; and (iii) that still other FAD susceptibility genes remain to be identified.

Analysis of a number of large data sets have revealed that missense mutations in the presenilin I (PS-1) gene are a frequent cause of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), accounting for perhaps as much as 50% of all cases of early onset FAD (1 ,2 ,4 -6 ). In order to determine the frequency of mutations in the presenilin II (PS-2) gene, we undertook a survey for mutations in the open reading frame (ORF) of the PS-2 gene in 60 pedigrees with FAD. The disease in these families was characterized by the occurrence of AD consistent with the NINDS-ADRDA criteria in at least three closely related subjects, often in more than one generation. In these pedigrees, the age at onset (range: 35-82 years; 36 with mean age at onset  < = 64 years; 14 with mean age at onset  > = 65 years; 10 with insufficient reliable data on age at onset) overlapped that observed in the pedigrees with known PS-2 mutations (onset between 45 and 72 years). To determine the penetrance of PS-2 mutations, we also examined several additional members of the FLO10 pedigree previously described with the Met239Val missense mutation in the PS-2 gene (2 ). Our data suggest that missense mutations in the PS-2 gene are a rare cause of AD and that these missense mutations may be subject to the modifying action of other genes or environmental influences.

A review of clinical data on additional members of the extended pedigree also uncovered two other subjects in the direct lineage of the family who had either historical evidence for late onset AD (subject I-2, the affected grandfather of III-20 who died at 75 years with dementia) or who currently have clinical features consistent with probable AD using the NINDS-ADRDA criteria (subject III-39 onset at 88 years). We and others have previously reported that the genotype at the Apolipoprotein E gene can modulate the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with the Val717Ile mutation in [beta]APP (7 ,8 ). However, in the FLO10 family with the Met239Val mutation in PS-2, ApoE genotypes do not correlate with age of onset (Table 1 ). Thus, the very elderly symptomatic subject III-20 (onset 84 years) has the same ApoE genotype ([epsilon]3/[epsilon]3) as three other affected carriers of the Met239Val mutation, all of whom developed symptoms at a younger age (onset 45-72 years). Moreover, the affected carrier IV-21, with the ApoE genotype of [epsilon]3/[epsilon]4 developed symptoms at an age (48 years) similar to that of his affected sibling IV-18 with an ApoE genotype of [epsilon]3/[epsilon]3 (onset = 45 years) (Table 1 , Fig. 1 ). Our sample size is too small to draw reliable conclusions about the presence or absence of interactions between the ApoE genotype and the Asn141Ile mutation (Table 1 )..

We can confidently exclude mutations in intronic sequences associated with RNA splice sites [indeed only one such mutation which affects splicing of exon 10 of PS-1 has been found in FAD affected subjects (T. Miki et al., in preparation)]. However, until the 5' UTR and 3' UTR sequences have been searched for pathogenic mutations, we cannot exclude the formal possibility that mutations might exist in these sequences in some of our pedigrees. Nevertheless, there are two corollaries to the conclusion that PS-2 ORF mutations are rare. First, unless a phenotype uniquely associated with or at least enriched in subjects with PS-2 mutants can be found, screening programs for mutations in the ORF of PS-2 are likely to have a low yield. Second, and more importantly, other as yet unidentified FAD susceptibility loci must exist..

0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	19	The other conclusion to be drawn from our data is that the age of symptom onset in subjects with PS-2 mutations is generally older (45-88 years) than that observed for most PS-1 mutations (25-65 years), and is highly variable even amongst affected members of the same pedigree. This contrasts sharply with the experience with PS-1 mutations, where the age of onset is generally quite similar amongst affected members of the same family, and often amongst members of different families with the same mutation (1 ,2 ,4 -6 ). Because to date all subjects with AD in the FLO10 pedigree have inherited the Met239Val mutation, it is unlikely that the late onset cases represent phenocopies and/or that it represents a polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with a nearby pathogenic mutation. Consequently, the most parsimonious explanation is that there is a single cause of the disease (the Met239Val mutation) and that the phenotype is modified by other genetic or environmental factors. The limited number of subjects with the Asn141Ile mutation in our data set prevents rigorous conclusions about any interactions between the ApoE genotype and this mutation. However, analysis of a larger data set by T. Bird and G. Schellenberg also reveals no obvious interaction between the genotypes at ApoE and PS-2 Asn141Ile (manuscript in preparation). This absence of a close correlation between the ApoE genotype and age of symptom onset in subjects with PS-2 mutation has two implications. First, in view of parallel observations showing no apparent interaction between ApoE genotype and mutations in PS-1 (7 ,9 ,10 ), together with the structural and amino acid sequence similarities of the PS-1 and PS-2 proteins (1 -3 ), it is likely that the functional effect of PS-1 and PS-2 mutations are similar and are either remote from the functional effect of the ApoE [epsilon]4 allele, or affect a biochemical pathway leading to AD which is different from that influenced by ApoE [epsilon]4. Second, the variation in age of onset in PS-2 mutation carriers argues that other modifying environmental or genetic factors (e.g. other polymorphisms within the presenilin genes or differences in other genes) must exist. The nature of these other factors remains to be determined. However, if these modifying factors can be identified, they might be exploitable as a therapeutic tool. MATERIALS AND METHODS.

Epidemiology studies show that estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) decreases the morbidity from several chronic neurological diseases. Alleles of ApoE modify the risk for and progression of the same diseases. ApoE levels in the rodent brain vary during the estrous cycle and increase after 17ss-estradiol administration. Both estradiol and ApoE3, the most common isoform of human ApoE, increase the extent of neurite outgrowth in culture. Combined, these observations suggest a common mechanism whereby estrogen may increase ApoE levels to facilitate neurite growth. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the effects of estradiol and ApoE isoforms on neurite outgrowth in cultured adult mouse cortical neurons. Estradiol increased ApoE levels and neurite outgrowth. ApoE2 increased neurite length more so than ApoE3 in the presence of estradiol. Estradiol had no effect on neurite outgrowth from mice lacking the ApoE gene or when only ApoE4, the isoform of ApoE that is associated with increased risk of neurological disease, was exogenously supplied. Cultures from mice transgenic for human ApoE3 or ApoE4 showed the same isoform-specific effect. Neuronal internalization of recombinant human ApoE3 was greater than ApoE4, and ApoE3 was more effective than ApoE4 in facilitating neuronal uptake of a fatty acid. We conclude that estradiol facilitates neurite growth through an ApoE-dependent mechanism. The effects of ERT on chronic neurological diseases may vary with ApoE genotype. The clinical use of ERT may require ApoE genotyping for optimal efficacy..

Humans have three major isoforms of ApoE (ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4) that are produced by three alleles, 2, 3, and 4, at a single gene locus on chromosome 19 (15, 16). Inheritance of 4 increases the risk and rate of progression of late-onset Alzheimer disease (17, 18, 19). Individuals with 4 alleles also appear to have an earlier age of onset of PD and a greater risk of developing dementia in PD (20, 21). Additionally, 4 inheritance increases the risk of developing dementia after head trauma (22, 23, 24) and increases the severity of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (25, 26)..

The entire cerebral cortex was dissected from the brain and placed in 2 ml B27/Hibernate A medium (B27/HA, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) with 0.5 mM glutamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 4 C. The cortex was sliced (0.5 mm thickness) and transferred to a 50-ml tube containing 5 ml B27/HA. After warming for 8 min at 30 C, slices were digested with 6 ml of a 2 mg/ml papain (Sigma) solution in B27/HA for 30 min at 30 C in a gyrating water bath. The slices were transferred to 2 ml B27/HA. After 2 min at room temperature, the slices were triturated 10 times with a siliconized 9-inch Pasteur pipette, and allowed to settle for 1 min. Approximately 2 ml of the supernatant were transferred to another tube, and the sediment resuspended in 2 ml B27/HA. The above step was repeated twice, and a total of 6 ml collected. The resultant supernatant was subjected to density gradient centrifugation at 800 x g for 15 min. The density gradient was prepared in four 1-ml layers of 35, 25, 20, and 15% Optiprep (Invitrogen Life Technologies) in B27/HA medium (vol/vol). Debris above 7 ml was discarded. The rest of the fractions, excluding the bottom pellet, were collected and diluted in 5 ml of B27/HA.

The entire cerebral cortex was dissected from the brain and placed in 2 ml B27/Hibernate A medium (B27/HA, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) with 0.5 mM glutamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 4 C. The cortex was sliced (0.5 mm thickness) and transferred to a 50-ml tube containing 5 ml B27/HA. After warming for 8 min at 30 C, slices were digested with 6 ml of a 2 mg/ml papain (Sigma) solution in B27/HA for 30 min at 30 C in a gyrating water bath. The slices were transferred to 2 ml B27/HA. After 2 min at room temperature, the slices were triturated 10 times with a siliconized 9-inch Pasteur pipette, and allowed to settle for 1 min. Approximately 2 ml of the supernatant were transferred to another tube, and the sediment resuspended in 2 ml B27/HA. The above step was repeated twice, and a total of 6 ml collected. The resultant supernatant was subjected to density gradient centrifugation at 800 x g for 15 min. The density gradient was prepared in four 1-ml layers of 35, 25, 20, and 15% Optiprep (Invitrogen Life Technologies) in B27/HA medium (vol/vol). Debris above 7 ml was discarded.

Because ApoE transfers lipids to neurons by endocytosis, we tested the rate of uptake of exogenous ApoE and lipid by neurons in cultures derived from ApoE KO mice. We examined both the rate of ApoE uptake and the rate at which a fatty acid was transported into cultured neurons. Cultures at 4 DIV from ApoE KO mice were incubated for 1 h with recombinant human ApoE3 or human ApoE4, and then prepared for immunocytochemical localization of ApoE. Coverslips were fixed with 80% ethanol for 1 h at RT, rinsed three times in T-TBS [0.2% Tween in 20 mM TBS (pH 7.5)] then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton in PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.2) for 30 min. Coverslips were then rinsed three times in T-TBS. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% BSA in 15% ApoE KO mouse serum in T-TBS for 1 h at RT and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a goat anti-ApoE antibody (Chemicon) at 1:200 dilution. After washing six times with T-TBS the coverslips were incubated with fluorescently labeled antigoat antisera (Pierce) for 30 min at 1:200 dilution and then washed five times in T-TBS for 5 min each. Control coverslips were incubated at 4 C. Coverslips were mounted with anti-photobleach medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and stored in the dark. Digital images of 30 fields per coverslip (x40 objective) containing neurons were obtained using a fluorescence microscope with an excitation frequency of 520 nm and emission at 492 nm with a digital camera (Pixera, Penguin 150CL) maintaining identical exposure settings for all images. ApoE immunofluorescence was measured by quantifying mean optical fluorescence of each field using Scion Image software. The upper and lower 20 bits were cut off to eliminate nonspecific fluorescence and a mean density of pixels/field within this range were obtained. The data were transformed to a scale of 0 to 100 for statistical analysis..

ANOVA found an overall significance of estradiol concentration on ApoE levels (F5,12 = 260.546; P  <  0.001). Post hoc testing with a Bonferroni corrected t test showed each higher dose of estradiol significantly increased ApoE levels from the lower dose except that 100 pM was not different from 1 pM of estradiol. A dose of 1 nM of estrogen exhibited the highest response of ApoE levels. A 10-nM concentration of estrogen had a significantly smaller effect on ApoE levels than 1 pM to 1 nM of estradiol. Normal female mouse estradiol concentrations are between 10 and 80 pM throughout the estrous cycle (42). Hence, these data suggest that a physiological concentration of estradiol had the greatest effect, and that a supraphysiologic concentration was less effective..

ApoE2 did not differ from ApoE3 on post hoc t testing. These data replicate previous results (32, 33). Analysis of the estradiol-only group also showed an isoform-specific effect (F3,8 = 700.702, P  <  0.001). Bonferroni corrected post hoc t testing showed that combined neurite length in the KO group was equivalent to the ApoE4 replacement group and was less than the ApoE2 (P  <  0.001) or ApoE3 (P  <  0.002) replacement group. Estradiol increased neuritic length when combined with ApoE2 (+95%) or ApoE3 (+79%) but not in the absence of ApoE or treatment with ApoE4. Post hoc t testing found the difference between ApoE2 and ApoE3 significant (P  <  0.003).

Post hoc t testing found the difference between ApoE2 and ApoE3 significant (P  <  0.003). In sum, estradiol increased neurite outgrowth, but only in the presence of ApoE2 or ApoE3 and estradiol had a greater effect on neurite growth in the presence of ApoE2 when compared with ApoE3..

Generally, these effects increase survival or process extension. The general assumption of these studies is that there is only a direct effect of estradiol on neuronal activation and growth. This assumption may be too simplistic. Our data suggest that ApoE plays an important role in neuronal activation and growth stimulated by estradiol..

Therefore, we selected a mixed culture derived from adult mouse brain to evaluate estradiol effects on ApoE levels and neuronal process growth. Adult cortical neuronal cultures contain both microglia and astroglia early in the culture. Our previous study showed that neurons comprise 70% of total cells, astroglia 15% and microglia 15% at 4 DIV (33). Glial-derived factors are important in synaptogenesis (see Ref. 48) and inclusion of glia in the culture may be required to see a broader spectrum of the effects of estrogen on neurons in vitro. For example, a previous report has shown that both microglia and astroglia must be present to obtain an estrogen-induced increase in ApoE mRNA (38). Hence, a monotypic cell culture may give a biased interpretation of critical estradiol effects if interactions exist between glia and neurons..

We found that a physiological concentration of estradiol had a maximal effect on both ApoE levels and neurite outgrowth. Our data also suggest a synergistic effect between estradiol and ApoE such that estradiol effects on neurite outgrowth are facilitated by ApoE3 but not by ApoE4. ApoE3 alone increased neurite extent by about 30%. But when combined with estradiol, neuritic growth increased by 70 to 80%. In addition, ApoE2 was significantly more effective than ApoE3 in facilitating neurite outgrowth in the presence of estradiol. This effect corresponds to studies that suggest a protective effect of ApoE2 in dementia (see Ref. 51). In addition, the differential effects of ApoE3 vs. ApoE4 were confirmed by using tg mice expressing ApoE3 or ApoE4.

The procedure used for preparing adult cultures strips cell processes. During the next 4 d, extensive neurite sprouting occurs. Estradiol may stimulate neurons to extend processes and concurrently stimulate astroglia (and perhaps microglia) to produce ApoE. Glial-derived ApoE supplies lipids for neuronal membrane synthesis and function. Our receptor inhibition studies suggest that both ApoE3 and ApoE4 are using low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and HSPG for neurite outgrowth (33, 49). However, neuronal growth is slowed or disrupted in the absence of ApoE or in the presence of ApoE4. It is worth noting that ApoE4 has been reported to show toxic effects in culture (52) and disrupt microtubule polymerization although at 10-fold higher concentrations of those used in this study (32). Hence, the less complex neuritic field seen in the cells incubated with ApoE4 may represent a deficiency of lipid in combination with toxic effects of ApoE4..

Cholesterol efflux from macrophages to apoE has been shown to decrease foam cell formation and prevent atherosclerosis. An apoE molecule can mediate cholesterol efflux from the macrophage that originally secreted it (autocrine effect) or from surrounding macrophages (paracrine effect). Traditional methodologies have not been able to separate these serial effects. The novel methodology presented here was developed to separate autocrine and paracrine effects by using a simple mathematical model to interpret the effects of dilution on apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux. Our results show that, at very dilute concentrations, the paracrine effect of apoE is not evident and the autocrine effect becomes the dominant mediator of efflux. However, at saturating concentrations, paracrine apoE causes 80 to 90% of the apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux, whereas autocrine apoE is responsible for the remaining 10 to 20%. These results suggest that the relative importance of autocrine and paracrine apoE depends on the size of the local distribution volume, a factor not considered in previous in vitro studies of apoE function. Furthermore, autocrine effects of apoE could be critical in the prevention of foam cell formation in vivo. This novel methodology may be applicable to other types of mixed autocrine/paracrine systems, such as signal transduction systems..

0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	6	AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE in atherosclerosis research is the characterization of the effects of locally synthesized apolipoprotein E (apoE) within the vessel wall. Endogenous synthesis and secretion of apoE by macrophages in the vessel wall have been shown to protect against atherosclerosis (22). Arterial macrophages participate in inflammation, tissue remodeling, and lipid metabolism. ApoE, which is synthesized by hepatocytes, adipocytes, and macrophages, mediates lipoprotein metabolism and affects cellular cholesterol homeostasis. apoE from macrophages accepts cholesterol from cells in the vessel wall and transports it back to the liver, where the cholesterol can be excreted as bile (3, 9). This pathway is called the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) system. The effect of apoE can be due to its cellular or extracellular positioning, and therefore an apoE molecule can mediate cholesterol efflux from the macrophage that originally secreted it (autocrine effect) or from surrounding macrophages (paracrine effect). The terms "autocrine" and "paracrine," traditionally applied to signaling peptides and hormones, have also been used to describe the actions of mediators with a broad range of functions besides signal transduction (1, 7, 25). It can be assumed that for the sake of cholesterol efflux an individual macrophage cannot distinguish the apoE that it secretes from the apoE derived from neighboring cells. However, because the endogenous synthesis of apoE causes high spatial proximity, autocrine apoE is at an advantage compared with paracrine apoE. The spatial proximity advantage of endogenous apoE results in a temporal sequence of autocrine effects occurring before paracrine effects and a concentration gradient from an autocrine compartment (high concentration) to a paracrine compartment (low concentration)..

For in vitro experiments with cultured macrophages, exogenously applied apoE has been used to approximate paracrine or endocrine apoE (14, 19). Endogenously synthesized apoE has been used to approximate autocrine apoE (16, 19 to 21). These approximations do not consider that a single molecule of an endogenously synthesized mediator can have a series of interactions that employ a combination of autocrine and paracrine mechanisms (4)..

Whereas macrophage apoE is used to demonstrate this novel methodology, the concepts have applications for separating the autocrine and paracrine effects of many other secreted biological mediators including growth factors, cytokines, and carrier proteins..

0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	34	Volume dependence theory. To manipulate the extracellular concentration of an endogenously synthesized biological mediator, the volume dependence theory takes advantage of the implicit relationship between concentration and distribution volume. The concentration of a secreted mediator such as apoE is proportional to the reciprocal of the extracellular distribution volume. Increasing the distribution volume (V) causes a decrease in the relative concentration (V to 1) of the secreted mediator. Varying the extracellular volume of a given number of cells (Fig. 1A) allows the juxtacellular and extracellular mechanisms of the synthesized mediator to be mathematically separated and characterized. This theory can be illustrated graphically as follows. For a plot of the biological effect (E) vs. extracellular volume (V), as the extracellular volume is increased, the effect decreases asymptotically to a plateau that represents the portion of the total effect that is independent of the extracellular volume (Fig. 1B). The value of this plateau is the y-intercept (b) of a plot of the biological effect (E) vs. reciprocal volume (V to 1) (Fig. 1C). This dose-response curve is linear at low relative concentrations (V to 1) and fits the linear equation:.

0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	58	Our study suggests that autocrine apoE has advantages that are biologically relevant. Even when the extracellular space is saturated with apoE, at least 10 to 20% of the apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux is the result of volume-independent interactions of endogenous apoE (Table 1). Lin et al. (19) found that with apoE-deficient cells, the exogenous application of apoE at 10 times the concentration of normal endogenous apoE secretion did not increase cholesterol efflux as much as normal endogenous apoE secretion by apoE-producing cells. The fundamental importance of these media transfer studies is that they show that exogenous apoE (paracrine) is not equivalent to endogenous apoE (autocrine and paracrine). For a macrophage with endogenously synthesized apoE, the advantage of autocrine apoE may become critical if homeostasis is challenged by cholesterol loading, if the conditioned space is large (making apoE diluted), if the turnover of conditioned space is high because of interstitial flow, or if a macrophage is isolated from other macrophages. The interstitial concentration, distribution volume, and turnover of macrophage apoE in the vessel wall are not known. These factors are critical for the interpretation of data from in vitro cell culture systems and the generalization of these data to the biology of macrophages in vivo. For example, the trend in viability may be related to changes in apoE secretion observed at very low volumes (Fig. 3A). The log-linear trend in viability (Fig. 3C) may be due to the relative concentrations of confounding mediators like growth factors and culture gases (e.g., CO2) in varying distribution volumes. Because apoE is not the only mediator being secreted in our system, it was necessary to subtract the effects of confounding mediators. This is why apoE+/+ macrophages were compared with apoE to / to  macrophages and why the specific apoE effect was calculated as apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux (E). The effects of confounding mediators on cholesterol efflux were minimal (Fig. 2, A and B). Although the major role of apoE is as an extracellular cholesterol acceptor, it is also possible that a portion of the effect of apoE on cholesterol efflux is the consequence of other actions of apoE, such as receptor or proteoglycan binding (17), intracellular cholesterol routing (8), or even stabilization of the cytoskeleton (6). Irrespective of which ultimate mechanisms or combination of effects may be responsible for the modulation of cholesterol efflux by apoE, these can only occur through either autocrine or paracrine events and are therefore addressed as a whole in our study..

Even when the extracellular space is saturated with apoE, at least 10 to 20% of the apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux is the result of volume-independent interactions of endogenous apoE (Table 1). Lin et al. (19) found that with apoE-deficient cells, the exogenous application of apoE at 10 times the concentration of normal endogenous apoE secretion did not increase cholesterol efflux as much as normal endogenous apoE secretion by apoE-producing cells. The fundamental importance of these media transfer studies is that they show that exogenous apoE (paracrine) is not equivalent to endogenous apoE (autocrine and paracrine). For a macrophage with endogenously synthesized apoE, the advantage of autocrine apoE may become critical if homeostasis is challenged by cholesterol loading, if the conditioned space is large (making apoE diluted), if the turnover of conditioned space is high because of interstitial flow, or if a macrophage is isolated from other macrophages. The interstitial concentration, distribution volume, and turnover of macrophage apoE in the vessel wall are not known. These factors are critical for the interpretation of data from in vitro cell culture systems and the generalization of these data to the biology of macrophages in vivo. For example, the trend in viability may be related to changes in apoE secretion observed at very low volumes (Fig. 3A). The log-linear trend in viability (Fig. 3C) may be due to the relative concentrations of confounding mediators like growth factors and culture gases (e.g., CO2) in varying distribution volumes. Because apoE is not the only mediator being secreted in our system, it was necessary to subtract the effects of confounding mediators. This is why apoE+/+ macrophages were compared with apoE to / to  macrophages and why the specific apoE effect was calculated as apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux (E). The effects of confounding mediators on cholesterol efflux were minimal (Fig. 2, A and B). Although the major role of apoE is as an extracellular cholesterol acceptor, it is also possible that a portion of the effect of apoE on cholesterol efflux is the consequence of other actions of apoE, such as receptor or proteoglycan binding (17), intracellular cholesterol routing (8), or even stabilization of the cytoskeleton (6). Irrespective of which ultimate mechanisms or combination of effects may be responsible for the modulation of cholesterol efflux by apoE, these can only occur through either autocrine or paracrine events and are therefore addressed as a whole in our study..
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	60	Although the volume dependence of apoE secretion and viability could not explain the volume-dependent trends of apoE-mediated efflux (Fig. 2C), these data definitely underscore the sensitivity of biological processes to in vitro culture volumes. Some of the higher-order characteristics of macrophage tissue could be overlooked by in vitro studies with macrophages. For example, an aggregate of macrophages may become a tissue that works with autocrine efficiency instead of being just the sum of its autocrine/paracrine cellular units. The spatial range of autocrine effect (30) is very important because if another cell is within this range there is the possibility of autocrine cooperation. This possibility could be explored by in vitro or in vivo studies on the effects of the geometry and the density of cell aggregates on apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux. Compared with exogenous lipoprotein-bound apoE of hepatic origin, local secretion of lipid free apoE by macrophages results in decreased atherosclerosis due to a small amount of apoE in a critical location (12, 22). In the study by Fazio et al. (12), WT mice were transplanted with apoE to / to  bone marrow. These chimeric mice had normal plasma apoE but no macrophage apoE production in the vessel walls. Although immunocytochemical staining of lesions with WT macrophages reveals high apoE levels, these chimeric mice with only plasma apoE had little to no apoE in the lesions. The lack of staining for plasma-derived apoE within the artery wall suggests that penetration into clusters of macrophages is limited. The macrophage, not plasma-derived apoE, is the primary source of apoE for RCT (5, 12, 22). Along these same lines, paracrine apoE may not be able to fulfill the critical actions of the small amount of autocrine apoE in the juxtacellular space or possibly even the intracellular space. apoE recycling, the internalization and resecretion of apoE (10, 13, 33), has been reported to mediate cholesterol efflux in hepatocytes and in macrophages (13). The methodology in this study is unable to resolve the "internal autocrine" (31) or "intracrine" (28, 29) mechanism that could be mediated by intracellular apoE..

In many of the documents that are found by a literature search for the term "autocrine," the terms "autocrine and/or paracrine" describe the proposed mechanism of action. It is difficult to quantitatively separate these two mechanisms experimentally. Traditional approaches to this problem have limitations and rely on simple qualitative assessments. Traditional methodologies that have been used to study macrophage apoE include characterizing the tissue distribution of apoE (11), measuring the effects of the endogenous synthesis of apoE vs. its complete absence (11), and measuring the effects of the endogenous synthesis vs. exogenous application of apoE (15, 19). These methods are useful in comparative assessments, but they are unable to simultaneously quantify the serial effects mediated by apoE or other secreted biological mediators..
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	63	In the present study, we have performed experiments based on the theory that the portion of the endogenous acceptor that mediates autocrine effects cannot be diluted. Previous studies have utilized experimental strategies similar to the one used in our study. Steck et al. (32) performed volume dependence experiments to study whether efflux to exogenous acceptors is proceeded by aqueous diffusion of cholesterol or by acceptor-membrane collisions. They found that, for certain types of acceptors, efflux approached a "volume-insensitive plateau," and they proposed that these types of acceptors may have "sites for efficient collisional transfer" (32). Our studies with endogenously synthesized acceptors suggest that these sites may be a combination of binding sites on the membrane and an enriched aqueous layer around the membrane (i.e., the juxtacellular space). Oehrtman et al. (27) used a theoretical model to study the escape of autocrine signaling ligands into the extracellular space. They found in a model of a ligand-receptor signaling system that "varying volume heights shows little effect on ligand concentrations." It remains to be seen whether the dilution methodology discussed here can change mediator concentrations over the large dynamic range (many orders of magnitude) of a log-linear dose-response curve such as those seen for ligand-receptor signaling pathways..

However, direct evidence that apoE plays such a role is lacking. We investigated whether apoE isoforms influence lipid content in the brain. We compared the brains of wild-type mice to apoE knockout (/) and human apoE3 and apoE4 transgenic mice and compared cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of humans with different apoE isoforms. We found that there was no effect of apoE on the content of multiple phospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol. There was, however, a marked effect of apoE on the sulfatide (ST) content in both the brain and CSF. The sulfatide mass in hippocampus and cortex of apoE knockout mice was found to be 61 and 114 mol% higher than wild-type mice counterparts at 12 months of age. In contrast, the sulfatide content in brain tissues from human apoE4-expressing mice was ~60% less than those found in wild-type mice of the same age. The ST mass in human CSF was significantly dependent on the APOE genotypes of the subjects. Examination of potential sulfatide carrier(s) in human CSF demonstrated that sulfatides are specifically associated with apoE-containing high density lipoproteins, suggesting that sulfatide levels in the central nervous system (CNS) are likely to be directly modulated by the same metabolic pathways that regulate levels of apoE-containing CNS lipoproteins. This novel role for apoE in the CNS may provide new insights into the connection of apoE with Alzheimer's disease and poor recovery after brain injury.

It has been postulated that apoE may also play an important role in the redistribution of cholesterol and phospholipids within the central nervous system (CNS) (3) where apoE is expressed mainly in astrocytes (4, 5). In vitro and in vivo data suggest that apoE can play a role in neurite outgrowth and sprouting (4, 6-9), however, whether this is due to effects on cholesterol and lipid metabolism is unclear. In addition to its role as a plasma lipid transport protein, apoE participates in pathobiological processes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) (10). The effect of apoE in AD is likely to occur at least in part via interactions with the amyloid- (A) peptide (see Ref. 11 for review). To date, the mechanisms of how apoE is involved in all of these biological processes have not been completely clarified..

The most common isoform, apoE3, has cysteine at position 112 and arginine at 158, whereas apoE2 has cysteine at both positions, and apoE4 contains arginine at both positions. The isoforms are encoded by three alleles at the same gene locus. ApoE4 has been shown to be a risk factor for AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (10).

The most common isoform, apoE3, has cysteine at position 112 and arginine at 158, whereas apoE2 has cysteine at both positions, and apoE4 contains arginine at both positions. The isoforms are encoded by three alleles at the same gene locus. ApoE4 has been shown to be a risk factor for AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (10). Although the role of apoE in the pathogenesis of AD is not entirely clear, studies suggest that apoE influences A deposition and toxicity in the brain (12-15)..

Sulfatides mediate diverse biological processes, including the regulation of cell growth, protein trafficking, signal transduction, cell adhesion, neuronal plasticity, and cell morphogenesis (see Refs. 16-18 for reviews). Sulfatides are almost exclusively synthesized by oligodendrocytes in the CNS and are present predominantly in the myelin sheath surrounding axons and, thus, are present in both white matter and gray matter (16). Altered levels of ST in human brain tissues are involved in the pathogenesis of various human diseases. Accumulation of ST, due to a sulfatidase deficiency, is responsible for metachromatic leukodystrophy, in which there is encephalopathy, long tract signs, and degeneration of myelin in the CNS (19). In contrast, our recent study demonstrated that substantial ST deficiency occurs at the very earliest stages of AD, although the one or more causes of this deficiency remain unclear (20). Mice deficient in ST and galactocerebrosides (GalC), generated by knocking out a ceramide galactosyltransferase, generally die by 3 months of age and demonstrate several abnormalities, including abnormal axonal function, dysmyelinosis, and loss of axonal conduction velocity (21-24)..

0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	12	Numerous studies have demonstrated the role of apoE on the normal variation of plasma lipids in an isoform-dependent manner (see Refs. 1 and 25 for reviews). Therefore, it has long been postulated that apoE may also play a role in lipid metabolism in the brain. However, direct evidence that apoE plays such a role is lacking. In this study, we investigated whether apoE or apoE isoforms influence lipid content in the CNS. We found that there were no significant effects of apoE on the content of multiple phospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol. In contrast, apoE had a dramatic effect on the sulfatide content in the CNS. Furthermore, the potential mechanisms of the relationship between apoE and ST, including ST in assembly of nascent apoE particles, ST transport and presence within cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lipoproteins, and ST hydrolysis mediated by apoE, were also investigated in the study. Collectively, we have uncovered a novel role for apoE, modulation of ST content, in the CNS. This finding may provide some new insights into the role(s) of apoE in biological and pathological processes in the CNS such as in AD and following brain injury.

Importantly, the levels of apoE3 and apoE4 expression in hemizygous transgenic mice are indistinguishable from each other and are ~70% of the levels of mouse apoE in wild-type mice (26, 36). The levels of ST mass in hippocampus and cortex of apoE3 transgenic mice at 12 months of age were only 53 and 40 mol%, respectively, of those found in apoE/ mice and were statistically lower than those found in apoE+/+ mice (Fig. 3). The levels of ST mass in both cortex and hippocampus of apoE4 transgenic mice were only 28 and 37 mol%, respectively, of those in the counterparts of apoE/ mouse tissues, or 59 and 60 mol%, respectively, of those found in the corresponding apoE+/+ mouse tissues at 12 months of age (Fig. 3). The ST mass levels in these brain regions of apoE4 transgenic mice were significantly lower than those found in the corresponding apoE3 transgenic mouse tissues (p  <  0.01) (Fig. 3), demonstrating isoform-specific regulation of ST mass levels by apoE. ApoE/ mice had significantly higher ST content in the thalamus, striatum, and septum compared with that present in apoE+/+ mice even by 6 months of age (Fig. 4). In contrast, significantly lower ST content in these brain regions was demonstrated in apoE3 transgenic mice relative to those in the wild-type (apoE+/+) mice (Fig. 4). The fact that human apoE transgenic mice, which express apoE only in brain, have lower levels of sulfatide than wild-type mice demonstrates that the regulation of brain sulfatide levels is via apoE produced in the brain..

The ST content in these particles was quantitated by ESI/MS. It was found that the ST content in these particles was negligible, although apoE4 particles contained more ST mass than that found in apoE3 particles (731  plus or minus  45 versus 562  plus or minus  22 pmol/mg apoE, respectively). Second, CSF (which contains CNS-produced apoE-containing lipoprotein particles) samples were collected from age-matched cognitively normal human subjects. The ST content in the CSF samples was analyzed by ESI/MS. The ST mass (nmol/mg apoE) in apoE3/E3 homozygous subjects was 46.4  plus or minus  3.3, whereas the level was significantly higher in subjects with one or two alleles of apoE4 (53.7  plus or minus  4.6, p  <  0.01) (Fig. 6).

First, ST molecules are acquired and directly associate with apoE particles in the CNS after apoE particles are secreted from astrocytes. Alternatively, ST molecules may be influenced by apoE in an indirect fashion but not directly associate and interact with apoE-containing lipoproteins. Therefore, to understand the one or more mechanisms of apoE-mediated alterations in ST content in the CNS, it is necessary to identify the carrier or carriers of ST molecules. The location of ST molecules was first investigated by analyzing ST content in human CSF fractions after gel filtration chromatography. It was found that sulfatides co-localized exactly with HDL-like lipoproteins present in human CSF (Fig. 7A). The two most abundant apolipoproteins produced in the CNS (apoE and apoJ) as well as several other apolipoproteins are present in human CSF. Therefore, experiments were performed to identify the specific carrier(s) of ST in human CSF by immunoprecipitation (see the inset of Fig. 7B for Western blots) and followed by ESI/MS quantitation of ST content in both supernatants and pellets. It was found that most (over 80 mol%) if not all ST molecules were immunoprecipitated with anti-apoE antibodies, whereas ST molecules were not specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-apoJ antibodies (Fig. 7, B and C). These results clearly demonstrated that ST molecules were specifically associated with apoE-containing HDL-like lipoproteins in CSF and suggested that apoE particles mainly acquired ST in the CNS after secretion from astrocytes..

A, quantitation of sulfatide content in human cerebrospinal fluid fractions after gel filtration chromatography. Human cerebrospinal fluid was fractionated by employing tandem Superose 6 columns as described under "Experimental Procedures." Seventy fractions of 400  microl each were collected. Lipids of the each individual fraction were extracted in the presence of N-palmitoyl sulfatide (70 pmol/fraction, used as an internal standard for sulfatide quantitation) by using a modified Bligh and Dyer method. Sulfatide content in each fraction was quantitated by ESI/MS as described under "Experimental Procedures." The x axis indicates fraction number and known elution profile of CSF lipoproteins as reported previously (27). Quantitation of sulfatide content in the immunoprecipitated lipoprotein particles (B) and supernatants before or after immunoprecipitation (C) was initiated by incubating 1.7 ml of pooled human cerebrospinal fluids with individual antibodies as indicated as described under "Experimental Procedures." Lipids of each immunoprecipitation pellet were extracted in the presence of N-palmitoyl sulfatide (70 pmol).

However, it was possible that one determinant for apoE-mediated ST content differences in the CNS might occur through apoE-catalyzed hydrolysis.

0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	51	The involvement of apoE in metabolism of phospholipids and cholesterol in the plasma is well known (1, 25). To investigate whether apoE influences the mass distribution of brain lipids, we systematically quantified the distribution of lipids including multiple phospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol in different brain regions of wild-type, apoE/, and human apoE transgenic mice. We found that there are no significant effects of apoE on the content of all examined lipids with the exception of ST levels, which were dramatically altered in both the apoE knockout and human apoE transgenic mice. Furthermore, this apoE-mediated alteration in ST content in the CNS is regulated by aging as well as by apoE produced in the brain, because the human apoE transgenic mice only express apoE in brain and still have markedly elevated plasma cholesterol (26). The results from the examination of the ST content in astrocyte-secreted apoE particles indicate that apoE can acquire a small amount of ST directly from cells that secrete apoE. However, because most brain ST is produced by oligodendrocytes and located in myelin in the CNS, it is likely that the majority of ST in apoE particles in the CNS is acquired from myelin after apoE secretion from its expressed cells. The major effect of mouse and human apoE appears to be in keeping ST levels in brain at a lower level than that present in the absence of apoE. This effect is probably due to apoE-containing lipoproteins facilitating cellular clearance of ST. Although hydrolysis of ST directly catalyzed by apoE was not observed in this study, apoE-associated ST hydrolysis in vivo can not be completely excluded. Because we showed that ST directly associates with apoE-containing lipoproteins in CSF, it is likely that transport of ST by apoE particles in brain interstitial fluid and CSF and endocytotic recycling of apoE particles through LDL receptor or LDL receptor family members such as LDL receptor-related proteins (37) are the major pathways by which apoE mediates ST metabolism in the CNS..

Although there are several possible mechanisms as to why these associations exist, there is very strong evidence to suggest that the interaction between apoE and A play an important role in the effect of apoE on AD (see Refs. 11 and 38 for reviews). For example, in transgenic animal models that develop AD-like amyloidosis and neuritic plaques, the lack of apoE results in little to no fibrillar amyloid formation nor neuritic dystrophy (14, 39), and the expression of human apoE results in an isoform-specific deposition of amyloid within neuritic plaques with the effect order being apoE4  >  E3  >  E2 (15, 40). These effects of apoE on A are likely mediated by interactions between apoE-containing HDL (the form of apoE in brain) and A. Given these issues, is there any way that sulfatide association with apoE-containing lipoproteins may be involved in apoE-A interactions?.

How it is that apoE plays a role in these processes remains unclear. It is possible that the effect is via an isoform-specific difference in regeneration as has been shown in some in vitro and in vivo models (see Ref. 9 for recent review). It is also possible, particularly in the case of multiple sclerosis and possibly stroke, that apoE is somehow regulating CNS inflammatory processes such as cytokine production as has been seen in some models (e.g. Ref. 44)..

One of the most studied candidates is the insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism (indel) of the gene for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). This study aimed to clarify its association with Alzheimer's disease. The meta-analysis included 39 samples, comprising 6,037 cases of Alzheimer's disease and 12,099 controls, using mainly primary data. Potential interactions with gender, age, ethnic group, and carrier status of the apolipoprotein E 4 allele were all examined. D homozygotes were at reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (odds ratio = 0.81, 95% confidence interval: 0.72, 0.90; corrected p = 0.0004); I homozygotes showed no association with Alzheimer's disease, while heterozygotes were at increased risk. Although there were clear differences among the three ethnic groups examined (North Europeans, South Caucasians, and East Asians), in all groups D homozygotes were at reduced risk. These results confirm the association of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme indel with Alzheimer's disease across diverse populations, although this is probably due to linkage disequilibrium with the true risk factor. Further, in North Europeans, both association and Hardy-Weinberg analysis suggested partial heterosis, that is, an increased risk for heterozygotes, due to a hidden interaction with another, as yet unknown, risk factor. This interaction warrants further investigation..

(1) first proposed an association with Alzheimer's disease of the insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism (indel) in intron 16 of the gene for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) on chromosome 17q23. The enzyme converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is potently hypertensive. The D allele is associated with raised plasma levels of the enzyme (2, 3). Kehoe et al. (1) found that I positives, that is, DI + II, were at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. The study comprised three samples, from Cardiff and London in Britain and Belfast in Northern Ireland, with strikingly similar results..

For the age stratifications ( < 65 years, 65 to 75 years, and  > 75 years), we divided the samples into two groups, according to how the ages of cases had been defined, for example, at onset (first group) or at examination or death (second group). We also conducted analyses restricted to controls and to diagnoses of probable or definite Alzheimer's disease according to criteria of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) (25) or of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) (26) (26 full samples and two part samples). In separate analyses, we excluded eight samples where Hardy-Weinberg analysis and genotyping methods were compatible with mistyping. Underreporting of heterozygotes may occur unless either 5 percent dimethyl sulfoxide is included in the polymerase chain reaction (27) or the DD genotype is confirmed by an insertion-specific second amplification (28). In further analyses, samples were placed where possible (34 of 39 samples) in one of three ethnic groups: North European (19 samples); South Caucasian (11 samples), defined here as from the Mediterranean or from the Middle East; and East Asian (four samples), from China or from Japan..

0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	23	Data analysis and statistical methods Three methods are commonly used to produce odds ratios in genetic association studies: method 1, allelic (i.e., D vs. I in this case); method 2, comparing each genotype with one other in turn (e.g., DD vs. DI); method 3, comparing each genotype in turn with the other two combined. All three methods are subject to bias, the degree of bias depending on how imperfectly the model fits reality. For instance, method 1 is best suited to testing a codominant model, where there is an allelic dose effect (e.g., DD  >  DI  >  II). Method 3, on the other hand, may be used to test either an I-dominant/D-recessive or a D-dominant/I-recessive model. We chose to follow the hypothesis-generating study (1) in using method 3, partly because preliminary examination of subsequent studies had shown no evidence of codominance. We also used both methods 2 and 3 to examine heterosis (heterozygotes at greater or lesser risk than either homozygote). Our main approach, method 3, gives an estimate of the risk associated with each genotype when compared with the rest of the population..
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	24	Pooled odds ratios were calculated three times, by the fixed-effects method of Mantel and Haenszel (29), by the random-effects method of DerSimonian and Laird (30), and by the Bayesian random-effects method of Warn et al. (31). However, as the results of all three methods were very similar, only those of the first two are shown (table 2). The methods of meta-analysis permit the accumulation of results across independent studies, even where the number of subjects or the ratio of cases to controls varies considerably, as here in the cohort of Sleegers et al. (9), for example. The heterogeneity test was by the method of Armitage (32). Logistic regression analysis was used to compare odds ratios among ethnic groups. Funnel plots (33) and cumulative meta-analysis (34) were used to investigate bias. Analyses were performed using "R" (35) and the package "rmeta" by Thomas Lumley (http://www.cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/rmeta.html). All tests of significance were two sided. A Bonferroni correction factor of 3 was applied to all p values by genotype..

The odds ratios were similar to those shown in table 2, that is, significant odds ratios by the method of DerSimonian and Laird (30) of 0.77 for D homozygotes and of 1.15 for heterozygotes and a nonsignificant odds ratio of 1.10 for I homozygotes.

We therefore excluded the eight samples where mistyping was considered possible, that is, underreporting of heterozygotes, taking into account both genotyping methods and Hardy-Weinberg analysis. We then repeated the overall analyses with the remaining 31 samples. The odds ratios were similar to those in table 2, that is, significant odds ratios of 0.81 for D homozygotes and of 1.12 for heterozygotes and a nonsignificant odds ratio of 1.09 for I homozygotes. Heterogeneity remained for I homozygotes (p = 0.02) but was no longer significant for D homozygotes (p = 0.19)..

The samples were divided into three ethnic groups, where possible: North European (19 samples), South Caucasian (Mediterranean and Middle Eastern, 11 samples), and East Asian (Chinese and Japanese, four samples). This removed nearly all heterogeneity (table 3). Table 3 shows clear differences among the three ethnic groups. There was no overlap whatsoever in allelic frequencies among the three groups. North Europeans and East Asians differed in the odds ratios for D homozygotes versus I positives (p = 0.0008) and for I homozygotes versus D positives (p = 0.0005). South Caucasians also differed from East Asians in the odds ratio for D homozygotes versus I positives (p = 0.0003). D homozygotes were at reduced risk in all groups, but particularly in East Asians. Heterozygotes were at increased risk in North Europeans. I homozygotes were at higher risk in East Asians, except by Bayesian analysis. We further examined heterosis (heterozygotes at greater risk) in North Europeans, by comparing DI with DD and with II in turn. We found that heterozygotes were at higher risk than D homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.25, 95 percent confidence interval: 1.08, 1.45) but not significantly higher than I homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.08, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.95, 1.22)..

Heterogeneity may be due to differences in sample selection (e.g., in age, gender, or diagnosis) or in methods (e.g., of genotyping), or it may be due to real differences in populations (e.g., in race) or in interactions with other risk factors (e.g., APOE*4). We examined all of these potential sources of heterogeneity. We found little effect of age, gender, or APOE*4 status, thus confounding our initial hypothesis. Both diagnostic and genotyping differences contributed some heterogeneity. The former was mainly due to the diagnosis of "possible Alzheimer's disease," reported to have a poor record of confirmation at autopsy (38). The latter was largely due to certain genotyping methods that may lead to underreporting of heterozygotes (27, 28), as shown by Hardy-Weinberg analysis..

(17, 39), by Buss et al. (40), and by Elkins et al. (12). These contrasts highlight the dangers of combining ethnic groups within a single cohort, even North and South Europeans, as indicated by Panza et al. (17, 39). Unfortunately, there was only one cohort of African origin, from the United States (41). Thus, no conclusions could be drawn about Africans..

0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	62	Heterosis Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are common in studies of the ACE indel, as previously pointed out by Buss et al. (40). This may be due to either mistyping or heterosis. Several cases of such disequilibrium were indeed compatible with mistyping. Most examples of disequilibrium in North Europeans, however, were of an excess of heterozygotes in Alzheimer's disease, which requires another explanation. We believe that explanation is heterosis. Heterosis occurs when heterozygotes show either a greater or lesser association with a given trait than does either group of homozygotes. In this case, in North Europeans, both an excess of heterozygotes in Alzheimer's disease and an association of heterozygotes with Alzheimer's disease were found. Comings and MacMurray (42) have suggested three explanations for heterosis, of which their second can be applied here. This proposes that heterosis may follow from the inadvertent combination of two unlike subsets due to a hidden interaction with another, unknown risk factor. To test this proposal, we constructed a mathematical model with two equal subsets based on a median split of an unknown factor X (table 4). The model illustrates how, although heterozygotes may have intermediate odds ratios in each subset, they can emerge with the highest odds ratio when the subsets are combined (i.e., heterosis). The overall results of this illustrative model (table 4) were very close to those of the present meta-analysis (table 2). We should stress, however, that heterosis was found only in North Europeans. Moreover, although heterozygotes were at greater risk than D homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.25, 95 percent confidence interval: 1.08, 1.45), they were not at significantly higher risk than I homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.08, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.95, 1.22). Thus, partial heterosis better describes this case..

However, we note the associations of the ACE indel and of nearby polymorphisms with various phenotypes, including cardiovascular risk (37, 43 to 47). In addition, ACE protein levels are raised in certain brain regions with Alzheimer's disease (48 to 50), the enzyme has been reported to modify ss-amyloid aggregation (51), ACE inhibitors have been reported to maintain memory in aged rats (52) and in human patients (53), and brain-penetrating ACE inhibitors have been associated with both reduced incidence of Alzheimer's disease in elderly hypertensive patients (54) and less cognitive decline in cases with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (55). Sleegers et al. (9) have recently provided evidence from magnetic resonance imaging of increased atrophy in both the hippocampus and amygdala of nondemented women homozygous for the ACE*I allele, together with a modest but significant increase in risk of Alzheimer's disease, independent of vascular factors. The D allele is associated with raised plasma levels of ACE (2), but that association is thought to be due to linkage disequilibrium with other nearby polymorphisms (3, 36). There is an apparent conflict between the benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy and the associations of the indel with Alzheimer's disease risk and pathology and with plasma levels of ACE. However, the influence of ACE polymorphisms on brain levels of the enzyme is not yet known and cannot be assumed to reflect the levels in plasma. This subject warrants fuller discussion than is possible here. A more detailed discussion is given by Kehoe (56), although it will need to be reconsidered and perhaps revised in the light of any interacting factor or factors that may emerge in future studies..

The quality of diagnosis and of genotyping varied among studies, but our overall results were not changed when these questions were taken into account. There was considerable heterogeneity in our initial results. However, we found the main sources of that heterogeneity and were able to remove it. Since cardiovascular factors are strong candidates for a potential interaction with ACE variants, the lack of data available to us on those factors was a limitation, which we hope will be overcome by future studies. Cardiovascular factors might also have influenced our results through selective mortality. However, D homozygotes have only a very slightly increased risk of cardiovascular complications (43 to 47, 57) and little evidence of any association with reduced life span (57 to 62). Thus, the influence of selective mortality, if any, is likely to be very small and not enough to provide an alternative explanation for our findings..

0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	70	Conclusions We suggest that this large study has established the ACE indel as a marker of Alzheimer's disease risk, since we found no evidence of bias, we found and removed the main sources of heterogeneity, we excluded various potential interactions, and significant results remained in each of the three ethnic groups examined. The indel, however, is probably in linkage disequilibrium with the true risk polymorphism (11). There were marked contrasts among the three ethnic groups studied (table 3). We also found evidence of an interaction with another risk factor in North Europeans. Potential interactions with other factors than age, gender, and APOE*4 status should be examined, particularly interactions with cardiovascular risk factors..

0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	5	Objective. To establish whether polymorphism of the apoE genes affects susceptibility to primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS), degree of inflammation or age of onset of pSS..
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	6	Methods. ApoE genotype distribution and allelic frequencies were analysed using PCR and the TaqMan system in 63 Finnish Caucasian patients with pSS and in 64 healthy controls matched for sex, ethnic origin and area of residence. The clinical and immunological data on the pSS patients were analysed in relation to the apoE genotypes..
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	7	Results. There was no difference between pSS patients and controls in apoE genotype and allelic frequencies. The apoE 4 allele was significantly associated with early onset of pSS in the entire population and in female patients (Kaplan to Meier log rank test, P = 0.0407 and P = 0.0168, respectively). The average age ( plus or minus  S.D.) of onset of pSS in all apoE 4 allele carriers was 46  plus or minus  12 and in other genotypes it was 53  plus or minus  10 yr (P = 0.031, t-test). ApoE polymorphism was not associated with signs of inflammation evaluated by such markers as concentration of plasma CRP, plasma interleukin-6, plasma TNF-, immunoglobulin G and haemoglobin, or leucocyte count or ESR..
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	8	Conclusions. ApoE polymorphism does not affect susceptibility to pSS or levels of plasma inflammatory indices in patients with pSS. However, a clear association prevails between apoE 4 and early onset of pSS..

The gene for apoE is polymorphic, presenting with three common alleles (2, 3, 4) at a single gene locus on chromosome 19. These alleles form six genotypes: E2/2, E3/2, E4/2, E3/3, E4/3 and E4/4, of which E3/3 is the commonest and E4/3 the second commonest in most populations. The presence of the apoE 4 allele is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease and Alzheimer's disease [reviewed in 3]..

We therefore hypothesized that genetic polymorphism of the apoE could have an effect on markers of inflammation in patients with pSS. However, this proved not to be the case: first, no differences were found in the apoE genotype or allele frequencies between pSS patients and healthy controls. Moreover, the apoE 4 allele did not influence the levels of CRP in patients with pSS. This finding might be explained by the fact that pSS is known to belong to a group of autoimmune diseases with a modest or even absent CRP reaction [10]. However, in addition to lack of differences in CRP levels, no differences emerged in any other well-established markers of inflammatory activity, including plasma IL-6, TNF- and IgG between apoE 4 carriers and non-carriers. The apoE 4 carrier state was also not associated with clinical features of the disease. Labial salivary gland histology, a marker of severity of inflammation in pSS, was even milder in apoE 4 allele carriers compared with non-carriers..

Similarly, it has been noted that the effect of the apoE 4 allele on coronary atherosclerosis [11] and Alzheimer's disease [12] is age-dependent. Moreover, in recent studies, apoE polymorphism has also been found to affect the age at onset of infectious diseases [13, 14]. ApoE polymorphism was found to affect the age of becoming infected with Plasmodium falciparum in children from Ghana [13] and to have a possible role in protection against the early stages of malaria [14]. Viral infections, e.g. Epstein to Barr, cytomegalovirus or retrovirus infections have been proposed to act as triggering agents in the development of pSS in genetically susceptible subjects [15]. There are no data on apoE polymorphism and susceptibility to or age at disease onset related to these infections. We do not know the background to the significant association between apoE 4 and earlier disease onset of pSS. One might speculate, however, that this association could be mediated, for example, through a possible effect on the time-point of a triggering viral infection..

The gender bias and the concomitant characteristic late age of disease onset in pSS have been difficult to interpret, as oestrogens have been considered to favour autoimmunity and androgens to protect from it. Carriers of apoE 4 have been held to be more susceptible to the development of some diseases associated with menopause, as they have been found to have higher serum DHEA and testosterone levels than women not carrying this allele [4]. Furthermore, an interaction between oestrogen and apoE in the Alzheimer's disease process has been observed; in a recent study apoE polymorphism influenced binding to the oestrogen receptor and altered transcriptional activity in response to oestrogen [16]..

0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)-mediated cholesterol efflux involves the binding of apoA-I to the plasma membrane via its C terminus and requires cellular ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) activity. ApoA-I also stimulates secretion of apolipoprotein E (apoE) from macrophage foam cells, although the mechanism of this process is not understood. In this study, we demonstrate that apoA-I stimulates secretion of apoE independently of both ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux and of lipid binding by its C terminus. Pulse-chase experiments using 35S-labeled cellular apoE demonstrate that macrophage apoE exists in both relatively mobile (Em) and stable (Es) pools, that apoA-I diverts apoE from degradation to secretion, and that only a small proportion of apoA-I-mobilized apoE is derived from the cell surface. The structural requirements for induction of apoE secretion and cholesterol efflux are clearly dissociated, as C-terminal deletions in recombinant apoA-I reduce cholesterol efflux but increase apoE secretion, and deletion of central helices 5 and 6 decreases apoE secretion without perturbing cholesterol efflux. Moreover, a range of 11- and 22-mer -helical peptides representing amphipathic -helical segments of apoA-I stimulate apoE secretion whereas only the C-terminal -helix (domains 220 to 241) stimulates cholesterol efflux. Other -helix-containing apolipoproteins (apoA-II, apoA-IV, apoE2, apoE3, apoE4) also stimulate apoE secretion, implying a positive feedback autocrine loop for apoE secretion, although apoE4 is less effective. Finally, apoA-I stimulates apoE secretion normally from macrophages of two unrelated subjects with genetically confirmed Tangier Disease (mutations C733R and c.5220 to 5222delTCT; and mutations A1046D and c.4629 to 4630insA), despite severely inhibited cholesterol efflux. We conclude that apoA-I stimulates secretion of apoE independently of cholesterol efflux, and that this represents a novel, ABCA-1-independent, positive feedback pathway for stimulation of potentially anti-atherogenic apoE secretion by -helix-containing molecules including apoA-I and apoE..

Other -helix-containing apolipoproteins (apoA-II, apoA-IV, apoE2, apoE3, apoE4) also stimulate apoE secretion, implying a positive feedback autocrine loop for apoE secretion, although apoE4 is less effective. Finally, apoA-I stimulates apoE secretion normally from macrophages of two unrelated subjects with genetically confirmed Tangier Disease (mutations C733R and c.5220 to 5222delTCT; and mutations A1046D and c.4629 to 4630insA), despite severely inhibited cholesterol efflux. We conclude that apoA-I stimulates secretion of apoE independently of cholesterol efflux, and that this represents a novel, ABCA-1-independent, positive feedback pathway for stimulation of potentially anti-atherogenic apoE secretion by -helix-containing molecules including apoA-I and apoE..

These transporters are membrane proteins that utilize ATP hydrolysis to transport substrates across membranes (4). Mutations in ABCA1/ABC-1 cause Tangier disease (TD), a severe HDL deficiency syndrome characterized by very low plasma levels of HDL and apoA-I, accumulation of cholesterol in tissue macrophages, and a predisposition to atherosclerosis (5 to 7). Fibroblasts from subjects with Tangier disease show impaired cholesterol and phospholipid release to lipid-free apolipoproteins (8). In addition, inhibition of ABCA1 expression or activity inhibits lipid efflux to apoA-I in normal fibroblasts (3, 6)..

Human atherosclerotic lesions contain apoE protein and mRNA, especially in association with macrophage foam cells (9). Secretion of apoE by macrophages may protect against atherosclerosis, as indicated by the effects of transplantation of apoE-expressing bone marrow into apoE-null mice (10, 11). This may depend upon enhanced local clearance of cellular lipids and/or inhibition of local inflammatory responses, in addition to lowering plasma concentrations of atherogenic plasma lipoproteins. Recent studies demonstrated that apoA-I stimulates both apoE secretion and cholesterol efflux from human and mouse foam cell macrophages (12, 13). Stimulation of apoE secretion by apoA-I and by HDL is most likely post-transcriptionally regulated and is observed for both endogenous apoE (macrophages) and recycled apoE (hepatocytes) (12 to 15). Recent studies indicate that ABCA1 may be involved in basal apoE secretion (16). However, the requirement for ABCA1 activity in apoA-I-induced apoE secretion has never been reported..

As we have previously described, the boundary conditions for accepting modeling of experimental data were an error function (ERF) 0.01 < ERF < 0.05 (42). An initial model assumed all de novo synthesized apoE was equally susceptible to degradation or secretion, and that net degradation and secretion proceeded at constant rates and were independent of each other. However, comparison of experimental and calculated data using this model identified that ERF were excessive and did not fulfill the boundary conditions (ERF for control 0.081 and for apoA-I 0.069, respectively). A second model simultaneously fitted the degradation and secretion of 35S-labeled cellular apoE to a first order rate equation as described in "Experimental Procedures." The cellular-labeled apoE at the start of the chase was divided into two pools: a larger mobile pool of apoE (EM 75%) and a smaller stable pool (Es 25%), which was neither degraded nor secreted during the duration of the experiment. The presence of Es was apparent from the residual pool of undegraded cell-associated apoE, and the presence of such a stable pool has previously been identified on the surface of HepG2 cells (47). Using this model, secretion and degradation of apoE were mutually dependent, and the boundary conditions for goodness of fit were fulfilled (Fig. 3). ApoA-I increased the rate constant for secretion (k1) and decreased the rate constant for degradation (k2) relative to control conditions, but did not substantially alter the size of Es and Em. Thus apoA-I-stimulated secretion from the mobile pool of apoE, which was otherwise fated for intracellular degradation..

0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	92	ApoA-I Maintains the Ability to Stimulate ApoE Secretion in Its Lipid-bound Conformation When complexed with phospholipids (e.g. nascent HDL discs) apoA-I undergoes conformational change, which increases the -helicity of the molecule (54, 57), and potentially increases the exposure of polar residues to the cell surface. Such changes may affect the efficacy of apoA-I-mediated apoE secretion in lipidated particles. ApoE secretion may thus be diminished if critical domains of apoA-I are obscured by lipidation or may be enhanced if greater exposure of polar domains enhances apoE secretion. There is also potential for synergy between phospholipid and apoA-I, as previous studies have identified a lipid-soluble pool of apoE associated with the extracellular matrix of HepG2 cells and macrophages (13, 41, 48, 58)..

Acceptors were added at concentrations matched for apoA-I content to allow accurate comparisons of efficiency in stimulating apoE secretion. Lipidation of apoA-I with POPC significantly increased apoE secretion 2 to 3-fold relative to apoA-I alone, whereas POPC alone did not significantly stimulate apoE secretion. These data suggest that lipidation of apoA-I promotes apoE secretion, and this might be caused by secondary conformational changes, such as increased exposure of polar residues of apoA-I to the cell surface..

Reduced local stimulation of apoE secretion by apoE4 in the artery or in the CNS might contribute to disease states associated with the apoE4 phenotype. ApoE4 differs from apoE3 in a single amino acid substitution, arginine instead of cysteine in position 112. This confers a more positive apoE charge, and causes conformational change to the N-terminal helix of apoE4, as a salt bridge forms between Arg112 and Glu109, and this alters the conformation of Arg61, which interacts with Glu255 (55). E4 also differs from E3 and E2 in lacking the potential for disulfide formation and self-association. In a previous study, Smith et al. (2) identified that the binding of E2, E3, and E4 to RAW macrophages, and the cholesterol efflux induced by these isoforms, were the same. Our studies confirmed similar efflux to the various apoE isoforms, supporting that differences in inducible apoE secretion cannot be explained by altered efflux, or binding. A recent study indicates that apoE4 has a higher lipid affinity than other apoE isoforms (56), and in this respect, these data support our observations that C-terminal deletions of apoA-I, which diminish its lipid affinity enhance its ability to induce apoE secretion..

Despite impaired ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux and severely reduced basal apoE secretion, apoA-I stimulated apoE secretion normally. Recent studies have shown that apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux via ABCA1 is linked to accelerated secretory vesicular transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, and this is absent in Tangier disease fibroblasts (66). As apoA-I stimulated apoE secretion normally from Tangier disease macrophages, we conclude that apoA-I must stimulate a distinct pathway of apoE secretion unrelated to its interactions with ABCA1 or its stimulation of cholesterol efflux. As apoE secretion induced by apoA-I is severalfold greater than basal apoE secretion, ABCA1-independent secretion is likely to be quantitatively more important than that related to ABCA1 activity. To our knowledge these findings represent the first reported non-ABCA1-mediated cellular process mediated by apoA-I..

ApoE is degraded in the lysosomal and proteasomal compartments (67) (68), and, although direct inhibition of lysosomal and cysteine proteases does inhibit apoE degradation, this does not increase apoE secretion (58). The possibility that apoA-I exchanges with cellular apoE such that apoA-I is degraded in place of apoE also seems unlikely, as the mass of apoA-I degraded corresponds to  < 30% of the mass of apoE secreted from human macrophages during time course experiments.3 It is more likely that apoA-I promotes apoE secretion by inhibiting its trafficking to degradatory compartments such as the lysosome and proteasome, or by stimulating vesicular traffic to the plasma membrane analogous to effects described in fibroblasts (66). Although HDL stimulates a range of protein kinase C-dependent and -independent signaling pathways, these are not necessarily activated by apoA-I (69), and the mechanisms by which apoA-I regulates vesicle traffic in general, and protein secretion in particular, require further investigation..

0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	2	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The 4 allele of the apolipoprotein-E (APOE) gene is associated with poor outcome following various cerebral insults. The relationship between APOE genotype and cognitive function in patients with type 1 diabetes is unknown. In a cross-sectional study of 96 people with type 1 diabetes, subjects were APOE genotyped, previous exposure to severe hypoglycemia was estimated by questionnaire, and cognition was assessed by neuropsychological testing. Cognitive abilities were compared using multivariate general linear modeling (multiple analysis of covariance, MANCOVA) in those with (n = 21) and without (n = 75) the APOE 4 allele. APOE 4 selectively influenced cognitive ability in a sex-specific manner (F = 2.3, P = 0.044, Eta2 = 0.15); women with APOE 4 performed less well on tests of current, nonverbal intellectual ability (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised performance test score, P = 0.001, Eta2 0.26) and frontal lobe and executive function (Borkowski verbal fluency, P = 0.016, Eta2 = 0.15). Previous exposure to severe hypoglycemia did not interact with APOE 4 to produce cognitive disadvantage.

0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The 4 allele of the apolipoprotein-E (APOE) gene is associated with poor outcome following various cerebral insults. The relationship between APOE genotype and cognitive function in patients with type 1 diabetes is unknown. In a cross-sectional study of 96 people with type 1 diabetes, subjects were APOE genotyped, previous exposure to severe hypoglycemia was estimated by questionnaire, and cognition was assessed by neuropsychological testing. Cognitive abilities were compared using multivariate general linear modeling (multiple analysis of covariance, MANCOVA) in those with (n = 21) and without (n = 75) the APOE 4 allele. APOE 4 selectively influenced cognitive ability in a sex-specific manner (F = 2.3, P = 0.044, Eta2 = 0.15); women with APOE 4 performed less well on tests of current, nonverbal intellectual ability (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised performance test score, P = 0.001, Eta2 0.26) and frontal lobe and executive function (Borkowski verbal fluency, P = 0.016, Eta2 = 0.15). Previous exposure to severe hypoglycemia did not interact with APOE 4 to produce cognitive disadvantage. The APOE 4 genotype is associated with specific cognitive disadvantage in young women with type 1 diabetes. APOE 4 is unlikely to mediate susceptibility to hypoglycemia-induced cognitive disadvantage..

In insulin-treated diabetes, severe hypoglycemia is common, with an annual prevalence of 30% in type 1 diabetes and a higher incidence in people with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia and strict glycemic control (1). Whether recurrent exposure to severe hypoglycemia promotes long-term cognitive sequelae is unresolved. Retrospective cross-sectional studies have indicated that some people with type 1 diabetes suffer a modest cognitive decrement (2), a finding not replicated by prospective observations for up to 10 years (3,4). The cross-sectional studies have reported individual differences in cognitive decrements in those exposed to severe hypoglycemia (2), suggesting that factors other than neuroglycopenia may influence the risk of developing subsequent cognitive impairment. Chronological age, diabetes duration, and coexistent microvascular and macrovascular complications have been proposed as potential mediators of susceptibility to hypoglycemia-induced cognitive impairment (2), whereas genetic susceptibility has not been examined..

The APOE gene has three common alleles (2, 3, and 4) coding for three protein isoforms (designated E2, E3, and E4). Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) mediates central nervous system cholesterol transport in an isoform-specific manner (6). APOE activity is important in neuronal repair and maintenance, and the least active E4-isoform confers a survival disadvantage to injured neurons (6). APOE polymorphism influences cognitive ability in health and disease apparently healthy middle-aged adults possessing the 4 allele have, on average, relatively low learning and memory ability (7); the 4 allele is associated with poorer cognitive and neurological outcome in head injury, demyelinating disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery (8)..

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The interaction of apolipoprotein E (apoE) with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans is an important step in the uptake of lipoprotein remnants by the liver. ApoE interacts predominantly with heparin through the N-terminal binding site spanning the residues around 136 to 150. In this work, surface plasmon resonance analysis was employed to investigate how amphipathic -helix properties and basic residue organization in this region modulate binding of apoE to heparin. The apoE/heparin interaction involves a two-step process; apoE initially binds to heparin with fast association and dissociation rates, followed by a step exhibiting much slower kinetics. Circular dichroism and surface plasmon resonance experiments using a disulfide-linked mutant, in which opening of the N-terminal helix bundle was prevented, demonstrated that there is no major secondary or tertiary structural change in apoE upon heparin binding. Mutations of Lys-146, a key residue for the heparin interaction, greatly reduced the favorable free energy of binding of the first step without affecting the second step, suggesting that electrostatic interaction is involved in the first binding step. Although lipid-free apoE2 tended to bind less than apoE3 and apoE4, there were no significant differences in rate and equilibrium constants of binding among the apoE isoforms in the lipidated state. Discoidal apoE3-phospholipid complexes using a substitution mutant (K143R/K146R) showed similar binding affinity to wild type apoE3, indicating that basic residue specificity is not required for the effective binding of apoE to heparin, unlike its binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor. In addition, disruption of the -helix structure in the apoE heparin binding region led to an increased favorable free energy of binding in the second step, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions contribute to the second binding step. Based on these results, it seems that cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan localizes apoE-enriched remnant lipoproteins to the vicinity of receptors by fast association and dissociation..

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Apolipoprotein E (apoE)1 is a key protein regulating lipid transport in human plasma and brain (1 to 4). It mediates hepatic clearance of remnant lipoproteins as a high affinity ligand for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family, including LDLR, LDLR-related protein (LRP), and cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (5). In the liver, HSPGs act in concert with LRP to complete the interaction of remnant particles with LRP in a process known as the HSPG-LRP pathway, in which apoE initially interacts with HSPG on the cell surface and is then transferred to the LRP for internalization (6). The ability of apoE to interact with members of the LDLR family and with HSPG can also be significant for cell signaling events (7). Binding of apoE to LRP activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and inhibits platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated migration of smooth muscle cells (8). Inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation by apoE is, on the other hand, mediated by its binding to HSPG (9). In addition, the interaction of apoE with HSPG has been implicated in neuronal growth and repair and, consequently, is involved in the progression of late onset familial Alzheimer's disease (10 to 12)..

The N-terminal domain is folded into a four-helix bundle of amphipathic -helices and contains the LDLR binding region (around residues 136 to 150 in helix 4) (14, 15). The C-terminal domain also contains amphipathic -helices that are involved in binding to lipoprotein particles (2, 16, 17). Both the N- and C-terminal domains contain a heparin binding site (18, 19). The N-terminal domain site is located between residues 136 and 147, overlapping with the LDLR binding region (20, 21), whereas the C-terminal site involves basic residues around lysine 233 (22). Although both sites are functional in the separated fragments, only the N-terminal site is available for interaction in both the lipid-free and lipidated states of the intact apoE molecule (22)..

ApoE3, the most common form, contains cysteine and arginine at these positions, respectively, whereas apoE2 contains cysteine and apoE4 contains arginine at both sites. Both apoE3 and apoE4 bind with equally high affinity to the LDLR, but apoE2 has defective binding to the LDLR and is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia (23). ApoE4 is associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease and is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (3, 24, 25)..

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	12	A cluster of arginine and lysine residues located on the polar face of the fourth amphipathic -helix in the N-terminal bundle represents the binding site for cell-surface receptors (2). Despite the apparent accessibility of these basic residues, interaction of apoE with lipid is necessary for its high affinity binding to the LDLR (26). Recent studies indicate that lipid binding induces opening of the helix bundle in the N-terminal domain (27, 28); this increases exposure of lysines 143 and 146 to the aqueous phase and thereby enhances interaction with acidic elements of the LDLR (29). Disruption of the amphipathic -helix spanning residues 140 to 150 abolishes LDLR binding, indicating that this structural motif in apoE is critical for function (30). In contrast to binding to the LDLR, the stringency for binding of apoE to the LRP or HSPG appears to be less severe. Lipid association of apoE is not required for binding to the LRP (31) or HSPG (22, 32), although the same apoE domain spanning residues 136 to 150 is involved in the binding (21, 33). ApoE2 that is highly defective in LDLR binding activity ( < 2% of normal apoE3 activity) has significant binding activity to LRP (40 to 50% of apoE3) (23) and HSPG (50 to 90% of apoE3) (6). The detailed molecular features that control high affinity binding of apoE to the LRP and HSPG are not yet defined fully..

To predict the distribution of apoE to different receptors, such as LDLR, LRP, and HSPG, however, it is also important to establish the kinetics of apoE-receptor association and dissociation because receptor/ligand interactions at the cell surface do not occur at equilibrium. In this study, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were employed to determine the affinity and kinetics of the interaction of engineered apoE molecules in the lipid-free and lipidated states with heparin. Using this approach, we provide novel insights into the mechanism of apoE/heparin interaction..

A streptavidin SA sensor chip was pretreated with three consecutive 5- microl injections of 50 mM NaOH in 1 M NaCl to remove nonspecifically bound contaminants. For immobilization of heparin on a SA chip, an injection of biotinylated heparin (10  microg/ml) in Tris buffer was made at a flow rate of 5  microl/min followed by a 10- microl injection of 2 M NaCl. Typically, 30 to 200 resonance units of heparin were immobilized, and the effects of mass transport were not significant because of the low surface density of ligand (35). An untreated flow cell was used as a control. For kinetic measurement of apoE interaction with heparin, a 30- microl injection of the apoE sample was passed over the sensor surface at a flow rate of 10  microl/min. At the end of the sample plug, the same buffer was passed over the sensor surface to facilitate dissociation. After 3 min of dissociation time, the sensor surface was regenerated for the next sample using a 10- microl pulse of 2 M NaCl.

The kinetic data were not fitted well by a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, as indicated by the large value of the goodness of fit (2 = 100) (Fig. 2, inset). However, significantly improved fit (2 = 7.4) was obtained using a two-state binding model, indicating that binding of apoE to heparin involves either a sequential two-step process or some conformational change (36, 37). The response curve of heparin binding of the apoE3 22-kDa fragment also showed two-state binding kinetics (Fig. 3A). Changing the injection time revealed that the dissociation rate was progressively decreased after longer injection (contact) time (Fig. 3A, inset), indicating that the stability of the initial apoE-heparin complex increases over time (36, 37). Such an effect of contact time on dissociation rate was not seen in the apoE 10-kDa binding to heparin, because the contribution of the second binding step to the overall process was very small (Fig. 3B).

As shown in Fig. 4, no change in the spectra of the apoE 22-kDa fragment was observed in the absence or presence of heparin. The -helix contents derived from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm were in the range of 47 to 49% up to a heparin: apoE weight ratio of 2 (Fig. 4, inset), indicating that there is no change in the secondary structure in apoE upon heparin binding. The four-helix bundle of the apoE 22-kDa fragment is known to open upon lipid binding (27, 28). To further confirm that any such conformational change in apoE is not involved in the two-state binding to heparin, we tested the heparin binding of the triple interhelical disulfide-linked apoE4 22-kDa mutant in which the opening of the four-helix bundle is completely restricted (27). SPR sensorgrams of heparin binding of this mutant still exhibited two-state binding kinetics (data not shown), indicating that a conformational change, such as the opening of the helix bundle, was not involved in the two-state binding for the apoE/heparin interaction..

As shown in Fig. 5, large decreases in binding responses were observed with the apoE3 K146E mutant, whereas the apoE3 K233E mutant exhibited responses similar to the wild type (WT), consistent with the previous observations using heparin-Sepharose gel in which only Lys-146 plays a dominant role in heparin binding of full-length apoE (22). Fig. 6A summarizes relative changes in rate constants for each mutant as well as for mutants K146Q and K233Q. Replacement of the lysines significantly affected the first association rate but had no effect on the rate constants for the second step. The relative contributions of each step to the overall free energy of binding were estimated from the affinity constants for the two individual steps (Fig. 6B) (42). Although the first binding step contributes the largest part of the free energy of binding in all proteins, significant decreases in the favorable free energy of binding for the first step were observed in the K146Q and K146E mutants, without any changes in the second step..

A previous SPR study indicated that the three full-length apoE isoforms have similar affinities for heparin (32). However, as shown in Fig. 7A, full-length apoE2 exhibited a somewhat slower first association rate and higher Kd value than full-length apoE3. Regarding the 22-kDa fragments, although apoE2 displayed a slower rate, and apoE4 a faster rate, in the first association phase compared with apoE3, the Kd values were similar among the three isoforms (Fig. 7B). Overall, these results indicate that apoE2 tends to bind to heparin with somewhat less affinity than apoE3 and apoE4 because of the slower first binding step..

To examine the possibility that similar requirements are necessary for heparin binding, we used two apoE3 22-kDa mutants for SPR measurements. The first was a (K143R/K146R) mutant in which the conservative substitution of two lysines with arginines decreases the affinity for the LDLR to 30% of the WT value. The second was a (L141K/K143L/K146L/L148K) mutant in which the exchange of lysines and leucines (which disrupts the -helical structure spanning residues 140 to 150 without altering the net charge) eliminates binding to the LDLR (30). Because lipid association is required for the high affinity binding of apoE to the LDLR (26), we used discoidal complexes of apoE 22-kDa fragments for SPR measurements to compare their LDLR binding abilities. The apoE3 22-kDa fragment-DMPC discoidal complex displayed a second order higher first association rate constant than the lipid-free protein, resulting in much higher affinity binding to heparin (cf. Tables I and II) (22). Among apoE isoforms complexed with DMPC, there was no significant difference in association and dissociation rate constants and equilibrium affinity (Table II). The mutation (K143R/K146R) had no effect on the kinetics and affinity for binding to heparin, indicating that charge specificity of basic residues is not required for effective binding to heparin. In contrast, the (L141K/K143L/K146L/L148K) mutant exhibited much lower responses in heparin binding than the WT apoE3 22-kDa fragment in the lipidated state (Fig. 8), suggesting that the amphipathic nature of the -helix spanning residues 140 to 150 is critical for the heparin binding of apoE. Interestingly, this mutation led to an increased favorable free energy of binding in the second step as well as a decrease in free energy of the first step (Fig. 9), but the overall Kd value was not significantly different from WT (Table II)..

It is known that, when a protein binds to heparin, it can induce a change in conformation within heparin and/or the protein (43). For the interaction between antithrombin and heparin, the initial interaction induces a conformational change in antithrombin that enables additional interactions between antithrombin and heparin, resulting in stronger binding (44). There is also evidence that the relatively flexible 2-sulfoiduronic acid residue in heparin can change its conformation upon protein binding, resulting in a better fit and enhanced binding (43). However, our CD measurements for the apoE/heparin mixture demonstrated that heparin binding does not induce a change in the secondary structure of apoE (Fig. 4). Taken together with the SPR data for the triple interhelical disulfide-linked apoE4 22-kDa mutant showing two-state binding to heparin, it appears that the two-state apoE/heparin interaction observed in SPR measurements is not due to any major conformational change in apoE upon heparin binding..

In fact, molecular modeling for the interaction between the heparin binding site of apoE and heparin fragment suggested that eight polar residues including Lys-146 directly contact with sulfate or carboxyl groups on the heparin chain (21). Thus, the large reductions in the association rate and favorable free energy in the first binding step for Lys-146 mutants (Fig. 6) are consistent with the first step involving fast electrostatic interaction between basic residues in apoE and acidic groups in heparin. In addition, analysis of the dependence of Kd values on sodium chloride concentration (data not shown) using the protein/polyelectrolyte interaction theory (46) indicated that there are 3.3 and 2.7 charged residues, respectively, involved in the electrostatic component of the overall and the first binding process in the apoE/heparin interaction. The similarity in these two values also supports the idea that electrostatic interaction is involved in the first binding step..

In fact, molecular modeling of the apoE/heparin interaction predicts formation of hydrogen bonding between some residues such as Lys-143 in apoE and heparin, and also hydrophobic interaction between the shallow groove of the -helix of apoE and the saccharide chains of heparin (21). In this regard, the significant increase in the contribution of the second step to the free energy of binding observed for the (L141K/K143L/K146L/L148K) mutant (Fig. 9), in which disruption of the amphipathic -helix in the heparin binding region destabilizes the N-terminal helix bundle and exposes the hydrophobic surface (30), implies that hydrophobic interaction between apoE and heparin contributes to the second binding step. In addition, we found that SPR data of the interaction of brain natriuretic peptide with heparin, in which the major contribution to the free energy of binding comes from hydrogen bonding interaction (47) displayed two-state binding, and the first binding step contributed most of the overall free energy of binding (data not shown). This suggests that hydrogen bonding may be involved mostly in the first binding step..

In addition, apoE2 that is highly defective in LDLR binding (23) exhibited similar heparin binding activity to apoE3 in both lipid-free and lipidated states (Fig. 7 and Table II). These results are consistent with previous observations that the requirements for the high affinity binding of apoE to HSPG/heparin are less stringent than for binding to the LDLR (6). It has been suggested that the multiple basic residues in the receptor binding region (residues 136 to 150) of apoE are required to have a particular orientation for optimal binding to the LDLR (48). Indeed, comparison of the structure of residues 135 to 151 between lipid-free and lipid-associated apoE showed a significantly different curvature and that the basic residues are less scattered, forming a better aligned and more elongated hydrophilic surface in the lipidated form (49, 50). In addition, our nuclear magnetic resonance studies (29, 51) demonstrated that lipid interaction increases positive electrostatic potential around lysines 143 and 146 and that these effects are much less in apoE2. Taken together, it appears that the enhanced electrostatic potential around residues 136 to 150 in apoE, required for the interaction with the LDLR, is not necessary for the high affinity binding to heparin..

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	58	Previous studies of the relative strengths of heparin binding of arginine and lysine demonstrated that the former binds 2.5 times more tightly (52). Indeed, we found from SPR measurements that the lipid-free substitution mutant (K143R/K146R) displayed a 2.6 times higher affinity to heparin than WT (data not shown). However, as shown in Table II, this double substitution of lysines with arginines had no effect on the kinetics and affinity of the binding of lipidated apoE to heparin, although this mutant exhibits much reduced binding affinity to the LDLR (30). It follows that there is no preference between lysine and arginine at these positions for the heparin binding of lipid-associated apoE. Disruption of the -helical structure in region 140 to 150 by the mutation (L141K/K143L/K146L/L148K) greatly affected the kinetics of binding to heparin (Fig. 8 and Table II), but this mutant still displayed overall heparin binding affinity similar to WT (Table II). This suggests that an amphipathic -helical structural motif in the receptor binding region of apoE is not critical for the effective binding to heparin; this is in contrast to the situation with LDLR binding. Such somewhat surprising results may arise because the appropriate arrangement of basic residues required for the interaction with heparin is still maintained in the discoidal complex of this mutant. Presumably, cooperative binding through multiple copies of the heparin binding sites of apoE molecules is important in determining the heparin binding ability of apoE bound to lipid particles (22)..
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	59	Implications for the Sequestration Role of HSPG in Remnant Lipoprotein Metabolism Our SPR kinetic data for the apoE/heparin interaction provide novel insights into the mechanism of the HSPG-LRP pathway for remnant lipoprotein uptake by cells (Fig. 10). In this pathway, apoE is postulated to interact initially with cell-surface HSPG and then transfer to the LRP for internalization (6). Because only limited kinetic parameters for the apoE/LRP interaction are available (33), we can only compare our kinetic parameters of binding of lipidated apoE to heparin with those to the related LDLR (53, 54). Because of the fast association of lipidated apoE in the first binding step to heparin through long range and nondirectional ionic interactions (Table II), it follows that apoE-enriched remnant particles can be captured rapidly by the abundant HSPG on the cell surface. Fast dissociation in this step is likely to allow a rapid transfer of remnant particles to the LRP associated closely with HSPG (55). The LRP could then retain the remnant particles at the cell surface until endocytosis occurs because of the very slow dissociation rate of the apoE-receptor complex (10 to 5 s to 1) (53). Such a process would be more efficient than direct binding of remnant particles in solution to the LRP, because remnant particles concentrated on the cell surface could diffuse in two dimensions by rapidly exchanging between HSPG binding sites until they collide with the LRP to form the LRP-remnant particle complex. This lateral diffusion on the cell surface is reminiscent of the "scooting mode" proposed for the interfacial reaction of phospholipases (56). It is also possible that some initial complexes of HSPG-remnant particle would undergo the second binding step, forming a more stable complex for internalization without LRP involvement..

The apoE-enriched remnant lipoproteins are first captured through the fast association of apoE with cell-surface HSPG. Because of the fast dissociation rate of this interaction, remnant lipoproteins are rapidly transferred to the LRP to form a stable complex (characterized by slow dissociation) for endocytosis. Some initial complexes of HSPG-remnant particle would undergo the second binding step, forming a more stable complex for internalization..
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	61	  In summary, we have characterized the kinetics and affinity of the interaction of apoE with heparin using SPR. Our data show that the binding of apoE to heparin is a two-step process, the fast initial binding involving a polar interaction followed by relatively slow nonpolar interaction. We propose that the fast association and dissociation process in the apoE/HSPG interaction plays a role in the HSPG-LRP pathway, in which remnant lipoproteins are rapidly captured by HSPG and then transferred to the LRP to form a stable complex for internalization..

0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   To identify the residues in the carboxyl-terminal region 260 to 299 of human apolipoprotein E (apoE) that contribute to hypertriglyceridemia, two sets of conserved, hydrophobic amino acids between residues 261 and 283 were mutated to alanines, and recombinant adenoviruses expressing these apoE mutants were generated. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of apoE4-mut1 (apoE4 (L261A, W264A, F265A, L268A, V269A)) in apoE-deficient mice (apoE to / to ) corrected plasma cholesterol levels and did not cause hypertriglyceridemia. In contrast, gene transfer of apoE4-mut2 (apoE4 (W276A, L279A, V280A, V283A)) did not correct hypercholesterolemia and induced mild hypertriglyceridemia. ApoE-induced hyperlipidemia was corrected by co-infection with a recombinant adenovirus expressing human lipoprotein lipase. Both apoE4 mutants caused only a small increase in hepatic very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride secretion. Density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis of plasma and electron microscopy showed that wild-type apoE4 and apoE4-mut2 displaced apoA-I from the high density lipoprotein (HDL) region and promoted the formation of discoidal HDL, whereas the apoE4-mut1 did not displace apoA-I from HDL and promoted the formation of spherical HDL.

Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of apoE4-mut1 (apoE4 (L261A, W264A, F265A, L268A, V269A)) in apoE-deficient mice (apoE to / to ) corrected plasma cholesterol levels and did not cause hypertriglyceridemia. In contrast, gene transfer of apoE4-mut2 (apoE4 (W276A, L279A, V280A, V283A)) did not correct hypercholesterolemia and induced mild hypertriglyceridemia. ApoE-induced hyperlipidemia was corrected by co-infection with a recombinant adenovirus expressing human lipoprotein lipase. Both apoE4 mutants caused only a small increase in hepatic very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride secretion. Density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis of plasma and electron microscopy showed that wild-type apoE4 and apoE4-mut2 displaced apoA-I from the high density lipoprotein (HDL) region and promoted the formation of discoidal HDL, whereas the apoE4-mut1 did not displace apoA-I from HDL and promoted the formation of spherical HDL. The findings indicate that residues Leu-261, Trp-264, Phe-265, Leu-268, and Val-269 of apoE are responsible for hypertriglyceridemia and also interfere with the formation of HDL. Substitutions of these residues by alanine provide a recombinant apoE form with improved biological functions..

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that apoE mutants that prevent binding of apoE-containing lipoproteins to the LDL receptor are associated with high plasma cholesterol levels and cause premature atherosclerosis in humans and experimental animals (2 to 4). ApoE promotes cholesterol efflux (5, 6) and thus may contribute to cell and tissue cholesterol homeostasis and protection from atherosclerosis (7, 8). ApoE is also a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (9, 10) and may contribute to lipid homeostasis in the brain (11)..

It was shown that overexpression of full-length apoE (by infection of mice with 1 to 2 x 109 pfu) did not correct the high cholesterol levels of the apoE to / to  mice, in contrast, it increased VLDL triglyceride secretion and induced hypertriglyceridemia (12 to 16). Overexpression of apoE3 or apoE4 also aggravated the hypercholesterolemia in apoE2 knock-in mice (17). However the high cholesterol profile of apoE to / to  mice or the apoE2 knock-in mice was corrected by infection with truncated apoE forms lacking different segments of the carboxyl-terminal domain (12 to 17). The hypertriglyceridemia induced by full-length apoE was independent of the apoE phenotype and mouse strain and could be corrected by overexpression of lipoprotein lipase (15). In normal C57BL6 mice overexpression of full-length apoE induced combined hyperlipidemia characterized by high cholesterol and high triglycerides levels, whereas truncated apoE forms did not change the plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels of these mice (13). Finally, truncated apoE forms could not correct the high cholesterol profiles of the apoE to / to  x LDLr to / to  double-deficient mice but did not induce hypertriglyceridemia, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal region of apoE is responsible for the hypertriglyceridemia (15, 16). Use of a series of apoE deletion mutants extending from amino acid 1 to amino acids 185, 202, 229, or 259 mapped the region responsible for the hypertriglyceridemia between amino acids 260 and 299 of apoE (12 to 17).

Thus, the apoE levels were reduced from an average value of 125 mg/dl in mice infected with the apoE4-expressing adenovirus, 2 to 6 days postinfection, to an average value of 10 mg/dl in mice infected with apoE4- and lipoprotein lipase-expressing adenoviruses (Fig. 6C). The lipoprotein lipase treatment reduced apoE levels from an average value of 150 mg/dl in mice treated with apoE4-mut2 alone to an average value of 40 mg/dl in mice treated with apoE4-mut2 and lipoprotein lipase (Fig. 6I). It is interesting that the greatest levels of apoE on days 2 and 3 postinfection with the apoE4-mut2-expressing adenovirus are associated with mild hypertriglyceridemia (Fig. 6, H and I). In contrast, the apoE levels of apoE4-mut1 remained high (average value of 170 mg/dl) with or without treatment with the LpL-expressing adenovirus (Fig. 6F)..

ApoE was cleared in mice treated with apoE4 and LpL, partially cleared in mice treated with apoE4-mut2 and LpL, and was unaffected in mice treated with apoE4-mut1 and LpL. The average apoE levels with or without treatment with lipoprotein lipase 2 to 6 days postinfection changed from 125 mg/dl to 10 mg/dl for apoE4, 150 mg/dl to 40 mg/dl for apoE4-mut2, and remained the same (170 mg/dl) for apoE4-mut1. The findings indicate that wild-type apoE4 resides on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles and following the hydrolysis of the triglycerides of these particles by LpL, apoE4 is recognized and cleared as a component of the remnant particles by the LDL-receptor. It appears that the majority of the mutant apoE4-mut1 may reside in another population of triglyceride-poor particles that are not cleared by the LDL receptor. Finally, the apoE4-mut2 may be partitioned in triglyceride-rich particles that are processed by LpL and cleared by the LDL receptor and triglyceride-poor particles that are not cleared by the LDL receptor. It is possible that the mutations introduced in apoE4-mut1 and to a lesser extent in apoE4-mut2 may have promoted the formation of triglyceride-poor apoE-containing lipoprotein particles that accumulate in the HDL region of these mice..
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	70	An important clue on the nature of the hypertriglyceridemic lipoprotein particles that accumulate in the plasma of the mice is provided by the clearance of apoE in mice co-infected with wild-type or mutant forms of apoE- and LpL-expressing adenoviruses. ApoE was cleared in mice treated with apoE4 and LpL, partially cleared in mice treated with apoE4-mut2 and LpL, and was unaffected in mice treated with apoE4-mut1 and LpL. The average apoE levels with or without treatment with lipoprotein lipase 2 to 6 days postinfection changed from 125 mg/dl to 10 mg/dl for apoE4, 150 mg/dl to 40 mg/dl for apoE4-mut2, and remained the same (170 mg/dl) for apoE4-mut1. The findings indicate that wild-type apoE4 resides on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles and following the hydrolysis of the triglycerides of these particles by LpL, apoE4 is recognized and cleared as a component of the remnant particles by the LDL-receptor. It appears that the majority of the mutant apoE4-mut1 may reside in another population of triglyceride-poor particles that are not cleared by the LDL receptor. Finally, the apoE4-mut2 may be partitioned in triglyceride-rich particles that are processed by LpL and cleared by the LDL receptor and triglyceride-poor particles that are not cleared by the LDL receptor. It is possible that the mutations introduced in apoE4-mut1 and to a lesser extent in apoE4-mut2 may have promoted the formation of triglyceride-poor apoE-containing lipoprotein particles that accumulate in the HDL region of these mice..

In contrast, apoE-mut1 (L261A, W264A, F265A, L268A, and V269A) did not displace apoA-I from the HDL region and did not affect the formation of spherical HDL particles. The findings suggest that when WT apoE4 or apoE4-mut2 is overexpressed, they may influence the formation or the stability of HDL. The effect of the apoE mutations on the biosynthesis and catabolism of VLDL and HDL is summarized in Fig. 9, A to C..

Both processes are expected to reduce the levels of HDL. The undesirable property of WT apoE to reduce plasma HDL levels can be overcome in the recombinant apoE4-mut1, were the hydrophobic residues in the 261 to 269 region were mutated into alanines..

BChE activity in the brain increases with age over 60 years and is elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (2 ,3 ). Histochemically reactive BChE is associated with amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and with amyloid angiopathy in AD (4 -8 ). We have looked for possible associations of AD with two of the more common human variants of the gene for BChE (BCHE), the atypical allele and the K variant (BCHE-K). The latter has a point mutation at nucleotide 1615 (GCA - >  ACA) which changes Ala539 to threonine and the catalytic activity is reduced by a third (9 ). BCHE-K is thought to have an allelic frequency of ~0.12 in Caucasians (9 -11 ). RESULTS.

In subjects >65 years without APOE [epsilon]4, the allelic frequency of BCHE-K was 0.14 in 22 confirmed AD cases and 0.11 in 72 controls. There was thus no association of BCHE-K with late-onset AD in subjects lacking an APOE [epsilon]4 allele. In APOE [epsilon]4 carriers, however, BCHE-K allelic frequencies in subjects aged >65 years were 0.18 in 52 confirmed AD cases and only 0.03 in 32 controls; in subjects aged >75 years the frequencies were 0.23 in 24 confirmed AD cases and 0.02 in 22 controls. These results gave odds ratios of confirmed AD of 6.9 and 12.8 for BCHE-K in APOE [epsilon]4 carriers aged >65 years and >75 years, respectively (Table 2 ).

In subjects over 65 years, the odds ratio in those who only carry BCHE-K was 1.1 and in those with only APOE [epsilon]4 it was 3.8. This gave a predicted odds ratio of 4.2 in subjects with both genes, on the assumption of independent effects of the two genes, compared with the observed value of 30.2. In subjects over 75 years, the predicted odds ratio was 1.7, but the observed odds ratio was 36. We therefore suggest that there is strong synergy between these two alleles in late-onset AD.

Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that BCHE-K is associated with a further increase in the risk of late-onset AD in APOE [epsilon]4 carriers. The effect could be due to linkage disequilibrium with another gene on chromosome 3, conceivably transferrin, whose C2 variant was reported to be more common in 20 clinically diagnosed AD cases than in the general population (14 ). BCHE is at 3q26.1-q26.2 (15 ), while the gene for transferrin is at 3q21-q25 (16 ). On the other hand, the effect on late-onset AD might be mediated by BCHE-K itself. Biological plausibility.

Both proteins are produced in quantity in the liver and secreted into the circulation (1 ,17 ). Not only apoE, but probably also BChE, interact with lipoproteins (18 ,19 ). Both proteins are found in astrocytes (20 ,21 ) and in other glia, BChE in oligodendrocytes (22 ) and apoE in microglia (23 ). Both proteins occur in AD in plaques, intra- and extracellular neurofibrillary tangles and in association with amyloid angiopathy (7 ,8 ,24 ,25 ). Furthermore, both BChE and apoE have been implicated in certain models of neurite growth (26 -31 ). In the case of apoE, there are differences between the E3 and E4 isoforms (29 -31 ) and, in the case of BChE, it has been suggested that the nature of the attached sugar residues may be important (26 -28 ). It should be noted that the K variant of BChE has an additional threonine residue at position 539, but whether this is a potential O-glycosylation site (or, indeed, a phosphorylation site) remains to be shown. Furthermore, a threonine residue has a high propensity for [beta]-sheet formation (32 ). In lysozyme, conversion of an isoleucine residue to threonine causes amyloidosis (33 ), as does conversion of an alanine residue to threonine in transthyretin (34 )..

Thus, subject to confirmation of our results, several millions of the elderly who carry both these genes are at high risk of developing AD, especially when aged over 75 years. As pointed out by Roses (36 ), the ability to identify such at-risk individuals has major social and ethical implications. Since APOE [epsilon]4 is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it will be important to see whether carriers who also have BCHE-K are at greater risk of cardiovascular disease. Such a study would not only have clinical relevance but could also increase our understanding about the role of vascular risk factors (37 ) in the aetiology of AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS.

It has been proposed that at least two other polymorphisms in the promoter of the APOE gene ( to 219G > T and  to 491A > T) might also contribute to disease susceptibility, and modulate the impact of structural changes in the ApoE protein, by altering its expression. In order to assess the extent of cis-acting influences on APOE expression in human brain, highly quantitative measures of allele discrimination were applied to cortical RNA from individuals heterozygous for the epsilon alleles. A small, but significant, increase in the expression of 4 allele was observed relative to that of the 3 and 2 alleles (P < 0.0001). Similar differences were observed in brain tissue from confirmed LOAD subjects, and between cortical regions BA10 (frontopolar) and BA20 (inferior temporal). Stratification of 4/3 allelic expression ratios according to heterozygosity for the  to 219G > T promoter polymorphism revealed significantly lower relative expression of haplotypes containing the  to 219T allele (P=0.02). Our data indicate that, in human brain, most of the cis-acting variance in APOE expression is accounted for by the 4 haplotype, but there are additional, small, cis-acting influences associated with promoter genotype..

Transgenic mouse models indicate that APOE dosage can significantly influence pathological hallmarks of human Alzheimer's disease, including amyloid deposition and neuritic degeneration (9,10). Furthermore, that cis-acting regulatory variants in human APOE have the potential to influence LOAD susceptibilty is suggested by a study in which variation in quantitative measures of peripheral lipid metabolism were better explained by considering genotype data from additional polymorphic sites in the vicinity of APOE, rather than 2 to 4 status alone (11). It should, however, be noted that the implications of that study for Alzheimer's disease are unknown, as it is unclear if those aspects of APOE function as indexed by peripheral lipid metabolism are relevant to LOAD pathogenesis. Moreover, the extent of cis-acting influences on APOE expression in human brain is also currently unclear..

By comparing the relative expression of alleles within individuals, the assay has a perfect internal control for variables such as RNA quality, disease status (with the exception of multiplicative effects between other risk factors and gene expression), cell loss as a result of degenerative changes and the trans-acting effects of other loci or environmental factors (e.g. cause of death, drug treatment, nutritional status, etc.). All of these variables can be expected to influence each allelic variant of mRNA equally. The assay therefore permits detection of small cis-acting influences on gene expression, even with a background of large inter-individual variation in total gene expression, a feature that has been previously observed in studies of total APOE mRNA expression (20). A further advantage is that the assay is robust to secondary effects on gene expression. For example, possession of an allele that influences disease as a result of impaired protein function might, by trans-acting homeostatic mechanisms, result in a compensatory increase in gene expression..

0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	59	The conditional probabilities for diplotypes suggest that, for 15% of  to 219G > T heterozygotes (i.e. two of the 13), the higher expression  to 219G allele is in phase with 4 in 34 individuals. As we do not know which, if any, individual diplotypes in this analysis are misclassified, we cannot accurately assess the impact of this on our estimate of the magnitude of effect. However, if we assume that the two heterozygotes displaying the least reduction in 4/3 ratio are misclassified, we obtain an estimate of the maximum possible size of the effect. Excluding these from analysis reveals a mean net effect of the 219T allele of a 6% reduction in relative 4 expression. We stress that this analysis provides a guide to the maximum effect; we cannot conclude that the effect is of this size because we have no compelling case to exclude any single individual from the analysis..

In the present study, heterozygosity at this site did not significantly influence relative 4 expression in any one direction. It should be noted, however, that power to detect a small, directional effect would have been diminished by the small sample size and low predicted consistency of phase. Interestingly, although only a single observation of all assayed samples, the one showing the greatest elevation in relative 334C (4) expression (25%) was also the only sample in which, with high probability (0.99), the  to 491A (high expression predicted in vitro) nucleotide was in phase with both  to 219G (high expression in vitro and in this study) and 334C (high expression in this study)..

In vitro work requires analysis of the effects of variants in alien genomic and cellular contexts, and therefore the findings must be examined for compatibility in vivo. Nevertheless, without in vitro work, while associations can be observed, it is impossible to attribute in vivo effects on expression to specific variants. This would require that the effect of all other cis-acting variants on the same haplotype be controlled for effectively an impossible task, as the relevant variants could be legion, and distributed across large genomic sequences..

0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	64	To summarize, using a relatively large series of brain samples, we have demonstrated that any common influences on APOE expression attributable to cis-acting polymorphism are small. We have also effectively excluded the existence of even fairly rare cis-acting haplotypes of large effect. Of the variance that does occur, most is accounted for by the 4 haplotype, with the 4 allele of APOE being expressed at a significantly higher level than 3. This is highly reproducible and appears to be independent of AD status. We have also shown that the  to 219G promoter allele is associated with higher expression of APOE mRNA in vivo, a finding compatible with previous in vitro studies. Our study provides important functional in vivo plausibility to the existing body of association data, suggesting that the  to 219T promoter polymorphism may modulate risk of AD independent of APOE epsilon status (16). However, though demonstration of functionality enhances the case, strong genetic support from samples that are larger than are currently available to any single group is now required to force the conclusion that the extremely small effects we have observed are relevant to LOAD susceptibility..

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Apolipoprotein E (apoE), a chaperone for the amyloid (A) peptide, regulates the deposition and structure of A that deposits in the brain in Alzheimer disease (AD). The primary apoE receptor that regulates levels of apoE in the brain is unknown. We report that the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) regulates the cellular uptake and central nervous system levels of astrocyte-derived apoE. Cells lacking LDLR were unable to appreciably endocytose astrocyte-secreted apoE-containing lipoprotein particles. Moreover, cells overexpressing LDLR showed a dramatic increase in apoE endocytosis and degradation. We also found that LDLR knock-out (Ldlr-/-) mice had a significant, 50% increase in the level of apoE in the cerebrospinal fluid and extracellular pools of the brain. However, when the PDAPP mouse model of AD was bred onto an Ldlr-/- background, we did not observe a significant change in brain A levels either before or after the onset of A deposition. Interestingly, human APOE3 or APOE4 (but not APOE2) knock-in mice bred on an Ldlr-/- background had a 210% and 380% increase, respectively, in the level of apoE in cerebrospinal fluid. These results demonstrate that central nervous system levels of both human and murine apoE are directly regulated by LDLR. Although the increase in murine apoE caused by LDLR deficiency was not sufficient to affect A levels or deposition by 10 months of age in PDAPP mice, it remains a possibility that the increase in human apoE3 and apoE4 levels caused by LDLR deficiency will affect this process and could hold promise for therapeutic targets in AD..

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Alzheimer disease (AD)1 is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is the most common cause of dementia. One of the key pathological hallmarks of AD is the deposition of the 39 to 43-amino acid amyloid (A) peptide in the form of both diffuse (thioflavine-S/Congo red-negative) and fibrillar (thioflavine-S/Congo red-positive) plaques. An abundance of data suggests that conversion of A from soluble to insoluble forms is an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. The A peptide is generated from cleavage of the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the predominant species being A40 and,to a lesser extent, A42 (1). Although accounting for  < 1% of all cases, early-onset, autosomal-dominant forms of AD have been identified that share the common feature of an overall increase in A levels or a relative elevation in the more fibrillogenic A42 throughout life, ultimately resulting in early A deposition and plaque formation. Identification of these familial AD cases has led to the generation of several APP transgenic mouse models that recapitulate many aspects of A deposition and associated pathology (2)..

An abundance of data suggests that conversion of A from soluble to insoluble forms is an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. The A peptide is generated from cleavage of the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the predominant species being A40 and,to a lesser extent, A42 (1). Although accounting for  < 1% of all cases, early-onset, autosomal-dominant forms of AD have been identified that share the common feature of an overall increase in A levels or a relative elevation in the more fibrillogenic A42 throughout life, ultimately resulting in early A deposition and plaque formation. Identification of these familial AD cases has led to the generation of several APP transgenic mouse models that recapitulate many aspects of A deposition and associated pathology (2)..

Abundant data suggest that apoE is linked to AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy due to its ability to act as an A chaperone (4) and influence A metabolism. By acting as an A-binding molecule, apoE influences the amount of A deposition and the conformation in which A aggregates, as well as A clearance and toxicity in vivo (5 to 8). Furthermore, the level of apoE in the brain directly influences all of the aforementioned processes (5 to 8). For example, APP transgenic mice lacking apoE develop less A deposition and virtually no fibrillar A deposits (5, 9, 10). Thus, understanding the cellular events and receptors that regulate apoE levels in brain may give important insights into AD pathogenesis..

Furthermore, apoE in the CNS is derived from within the CNS and not the plasma (11). However, in the CNS, apoE-containing lipoproteins differ from those found in the periphery in both the amount of sialation and, perhaps more importantly, the type of lipoprotein particle it associates with (12). In the plasma, apoE is in both very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and a subset of high density lipoproteins that also contain other apoproteins. In contrast, CNS apoE is in high density lipoprotein-like lipoproteins that are secreted primarily by astrocytes and, when released by cells, contain apoE as their sole apolipoprotein constituent (12, 13). Despite this information, whether specific apoE receptors regulate the level of apoE in the brain or mediate apoE-dependent clearance of apoE-binding proteins is unknown. Nearly 20 years ago, Brown and Goldstein (14) elucidated the role of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoproteins in plasma, including apoE. Subsequently, other members of the LDLR family have been identified. Many are expressed in brain, and they have been shown in vitro to bind and endocytose lipid-rich lipoproteins that contain apoE (15). To determine whether LDLR family members influence the level of CNS apoE and A metabolism, an AD mouse model was recently bred to mice lacking the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) (16). An increase in A aggregation and deposition was found in these mice. RAP is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein known to influence the folding and level of all LDLR family members, and in this study, levels of both LDLR-related protein (LRP) and LDLR were examined and found to be reduced in the brain of mice lacking RAP (16). Additionally, overexpression of a functional LRP mini-receptor in the PDAPP model led to an increase in the levels of soluble A at advanced stages of deposition, but with no detectable change in A deposition measured histologically (17). Thus, whether other LDLR family members are responsible for brain apoE metabolism and whether they play a role in regulating A levels in vivo remains unclear. Herein, we investigate the role of LDLR in regulation of CNS-derived apoE as well as on brain A levels in a mouse model of AD..

For analysis of human apoE isoforms, Ldlr-/- mice were first bred to wild-type SJL mice to generate Ldlr+/- mice on a mixed C57BL/6J x SJL background. These mice were then bred to human APOE-expressing mice (24) that have been maintained on the same C57BL/6J x SJL background such that all mice analyzed for human apoE experiments were on an identical background. For A analysis, we utilized the PDAPP mice that overexpress human APP751 with a familial AD mutation at position 717 (APPV717F) under control of the neuron-specific platelet-derived growth factor promoter (25). We crossed PDAPP+/-, Ldlr+/- mice with Ldlr+/- mice to generate PDAPP+/-, Ldlr+/+ and PDAPP+/-, Ldlr-/- mice (littermates) on the same mixed genetic background as described previously (7). Hereafter, all mice referred to as PDAPP in this study are hemizygous for the PDAPP transgene (PDAPP+/-). Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (150 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and perfused transcardially with 0.1 M PBS containing heparin (3 units/ml), pH 7.4. One hemibrain was immersion-fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4  degrees C. After fixation, the brain was cryoprotected in PBS containing 30% sucrose at 4  degrees C. Brain regions from the other hemisphere were dissected and frozen on powdered dry ice before analysis. Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) were used where indicated. For PBS-soluble A analysis, tissue was first Dounce homogenized in ice-cold PBS with protease inhibitors and immediately spun for 5 min at 20,000 x g. For carbonate-soluble A analysis, the PBS-insoluble pellet was then homogenized in ice-cold 100 mM carbonate, 50 mM NaCl, pH 11.5, with protease inhibitors and immediately spun for 10 min at 20,000 x g. For carbonate-insoluble A analysis, the carbonate-insoluble pellet was lysed for 3 h with rotation in 5 M guanidine, 50 mM Tris with protease inhibitors.

To detect full-length APP and C-terminal fragments of APP, the blot was probed with CT15 (a generous gift from Dr. Ed Koo, University of California, San Diego, CA), a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal 15 amino acids of APP (29). To detect LRP, blots were probed with rabbit anti-LRP antibody (17).

DiI-labeled apoE lipoprotein particles were readily taken up into endocytic vesicles in wild-type and Lrp-/- cells (Fig. 1A). This punctate pattern of staining is typical of receptor-mediated endocytosis and represents an endosomal/lysosomal distribution of endocytosed ligands. However, cells from Ldlr-/- or double-knock-out Ldlr-/-, Lrp-/- cells showed no appreciable endocytosis of astrocyte-secreted, apoE-containing lipoprotein particles (Fig. 1A).

These cells expressing the different LDLR family members have been shown previously to bind and endocytose control ligands (19). These receptors are the main candidate apoE receptors expressed in the brain (15). Application of 125I-labeled, astrocyte-secreted, apoE-containing lipoprotein particles to cells overexpressing LDLR resulted in a large increase in RAP-inhibitable endocytosis and degradation of apoE (Fig. 1B).

The area of the hippocampus covered by A immunoreactive deposits in tissue sections was 31% higher in 10-month-old PDAPP, Ldlr-/- mice compared with PDAPP, Ldlr+/+ mice (Fig. 4A), but this increase was not statistically significant. Similar results were found for thioflavine-S-positive fibrillar deposits, and comparable results were found in the cortex (data not shown). A biochemical analysis of carbonate-soluble A levels in the hippocampus revealed slight but nonsignificant increases in both A40 (17%) and A42 (53%) of 10-month-old PDAPP, Ldlr-/- mice as compared with PDAPP, Ldlr+/+ mice (Fig. 4B). Carbonate-insoluble A levels in the hippocampus also revealed slight but nonsignificant increases in both A40 (51%) and A42 (10%) of 10-month-old PDAPP, Ldlr-/- mice as compared with PDAPP, Ldlr+/+ mice (Fig. 4C). Whereas Ldlr-/- mice have an increase in plasma cholesterol of 79% compared with wild-type (Ldlr+/+) mice (Fig. 5A), there were no differences in either brain or CSF cholesterol (Fig. 5, B and C). There was also no evidence that the processing of APP (Fig. 5D) or the levels of total APP protein (data not shown) were different between the genotypes. Additionally, hippocampal LRP levels were not altered in the absence of LDLR (data not shown). Thus, although the level of murine apoE is elevated by about 50% in the extracellular CNS pools in Ldlr-/- mice, these data suggest that this degree of change in the level of apoE is not sufficiently increased to significantly affect A levels at young ages or the early stages of A deposition in PDAPP transgenic mice..

To confirm previous findings noted from these mice (33), we assessed plasma cholesterol and apoE and found that both were significantly elevated in the absence of LDLR in all genotypes (data not shown). To determine the extent to which LDLR regulates human apoE levels in the extracellular space of the CNS, we measured apoE levels in the CSF. We found that levels of both human apoE3 and human apoE4 in the CSF were significantly higher by 210% and 380%, respectively, in the absence of the LDLR (Fig. 6A). The level of human apoE2 in the CSF was not significantly altered by the presence or absence of the LDLR (Fig. 6A), as was expected, because the human apoE2 isoform exhibits  < 2% binding to the LDLR (34). However, it is interesting to note that the level of human apoE2 is substantially higher than that of apoE3 or apoE4 in the CSF (Fig. 6A). Despite the increase in human apoE levels in the absence of LDLR, there was no significant increase in the level of brain cholesterol in these mice (Fig. 6B)..

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	38	Our in vitro data indicate that LDLR family members including LRP, VLDL receptor, and apoER2 are not able to appreciably internalize and degrade astrocyte-secreted apoE-containing lipoproteins. Previous work has clearly demonstrated that these LDLR family members are able to efficiently bind and endocytose apoE reconstituted in large, cholesterol-rich lipoprotein particles termed -VLDL (35). However, these -VLDL particles differ from astrocyte-secreted apoE in lipid composition, the presence of other apoproteins, and the amount of sialation (12). The apolipoprotein lipidation state does alter receptor binding characteristics. For example, our previous studies have shown that recombinant apoE in the absence of lipid prefers binding to LRP over the LDLR (22). This is not a form of apoE that has been shown to be present under physiological conditions. Together, these results indicate that the lipid content and form of apoE lipoprotein particles can alter their receptor binding specificity. They also demonstrate that the LDLR is an important apoE receptor that regulates human and murine apoE endocytosis and levels in the brain. Although the results of this study do not rule out that other LDLR family members contribute in some way to the level of apoE in the brain, they clearly show that LDLR plays an important role in brain apoE metabolism..

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	40	Recent studies have shown that increasing or decreasing cellular cholesterol can influence cellular A secretion (36). Although Ldlr-/- mice have elevated plasma cholesterol levels, we found that the level of brain cholesterol is unaffected in these mice as has been previously reported (37). The exact mechanism by which apoE affects AD pathogenesis is unclear. However, a large body of evidence suggests that one mechanism by which it influences the age of onset of AD is by acting as a chaperone for both soluble and insoluble A, thereby influencing A clearance and fibrillogenesis (3, 5, 7, 32). Our current results suggest that although the LDLR regulates extracellular levels of apoE in the brain, a 50% increase in the level of murine apoE over endogenous levels is not sufficient to alter A levels at young ages or the early stages of A deposition in PDAPP mice at 10 months of age. This may represent a ceiling effect of the level of murine apoE or indicate that a larger increase in the level of murine apoE may be necessary to effect a change in A levels in this model. Alternatively, other pathways of apoE-mediated clearance of A play a much larger role in the metabolism of A such as LRP or bulk flow along interstitial fluid drainage pathways. Unfortunately, Lrp-/- mice die in early embryonic stages, and thus the effect of endogenous LRP on brain apoE levels is difficult to assess as shown in this study. Additionally, the LDLR may play a role in A deposition only at later stages of deposition, as was found for LRP in PDAPP mice (17). It is also possible that the LDLR may differentially regulate human apoE isoforms in the CNS to a greater extent than murine apoE and therefore influence A levels and deposition. It is interesting that independent of the effect of the LDLR, the level of apoE in the CSF of human APOE2 mice is significantly higher than that in APOE3 or APOE4 mice. This suggests that in humans, LDLR may play a more important role in regulating CNS apoE levels and AD pathogenesis. Studies of human CSF have reported no significant differences in the level of human apoE between individuals expressing APOE3 or APOE4 alleles, but the level of CSF apoE in APOE2/2 homozygous individuals has not been assessed, to our knowledge. Given that APOE2 has been associated with a decreased risk for developing AD, an intriguing possibility is that the absolute level of apoE present in the brain of these individuals could account for the decrease in risk. Human and murine apoE differ by 25% at the amino acid level, and human apoE isoforms and murine apoE isolated from VLDL have been shown to differentially bind the LDLR (33). Using the PDAPP mouse model, previous studies from our group have shown that expression of human apoE isoforms under the control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter results in a significant delay in deposition compared with mice expressing endogenous murine apoE (7, 32). More recently, the same human apoE knock-in mice used in this study were crossed to PDAPP mice, and both a delay in A deposition and an isoform-dependent effect on A deposition (E4  >  E3 E2) were found (38). Additionally, we have recently replicated this result in the APPsw mouse model of AD utilizing the same APOE3 and APOE4 knock-in mice used in this study (39). Clearly, human apoE isoforms affect A metabolism and deposition differently than murine apoE, but whether this is due to altered clearance and/or structure of A in vivo remains to be determined. Determining the role of LDLR or other receptors or clearance pathways in the brain that are also involved in regulating apoE levels is central to understanding how apoE influences A metabolism and AD pathogenesis..

0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	5	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   ABCA1 is an ATP-binding cassette protein that transports cellular cholesterol and phospholipids onto high density lipoproteins (HDL) in plasma. Lack of ABCA1 in humans and mice causes abnormal lipidation and increased catabolism of HDL, resulting in very low plasma apoA-I, apoA-II, and HDL. Herein, we have used Abca1-/- mice to ask whether ABCA1 is involved in lipidation of HDL in the central nervous system (CNS). ApoE is the most abundant CNS apolipoprotein and is present in HDL-like lipoproteins in CSF. We found that Abca1-/- mice have greatly decreased apoE levels in both the cortex (80% reduction) and the CSF (98% reduction). CSF from Abca1-/- mice had significantly reduced cholesterol as well as small apoE-containing lipoproteins, suggesting abnormal lipidation of apoE. Astrocytes, the primary producer of CNS apoE, were cultured from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice, and nascent lipoprotein particles were collected. Abca1-/- astrocytes secreted lipoprotein particles that had markedly decreased cholesterol and apoE and had smaller apoE-containing particles than particles from Abca1+/+ astrocytes. These findings demonstrate that ABCA1 plays a critical role in CNS apoE metabolism. Since apoE isoforms and levels strongly influence Alzheimer's disease pathology and risk, these data suggest that ABCA1 may be a novel therapeutic target..

In humans, loss-of-function mutations in ABCA1 cause Tangier's disease (6 to 9), which is characterized by accumulation of cholesterol in lymphatic tissues and increased catabolism of abnormally lipidated HDL, resulting in very low levels of plasma HDL and HDL-associated apolipoproteins A-I (apoA-I) and A-II (apoA-II) (10, 11). ABCA1 knock-out mice (Abca1-/-) have been produced, and the mice have a similar phenotype as patients with Tangier's disease (12)..

0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	11	However, neither Tangier's disease patients nor Abca1-/- mice have been examined to determine whether ABCA1 plays a role in lipidation or metabolism of lipoproteins in the central nervous system (CNS). The most abundant apolipoprotein in the CNS is apolipoprotein E (apoE), which is produced within the CNS, primarily by astrocytes and to some extent microglia (13 to 17). ApoE is present in brain tissue and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it is present in HDL-like particles (18 to 20). By analyzing brain tissue, CSF, plasma, and primary astrocyte cultures from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice, we determined that deletion of ABCA1 markedly affects metabolism of apoE and cholesterol in the CNS and in nascent lipoprotein particles secreted by cultured astrocytes. These findings have implications for neurological diseases involving apoE, such as Alzheimer's disease..

This function may occur in the astrocyte secretory pathway or extracellularly. Analysis of nascent lipoprotein particles isolated from conditioned media of primary astrocyte cultures demonstrated that Abca1-/- astrocytes secrete apoE-containing particles of markedly smaller size with reduced cholesterol and apoE, demonstrating that ABCA1 is required by the main cellular producer of apoE in the CNS to normally lipidate apoE. Of the apoE produced by CNS cells such as astrocytes that reach the CSF of Abca1-/- mice, a fraction of the particles present were also abnormally small, although some were of normal size. Thus, there appears to be a mechanism that does not require ABCA1 to lipidate some apoE that reaches the CSF. However, the fact that CSF apoE levels in Abca1-/- were 2% of normal suggests that the non-ABCA1 mediated pathway is inefficient and that most apoE particles produced in the absence of ABCA1-mediated lipidation are rapidly metabolized in the CNS..

This function may occur in the astrocyte secretory pathway or extracellularly. Analysis of nascent lipoprotein particles isolated from conditioned media of primary astrocyte cultures demonstrated that Abca1-/- astrocytes secrete apoE-containing particles of markedly smaller size with reduced cholesterol and apoE, demonstrating that ABCA1 is required by the main cellular producer of apoE in the CNS to normally lipidate apoE. Of the apoE produced by CNS cells such as astrocytes that reach the CSF of Abca1-/- mice, a fraction of the particles present were also abnormally small, although some were of normal size. Thus, there appears to be a mechanism that does not require ABCA1 to lipidate some apoE that reaches the CSF.

ApoE secreted by astrocytes is present in particles that contain approximately an equal mass of apoE, cholesterol, and phospholipids (21). Furthermore, virtually all cholesterol and phospholipids secreted by astrocytes are associated with apoE (33). In contrast, apoJ secreted by astrocytes has very little associated cholesterol or phospholipids (21) and we found that it was present at normal levels in the brains of Abca1-/- mice. Thus, apoJ particles are stable in the absence of ABCA1, possibly because they are normally lipid-poor and do not require extensive lipidation for stability..

Additionally, since Abca1+/- mice had intermediate apoE levels, more subtle alterations in ABCA1 gene dosage and/or functionality may affect apoE metabolism. The Apoe genotype is a major risk factor for both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (34 to 36). The Apoe genotype may also influence neurologic prognosis after intracerebral hemorrhage (37), traumatic brain injury (38), and multiple sclerosis (39). The effects of apoE on AD and CAA are likely to be mediated in large part by the role of apoE role as an amyloid- (A) chaperone that influences A clearance and fibrillogenesis (40). In amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice that develop many of the pathological changes seen in AD and CAA, the level of apoE, regardless of species or genotype, markedly influences the time of onset, conformation, and amount of the A peptide that accumulates in the brain with age (41 to 45). For example, when amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice were crossed to Apoe-/- mice, animals lacking apoE had almost no fibrillar A deposition, neuritic plaques, or CAA, and Apoe+/- mice had less than 50% as much A-related pathology as Apoe+/+ mice (41 to 44). These results show that alterations in CNS apoE levels by as little as 50% have massive effects on AD-like pathology in the CNS. Since ABCA1 regulates both the level of apoE as well as its state of lipidation, modulation of ABCA1 levels or function is likely to directly influence apoE/A interactions along with A deposition and its negative consequences in the brain. In addition to the effects of ABCA1 on apoE, recent studies also suggest that ABCA1 can influence cellular A production (46 to 48). These effects are likely independent of apoE since alterations in ABCA1 expression levels affect A in some cell types that do not express apoE. Several studies also suggest a direct link between Abca1 polymorphisms and risk for AD (32, 49, 50)..

Since apoE levels in the CNS profoundly influence AD and CAA pathology in vivo, modulation of ABCA1 function and levels may be a novel therapeutic target for AD, CAA, and other diseases of the CNS..

0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	4	Possession of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) [epsis]4 allele is the most frequently associated genetic susceptibility factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, new polymorphisms in the regulatory region of the APOE gene have been described. We analysed the effects of three of these mutations (-491 AT, -427 CT and Th1/E47cs) on disease risk in a large case-control study, and tested their impacts on APOE allelic expression in brain tissues. The Th1/E47cs T allele was associated with an increased risk of occurrence of AD, while the -491 T allele was associated with a decreased risk, independently of the APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 polymorphism effect. However, the impact of the Th1/E47cs mutation was the strongest. The -427 CT polymorphism was not associated with the disease. In AD subjects heterozygous for the [epsis]4 allele, analysis of allelic expression showed that the relative expression levels of the [epsis]4 allele were higher than those of the corresponding controls. Consistent with epidemiological data, the relative level of expression of the [epsis]4 allele was modified accordingly to the presence or absence of the two main promoter polymorphisms, indicating, in vivo, the deleterious effect of the Th1/E47cs T allele and the protective effect of the -491 T allele in population. These data indicate that in addition to the qualitative effect of the APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 polymorphisms on the AD occurrence, the quantitative variation of expression of these alleles due to functional APOE promoter mutations, is a key determinant of AD development..

0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	6	The presence of at least one apolipoprotein E (APOE) [epsis]4 allele is a major genetic susceptibility factor for late-onset familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). This risk factor accounts for ~45-60% of cases (1). Indeed, the [epsis]4 allele is associated with an increased risk of AD in an allele dose dependant manner (2,3). Conversely, the [epsis]2 allele protects against the disease (4,5). The mechanisms by which apoE isoforms are implicated in human nervous system physiology and influence the pathogenesis of AD, are not fully understood (2,6-8). The effect of the APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 alleles may not be due only to the intrinsic biochemical properties of the isoforms coded by these alleles. Other genetic variants influencing APOE allele expression may account for the increase or decrease in the level of risk of AD. This hypothesis is supported firstly by preliminary observations of the relative overexpression of the [epsis]4 allele compared with the [epsis]3 allele in the brain of patients with AD, compared with controls (9). Secondly, Th1/E47cs and -491 AT polymorphisms located in the APOE promoter have been described and associated with AD risk (10,11). Moreover the effect of these two polymorphisms on AD occurrence was described separately in case-control studies. This prompted us to analyse the relative contribution of these two promoter polymorphisms, and also a third, located at position -427 of the APOE promoter together with the [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 alleles, towards AD risk in a large case-control study (509 controls and 573 AD cases). Furthermore, we investigated the possible influences of the two main polymorphisms on APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 allelic relative expression in brain tissues, to approach their in vivo functionality, in brain samples from 49 AD cases and 45 controls..

The risk of developing AD for carriers of at least one T allele was 2.13 (95% CI: 1.61-2.83). Conversely, the frequency of the -491 T allele was decreased in patients, compared with controls ([chi]2 = 9.5, P = 0.002). The genotype and allele frequencies of the -491 AT polymorphism were both similar to those observed in the North American population but differed from the Spanish sample (11). The OR to develop AD in subjects bearing at least one -491 T allele was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.52-0.88, P = 0.004). No association with the disease was detected for the -427 CT polymorphism. To eliminate possible confounding effects of the APOE [epsis]4 allele on the association of the Th1/E47cs and -491 AT polymorphisms with AD, we controlled the effects of each allele using logistic regression adjusted for the presence or absence of the [epsis]4 allele. After adjustment, the risk associated with possession of at least one Th1/E47cs T allele persisted (OR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.15-2.11, P = 0.004), while the risk associated with -491 T allele did not (OR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.62-1.10, P = 0.19). This observation suggested that the effect of the Th1/E47cs T allele is independent of that of the [epsis]4 allele, while the -491 T allele is not. However, since the Th1/E47cs G and [epsis]2 alleles are in complete disequilibrium (Table 2), we also performed a logistic regression including both protective and deleterious effects of [epsis]2 and [epsis]4 alleles, respectively.

In particular, estimation of the OR associated with the combination of the [epsis]4 and the Th1/E47cs T allele on the same chromosome indicate an estimated increased risk of 1.7 for the heterozygous [epsis]3/[epsis]4 individuals presenting this haplotype, as described previously (10). Thus, if the [epsis]4 allele is associated with the Th1/E47cs T allele on the same chromosome, while the [epsis]3 allele is associated with the Th1/E47cs G allele on the other, the relative [epsis]4/[epsis]3 mRNA ratio should be significantly increased and associated with AD. Conversely, if both [epsis]4 and [epsis]3 alleles are under the control of the same Th1/E47cs allele, either G or T, the level of expression should be similar. Thus, we expected a stronger distortion in Th1/E47cs heterozygotes than in homozygotes. This argument is clearly illustrated by our experimental data (Table 3). The same approach is valid for the -491 AT mutation..

However, the small size of the [epsis]4/[epsis]4 control population did not allow such an impact to be brought forward; (ii) as a consequence, the measured OR in [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 homozygous individuals mainly depended on the [epsis]3/[epsis]3 population.

Underlining the importance of apoE level, the APOE expression has been shown to correlate with A[beta] peptide deposition in transgenic mice (19,20)..

In [epsis]3[epsis]4 AD cases, both the [epsis]3 and [epsis]4 alleles would be overexpressed, but the [epsis]4 allele, due to the promoter mutations, being still more overexpressed than the [epsis]3 allele. Exacerbation of APOE [epsis]4 expression level may foster the intrinsic deleterious effect of the apoE4 isoform in AD for instance in promoting A[beta] aggregation (2,6,22)..

Indeed, we observed a strong underexpression of the [epsis]4 allele compared with the [epsis]3 allele in controls. Although the role of apoE during maturation and ageing is not completely understood yet, the fact that apoE deficient homozygous mice exhibit reversible dendritic alterations and significant learning deficits in the Morris water maze, suggests neurotrophic capabilities for apoE (23-25). However, the abilities of each isoform may be different since the apoE4 isoform does not have the same effects as the apoE3 isoform on neurite outgrowth (26). For instance, apoE3, but not apoE4, may stabilize the neuronal cytoskeleton (7)..

Indeed, to date, five polymorphisms have been described in the APOE promoter region (10,12). Two of the three polymorphisms studied, seem to play a role in AD. The two remaining have allelic frequencies  < 1% (12), and therefore cannot explain the effects observed in the case-control and mRNA studies. However, it remains possible that other unknown polymorphisms modulate the APOE mRNA level. These new mutations may be far away from the promoter polymorphisms, for instance in the brain tissue specific element (27,28). The interaction between all the putative polymorphisms modifying APOE expression will be very difficult to model. Various combinations of different mutations may confer a large APOE expression heterogeneity at two levels: (i) the absolute level of APOE expression and (ii) the percentage of expression of one allele compared with the other in heterozygous individuals, adding to the complexity of the association between APOE and AD. Therefore, the variation of the APOE expression induced by the APOE promoter polymorphisms may partly explain the heterogeneity of the impact of the [epsis]4 allele in different ethnic groups (1,29)..

The APOE gene, located on human chromosome 19q13.2, is a polymorphic locus represented by three common alleles, 2, 3 and 4. These three alleles encode three APOE isoforms of 34 kDa that differ at amino acid positions 112 and 158. These two amino acid substitutions confer slightly different functions for the respective proteins. The E2 isoform, encoded by the 2 allele, contains a Cys at position 158, in comparison with the Arg found in the E3 and E4 isoforms. The substitution of Cys for Arg alters the positive ion potential within the receptor-binding domain, and thus decreases the affinity of the E2 protein for the LDL receptor to 1% of the normal binding capacity (1,2). Consequently, the level of circulating E2 protein is significantly higher than that of E3. In contrast, the level of E4 protein is significantly lower than that of E3, presumably a consequence of the isoform-specific differences in lipid binding and uptake. The ability of APOE to bind its receptors, which include LDLr, LRP, VLDLr and megalin, members of the LDL receptor family, dictates the efficiency with which these molecules are delivered to the appropriate cells and turned over..

Several studies have implicated a role for cholesterol in the production of Ass, the primary constituent of senile plaques in the AD brain (8 to 12). High serum cholesterol levels in mice transgenic for APP, the precursor protein for the Ass peptide, correlate with increased brain Ass levels and a more severe plaque load (13,14). Retrospective epidemiological studies have demonstrated a decreased AD risk in human populations on statin therapy to lower cholesterol levels (reviewed in 15), although this effect may be indirect, as several studies have shown that statins do not alter the Ass levels in serum (16,17). Several studies have reported an association of elevated serum cholesterol levels with AD risk and levels of Ass (18,19), independent of APOE genotype. Other studies, however, have failed to demonstrate a correlation between serum cholesterol levels and AD development (20). APOE 4 may affect AD risk by conferring high cholesterol levels and thereby increasing Ass production. AD patients with an 4 allele have increased levels of Ass1 to 40 in their brains and CSF, and have more extensive plaque pathology (21,22). Interestingly, the 2 allele, which confers low cholesterol levels, is also considered to be protective against AD development (7)..

These models utilize various promoters to drive the expression of human APOE cDNAs in neurons and glia. This approach has several limitations concerning the regulation of APOE in both the brain and the periphery. First, most APOE transgenic studies have attempted to normalize APOE levels in the APOE 3 or 4 transgenic lines with respect to each other (23) or to endogenous levels (24). However, several human studies suggest that levels of APOE vary with genotype and may impact AD pathogenesis. Second, all APOE transgenic lines have been bred onto the Apoe-null background, which confers high circulating cholesterol levels. Given the role of Apoe in peripheral cholesterol metabolism and the growing evidence for cholesterol levels influencing brain Ass metabolism, it is unclear how the absence of Apoe affects AD pathology in these animals. Importantly, there has been no consensus about the impact of APOE genotype on AD pathogenesis from these studies, perhaps owing to the complications of different promoters and altered levels of APOE in the brain, combined with the complications of a mixed genetic background in these models..

To circumvent these limitations, we took advantage of APOE KI animals generated at the Mitsubishi Kagaku Institute of Life Science, Japan (27). The targeted allele placed the human cDNA for each APOE allele in-frame with the endogenous exon 1 sequence and part of exon 2. This allowed for control of human APOE expression by endogenous regulatory elements, while at the same time removing the mouse Apoe coding sequence. APOE 4 KI mice generated by this strategy were previously published (27). It was demonstrated that human APOE in these mice is expressed in serum and in astrocytes in the correct histological pattern. The APOE KI mice were originally maintained on a mixed C57BL/6;129P2 background and contained a neo selection cassette in the targeted allele. Work from our lab and others has demonstrated that genetic background can greatly influence phenotypic expression, particularly with regards to Ass generation and deposition (28). In addition, several lines of evidence have shown that the strong promoter of neo can influence the expression of both the targeted locus as well as the neighboring genes (29,30). For these reasons, the APOE KI lines were backcrossed onto the defined C57BL/6J (B6) inbred background and also mated to ZP3-cre transgenic mice congenic on the B6 background (31) to remove the neo cassette through cre-mediated loxP excision. The cre transgene was transferred onto the APOE KI background such that the expression of cre in the mouse oocytes of APOE KI females excised the floxed neo cassette in the targeted allele. These females were mated to B6 males, and the resulting offspring inherited the targeted allele lacking the neo tag, as demonstrated by both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, using primers to neo, and by Southern blot (data not shown). Animals lacking the cre transgene were identified in subsequent progeny. Once each APOE KI line was backcrossed five generations (N5, incipient congenic,  > 98% homogeneous) (32), animals were intercrossed to obtain populations of APOE 2/2, 3/3 and 4/4 mice (hereafter referred to as 2 KI, 3 KI and 4 KI, respectively). Animals were PCR genotyped on the basis of the presence of human APOE, using human-specific primers, and the absence of the endogenous Apoe locus, demonstrated by PCR using mouse Apoe-specific primers (data not shown). These mice were then characterized at 6 to 8 weeks of age for a variety of parameters in order to understand how each APOE allele behaves in the mouse with respect to steady-state protein levels and cholesterol metabolism, and how each impacts APP processing and Ass metabolism..

For these reasons, the APOE KI lines were backcrossed onto the defined C57BL/6J (B6) inbred background and also mated to ZP3-cre transgenic mice congenic on the B6 background (31) to remove the neo cassette through cre-mediated loxP excision. The cre transgene was transferred onto the APOE KI background such that the expression of cre in the mouse oocytes of APOE KI females excised the floxed neo cassette in the targeted allele. These females were mated to B6 males, and the resulting offspring inherited the targeted allele lacking the neo tag, as demonstrated by both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, using primers to neo, and by Southern blot (data not shown). Animals lacking the cre transgene were identified in subsequent progeny. Once each APOE KI line was backcrossed five generations (N5, incipient congenic,  > 98% homogeneous) (32), animals were intercrossed to obtain populations of APOE 2/2, 3/3 and 4/4 mice (hereafter referred to as 2 KI, 3 KI and 4 KI, respectively). Animals were PCR genotyped on the basis of the presence of human APOE, using human-specific primers, and the absence of the endogenous Apoe locus, demonstrated by PCR using mouse Apoe-specific primers (data not shown). These mice were then characterized at 6 to 8 weeks of age for a variety of parameters in order to understand how each APOE allele behaves in the mouse with respect to steady-state protein levels and cholesterol metabolism, and how each impacts APP processing and Ass metabolism..

Parallel western blots of recombinant E2, E3 and E4 serial dilutions (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50  microg of protein) were run to determine the affinity of this antibody for each isoform. Standard curves of fluorescent units for each isoform revealed little difference in detection. E4 appeared to be detected slightly less well (data not shown). Levels of APOE protein in each KI animal were compared with a standard homogenate (or serum standard) from a homozygous 3 KI animal. Figure 1 illustrates the differences in APOE levels compared across lines as the ratio of steady-state levels of each sample relative to the standard. APOE 2 KI animals had an average 2-fold higher steady-state level of APOE in both brain and fasted liver when compared with 3 KI and 4 KI animals (Fig. 1A and B, P < 0.001). All three lines had significantly different levels of APOE in the brain. Levels of steady-state APOE in brain were confirmed by a human-specific APOE ELISA, using a standard curve of recombinant E2, E3 or E4 to quantitate levels of each isoform. 2 KI animals demonstrated a 2-fold increase in the level of brain APOE by this method as well (P < 0.001), although E3 and E4 were not significantly different. The difference shown by western blotting in the 3 and 4 lines may be explained by the slightly lower affinity of the antibody for recombinant E4. The level of APOE in fasted serum of 2 KI animals was also significantly higher than those found in 3 KI and 4 KI animals by western blotting (Fig. 1D, P < 0.01). The relationship between genotype and APOE levels in the KI mice recapitulates that observed in human serum (33 to 35)..

The distribution of APOE and cholesterol was analyzed for each profile. Fasted serum from three animals of the same sex was pooled for analysis of each genotype; no sex difference was apparent (data not shown). The profiles for each genotype are shown in Figure 2. APOE 3 KI and 4 KI profiles do not differ from that of B6 wild-type animals, in that the majority of circulating cholesterol is found in the HDL fraction, whereas the VLDL and LDL/IDL fractions are minimal. In contrast, the 2 KI profiles demonstrated that, although the levels of HDL cholesterol remained equal to that found in the other lines, the cholesterol distribution extended to the LDL/IDL fraction and had the highest level in the VLDL fraction. Thus, the increased total cholesterol levels in the 2 KI mice were due to an increase in VLDL and LDL/IDL cholesterol..

We show that APOE KI mice on the defined C57BL/6J background have significantly different levels of APOE in both serum and tissues, as well as significantly different cholesterol levels. APOE increases Ass levels in a genomic-based APP transgenic mouse in the absence of changes in APP processing. Unlike previously reported APOE transgenic models, which express normalized levels of APOE only in the brain, our genomic-based approach allows us to address two hypotheses surrounding the role of APOE 4 as a risk factor for AD. APOE genotype and AD risk in humans correlate with both serum cholesterol levels and steady-state levels of APOE protein. APOE 4, the most significant genetic risk factor for AD, is associated with both high circulating cholesterol levels and reduced steady-state APOE levels. In contrast, APOE 2 is protective against AD and incidentally confers both low serum cholesterol levels and high levels of APOE. Thus, APOE may affect AD risk through its involvement in cholesterol metabolism, shown through diet studies in the mouse to directly affect Ass production. Alternatively, brain APOE levels may influence the clearance efficiency of the Ass peptide and its subsequent deposition..

We show that APOE KI mice on the defined C57BL/6J background have significantly different levels of APOE in both serum and tissues, as well as significantly different cholesterol levels.

APOE is primarily synthesized in the liver and brain; additional sites include the adrenal gland and kidney (38,39). APOE genotype has been shown to correlate with APOE abundance in the periphery (33,40 to 42); the 2 allele confers high APOE, whereas the 4 allele confers low APOE, with respect to 3 levels. The effect of APOE alleles on APOE abundance in the brain and CSF is less clear owing to conflicting reports, with many studies concentrating on the abundance of APOE in AD brains relative to controls, irrespective of APOE genotype (35,43,44)..

Our findings, particularly the data from brain, illustrate the innate differences in the behavior of the three human APOE alleles in the mouse, arguing for the relevance of a genomic-based APOE model in understanding APOE function. The differences in brain APOE levels in our KI mice may have important implications for how APOE influences pathology development in an AD mouse model. A recent report by Sullivan et al. (45), showing that brain APOE levels are genotype-independent in a different set of APOE KI animals contradicts these data. However, their reported APOE lines contain a neo cassette in the targeted allele that may affect protein expression. An additional difference is the inclusion of human APOE intron 1 in the targeted allele of their mice, which may contain additional endo genous regulatory elements. Further comparisons between their mice and ours will be necessary to determine the innate differences between the two models..

The 4 KI animals have fasted cholesterol levels that are slightly below those of B6 wild-type animals, whereas the 2 KI animals have 2-fold higher cholesterol levels. The 3 KI and B6 wild-type cholesterol levels do not significantly differ. These data recapitulate what has been shown in other APOE KI models (46 to 48), but are opposite from the findings in humans, where the 4 allele is associated with high and 2 with low cholesterol levels. These data highlight the innate differences in mouse and human cholesterol metabolism, which include the utilization of different lipoproteins to transport cholesterol. Our data also contrast with the initial report of the 4 KI mice by Hamanaka et al. (27), showing a 2.5-fold increase in levels of circulating cholesterol relative to wild-type controls. This discrepancy in the data may be attributed to several factors. The first, and perhaps most notable, is the difference in genetic background between these two studies. Several lines of evidence demonstrate a strong genetic component to cholesterol metabolism in the mouse (46 to 48). This complex trait involves genes that work both in an additive manner as well as epistatically (49). Our analysis of cholesterol in these KI mice over subsequent backcrosses further argues for background effects, as demonstrated by comparing the cholesterol levels in the 4.N5 animals and the 4.R1.40 animals at the N8 backcross generation (Table 1 versus Fig. 4). Second, the KI mice that we report no longer transmit the neo cassette in the targeted allele. Although there is no direct evidence to suggest that the presence of neo affects the function of APOE or cholesterol metabolism in these mice, this cannot be ruled out. Finally, the differences in diet or methodology between the two studies may also impact the reported cholesterol levels..

These data suggest that the presence of human APOE 3 or 4 does not disrupt mouse cholesterol metabolism, an observation also made by Maeda and colleagues (50 to 52). Comparison of these profiles with that published by Hamanaka et al. highlights a further distinction between their 4 KI model and that characterized here. In contrast to our data, Hamanaka et al. showed cholesterol distributed to all lipoprotein classes in the 4 KI mice, including VLDL and LDL. This profile is actually most similar to that of the 2 KI animals presented here. These animals have significantly higher cholesterol levels and appear to transport the excess circulating cholesterol in the VLDL and LDL fractions, suggesting an impaired cholesterol metabolism. The noted increase in triglyceride levels in these 2 KI animals also suggests the development of type III hyperlipoproteinemia, a complex disorder characterized by high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which affects 10% of humans homozygous for the 2 allele (53). It has been suggested by Sullivan et al. and others (51,54) that this condition manifests itself in 2 KI mice owing to the presence of additional genetic factors in the mouse genome that interact with the 2 allele..

0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	51	Qualitative western blot analysis of 3 and 4 KI FPLC profiles demonstrated that the behavior of E3 in mice maintained on a low cholesterol diet follows that of endogenous Apoe, found mainly in the IDL/LDL, with some in the HDL fraction; E4 appears to be enriched in the HDL fraction. This observation may reflect another difference between mouse and human cholesterol metabolism. The E4 isoform has a greater affinity for large lipoproteins, which in humans are chylomicrons and VLDL. E2 and E3, on the other hand, prefer smaller lipoproteins and are primarily found associated with HDL, the smallest lipoprotein class. Importantly, mouse plasma is enriched in a large, Apoe-rich HDL that is absent in normal human plasma (36). It may be that E4 has a preference for these particles over the other two isoforms. Our mice do not show an enrichment of APOE in VLDL, as observed by Maeda and colleagues. This discrepancy with our data may be explained by differences in genetic background or diet. Further comparisons between these two sets of APOE KI models, including levels of protein, will be required to thoroughly explain these results..

Several studies have established a link between cholesterol and APP processing (10,55,56). Refolo et al. (13) demonstrated that cholesterol influences the cleavage of APP by beta-secretase in vivo, with hypercholesterolemia increasing CTFss levels. However, neither levels of holo APP nor CTFs were altered in the APOE;R1.40 animals at 28 days of age. The lack of an effect on APP processing in the 2 KI animals was unexpected, considering their high serum cholesterol levels..

Given the strong evidence for high cholesterol levels increasing Ass production (13) we predicted that the 2 KI animals, with a 2-fold increase in total serum cholesterol, would demonstrate much higher levels of Ass than the 3 KI and 4 KI mice. However, similar to the CTF data, the levels of Ass1 to 40 in brain were indistinguishable across lines. There are several possible explanations for these results. First, the data we present here come from 28-day-old animals, an age just post-weaning and prior to sexual maturity. It is possible that the ability of cholesterol to affect APP processing and Ass metabolism is time- or age-dependent. Successful diet studies have chronically fed mice high cholesterol diets for several weeks (13,14). Chronic exposure to high serum cholesterol levels for several weeks or months may be required to affect Ass metabolism in the APOE;R140 animals. Assaying levels of Ass1 to 40 in older animals will be useful to further understand the age component of cholesterol effects and APOE on APP processing..

This allows us to further dissect two aspects of APOE function that may impact the development of AD, cholesterol metabolism and Ass clearance. APOE abundance in the brains of 4 KI animals is low, but these animals have normal serum cholesterol levels. These animals allow us to study the effects of low APOE levels in the absence of high cholesterol, which is often observed in humans who inherit an 4 allele. Likewise, the 2 KI animals have both high serum cholesterol and high brain APOE levels. These animals are useful to determine the effects of high cholesterol independent of low APOE levels.

To address this controversy, we compared remnant clearance in two mouse models in which apoE is primarily derived either from hepatocytes or from an extrahepatic source. Hypomorphic apoE mice universally express reduced levels of apoE in all tissues, with the liver remaining the primary source of apoE. This mouse model of hepatocyte-derived apoE was compared with Apoe/ mice transplanted with mouse bone marrow as a model of primarily non-hepatocyte-derived apoE. Immunohistochemical analysis of liver sections revealed that only the hepatocyte-derived apoE model had detectable levels of apoE on hepatic sinusoidal surfaces. The non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model with plasma apoE levels similar to those in the hepatocyte-derived model had 2-fold more total plasma cholesterol, 4-fold more total plasma triglycerides, and 8-fold higher levels of apoB48, similar to Apoe/ mice. Both the hepatocyte-derived and the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE models had delayed clearance of an infused bolus of 125I-labeled remnants compared with wild-type mice. However, after 3 h, plasma remnants reached wild-type levels only in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, which had accumulated 70  plus or minus  5% of wild-type levels of remnants in the liver while the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model had accumulated only 38  plus or minus  4%. These results demonstrate the existence of a role for both hepatically derived and localized apoE in remnant clearance.

Apolipoprotein (apo)1 E mediates the uptake of remnants in the liver by binding to the LDL receptor (LDLR), the LDLR-related protein (LRP), and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (4-7). Inefficient clearance leads to the accumulation of remnants in plasma and contributes to premature atherosclerosis (8, 9)..

0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	8	The liver is the major source of plasma apoE; extrahepatic tissues, primarily macrophages, contribute up to 10% of plasma levels (10). Hepatocyte-derived apoE has been proposed to promote remnant clearance and uptake through a two-step process referred to as secretion-capture (3, 11, 12). In the first step, a portion of newly secreted apoE interacts with HSPG and remains bound to hepatocyte cell surfaces; the remainder is released into the space of Disse, where it serves to enrich lipoproteins (11-13). The presence of apoE on hepatocytes is thought to promote the trapping, or sequestration, of remnants (6, 11). In support of this mechanism, distinct dynamic pools of apoE on hepatocyte cell surfaces have recently been reported in vitro (14). In the second step, sequestered remnants are further enriched with hepatocyte-derived apoE and are internalized into hepatocytes through processes mediated by receptors, including the LDLR and the LRP (7, 15-19), or through interactions with HSPG alone (11, 20, 21). When apoE/HSPG interactions are disrupted in vivo by intravenous heparinase infusion, remnant clearance is severely inhibited, supporting the importance of the secretion-capture role of apoE in remnant clearance (22, 23)..

Moreover, evidence from mouse models expressing apoE exclusively from extrahepatic sources suggests that hepatic apoE expression is not absolutely required for remnant clearance or for normal plasma cholesterol levels (25-27). Finally, it is not clear whether hepatic apoE expression is required for remnant clearance in mice lacking the LDLR (24, 28, 29)..

0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	12	We previously reported (30) the generation of hypomorphic apoE (hypoE) mice that express reduced levels of Arg-61 apoE, which is similar to human apoE4 in that it displays apoE4 domain interaction. The reduction in apoE levels is caused by a neomycin (neo) cassette flanked by loxP sites in Apoe intron 3. However, the expression pattern of the hypomorphic allele remains normal, with the liver producing the majority of apoE in these mice (30). Excision of the neo cassette by Cre-mediated gene repair restores normal expression of the allele in all tissues (31). Despite having only 2-5% of wild-type plasma apoE levels, hypoE mice display a nearly normal lipoprotein profile. However, in Apoe/ mice with similar plasma apoE levels after transplantation with varying amounts of wild-type bone marrow, remnants accumulate (32). It was not until plasma apoE levels exceeded 10% of wild-type levels that remnant levels approached normal. The more efficient remnant clearance in hypoE mice suggests the importance of hepatocyte-derived apoE and the secretion-capture role of apoE..

Briefly, a neo cassette flanked by loxP sites was inserted into Apoe intron 3 by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells to help follow the replacement of the human equivalent of Thr-61 by an arginine, aimed at creating a model of apoE4 (31). The presence of the neo cassette in Apoe intron 3 results in reduced apoE mRNA levels in all tissues and organs (30). The apoE mRNA levels in the liver, brain, and spleen in targeted mice are ~5% of those in wild-type mice, resulting in plasma apoE levels equal to 0.05-0.12 mg/dl (~2-5% of wild-type levels) as determined by Western blot analysis using mouse apoE as standards, with the liver remaining the primary source of apoE. However, following Cre-mediated excision of the neo cassette in targeted mice, normal expression of the Arg-61 Apoe allele is restored. The mice were weaned at 21 days of age, housed in a barrier facility with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, and fed a chow diet containing 4.5% fat (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO)..

Plasma was centrifuged in a Beckman ultracentrifuge in a TL-100.3 rotor at 80,000 rpm for 16 h at 8  degrees C. Remnants were isolated and recentrifuged for two additional 16 h periods at d = 1.04 g/ml to ensure removal of plasma albumin. The purity of the remnant preparation was examined by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue, which revealed apoB48 as the major protein component followed by apoAI; apoB100 was present in trace amounts. Remnants were labeled with Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) by a modification of the iodine monochloride method first described by McFarlane (33). 125I-labeled remnants were extensively dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.2, and adjusted to a specific activity of 65,000 cpm/ microg protein. Labeled remnants (24  microg of protein in a volume of 400  microl of PBS) were injected into the tail vein of recipient mice (wild-type, hepatocyte-derived apoE model, non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model, and Apoe/ mice, n = 3/group). Blood (50  microl) was collected from the retro-orbital venous plexus into heparinized tubes 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 180 min after injection of 125I-labeled remnants. Aliquots of plasma were analyzed for radioactivity on a gamma counter (Packard). Total counts were calculated assuming that plasma represents 3.5% of total body weight (34). At 180 min, the mice were anesthetized with avertin and flush perfused with PBS, pH 7.2. Whole livers were collected, and the amount of 125I in the liver was determined.

We first examined liver-associated apoE in both mouse models. Like wild-type mice, the hepatocyte-derived apoE model had detectable levels of apoE bound to hepatic sinusoidal surfaces, although at reduced levels (Fig. 1). In contrast, and similar to Apoe/ mice, the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model had little if any detectable apoE bound to hepatic sinusoidal surfaces. However, unlike Apoe/ mice, the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model had some apoE-immunoreactive cells in liver sections, which likely represent macrophage-derived Kupfer cells expressing apoE or cells that have taken up apoE from the circulation. Thus, the enrichment of apoE on hepatic sinusoidal surfaces required local apoE expression, present only in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model..

Fractionation of mouse plasma showed a marked difference in the lipoprotein profiles (Fig. 3). The non-hepatocyte-derived apoE mice transported 60-80% of plasma cholesterol as remnant lipoproteins. In contrast, the hepatocyte-derived apoE mice transported only 30-40% of plasma cholesterol as remnant lipoproteins (30), which is more like wild-type mice that transport the majority of their plasma cholesterol as high density lipoprotein (17). Thus, the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model transports 2-3-fold more remnant lipoprotein-associated cholesterol and less high density lipoprotein cholesterol than the hepatocyte-derived model.

Although both the hepatocyte-derived apoE model and the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model had an overall delay in remnant clearance relative to wild-type mice, only the hepatocyte-derived apoE model reached wild-type levels at 3 h. Moreover, the livers of the hepatocyte-derived apoE model (n = 3) contained 70  plus or minus  5% of the total radioactivity found in wild-type mouse livers, whereas the livers of the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model (n = 3) contained only 38  plus or minus  4% after 3 h..

Rather, the difference in the rate of remnant clearance between the two models was apparent only at the later time points diverging after the first 30 min. These results demonstrate that apoE synthesized by liver hepatocytes favors an overall greater capacity for liver-mediated remnant uptake than apoE synthesized by extrahepatic tissue. Moreover, these results support a role for apoE-enrichment of remnants sequestered at the surface of hepatocytes and are consistent with the plasma lipoprotein profiles of fasted mice that show a significant accumulation of remnants in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model, but not in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model (Fig. 3).

Indeed, all three of these mouse models displayed similarly delayed initial rates of remnant clearance relative to wild-type mice. However, a shortcoming of the liver-perfusion model is that the results cannot necessarily be extrapolated to explain the steady-state levels of remnants in mice. For example, in apoE null mice, the perfused liver effectively cleared an infused bolus of remnants, whereas at steady-state the mice accumulate remnants in plasma. In contrast, our in vivo models directly focus on the steady-state levels of remnants in mice..

Indeed, all three of these mouse models displayed similarly delayed initial rates of remnant clearance relative to wild-type mice. However, a shortcoming of the liver-perfusion model is that the results cannot necessarily be extrapolated to explain the steady-state levels of remnants in mice. For example, in apoE null mice, the perfused liver effectively cleared an infused bolus of remnants, whereas at steady-state the mice accumulate remnants in plasma. In contrast, our in vivo models directly focus on the steady-state levels of remnants in mice..
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	64	In conclusion, this in vivo study in mice expressing apoE from hepatic versus extrahepatic sources demonstrates and underscores the importance of hepatically derived and localized apoE for efficient remnant clearance by the liver. Because remnant clearance operates close to its sub-optimal level in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, the model should be informative in revealing the relative contributions of the LDLR and the LRP in remnant clearance in the context of low levels of plasma apoE. The hepatocyte-derived apoE model can also serve to determine the contribution of other proteins known to be ligands for remnant clearance such as hepatic lipase (37, 38).     ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

In this study, we present evidence that, in addition to the known transcript (ApoE S1) that translates into ApoE, there are three additional transcripts in mice. Two of these transcripts, ApoE S2 and ApoE S3, which are predicted to be transmembrane proteins, are transcribed from the sense strand. ApoE AS1 is transcribed from the antisense strand and is complementary to exon 4 of ApoE S1. The open reading frame of ApoE AS1 is conserved between human and mouse. The antisense transcript falls within the region of the human epsilon 4 allele that has been linked to the familial onset form of Alzheimer's disease. We also demonstrate the expression of ApoE S3 and ApoE AS1 in ApoE knockout mice, and ApoE S1 and ApoE S2 do not get transcribed. We had previously identified ApoE S1 as being upregulated in mice after spinal cord injury. In this study, we show that in spinal cord-injured C57BL/6 mice, both ApoE S1 and ApoE S3 transcripts are 10-fold upregulated and the antisense ApoE AS1 is 100-fold upregulated compared with normal levels. Such data suggest that these alternate transcripts are involved in the molecular pathogenesis of CNS disease and perhaps in ApoE expression in general, as we show that ApoE S2 and AS1 are also transcribed in human..

This molecule has two structural domains, the N-terminus (residues 1 to 191) which can bind a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and can interact with heparin sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface and the C terminus (residues 222 to 299) which has a high affinity for lipids and is responsible for lipoprotein binding (2 to 4).

However, our own sequencing could not account for two bases in the published sequence (D00466.1), a C at position 2882 [TTG (C) CTC] and a C at 2898 [TGG (C) CCC].

Both sense and antisense messages have sequences recognized as translation start sites and therefore could exist as protein. Examples demonstrating the expression of antisense message have been shown for a variety of genes (reviewed in 28 and 29) including urocortin (30), cardiac troponin (31) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (32). The scenario we describe here for ApoE most closely resembles that of bFGF expression. The bFGF gene locus is known to be transcribed into multiple mRNA products, including at least one antisense transcript. This antisense transcript may be involved in regulating gene expression by hybridizing the sense transcript while still in the nucleus and perhaps affecting developmental patterns and tissue differentiation (32). The bFGF transcript isolated from Xenopus could also, however, be translated into a 25 kDa protein of as yet unknown function (33). At this point, it is unclear whether any of our newly identified ApoE transcripts, including the antisense transcript, are in fact translated except for ApoE S2 protein that is found in the serum. Beyond being translated into a protein, all the transcripts could participate in regulating each other's levels through a process like RNAi..

The scenario we describe here for ApoE most closely resembles that of bFGF expression. The bFGF gene locus is known to be transcribed into multiple mRNA products, including at least one antisense transcript. This antisense transcript may be involved in regulating gene expression by hybridizing the sense transcript while still in the nucleus and perhaps affecting developmental patterns and tissue differentiation (32). The bFGF transcript isolated from Xenopus could also, however, be translated into a 25 kDa protein of as yet unknown function (33). At this point, it is unclear whether any of our newly identified ApoE transcripts, including the antisense transcript, are in fact translated except for ApoE S2 protein that is found in the serum. Beyond being translated into a protein, all the transcripts could participate in regulating each other's levels through a process like RNAi..

For the ApoE antisense transcript, we can say that the reading frame is also open in humans and, consequently, there is the possibility that an antisense message is actually translated into a protein. The protein predicted from sequence M10065 has 198 amino acids and has a signal peptide predicted by the SignalP-3.0 HMM program (34) with a probability of 0.973. In contrast, in the mouse AS1 protein, the same program predicts a signal peptide with a probability of only 0.265. Even deleting the first 21 amino acids in the mouse protein that the human protein lacks increases the probability only to 0.38. Therefore, even though the human sequence probably enters the secretory pathway, the mouse sequence seems to lack a signal peptide. As programs like SignalP-3.0 HMM are focusing on prediction of classical signal peptides, one cannot exclude the presence of other signal motifs in the mouse protein..

0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	66	The ApoE antisense protein is encoded by exon 4, the exon that accounts for the three major allelic variants in humans. These allelic variations of the sense protein are defined by the substitution of an arginine (a positively charged polar amino acid) for a cysteine (a non-polar amino acid) at positions 112 and 158 of the protein (35,36). In the putative antisense protein, an arginine is substituted for a histidine, both positively charged polar amino acids. Therefore, these two variants are probably affecting the function of the antisense protein less than that of the sense protein and are therefore more conservative in the antisense direction. However, as studies of allelic variations and their implications in disease have always been conducted in reference to the sense protein, other more prominent variations (Table 1) might lead to functional and more relevant changes. One dramatic change is the variation at positions 3817 to 3819 (sequence position in reference to M10065). The substitution of TAG to GCT on the antisense strand opens the reading frame, so translation can continue for another 113 amino acids. The E4 allele as published by Paik et al. (35) and Emi et al. (36) contains a stop codon at positions 3817 to 3819. However, at this point, it is not clear if the allelic variation that opens the reading frame is linked with any of the major allelic forms like the E4, E3 or E2 genotype (for some of the observed haplotypes, see Table 1 in 37; for other relative frequencies of ApoE sequence variants within the E4, E3 and E2 genotypes, see Table 3 in 38). Therefore, an involvement of the putative antisense protein in diseases correlated with the allelic variants cannot be excluded. For example, in Alzheimer's disease, the specific molecular pathway by which ApoE modifies the expression of this disease remains elusive (19). Furthermore, other sequence variations in the different alleles (34) that are conservative in the sense direction might lead to amino acid substitutions or even stop signals in the antisense direction..

Our data suggest that the genetic manipulation used to generate the ApoE knockout has only eliminated the expression of ApoE S1 and ApoE S2 transcripts. We found that both ApoE S3, a putative transmembrane protein with a sequence completely different than that known for the ApoE protein, and ApoE AS1, a protein potentially produced from an antisense transcript, are still expressed in the knockout. This is possible because the region of the gene responsible for these transcripts, in particular exon 4, has not been disrupted by the insertion of the neo gene in the knockout. The roles of these transcripts are currently unknown. In addition, further work must be done to determine whether they are translated in vivo..

In particular, ApoE is a major component of specific lipoproteins called very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs). A major function of VLDLs is to remove excess cholesterol from the blood and carry it to the liver for processing. Maintaining normal levels of cholesterol is essential for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and stroke. There are at least three slightly different versions of the ApoE gene. The major versions, or alleles, are called 2, 3 and 4. The most common allele is 3, which is found in more than half of the population. Researchers have found that most people with familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition that causes very high levels of cholesterol and an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, have two copies of the 2 allele. This allele seems to be one of several genetic factors that play a part in this disorder. In addition, ApoE allelic version 4 is a risk factor for coronary artery disease. People who inherit at least one copy of the ApoE 4 allele have an increased risk of developing type 2 Alzheimer's disease, which first appears later in life. Studies have shown that people who inherit two copies of ApoE 4 have the highest chance of developing the disease. It is not yet known how this allele affects a person's risk of Alzheimer's disease; however, it has been found that it increases the number of amyloid plaques, which are characteristic of the disease (9,19)..

For serum, blood was collected from the tail vein and left to coagulate for 2 h at +4 degrees C until separation. Liver was collected on wet ice, homogenized with a glass homogenizer and mixed with lysis buffer, containing proteinase inhibitor cocktail (CompleteTM from Boehringer Mannheim) in 1xPBS with 0.1% SDS at +4 degrees C. Total protein concentration of sera and liver samples was determined using a standard Lowry protein assay procedure (DC Protein Assay Kit, BioRad Laboratories, catalog no. 500-0116) and equilibrated to a total protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. Protein samples were mixed with 4xSDS gel loading buffer and boiled for 10 min, then loaded onto a 10% SDS to PAGE (for the liver samples) at 20 to 30  microg per well (lane) or loaded onto a 12% gel (for serum samples) at 20 to 30  microg/well. The gel was then electroblotted to Immobilon-P (Millipore) in 25 mM Tris to OH, 250 mM glycine, 10% methanol at 8 V, 30 mA overnight. The blot was blocked in PBS to Tween-20 (0.005%), 5% milk for 1 h. To detect ApoE S1 and ApoE S2, blots were incubated with a goat anti-apoe antibody (1:300) (sc-6384, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at +4 degrees C. As a secondary antibody, an HRP-labeled mouse monoclonal anti-goat/sheep antibody was used (Sigma A-9452) for 1 h at RT at the following concentration: for liver, 1:5000; for serum, 1:7000. The blot was developed using the chemiluminescence kit from Boehringer Mannheim. The chemiluminescent signal was scanned and digitalized..

However, several data suggest that genetic factors, within the APOE locus, may also modulate the risk associated with this polymorphism. We look for new mutations in the APOE promoter, susceptible to modify the risk associated with the APOE [epsis]4 allele. We characterised a G[rarr]T mutation at -186 bp of the APOE gene TATA box, named Th1/E47cs. This new polymorphism is located in a consensus sequence of a potential transcriptional (Th1/E47) factor binding site. We studied the impact of this new polymorphism with those of other markers of the APOE locus in a large case-control study and observed that Th1/E47cs modulated the influence of the APOE [epsis]4 allele on the risk of Alzheimer's disease..

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	6	The apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), a key player of the lipid transport, exists as three main alleles in the general population: [epsis]2, [epsis]3 and [epsis]4. These polymorphisms correspond to mutations in the coding sequence of the APOE gene resulting in amino acid substitutions (Arg and Cys) at positions 112 and 158 of the protein. This gene is located on chromosome 19 at position q13.2. The implication of chromosome 19 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) was suspected on at least three occasions (1-3) before the report of an association between late-onset AD and the APOE [epsis]4 allele (4). Numerous studies confirmed this finding and extended this observation to early-onset AD (5-7). It is now established that carrying an [epsis]4 allele increases the risk of AD in an allele dose dependent manner and shifts the age of onset of the disease to earlier ages (8). Conversely, bearing an [epsis]2 allele confers a protection against the disease (5,9,10). Thus, the APOE genotype appears as an important biological marker for AD susceptibility accounting for between 45 and 60% of AD genetic variability..

The E4 isoform would facilitate or not limit the amyloid substance deposition (11,12). This isoform may not protect against oxidative stress, in contrast to the E2 isoform (13). It has also been suggested that the E2 and E3 isoforms would prevent the aggregation of Tau protein by limiting abnormal phosphorylation leading to the constitution of paired helical filament, while the E4 isoform would not (14)..

This observation suggests that other factors should influence the APOE associated risk. Indeed, other genetic and environmental factors such as family history, gender, smoking, oestrogen, cholesterol level or other polymorphisms located in APOE receptor genes for instance (15-20), may modify the APOE associated risk. However, recent reports suggest that additional genetic factors within the APOE locus itself may also modulate this risk. Firstly, a genetic study of markers in the vicinity of the APOE locus demonstrated that a combination of three polymorphisms increases the estimation of the APOE associated risk of AD compared with APOE polymorphism alone (5). Secondly, a distortion of the allelic expression of the APOE gene is observed in the brain of affected patients; indeed, the relative expression of the [epsis]4 allele is increased 1.5-fold in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 bearer AD patients, compared with [epsis]3/[epsis]4 bearer controls (21)..

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	12	Together, these data suggest the potential existence of one or more additional genetic susceptibility factors in the APOE sequence, modifying the risk associated with the APOE [epsis]4 allele in the occurrence of AD. Detailed sequence analyses and a study of the APOE locus are needed to characterise such additional genetic factors. For instance, Mui et al. reported a polymorphism (1E1) in the first intron of the APOE gene in strong linkage disequilibrium with the APOE [epsis]4 allele (22)..

RESULTS.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	15	Sequencing the 375 bp upstream to the TATA box of APOE, we found a (G[rarr]T) polymorphism at position -186 of the TATA box, located in a potential consensus binding sequence of the Th1/E47 heterodimer transcriptional factor (Fig. 1) (23). Because of this location, we named it Th1/E47cs polymorphism (for Th1/E47 consensus sequence polymorphism)..

(b) Comparison of the APOE promoter sequence including the Th1/E47cs polymorphism and the consensus sequence of the predicted binding site of the Th1/E47cs heterodimer (21). The predicted positions of Th1 and E47 binding site are indicated at the top and are based on the known half-site specificity of E47 and that predicted for Th1. The G[rarr]T mutation (boxed) is located in the half-site specificity of E47. Nucleotide positions are numbered relative to the canonical E-box sequence..
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	17	We studied the association of the Th1/E47cs polymorphism with AD in a large case-control study (310 cases, age = 74.6  plus or minus  9.3 years; 293 controls, age = 73.5  plus or minus  10.9 years). We analysed the Th1/E47cs polymorphism together with the APOE, the 1E1 and the D19S178 repeat polymorphisms. The distributions of these polymorphisms are presented in Table 1. No deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed for any of these polymorphisms. As expected, the [epsis]4 allele was strongly associated with AD (OR = 4.67, 95% IC [3.28-6.67]), while the [epsis]2 allele exhibited a protective effect (OR = 0.27, 95% CI [0.14-0.52]). In the control population, the Th1/E47cs G allele was the common one (0.531), in contrast to the AD population (0.468). The allelic and genotypic distributions were significantly different in the AD cases when compared with the control cases (P = 0.03 and P = 0.007, respectively). The Th1/E47cs T allele was associated with an increased risk of developing AD (OR = 1.29, CI 95% [1.02-1.63]) and the OR was 1.79 (CI 95% [1.21-2.65], P = 0.002) for individuals bearing at least one T allele. For the 1E1 polymorphism, the allelic and genotypic distributions, similar to the ones reported by Mui et al. (20), were significantly different between the AD and control populations (P = 0.002 and P = 0.0005, respectively). The 1E1 C allele was associated with a decreased risk of developing AD (OR = 0.56, CI 95% [0.40-0.78], P = 0.0003). No difference in the allelic or genotypic distributions of the D19S178 repeat alleles was observed (P = 0.90 and P = 0.95, respectively)..
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	18	We calculated pairwise linkage disequilibriums between D19S178, Th1/E47cs, 1E1 and APOE polymorphisms (Table 2). As expected significant linkage disequilibriums existed between Th1/E47cs, 1E1 and APOE polymorphisms. D19S178 was independent of the other polymorphisms, although a weak linkage disequilibrium existed with APOE in the control population..

D19S178 was independent of the other polymorphisms, although a weak linkage disequilibrium existed with APOE in the control population..
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	20	We estimated the haplotypes generated by these four polymorphisms using the myriad haplotype algorithm. Among the 16 theoretical haplotypes, 15 were observed (Table 3a). All haplotypes were observed in AD cases, while three (nos 2, 5 and 7) were not represented in controls. The difference in the distribution of the estimated haplotype frequencies between cases and controls was tested with a likelihood ratio test with 13 degrees of freedom ([chi]2 = 696). To take into account the strong association of the APOE [epsis]4 allele with AD, we compared the estimated haplotype distributions in the [epsis]3/[epsis]3 and in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 AD and control subgroups (Table 3b and c). In each subgroup ([epsis]3/[epsis]3 and [epsis]3/[epsis]4 genotype bearers, respectively), the estimated haplotype distributions were significantly different between AD and control subjects (likelihood test [chi]2 = 374, df = 8 and [chi]2 = 160, df = 6, respectively), suggesting potential independent effect of the other polymorphisms..

To determine if the effect of the Th1/E47cs and 1E1 polymorphisms were not due to the linkage disequilibrium existing with the APOE polymorphism, we performed a multivariate logistic regression taking into account age, gender, and the four polymorphisms in the same model.

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	28	If we assume that the level of expression of the APOE alleles is increased due to cis mutations in the promoter region, this hypothesis has three major implications: (i) the promoter mutation may modulate the expression of the APOE alleles leading to an increased deleterious risk for [epsis]4 and to an increased protective effect for [epsis]2; (ii) given that what determines the risk is the importance of the relative level of expression of both alleles of the APOE, this promoter mutation will have a differential effect in APOE heterozygous and homozygous genotypes; (iii) the effect of the cis mutation in heterozygous individuals will depend on the phase of this polymorphism with the APOE [epsis] alleles (i.e., the haplotype). In heterozygous Th1/E47cs and APOE [epsis]4 genotype bearers, the [epsis]4 allele may be combined either with the Th1/E47cs T or G allele. One of these combinations may increase the relative expression level of the [epsis]4 allele and decrease the relative expression level of the [epsis]3 allele, the other combination having the inverse influence. Thus, in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 genotype bearers, the risk of developing AD will be different between the Th1/E47cs heterozygous and homozygous individuals. To test these assumptions, we studied the gender and age adjusted OR for developing AD for Th1/E47cs heterozygous genotype bearers compared with homozygous Th1/E47cs individuals. The Th1/E47cs heterozygous genotype was only associated with an increased risk of developing AD in the heterozygous APOE individuals (OR = 2.40, CI 95% [1.40-4.12], P = 0.001) and not in the homozygous APOE individuals (OR = 1.02, CI 95% [0.67-1.57], P = 0.91). In particular, in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 sub-population (Table 5), the risk of developing AD for the heterozygous Th1/E47cs individuals was increased compared with the homozygous Th1/E47cs individuals (OR = 1.90, CI 95% [0.97-3.70], P = 0.06, AD = 107 and Controls = 54). This increased risk became significant in a larger [epsis]3/[epsis]4 population (OR = 2.07, 95% CI [1.21-3.54], P = 0.008, AD = 152 and Controls = 91). However the risk obtained for the heterozygous 1E1 individuals was not significant compared to the homozygous 1E1 individuals (OR = 0.62, 95% CI [0.36; 1.05], P = 0.07). To assess the contribution of each polymorphism on the risk of developing AD in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 population, we performed a multiple logistic regression. We detected an increased risk tendency for developing AD only in the heterozygous Th1/E47cs (OR = 1.89 CI 95% [1.07-3.35], P = 0.027) but not in the heterozygous 1E1 bearers (OR = 0.75, 95% CI [0.43-1.33], P = 0.33). Altogether, these data suggest that the Th1/E47cs polymorphism could modify the relative level of expression of the APOE alleles..

For the APOE [epsis]3/[epsis]4 and Th1/E47cs G/T bearers, 57.6% of the controls were estimated to have the [epsis]4 and T alleles on the same chromosome, while this proportion was 69.7% in the case group, leading to an estimated OR of 1.7.

Although a strong linkage disequilibrium existed between the [epsis]4, Th1/E47cs T and 1E1 G alleles, the effect of each of these polymorphisms persisted when introduced in the same logistic regression model. This observation suggested that the risk associated with the APOE [epsis] alleles may be modulated according to their combination with other polymorphisms. To have at least one Th1/E47cs T or 1E1 C allele significantly modified the risk of developing AD in the whole population. Furthermore, the impact of the [epsis]4 allele seemed decreased, suggesting that part of its effect may be attributed to the promoter polymorphisms. Another argument was brought forward when estimating the risk associated with the phase. The estimated risk of developing the disease for the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 genotype bearers was not similar according to the combination of the Th1/E47cs and APOE [epsis] alleles on the same chromosome. These results were in accordance with our previous data which suggest that the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 individuals will preferentially develop AD, because they expressed the [epsis]4 allele at a greater level. Thus, a cis mutation in the APOE promoter, may favour the relative expression level of the [epsis]4 allele, and potentially the deleterious action of the E4 isoform..

This factor E47 belongs to the class A proteins which are ubiquitously expressed and form combinatorial interactions with the class B proteins to control tissue-specific gene expression (24). In particular, E47 is expressed in brain, associated with multiple class B protein and is implicated in the development and maintenance of the mammalian nervous system (25-27). Little is known about the Th1 factor. It was identified in a screen of a mouse embryo cDNA library. Its homologous protein in Drosophila is a partner for the Drosophila class A protein daughterless, expression of which is essential for neurogenesis (28)..

Furthermore, the effect of this new polymorphism susceptible to modulate the risk associated to the APOE alleles must be confirmed by other epidemiological studies and a more profound analysis will have to be performed to determine the haplotypes. In conclusion, The Th1/E47cs polymorphism, located within a putative regulatory element of the APOE promoter could contribute to the APOE expression level but other polymorphisms in the regulatory sequences of this gene may exist and a more extended screening of these regulatory regions needs to be developed.

The anonymous (CA)n repeat DNA marker, D19S178, the 1E1 polymorphism and the APOE polymorphism were tested as previously described (8,22,31). Because the Th1/E47cs polymorphism did not create or destroy any restriction enzyme sites, two techniques were used to confirm the results. The first one consisted of designing a mismatch primer which contained one mismatched base pair, four bases away from the 3[prime] end of the forward primer and five bases from the polymorphism. When incorporated into a PCR product, this primer produced a Bstn I cut site when a G was present and no cut site when a T was present at the polymorphic site. Briefly, the PCR step was performed during 40 cycles (1 min at 94 degrees C, 1 min 15 s at 54 degrees C and 1 min at 72 degrees C each cycle) with the forward primer 5[prime]-AGAATGGAGGAGGGTGCCTG-3[prime] and the reverse primer 5[prime]-ACTCAAGGATCCCAGACTTG-3[prime] in a total volume of 50  microl containing 1.25 U Taq DNA polymerase, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1% of DMSO, 0.5 mM of MgCl2. Twenty five  microl PCR of product was digested with 1 U Bstn I at 60 degrees C overnight. Digestion products were visualised with a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The Th1/E47cs T allele was characterised by a 49 bp fragment and the G allele by a 31 bp fragment. The second technique consisted of performing an allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridisation. A 375 bp fragment containing the Th1/E47cs polymorphism was amplified using as forward primer: 5[prime]-TACTTTCTTTCTGGGATCCAGG-3[prime] and reverse primer: 5[prime]-ACTCAAGGATCCCAGACTTG-3[prime]. PCR was performed in a total volume of 50  microl during 35 cycles (1 min at 94 degrees C, 1 min at 50 degrees C and 1 min at 72 degrees C each cycle) containing 1.25 U Taq polymerase, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1 mM of MgCl2.

The standardised disequilibrium ([delta]) and the percent of the maximum possible value of disequilibrium were computed as outlined by Thompson et al. (35). Statistical significance for linkage disequilibrium was considered only at P  <  0.001 level since multiple non-independent pairwise comparisons were performed. Extended haplotype frequencies of the four markers were estimated on collapsed data using the myriad haplotype algorithm described by McLean and Morton (36), implemented in a computer program by Cox et al. (37). The comparisons between haplotype frequencies in cases and controls were tested with a likelihood ratio test. The estimated frequencies were compared with those expected on the basis of equilibrium by Pearson's [chi]2 or Fisher exact test as necessary (38).

Interaction with other biological factors may modulate the effect of the apoE isoforms. However, previous work suggested that other genetic variability within the APOE locus, influencing the effect of the [epsis]4 allele, may exist. Such variability could modify the expression of the APOE gene and, in particular, the level of expression of APOE alleles could be an important determinant of disease pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis we examined the levels of expression of APOE in heterozygotes with AD and in controls, using a new method of semi-quantitation. We report that relative [epsis]4 mRNA expression is increased in AD compared with controls and suggest that genetic variability in the neural expression of APOE contributes to disease risk.

INTRODUCTION.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	6	The [epsis]4 allele of the APOE gene is a major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) (1), and is also implicated as a risk factor for early-onset disease in some populations (2,3). Previous studies have described [epsis]4 homozygotes as having a higher risk of developing disease than [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes. However, individuals bearing one or two [epsis]4 alleles, do not inevitably develop the disease. Detailed genetic analysis around the APOE locus has suggested the existence of other genetic variability in this region which could contribute to disease risk (4). There are two possible explanations for these observations: (i) there is another genetically variable locus in the vicinity of the APOE gene involved in the pathogenesis of the disease; (ii) there is a genetic variability in the control of expression of the APOE gene (4)..

0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	8	There has been little examination of the mRNA expression of APOE in AD (5,6). The available evidence suggests that APOE expression is increased by neuronal damage (7,8) and that the bulk of the expression occurs in astrocytes (5). This expression is believed to be part of a compensatory mechanism aimed at aiding reafferentation and reactive synaptogenesis (9). Only a few studies have examined the expression of the apoE protein in AD cases and controls relative to the APOE genotype (9,10). Bertrand et al. have suggested that the amount of apoE protein could be inversely correlated to the number of [epsis]4 alleles carried by subjects: higher levels were observed in [epsis]3 homozygotes, lower in [epsis]4 homozygotes and intermediate levels in [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes (10)..

0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	10	We hypothesised that, since [epsis]4 homozygotes have a higher risk of developing disease than [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes, and a high proportion of individuals with the latter genotype reach a greater age without developing AD, a likely explanation of this was that there was genetic variability in neural expression at the APOE locus and that [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygote individuals who were high [epsis]4 expressors and/or low [epsis]3 expressors were more likely to develop AD than individuals with high [epsis]3 expressors and/or low [epsis]4 expressors..

We developed a semi-quantitative assay to measure allelic expression of APOE mRNA by RT-PCR using silver staining (11). This method of quantitation has been applied to brains of heterozygote subjects collected at various centres and used to assess the percentage of [epsis]4 mRNA expression in [epsis]3[epsis]4 and [epsis]2[epsis]4 subjects and [epsis]2 mRNA expression in [epsis]2[epsis]3 individuals.

We observed that [epsis]3 mRNA expression was consistently greater than [epsis]4 mRNA expression in all cases (Fig. 2). In addition, there was a clear and consistent difference in the [epsis]4 allelic expression ratio between AD cases and controls (Fig. 2), with AD cases showing a higher relative expression of [epsis]4 mRNA than controls (34.4  plus or minus  2.6% versus 22.6  plus or minus  1.8%, respectively, P = 0.001 with Mann-Whitney test). Regarding the other heterozygous genotypes, the small size of each group prevented us from reaching any definite conclusion. Nevertheless, a trend towards the same situation as observed in the [epsis]3[epsis]4 group could be noted, an increase in the expression of the [epsis]4 allele in the [epsis]2[epsis]4 group (42.6  plus or minus  3.7% in the AD cases versus 28.9  plus or minus  1.2% in the only control), whereas nothing was apparent in the [epsis]2[epsis]3 group (39.0  plus or minus  1.4% in the only AD case versus 45.8  plus or minus  4.3% in controls). Furthermore, a difference in the allelic expression ratio between [epsis]2[epsis]4 and [epsis]3[epsis]4 AD cases was observed, since [epsis]2[epsis]4 patients showed a 1.25-fold increase of the [epsis]4 allele ratio (P = 0.01 with Mann-Whitney test)..

0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	18	It is important to note that measurement of the ratio of expression of the two alleles in heterozygotes is likely to be a much more robust measurement than the determination of absolute levels of mRNA expression in the same tissue, since the latter will be profoundly affected by post-mortem delay, agonal state and cell population and density..
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	19	As can be seen in Figure 2, the level of expression of the [epsis]3 allele is consistently higher than that of the [epsis]4 allele in the AD group as well as in the control group. These data suggest that there is either differential stability of the different mRNA species, or that there is genetic variability in the expression of the two alleles in disequilibrium with the coding polymorphism. However, in addition there was a clear and consistent difference in the [epsis]4 allelic expression ratio between AD cases and controls. These results are consistent with the notion that part, at least, of the genetic risk of developing AD encoded at the APOE locus relates to the expression of this protein in the brain. It would seem that heterozygote individuals who express a relatively high proportion of the [epsis]4 allele are at greater risk for developing disease than those expressing a relatively low proportion. The observation that the different alleles of APOE are not equally expressed may be of importance in the formulation of hypotheses relating to the role of APOE in the pathogenesis of AD in general. At present, there is much speculation and experimentation designed to determine the nature of the role of the different alleles of APOE in the pathogenesis of AD. As previously suggested, the E4 isoform may facilitate (12) or not limit (13) the amyloid substance deposition. This isoform would not protect against oxidative stress, conversely to the E2 isoform (14). Finally, it has been suggested that the E2 and E3 isoforms may prevent the aggregation of Tau protein, while the E4 isoform may not prevent the paired helical filament formation (15). However, these hypotheses are based on the premise that the APOE allele isoforms are equally expressed and present at similar concentrations in the brain. These isoform-specific differences could be enhanced by a different representation of each isoform in an individual..

Several studies had explored this issue reporting contradictory findings in brain (10,16), cerebrospinal fluid (17,18) and plasma (19). But even if the apoE level was tested according to the APOE genotype, none of the previous studies have been able to determine the relative ratio between the different isoforms and thus our results are not comparable with them. The development of isoform-specific monoclonal antibodies would help to determine whether the variation that is observed in our population is also present at the protein level (20)..

0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	25	It is interesting to note that APOE is up-regulated as a consequence of an insult. Poirier et al. showed an increase in the level of expression of APOE mRNA in rat after lesioning of the cerebral cortex (6). Similarly, Diedrich et al. showed that APOE mRNA was increased in AD brains (5). Together these results support an event, which may lead to an increase of the APOE mRNA and, in parallel, a distortion of the allelic expression. The distortion of the allelic expression may be specific to brain, and possibly restricted to certain areas (21). This suggests a neural genetic susceptibility for AD associated with the APOE gene..

Using haplotype data from markers surrounding the APOE locus, including the APOE polymorphism, Templeton showed that the coding polymorphism in the APOE gene was not sufficient to explain the increased risk for AD (22).

We have previously reported that a common variant in the regulatory region of APOE (-491A) is associated with risk for late onset AD. In this report we analyze the association of another APOE promoter polymorphism (-427T/C) with AD in two case-control clinical samples and demonstrate a correlation between APOE promoter transcriptional activity and risk for AD. The association studies show that the allelic variant (-427C) and the haplotype [-491A-427C] of the APOE promoter are associated with increased risk for AD. Study of the transcriptional activity of the common haplotypes defined by combination of the -491 and -427 alleles indicated that the risk for late onset AD positively correlates with transcriptional activity of the APOE gene, suggesting that increases in the local expression of ApoE could be responsible for the association of APOE promoter polymorphism with AD..

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	5	Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, exists in both familial and sporadic forms. Genetic studies have led to the identification of three genes, [beta]-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (1), presenilin-1 (2) and presenilin-2 (3), which, when mutated, can cause autosomal dominant forms of familial AD. However, mutations in these three genes are responsible for only a small fraction of AD cases, while the vast majority of patients with AD presents with a late age at onset and shows non-Mendelian inheritance. The absence of Mendelian inheritance indicates that late onset AD is a complex disease in which genetic and non-genetic factors are likely to be interacting. The [epsis]4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE, gene; ApoE, protein) has been associated with an increased risk of developing AD (4). However, many AD cases have no APOE [epsis]4 alleles. Thus it is likely that there are additional AD risk factors, both genetic and environmental, still to be identified..

We now report that the allelic variant -427C of the APOE promoter is also associated with AD, whereas we found no significant association of -219 and +113 polymorphisms with risk for AD. Results from others have suggested that the -219 polymorphism acts as a modifier of ApoE4- associated risk (8).

We first analyzed the [-491-427] haplotype distribution in both the Spanish and US samples. A combined digestion of an APOE fragment spanning nt -512 to -285 with DraI and AluI was performed, which allowed identification of the four haplotypes and the 10 genotypes defined by the combination of the -491 and -427 alleles. Haplotype [A-T] [-491-427] was the most common, followed by [T-T] and [A-C]. No subjects with the T-C haplotype were found in either sample.

The APOE proximal promoter activity of the three haplotypes ([T-T], [A-T] and [A-C]) was measured in U87 human astrocytoma cells using the same luciferase-based transient transfection system employed in our previous studies (5,7,19). As shown in Figure 1, transcriptional activity of haplotypes [A-T] and [A-C] were increased by 30 and 100%, respectively, over that of haplotype [T-T], suggesting that the presence of the alleles conferring increased risk for AD (-491A and -427C) is associated with increased constitutive levels of APOE promoter activity in human astrocytoma cells. The three haplotypes [T-T], [A-T] and [A-C] were thus named minus (-), even (x) and plus (+), respectively, according to their transcriptional activity. Additional information was obtained using oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the -491 and -427 allelic forms in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, with freshly prepared nuclear extracts from U87 cells. As shown in Figure 2, one of the three specific band shifts detected by the 427T probe (arrows) was not detected by the 427C probe, suggesting that the T->C substitution hinders binding of the probe to a nuclear protein. This finding is in agreement with the data obtained in our previous work using the 491 probes (7) and strongly suggests that differential transcriptional activities of the three [-491-427] haplotypes encountered in astrocytoma cells are a consequence of differential binding to nuclear proteins present in these cells..

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	28	In this paper we report an association between polymorphisms in the proximal region of the APOE promoter and risk for AD. We have previously reported association of homozygosity for the -491A allele with risk for AD (7). Here we show that the -427C allele is also associated with risk for AD. Furthermore, combination of these two alleles into the [-491A-427C] haplotype generates a high risk for AD, in particular in the Spanish population, in individuals bearing no ApoE4 alleles. The same effect is observed in the St Louis sample, although the relative risk was lower than in the Spanish sample. The difference in relative risk is most probably attributable to differences in the frequencies of APOE promoter haplotypes in the two control populations, since the two AD samples show very similar frequencies of promoter haplotypes. It is well documented that population-based differences in ApoE4 allele frequency (9,10) give rise to population differences in relative risk for AD associated with this allele. Consistently, in our samples the OR associated with ApoE4 in the Spanish population (8.3) was more than double that in the St Louis sample (3.1) (7). Based on these data, we anticipate that there will be wide variation in the relative risk for AD associated with the APOE promoter polymorphism in different populations, as has already been noted for the ApoE4 allele (11). Dividing the sample on the basis of the presence or absence of ApoE4 revealed that the promoter polymorphisms and ApoE4 are independent risk factors. Indeed, the risk due to the promoter polymorphism was most prominent in individuals without ApoE4 alleles..

Regulation of APOE expression has been investigated thoroughly in hepatoma cells, where it has been shown that the elements required for efficient expression are located in the 5[prime] proximal region and in the first intron (16-18). More recently, we have demonstrated that this region also drives efficient expression of APOE in astrocytoma cells (19). The data presented in this report strongly suggest that allelic polymorphism in the transcriptional regulatory region of APOE may contribute to differences in the levels of ApoE synthesis by astrocytes. Specifically, our data indicate that the single base substitutions corresponding to the -491 and -427 APOE polymorphic sites produce differences in transcriptional activity of the APOE promoter due to differential binding of nuclear proteins. It is well documented that single nucleotide changes within a promoter region can dramatically affect transcriptional activity mediated by transcription factors (20-22)..

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	33	The data presented here strongly suggest the existence of a direct correlation between risk for AD and APOE promoter activity in astrocytic cells, i.e. the higher the expression of ApoE, the higher the risk for AD. There is increasing evidence suggesting that increased levels of ApoE are associated with AD pathogenesis. Several studies have reported that ApoE levels are elevated in the brain and in plasma from AD patients (23-25). Intracellular accumulation of ApoE has also been correlated with neuronal cell death and intracellular A[beta] stabilization (26). Recent studies have also demonstrated that the level of ApoE expression can modify both the cytotoxic effects of ApoE and the propensity of A[beta] to deposit in the murine brain. ApoE at concentrations found in the cerebrospinal fluid protects neuronal cells from A[beta] peptides, while higher ApoE concentrations could lead to neuronal cell death (27). Crossing APOE knockout mice with mice overexpressing a human mutant APP gene indicates that A[beta] deposition correlates positively with ApoE dose and suggests that ApoE may facilitate A[beta] peptide deposition in vivo (28)..

The amino acid substitutions associated with the E2, E3 and E4 ApoE isoforms lead to differences in the predicted three-dimensional structure of ApoE that are likely to alter the functional properties of the molecule. Several potential mechanisms of action of ApoE4 on AD risk have been proposed, based on the ApoE isoform-specific differences observed in several assays developed in brain cells (28-35). However, to date there is no adequate explanation for the variation in risk for AD associated with the different ApoE isoforms..

These two factors are associated with AD risk independently, i.e. each one can produce risk by itself, but may interact with each other resulting in an overall risk for individuals bearing both ApoE4 and high expressing APOE promoter forms that would depend on the relative contribution of each of these two risk factors..

Protein expression and enzymatic activity of cathepsin D increased in differentiated keratinocytes in both stratified organotypic cultures and in mouse skin during epidermal barrier repair. Treatment of cultured keratinocytes with exogenous cathepsin D increased the activity of transglutaminase 1, known to cross-link the cornified envelope proteins involucrin and loricrin during epidermal differentiation.

In hyperproliferative diseases like psoriasis, premature expression of involucrin is found in the lower spinous layers (Thewes et al., 1991). Another main component of the CE is loricrin. It is expressed in a later stage of differentiation (Watt, 1983) and is cross-linked to other epidermal proteins such as cystatin, elafin or filaggrin..

Beside its structural role, ceramide is known as an important intracellular signal mediator for various cytokines, in particular tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (Liu et al., 1997; Perry and Hannun, 1998). TNF binding to the p55 TNF receptor (TNF-R55) results in activation of an endolysosomal acid sphingomyelinase (Wiegmann et al., 1994; Kronke et al., 1996). Increase in intracellular ceramide levels is followed by different cellular responses depending on cell type and degree of activation such as differentiation, proliferation and programmed cell death (apoptosis) (Kronke et al., 1996; Jarvis et al., 1994; Kolesnick and Golde, 1994; Geilen et al., 1997; Wakita et al., 1994). We suggested a functional role of TNF and ceramide derived from acid sphingomyelinase in cutaneous permeability barrier repair after experimentally induced injury of the skin. We detected high levels of sphingomyelinase and ceramides after barrier disruption as well as a significant delay in barrier repair in TNF-R55-deficient mice (Jensen et al., 1999). In understanding the various biological effects of ceramides, it is important to know their direct intracellular targets..

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	12	Recently, we found that the aspartatic protease cathepsin D (CTSD) is a novel specific intracellular binding protein for ceramide, derived from acid sphingomyelinase (Heinrich et al., 1999). Ceramide enhances the proteolytic activity of CTSD. CTSD is the main aspartatic protease of endolysosomes. It is synthesized and translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum as an inactive pre-proenzyme (52 kDa), processed into an enzymatically active, intermediate proenzyme (48 kDa) and finally converted into the mature form of 32 kDa in the lysosomes (Fujita et al., 1991). CTSD is involved in the proteolytic activation as well as proteolytic degradation of intracellular proteins (Diment et al., 1988; Lazarus et al., 1974; Sato et al., 1997). Increased levels of CTSD are correlated with tumor cell invasion and metastasis in malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma and human breast cancer (Kageshita et al., 1995; Kawada, 1997). Reports suggest that CTSD may play a role in the metastasizing process of malignant cells because of their destructive effects on the extracellular matrix. Therefore, CTSD activity was used to predict recurrence in breast cancer (Tandon et al., 1990). In HeLa cell cultures CTSD is a mediator of programmed cell death induced by various cytokines. Overexpression of CTSD induced cell death without any external stimuli and the CTSD inhibitor pepstatin A suppressed cell death in this system (Deiss et al., 1996). Some of these findings were supported by in vivo studies in CTSD-deficient mice, generated by gene-targeting. These mice developed normally during the first 2 weeks. Afterwards they exhibited progressive atrophy of the intestinal mucosa, followed by massive intestinal necrosis and profound destruction of lymphoid cells. The mice died in a state of anorexia at the age of 4 weeks, though lysosomal bulk proteolysis was maintained, possibly due to compensatory activation of related lysosomal proteases (Saftig et al., 1995)..
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	13	In the skin CTSD plays a role in both extracellular and intracellular catabolism. In hyperproliferative skin disorders such as psoriasis, increased expression of the mature form of CTSD has been reported, returning to normal after resolution of the psoriasis by psoralen and long-wave ultraviolet radiation (PUVA) light treatment (Kawada et al., 1997; Chen et al., 2000). It was suggested that CTSD may be involved in the control of cell differentiation during normal development. Horikoshi et al. found increased expression and increased activity of CTSD isoforms in the skin depending on the stage of epidermal differentiation (Horikoshi et al., 1998). CTSD enzyme is active at an acid pH (maximum at pH 3) and may work at the transition of the stratum granulosum to stratum corneum, because the stratum corneum produces an acid environment (pH 5.5) (Ohmann and Valquist, 1994). Despite these results, function and cellular substrates of CTSD in epidermal differentiation are still unknown..

In primary keratinocytes the three known isoforms of CTSD (52 kDa, 48 kDa and 32 kDa) were detected with the 48 kDa form being the main product. In 20-day-old stratified cultures, expressing various signature proteins of keratinocyte, cornification and differentiation (Steude et al., 2002), we found a significant increase of the 52 kDa and the 48 kDa CTSD forms (Fig. 1A). The 52 kDa protein represents the enzymatically inactive pre-pro CTSD form, while the 48 kDa protein is the active membrane-bound enzyme (Fujita et al., 1991)..

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	46	TG1 activity is stimulated by exogenous CTSD in keratinocytes in culture During epidermal differentiation the CE proteins involucrin, loricrin and filaggrin are cross-linked by the formation of -(-glutamyl)lysine isodipeptide bonds catalyzed by TG1 (Kim et al., 1995). In addition, it has been described that TG1 catalyzes covalent ester binding of -hydroxyceramide to involucrin (Nemes et al., 1999). Thus this enzyme mediates key functions in epidermal differentiation. Since CTSD may be involved in the regulation of the activity of TG1 (Negi et al., 1981; Negi et al., 1990) we investigated a possible direct involvement of CTSD in the proteolytic activation of TG1. Since the high molecular mass TG1 precursor protein is membrane bound (Chakravarty and Rice, 1989; Steinert et al., 1996b), and upon terminal differentiation of keratinocytes TG1 is cleaved at two sites, leading to a more active form (Rice et al., 1990; Kim et al., 1995; Steinert et al., 1996a; Steinert et al., 1996b), we prepared a membrane fraction from lysates of HaCaT cells as starting material. The enzymatic activity of TG1 was measured in the membrane preparation after addition of exogenous CTSD in the absence and presence of pepstatin A in an in vitro TG1 assay based on the cross-linking of [3H]putrescine to dimethylcasein as substrate (Hohl et al., 1998). As shown in Fig. 4, TG1 activity was increased by exogenous CTSD and the enzymatic activation was blocked by pepstatin A. This result suggests a CTSD-mediated proteolytic activation of a (membrane-bound) TG1 precursor molecule leading to enzymatically active TG1 fragments. This observation supports a functional link between CTSD and TG1 activities..

Using a specific TG1 enzyme assay, we found significantly decreased TG1 activity in the epidermis of heterozygous (CTSD(+/ to )) mice which was further reduced in homozygous (CTSD( to / to )) mice (Fig. 6). In order to investigate whether this decreased TG1 activity in CTSD( to / to ) mice is caused by a defective processing of a TG1 precursor molecule, we analyzed the distribution of TG1 protein by western blotting using a specific anti-TG1 antibody. A strongly band of approximately 35 kDa was detected in the epidermis from wild-type mice, but this band was significantly decreased in the skins of CTSD-deficient heterozygous and even more in homozygous mice (Fig. 7). In CTSD( to / to ) mice, a 150 kDa protein was strongly expressed instead, which was also seen in CTSD(+/ to ) mice, but completely absent in wild-type mice.

In vitro, we identified the endolysosomal aspartate protease CTSD as a specific ceramide-binding protein. Ceramide enhances CTSD proteolytic activity (Heinrich et al., 1999). The existence of CTSD in the skin was shown previously, but the function has not been elucidated. Increased activity of CTSD isoforms depending on the stage of epidermal differentiation has been described (Horikoshi et al., 1999). Also, an increased expression of the mature form of CTSD has been reported (Kawada et al., 1997) in psoriasis, a disease that is characterized, in addition to inflammation, by epidermal hyperproliferation and altered differentiation. Furthermore, in psoriasis premature expression of the CE protein involucrin is known (Thewes et al., 1991)..

First, we performed in vitro studies determining the protein expression and activity of CTSD in primary and in differentiated, stratified (organotypic) cultured keratinocytes. We found a significant increase in CTSD protein levels and an increase in the enzymatic activity of CTSD in differentiated compared to primary keratinocytes, suggesting a function of CTSD during epidermal differentiation in vitro..

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	78	To explore a possible link between CTSD and epidermal differentiation in vivo, we investigated the epidermal expression and the enzymatic activity of CTSD after experimental skin injury during permeability barrier repair in wild-type mice. We found significantly increased epidermal expression of the active intermediate as well as the mature form of CTSD 3 hours and 5 hours after permeability barrier disruption, caused by increased processing and increased synthesis of the enzyme. In accordance, we noted a significant increase of epidermal CTSD enzyme activity at different times after skin injury. Topical application of pepstatin A, an inhibitor of CTSD (Heinrich et al., 1999), prevented an increase in the protein expression and in the activity of CTSD and significantly delayed permeability barrier repair after experimental disruption. These results clearly show involvement of CTSD in the epidermal repair process after injury..

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	80	The kinetics of CTSD processing and activation, as demonstrated by increased expression at 1-5 hours after treatment, corresponded to the activation of sphingomyelinase and the amount of epidermal ceramides after barrier perturbation (Jensen et al., 1999). In our previous study, a significant increase in acid sphingomyelinase activation and an elevated epidermal ceramide content 1-4 hours after barrier disruption was demonstrated (Jensen et al., 1999), thus acid sphingomyelinase-derived ceramide may be linked to CTSD activity during permeability barrier repair..
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	81	The epidermis follows a programmed transformation of keratinocytes from the proliferating basal cells to the spinous, then to the granular and to the horny layers where the permeability barrier resides and finally desquamation occurs. Starting in the granular layer, aspartatic proteinases such as CTSD are activated in the lysosomes where they participate in the massive degradation process accompanying cornification. Recent observations identified CTSD to be located in lamellar bodies within the keratinocytes (Ishida-Yamamoto et al., 2004). Involucrin and loricrin are cross-linked by TG1 to form the insoluble and rigid CE (Steinert and Marekov, 1997). CTSD was reported to activate TG1 and thereby contribute to the enzymatic processes during cornification (Negi et al., 1981; Horikoshi et al., 1999). These findings were supported and extended by our in vitro and in vivo results: we found CTSD-dependent activation of TG1 in a keratinocyte membrane preparation and, furthermore, the activity of TG1 was severely diminished in the epidermis of CTSD( to / to ) mice when compared to wild-type mice. The enzymatic activity of TG1 correlated with the expression of a 35 kDa protein in wild-type mice, as detected by immunoblotting. This 35 kDa protein was undetectable in the epidermis of CTSD( to / to ) mice, where we observed the expression of a 150 kDa TG1 protein instead. There was less of this protein in CTSD(+/ to ) mice and none in wild-type control mice. These observations suggest the involvement of CTSD in the processing of a higher molecular weight precursor to generate an enzymatically active 35 kDa TG1 form (see model in Fig. 12). A recent report by Iizuka et al. (Iizuka et al., 2003) studied proteolytically activated TG1 in the epidermis by using cleavage-site-directed antibodies. A 33 kDa fragment was identified by western blotting that was mainly found in the cytosol of keratinocytes, in differentiated cells and in the stratum corneum of the skin (Iizuka et al., 2003). A second fragment resided at the plasma membrane of keratinocytes and in regions of the skin including suprabasal layer, spinous layer and granular layer, but not the stratum corneum. The differentiation-related 33 kDa TG1 fragment of this study could be the same protein as the 35 kDa fragment we detected in CTSD(+/+) mice, but not in CTSD( to / to ) mice..

During epidermal differentiation, the aspartate protease CTSD in the stratum granulosum (SG) is activated, cleaves the membrane-bound 150 kDa precursor of transglutaminase 1 (TG1) producing the active 35 kDa form. TG1 in turn mediates cross-linking of the cornified envelope (CE) proteins involucrin and loricrin to the CE. SC, stratum corneum; SS, stratum spinosum; SB, stratum basale..

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	86	Epidermal differentiation including the formation of the CE proteins involucrin and loricrin, are crucially involved in permeability barrier repair (Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage et al., 1998). The soluble CE protein involucrin is expressed in the spinous layer at an early stage in keratinocyte differentiation. Loricrin is an insoluble CE precursor, expressed later in the differentiation process in intracellular granules..
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	87	The link between CTSD-dependent activation of keratinocyte TG1 and the expression of CE proteins was confirmed in CTSD( to / to ) mice. In these mice, we found significantly reduced involucrin and loricrin protein levels after experimental skin injury in parallel to a reduced activity of TG1. These results are in agreement with the effects observed after application of the CTSD inhibitor pepstatin A (data not shown). Since a high molecular mass TG1 precursor protein was present in CTSD( to / to ) but not in wild-type mice, CTSD appears to mediate the proteolysis of the enzymatically inactive TG1 to the active enzyme. Thus, the deficient mice also reveal a functional link between CTSD expression, maturation and activation of TG1, and the appearance of involucrin and loricrin in the epidermis..

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	89	Morphologically, the CTSD( to / to ) mice exhibited epidermal hyperkeratosis as a sign of disturbed epidermal differentiation. The skin symptoms may be explained by a diminished ability of the corneocytes to bind intercellular lipids, caused by the reduced expression of involucrin and loricrin in the stratum corneum. Previously, it was shown that the CE proteins, in particular involucrin, covalently bind -hydroxy ceramides. These ceramides form a scaffold for the attachment of free ceramides, cholesterol and free fatty acids that provides stratum corneum lipid bilayers for the permeability barrier function (Downing, 1992; Steinert and Marekov, 1997). Morphological disruption of the corneocyte layers was found in the CTSD( to / to ) mice (Fig. 10B). These disruptions started at the interface of the stratum granulosum/stratum corneum, the place where normally the lipid bilayers extrude their lipids into the intercellular space. Ultrastructural analysis of the epidermis in CTSD( to / to ) mice revealed broadening of the distances between the SC layers, with only a faint staining of the CE and thickened corneocytes in the axial direction. This demonstrates the influence of CTSD on corneocytes and possibly on lipid organization in the stratum corneum. Together, the morphological findings suggest an important role for CTSD in epidermal differentiation..

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	91	To evaluate the consequences of CTSD deficiency and reduced TG1 activity in more detail, we analyzed the distribution of various epidermal keratins and CE proteins by immunohistology. An extended expression of basal and differentiation-related keratins K5 and K1 as a sign of a disturbed differentiation was found in CTSD-deficient mice. In previous studies we have found that expression of the differentiation marker K1 is disturbed after acute (tape-stripping) or chronic (metabolic, essential fatty acid deficient diet, EFAD) barrier disruption. However, in these models we also found an increase in the expression of the proliferation-associated keratin K6 (and also K16) (Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage et al., 1998). Expression of K6 (besides changes in basal and differentiation related keratins) is also known in psoriasis (Hagemann and Proksch, 1996). In CTSD( to / to ) mice K6 was absent, though a thickening of the horny layer was clearly visible. Therefore, the CTSD( to / to ) mice may have similarities to so called `retention hyperkeratosis', such as ichthyosis, and not to so called `hyperproliferation-associated keratosis', such as psoriasis. In accordance, mice heterozygous for a truncated keratin K10, as a model for the ichthyosis called epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, which is caused by point mutations in the suprabasal K1 or K10 (Cheng et al., 1992; Chipev et al., 1992; Rothnagel et al., 1992; Yang et al., 1997; Suga et al., 1998; Ishida-Yamamoto et al., 2000), did not show K6/K16 protein expression in flank skin (Porter et al., 1998). Ichthyosis is a group of skin disorders with different causes, showing disturbed epidermal differentiation with variable effects on the permeability barrier (Lavrijsen et al., 1993)..

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	93	The expression of involucrin and loricrin, as well as filaggrin, were significantly reduced in heterozygote and homozygote epidermis in the CTSD-deficient mice. Filaggrin deficiency is well known in ichthyosis vulgaris (Gunzel et al., 1991). Defective interaction between keratin and filaggrin is also seen in epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. Abnormal distribution of loricrin has been detected in genetic diseases involving loricrin (loricrin keratoderma, Vohwinkel's syndrome) (Maestrini et al., 1996; Suga et al., 2000). Loricrin mutation in Vohwinkel's keratoderma is unique to the variant with ichthyosis (Korge et al., 1997). Defects in cross-linking of loricrin are detected in TG1-deficient mice, the animal model of lamellar ichthyosis (Matsuki et al., 1998)..

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	95	Evaluation of the barrier function in our CTSD( to / to )-mice by measurements of TEWL revealed no constitutive defect. We suggest that development of ichthyosiform skin compensates for defective stratum corneum morphology and deficiency in differentiation-related proteins. Recently, similar results have been reported in mice lacking TG1 (Matsuki et al., 1998). Skin from TG1-deficient mice, which die as neonates, lacks the normal insoluble CE and has impaired barrier function. Neonatal TG1( to / to ) mouse skin was taut and erythrodermic, but transplanted TG1( to / to ) mouse skin resembled that seen in severe ichthyosis, with epidermal hyperplasia and marked hyperkeratosis. Abnormalities in those barrier structures remained, but TEWL was decreased to control levels in the ichthyosiform skin. The authors suggested that the ichthyosiform skin phenotype in TG1 deficiency develops massive hyperkeratosis as a physical compensation for the defective cutaneous permeability barrier (Kuramoto et al., 2002). A compensatory mechanisms maintaining skin barrier function in the absence of a major CE protein was also described in a loricrin-deficient mouse model (Koch et al., 2000). Also, targeted ablation of the murine involucrin gene did not show defects in barrier function. These mice developed normally, possessed apparently normal epidermis and hair follicles and generated CEs that could not be distinguished from those of wild-type mice (Djian et al., 2000; Jensen et al., 1999b). The complexity and redundancy of epithelial barrier function has been discussed by Steinert (Steinert, 2000). Our CTSD( to / to ) mouse model has a broader impact on skin morphology than either involucrin or loricrin deficiency. Notably, there are similarities between the skin of CTSD( to / to ) mice, the skin of TG1( to / to ) mice and the human skin disease lamellar ichthyosis. In lamellar ichthyosis a mutation in the TG1 gene resulting in a reduction in epidermal involucrin was described (Hohl et al., 1993; Huber et al., 1995). The similarities are explained by the strongly reduced TG1 expression in the skin of CTSD( to / to ) mice..

0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	3	The contribution of estrogens to the prevention of neurodegenerative disorders has attracted considerable attention over the last few years as a result of conflicting data from clinical trials, some of which have shown protective effects of postmenopausal estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy (HRT), whereas others (including the recently concluded Women s Health Initiative trial) have revealed no significant benefit. Although the reason for these apparently discrepant results remains the subject of heated debate, a growing body of evidence suggests that individual women may exhibit variable neuroprotective responses to HRT, in part because of interactions with other known risk factors for neurodegenerative disease. One such risk factor, which modulates the effects of HRT on rates of cognitive decline in aging women, is the expression pattern of allelic variants of apolipoprotein E (apoE). The paper by Nathan et al. (1) in this issue of Endocrinology indicates why this may be the case. Trophic effects of the natural ovarian estrogen, estradiol-17ss, on neurite growth in cultured mouse cerebral cortical neurons are reported to be critically dependent on apoE expression. Moreover, responses to estradiol-17ss are shown to be dependent on the type of apoE present: whereas estradiol-17ss is neurotrophic in the presence of human apoE 2 or apoE 3, the apoE 4 variant, which has been associated with the progression of late onset Alzheimer s disease, does not support this response..

0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	5	The concept that HRT might have beneficial effects on the aging brain evolved initially from studies in laboratory animals. Almost 3 decades ago, estradiol-17ss was shown to exert neurotrophic effects in tissue explants derived from the developing mouse hypothalamus and preoptic area (2). Synaptogenic effects of estradiol-17ss were later demonstrated to occur in the adult brain, including regions of the brain, such as the hippocampus, that are important for cognitive function (3, 4). In various models of neuronal damage, natural and synthetic estrogens were reported to enhance cell survival (5), whereas estradiol-17ss treatment was shown to enhance nonamyloidogenic processing of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (6). Estradiol-17ss was also found to have positive effects on maintenance of the neurotransmitter systems that undergo degeneration in Alzheimer s disease (7) and Parkinson s disease (8). Taken together, these observations provided strong mechanistic support for the concept that postmenopausal HRT might slow or prevent neurodegenerative processes..
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	6	The concept that HRT might have beneficial effects on the aging brain evolved initially from studies in laboratory animals. Almost 3 decades ago, estradiol-17ss was shown to exert neurotrophic effects in tissue explants derived from the developing mouse hypothalamus and preoptic area (2). Synaptogenic effects of estradiol-17ss were later demonstrated to occur in the adult brain, including regions of the brain, such as the hippocampus, that are important for cognitive function (3, 4). In various models of neuronal damage, natural and synthetic estrogens were reported to enhance cell survival (5), whereas estradiol-17ss treatment was shown to enhance nonamyloidogenic processing of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (6).

Part of the problem appears to be that in human beings, unlike laboratory animals, effects of HRT may be confounded by a variety of other factors, which modulate or oppose the actions of the hormones. One particularly important genetic factor appears to be the expression pattern of apoE. Expression of different apoE alleles had previously been demonstrated to affect the risk of atherosclerosis (12) as well as the rate of progression of several human neurodegenerative diseases (13, 14), including Alzheimer s dementia (15). Intriguingly, patterns of apoE expression were also found to significantly influence responses to HRT (16)..

0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	9	The mechanism underlying this interaction remained uncertain. One possibility was that it might reflect the known effects of apoE expression on atherosclerotic processes (12), with cerebral vascular compromise secondarily affecting the rate of cognitive decline (16). An alternative hypothesis, however, was suggested by studies aimed at elucidating the effects of estradiol-17ss on apoE expression in nerve cells. Studies in mice demonstrated that expression of apoE in different brain regions varied with stage of the female reproductive cycle (17), consistent with the hypothesis that estradiol-17ss might induce apoE expression in the brain, as had already been demonstrated for apoE in blood (18). Addition of apoE 3 was found to produce effects like those of estradiol-17ss on cultured neurons (19). Moreover, neuroprotective effects of estradiol-17ss were abolished in transgenic mice homozygous for deletion of the apoE gene (20). These observations raised the possibility that apoE might represent an integral component of the mechanisms mediating trophic responses of neurons to estrogen exposure..

0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	11	The study by Nathan et al. (1) demonstrate that this is indeed the case. The growth-promoting effects of estradiol-17ss not only depend on the expression of apoE, they are also highly dependent on the nature of the apoE subtype. In cultured cells from the adult mouse cerebral cortex, estradiol-17ss increased both apoE levels and neurite outgrowth. The hormone had no effect on neurite outgrowth from mice lacking the apoE gene, or when only apoE 4 was exogenously supplied. ApoE 2, an apoE variant that has been associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer s disease and increased age of onset, increased neurite length more than apoE 3 in the presence of estradiol-17ss. Cultures from mice transgenic for human apoE 3 were capable of responding to estradiol-17ss, whereas those from mice expressing only apoE 4 were relatively insensitive. Similarly, apoE 3 was accumulated in neurons to a greater extent than apoE 4 and was more effective in facilitating neuronal uptake of fatty acid. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that apoE may play an integral role in supporting the neurotrophic effects of estradiol-17ss and that patterns of apoE expression may have a profound impact on the sensitivity of the brain to estrogen action..
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	12	These observations have important implications for future studies on the effects of HRT. If expression of specific apoE alleles is required for estrogen to exert neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects, the pattern of apoE allele expression is likely to be important in determining the effectiveness of estrogen-based HRT. Synergism between apoE subtype expression and the effects of HRT has already been demonstrated with respect to the progression of atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women, for which estrogen use appears to be particularly beneficial in patients with no apoE 4 allele (12). The same situation may well be true for effects on neurodegenerative processes. Yaffe et al. (16) administered cognitive function tests over a number of years to women who were either taking estrogen-based HRT, had taken HRT at some time in the past, or who had never used HRT. In the women who did not express the apoE 4 variant, postmenopausal estrogen use reduced the risk of age-related cognitive impairment by almost 50%, compared with the women who never used estrogen. By contrast, apoE 4-positive women did not show a significant estrogen response (16). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that analysis of apoE variant expression may be predictive of whether HRT is likely to have long-term beneficial cognitive effects..

0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	14	Much remains to be done. One of the key questions that remains to be answered is the extent to which the data presented by Nathan et al. (1) can be extrapolated to the normal brain. The work of Nathan et al. used cultures of dispersed neuronal and glial cells from the adult mouse cerebral cortex. It will be important in future to determine whether the effects of estrogens on the aging brain involve comparable apoE-dependent mechanisms. Published evidence is consistent with the view that effects of estradiol-17ss on the recovery of the mature brain from injury require apoE. Thus, in mice, enhancement of synaptic sprouting by estradiol-17ss in response to an entorhinal cortex lesions is dependent on apoE expression (21). However, neuronal damage, perhaps including the cellular damage inevitably incurred during the preparation of primary cell cultures, may result in reexpression of estrogen receptor mechanisms that are normally expressed only in development (22). Hence, it remains to be established whether these findings can be extrapolated to the regulation of neuronal growth and survival in the uninjured brain. As postulated by Nathan et al. (1), in dementia or after trauma, degeneration and repair may be in dynamic balance, with cognitive decline occurring when degenerative processes predominate. However, significant trophic responses to estradiol-17ss are also observed under conditions in which neurodegeneration is probably minimal (3, 4). These responses may contribute to the effects of estrogens on cognitive performance (23). It remains to be determined whether apoE is involved in the trophic actions of estradiol-17ss under normal physiological, as opposed to pathological, conditions..
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	15	A second question is how apoE is regulated by steroids other than estradiol-17ss. A wide range of estrogens and progestins have been used for HRT in postmenopausal women (10, 11). It remains to be determined how these different steroids affect apoE expression. The question of the specificity of the apoE response is critical because of the possibility that some combinations of hormonal agents could abrogate the beneficial effects of natural estrogens. For example, Nilsen and Brinton (24) have reported that whereas progesterone and 19-norprogesterone both potentiate the neuroprotective effects of estradiol-17ss, the opposite effect is observed with medroxyprogesterone acetate, the synthetic progestin used in the Women s Health Initiative trial. Whether or not apoE expression is affected by other steroids is also important because of the fact that estradiol-17ss is not the only hormonal steroid with neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties. Recent work suggests that androgens may confer protection against neurodegenerative processes. Men with higher free testosterone levels appear to have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer s disease (25), whereas reduced levels of the principal adrenal androgen, dehydroepiandrosterone, have been reported in Alzheimer s disease patients (26). In laboratory studies, androgens and progestins have been reported to elicit neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects under a variety of experimental conditions (24, 27, 28). Although in some cases these effects may involve either interactions with estrogen or intermediate estrogen biosynthesis, in others they clearly do not (27). An intriguing hypothesis for future study is that apoE expression may represent a common link in steroid-activated neurotrophic responses. If so, effects of androgens, like those of estrogens, may be influenced by apoE genotype. Interestingly, this possibility has already been raised by preliminary clinical studies, which demonstrated interactions between testosterone and apoE 4 expression in men with Alzheimer s disease, as well as an association between apoE 4 and circulating testosterone levels in men without the disease (29). These observations raise the possibility that the relationship between apoE expression and gonadal steroids may be multifactorial, with the apoE 4 allele directly affecting the risk of neurodegenerative disease via effects on neuronal growth and survival, as well as indirectly via reductions in testicular androgen secretion..

(1), however, is the potential for development of novel strategies for replacement therapy designed to directly target the regulation of neural apoE expression. The adverse effects of conventional HRT are primarily associated with responses that do not involve the brain, including alterations in coagulation factors, enhancing the risk of stroke, as well as trophic effects on the reproductive organs, resulting in increased risks for breast and endometrial cancer (10, 11). If regulation of apoE expression is indeed a critical component of the mechanisms mediating neuroprotective responses to estradiol-17ss, direct targeting of apoE regulation in the brain might mimic the beneficial central effects of this hormone without the adverse risks associated with conventional HRT. Such an approach seems at least potentially feasible, because the receptor systems mediating the effects of estrogens on central apoE synthesis may well be different from those found in nonneural estrogen target organs. Thus, estradiol-17, an estrogen with weak systemic hormonal activity, is fully capable of inducing apoE synthesis and release in mouse cerebral cortex and cultured glial cells (30, 31). As a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of estrogen on apoE expression evolves, it may be possible to identify agents that will selectively up-regulate apoE expression in the brain with no significant adverse effects on tissues elsewhere in the body..

The authors performed a meta-analysis of 14 studies (16 comparisons) with CTSD genotyping (3,174 Alzheimer s disease cases and 3,298 controls). Overall, the random effects odds ratio for the T versus the C allele was 1.17 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95, 1.44), with some between-study heterogeneity (p  <  0.01). There was significant between-study heterogeneity but no evidence of a significant association when the first hypothesis-generating study was excluded from the calculations (odds ratio (OR) = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.35; p = 0.29). The summary odds ratio for T carriers versus T noncarriers was similar in subjects carrying or not carrying an apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4). The increased susceptibility to Alzheimer s disease conferred by APOE*4 carriage tended to be more prominent in the presence of the T allele (random effects OR = 6.07, 95% CI: 4.19, 8.79, and OR = 4.09, 95% CI: 3.15, 5.31, in T carriers and noncarriers, respectively). The meta-analysis shows that the CTSD polymorphism is not a major risk factor for Alzheimer s disease, although a small effect or an enhancement of the APOE*4 effect cannot be excluded..

The cathepsin D gene (CTSD) is located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p15.5) and consists of nine exons. The synthesis of beta-amyloid peptide is a putative key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer s disease. Beta-amyloid derives from its precursor protein via proteolytic cleavage by secretases.

There is also controversy on whether this polymorphism may interact with the apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4), which is the best known genetic determinant for sporadic Alzhei-mer s disease (20). Single studies may have been underpowered to detect interactions or even overall effects. Given the amount of accumulated data, we deemed it important to perform a quantitative synthesis of the evidence using rigorous methods. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of all available studies relating the CTSD polymorphism to the risk of Alzheimer s disease..

Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1, and presenilin 2 genes account for 5 percent of the cases and result in an autosomally dominant pattern that is expressed with complete penetrance and early manifestations (23). Alzheimer s disease is probably slightly more common in females (24). Other proven or postulated risk factors include head injury (in particular among males) (25), as well as family history, low income, low education, low occupational status, depression, exposure to aluminum in drinking water, hypertension, and Down s syndrome (26, 27). Conversely, the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to treat arthritis has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzhei-mer s disease, as has been estrogen use by postmenopausal women (27). Physical activity, diets with high levels of vitamins B6, B12, and folate, and red wine in moderate quantities may be protective (27). The prevalence of Alzheimer s disease varies considerably among different population groups (28). At least a few dozens of polymorphisms have been examined in relation to sporadic Alzheimer s disease, and published reviews are available (23, 29). Among them, there is conclusive evidence from several studies and meta-analysis thereof that APOE*4 is a strong risk factor for developing Alzheimer s disease for both male and female subjects and for both early onset ( < 65 years) and late-onset disease (20), with an approximately fivefold increase in the odds of developing Alzheimer s disease. Single studies have also implicated other polymorphisms as being important, although the reported odds ratios are much smaller than those seen for APOE*4, and attempts at replication in subsequent research have not been conclusive. Meta-analyses for some other polymorphisms have already appeared in the literature (30 to 35). They suggest no significant overall associations for several of these polymorphisms, including the myeloperoxidase gene promoter polymorphism (30), intronic or promoter region polymorphisms of presenilin 1 (for late-onset disease) (31), an insertion-deletion polymorphism or a missense mutation in the alpha-2 macroglobulin gene (32), and several polymorphisms of the protein tau gene (33). Associations of modest effect size (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.30 to 1.35) have been claimed in meta-analyses of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein gene exon 3 polymorphism (34) and of an insertion-deletion polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme I gene (35)..

One study (6) mentioned that 61 percent of Alzheimer s disease cases had late-onset disease (age of onset:  > 65 years), five studies (8, 12 to 14, 19) specifically included only late-onset Alzheimer s disease cases, one study (18) specifically excluded such patients, and the remaining did not clarify the age at onset. Controls did not have a diagnosis of Alzheimer s disease, but the amount of additional screening (general physical and neurologic examination, psychiatric interview, neuropsychological testing, blood and cerebrospinal fluid studies, computed tomography scan, and Mini-Mental State Examination score) to exclude Alzheimer s disease differed substantially across studies..

The T allele was more highly represented among controls of American descent (overall prevalence of 8.6 percent, 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 7.1, 10.1) than in controls of European (7.8 percent, 95 percent CI: 7.0, 8.6) or Asian (0.9 percent, 95 percent CI: 0.3, 1.5) descent. There was significant heterogeneity in the prevalence rates of the T allele even across the control subjects of European descent, with a rate of 14.3 percent among Hispanic Americans, 10.4 percent in Italy, 10.1 percent in Spain, and lower rates in northern European countries (7.6 percent in the United Kingdom, 6.3 percent in Sweden, 6.1 percent in Germany, and the lowest prevalence rate of 4.5 percent in a Polish population). Overall, the prevalence of T/T homozygosity was 0.3 percent, 0.8 percent, and 0.2 percent in control subjects of American, European, and Asian descent, respectively. The respective prevalence rates of C/T heterozygosity were 16.6 percent, 14.0 percent, and 1.5 percent, and the respective rates for C/C homozygosity were 83.1 percent, 85.2 percent, and 98.3 percent.

Distribution of CTSD alleles among Alzheimer s disease cases and controls in the included studies   Overall effects There was a trend suggesting that the T allele may confer increased susceptibility to Alzheimer s disease (figure 1). As shown in table 3, the summary odds ratio was 1.17 by random effects (p = 0.14), and there was significant heterogeneity among the 16 study comparisons (p  <  0.01 for heterogeneity). We found no evidence of an association of the T/T genotype with the risk of Alzheimer s disease relative to the C/C genotype. There was no significant between-study heterogeneity. No evidence of an association with Alzhei-mer s disease was discerned also when the recessive model was examined for the effect of T, while a trend for an association was seen in the dominant model (by random effects, OR = 1.19, 95 percent CI: 0.97, 1.47; p = 0.10). There was no between-study heterogeneity in the recessive model contrast, while significant heterogeneity (p  <  0.05) was still seen for the dominant model contrast. Subgroup analysis of studies with cases and controls of European descent yielded similar results (15 comparisons (11,436 alleles): OR = 1.18, 95 percent CI: 0.96, 1.46; p = 0.12) (p  <  0.01 for heterogeneity)..

Summary odds ratios for various contrasts   Bias diagnostics In cumulative meta-analysis and recursive cumulative meta-analysis, the magnitude of the summary odds ratio had not been stable over time, and it had changed considerably per year with an apparent dissipation of the postulated effect (by random effects, summary OR for T vs. C: 2.05 at the end of 1999, 1.41 at the end of 2000, 1.16 at the end of 2001, 1.14 at the end of 2002, and 1.17 in 2003). Excluding the first hypothesis-generating study (9), we found that the summary odds ratio became 1.11 (95 percent CI: 0.91, 1.35; p = 0.29) with significant between-study heterogeneity (p  <  0.05), and there was no evidence of any association even in the comparison of the homozygotes (T/T vs. C/C: OR = 0.96, 95 percent CI: 0.48, 1.90; p = 0.91), with no between-study heterogeneity. There was no relation between the effect size and the variance of each study, suggesting that larger studies agreed with the results of smaller studies. Analyses limited to studies with more intensive efforts to exclude Alzheimer s disease from controls yielded similar results (11 comparisons (10,382 alleles): OR = 1.22, 95 percent CI: 0.96, 1.54; p = 0.10) (p = 0.02 for heterogeneity)..

Among carriers of the high-risk APOE*4 allele, T allele carriers had a random-effects odds ratio of 1.38 (95 percent CI: 0.89, 2.15) for Alzheimer s disease compared with subjects not carrying the T allele. Among subjects not carrying the APOE*4 allele, the respective odds ratio was 1.13 (95 percent CI: 0.90, 1.42). There was significant between-study heterogeneity in the APOE*4-positive group (p = 0.07). The two effect sizes overlapped widely..

Moreover, the meta-analysis also cannot exclude the possibility that the presence of the CTSD T allele may enhance the increased susceptibility toward Alzheimer s disease conferred by APOE*4.

Cathepsin D is an intracellular acid protease with beta-secretase activity in vitro (1, 2) that can cleave amyloid precursor protein and the tau protein to generate fragments with intact microtubule-binding domains (44), which might play a role in the pathogenesis of paired helical filaments. One study has shown that the CTSD polymorphism is associated with increased secretion and altered intracellular maturation of procathepsin D (3). It should be noted that it is not clear whether the CTSD polymorphism has functional consequences for the mature form of the enzyme. Although we cannot exclude a biologic effect for the CTSD polymorphism, our findings are in accordance with the results of a recent full genome scan showing no significant linkage of Alzheimer s disease to the short arm of chromosome 11, the region where the CTSD gene is located (45 to 47)..

Our analyses addressed interactions with APOE*4, the major known genetic determinant of Alzhei-mer s disease. Interactions with other genetic or environmental factors have not been studied. The trend for a stronger effect of APOE*4 in the presence of T allele carriage is interesting in the light of data suggesting that T carriage may affect the general intelligence (5). However, subgroup and interaction analyses should be interpreted cautiously, since differences between subgroups may occur by chance (49) and their validation would require studies with even larger sample sizes than the several thousand included in this meta-analysis. Finally, population stratification may theoretically have affected the results of the constituent studies in the meta-analysis (50), since we documented that the frequency of the T allele varied considerably among the different ethnic groups or even among the different ethnic groups of European descent. However, most studies were strictly ethnically defined, so the population stratification effect is unlikely to have been of any considerable magnitude..

Early and small genetic association studies may come up with spurious findings (41, 51, 52).
