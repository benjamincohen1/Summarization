We have reported previously (Michikawa, M., Fan, Q.-W., Isobe, I., and Yanagisawa, K. (2000) J. Neurochem. 74, 1008-1016) that exogenously added recombinant human apolipoprotein E (apoE) promotes cholesterol release in an isoform-dependent manner. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this isoform-dependent promotion of cholesterol release remains undetermined. In this study, we demonstrate that the cholesterol release is mediated by endogenously synthesized and secreted apoE isoforms and clarify the mechanism underlying this apoE isoform-dependent cholesterol release using cultured astrocytes prepared from human apoE3 and apoE4 knock-in mice. Cholesterol and phospholipids were released into the culture media, resulting in the generation of two types of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-like particles; one was associated with apoE and the other with apoJ. The amount of cholesterol released into the culture media from the apoE3-expressing astrocytes was ~2.5-fold greater than that from apoE4-expressing astrocytes. In contrast, the amount of apoE3 released in association with the HDL-like particles was similar to that of apoE4, and the sizes of the HDL-like particles released from apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes were similar. The molar ratios of cholesterol to apoE in the HDL fraction of the culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes were 250  plus or minus  6.0 and 119  plus or minus  5.1, respectively. These data indicate that apoE3 has an ability to generate similarly sized lipid particles with less number of apoE molecules than apoE4, suggesting that apoE3-expressing astrocytes can supply more cholesterol to neurons than apoE4-expressing astrocytes. These findings provide a new insight into the issue concerning the putative alteration of apoE-related cholesterol metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.

Previous epidemiological studies show that an elevated serum cholesterol level is a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 (1-3) and that statin therapy reduces the frequency of AD (4) and dementia (5). The decreased levels of cellular cholesterol have been shown to reduce A production in vitro (6) and in vivo (7). Previous studies have also shown the association of cholesterol accumulation with mature senile plaques (8) and neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons (9). Additionally, a recent study (10) has suggested that an increased cholesterol level in the membrane facilitates amyloid fibril formation through formation of GM1 ganglioside-bound A, a putative endogenous seed. These findings suggest that increased cellular cholesterol levels induce high amyloid -protein (A) production and subsequent AD development.
However, several studies (11-14) have shown opposing evidence indicating that cholesterol levels in serum, cell membranes of brains, and cerebrospinal fluid are decreased in AD patients compared with those in controls. Previous studies have shown that increased dietary cholesterol levels reduce A secretion (15) and that increased cellular cholesterol levels inhibit the A-mediated cell toxicity (16, 17). On the other hand, the effect of A on cellular cholesterol metabolism has also been investigated (18). Our recent studies have shown that not monomeric but oligomeric A affects cholesterol metabolism (19) and eventually reduces cellular cholesterol levels (20). In addition, cholesterol deficiency has been shown to promote tau phosphorylation in vitro (21, 22) and in vivo (23). These findings suggest that the involvement of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD is dualistic. The elevated levels of cellular cholesterol contribute to AD development by elevating A secretion; however, the increasing amount of oligomerized A reduces cellular cholesterol levels, which in turn may promote the progression of AD pathologies.
ApoE is one of the major apolipoproteins in the central nervous system regulating lipid metabolisms (24-27). Astrocytes and microglia are known to synthesize apoE (28, 29), which generates HDL-like particles with cellular lipids in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and culture media (25, 26, 30, 31). These apoE-lipid particles are assumed to supply cholesterol to neurons in an apoE receptor-mediated manner (32, 33). Previously, we have reported (34) that exogenously added recombinant human apoE promotes cholesterol release in an isoform-dependent manner. However, the mechanism underlying the isoform-dependent cholesterol release mediated by apoE remains undetermined. It is known that the majority of apoE in CSF and conditioned culture media is associated with lipids (31, 35), and that the characteristics of lipid particles generated by the addition of exogenous apolipoprotein and those generated by endogenous apolipoprotein are different. HDL-like particles generated by the addition of exogenous apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) (36) and apoE (34) have a low amount of cholesterol, whereas HDL-like particles formed with endogenous apoE are cholesterol-rich (37). These lines of evidence led us to determine whether the endogenous apoE-mediated cholesterol release from cultured astrocytes is isoform-specific and, if it is the case, to characterize the molecular mechanism underlying the isoform-dependent lipid release. In this study, we investigated the endogenous apoE-mediated cholesterol release from astrocytes isolated from human apoE3- and apoE4 knock-in mouse brains. We found that apoE3 has the ability to generate similarly sized HDL-like particles with less amount of apoE than apoE4. These findings may provide the basis for studies to relate cholesterol with AD pathogenesis.     EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES
Animals-- Mice expressing human apoE4 in place of mouse apoE were generated by the gene-targeting technique taking advantage of homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (knock-in) as described previously (38). ApoE3 knock-in mice were produced in the same manner except that the transgene carried apoE3 cDNA in place of apoE4 cDNA. The details of the generation of apoE3 mice will be described elsewhere. Postnatal day 2 mice that possess homozygous 3 (3:3) or 4 (4:4) allele and correctly expressing human apoE3 or apoE4 proteins, respectively, were used in this study.
Cell Culture-- Highly astrocyte-rich cultures were prepared according to a method described previously (39, 40). In brief, brains of postnatal day 2 mice were removed under anesthesia. The cerebral cortices from the mouse brains were dissected, freed from meninges, and diced into small pieces; the cortical fragments were incubated in 0.25% trypsin and 20 mg/ml DNase I in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, and 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4) at 37  degrees C for 20 min. The fragments were then dissociated into single cells by pipetting. The dissociated cells were seeded in 75-cm2 dishes at a cell density of 1  x  107 in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 10 days of incubation in vitro, astrocytes in the monolayer were trypsinized (0.1%) and reseeded onto 6-well dishes. The astrocyte-rich cultures were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS until use.
Neuron-rich cultures were prepared from rat cerebral cortices as described previously (19). The dissociated cells were suspended in the feeding medium and plated onto poly-D-lysine-coated 6-well plates at a cell density of 2  x  105/cm2. The feeding medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixture (DMEM/F-12; 50:50%) and N2 supplements. More than 99% of the cultured cells were identified as neurons by immunocytochemical analysis using monoclonal antibody against microtubule-associated protein 2, a neuron-specific marker, on day 3 of culture (41).
Quantification of Released and Intracellular Cholesterols and Phosphatidylcholines-- The astrocytes in 6-well plates were washed in DMEM three times and incubated in 2 ml of DMEM for 1, 3, and 5 days at 37  degrees C. The conditioned culture media were removed and processed for lipid extraction. The astrocytes in the monolayer were washed in PBS three times and air-dried at room temperature. Lipids in the conditioned culture media were extracted according to methods reported previously (34, 41), with some modifications. In brief, aliquots of 1.0 ml each of the conditioned culture media were transferred to clean glass tubes containing 4.0 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v). The organic phase was separated from the aqueous phase, washed twice by vigorous mixing with 3 ml of water, re-separated from the aqueous phase by centrifugation, and dried under N2 gas. For extraction of intracellular lipids, dried cells were incubated in hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2 v/v) for 1 h at room temperature. The solvent from each plate was removed and dried under N2 gas. The organic phases were redissolved in 400  microl of chloroform, and 150  microl of each sample was transferred onto 96-well polypropylene plates (Corning Glass) and dried under air flow. The dried lipids were then dissolved in 20  microl of isopropyl alcohol, and the contents of cholesterol and phospholipids were determined using cholesterol (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and phospholipid (Kyowa Medix, Tokyo, Japan) determiner kits, respectively.
Determination of Amount of [14C]Acetate Incorporated into Cholesterol and Phosphatidylcholine-- Astrocytes cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS were washed in PBS three times and recultured in DMEM. The cultures were then treated with 37 kBq/ml [14C]acetate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1, 3, and 5 days. At the indicated time points, the culture medium was quickly removed; the cells were then washed three times with cold PBS and dried at room temperature. Aliquots of 0.5 ml each of the conditioned culture media were transferred to clean glass tubes containing 2.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v). For the extraction of intracellular lipids, dried cells were incubated in hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2 v/v) for 1 h at room temperature. The solvent from each plate was removed and dried under N2 gas. The organic phases were redissolved in 50  microl of chloroform, and 10  microl of each sample was spotted on activated silica gel high performance thin layer chromatography plates (Merck); the lipids were separated by sequential one-dimensional chromatography using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25:15:4:2, v/v), followed by another run in hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80:30:1). [14C]Cholesterol and [14C]phosphatidylcholine were used as standards. The chromatography plates were exposed to radiosensitive films, and each lipid was visualized and quantified with BAS2500 (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). For determination of protein concentration, the astrocytes were cultured in 1 ml of distilled water containing 0.1% NaOH for 1 h, and 10  microl of each sample was processed for determination of protein concentration using a BCA kit.
Density Gradient Ultracentrifugation-- After incubation in DMEM for 5 days, the astrocyte culture medium was collected, centrifuged at 1,600  x  g for 15 min in a 50-ml plastic tube to exclude cell debris, and adjusted to a discontinuous sucrose gradient. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was prepared in a 14  x  89-mm ultracentrifuge tube (Ultraclear, Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) from the bottom to the top, with 2 ml of sucrose at a density of 1.30 g/ml, 3 ml at 1.20 g/ml, 3 ml at 1.10 g/ml, and 4 ml at 1.006 g/ml medium. The sample in the sucrose gradient was then centrifuged in an SW41-Ti swing rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) at 4  degrees C for 48 h at 160,000  x  gav. Following density gradient centrifugation, 12 1.0-ml fractions were collected with a micropipette from the top gradient. The densities of the fractions were determined by measuring the weight of 100  microl of each fraction using a micropipette. The final fraction was stirred to resuspend the pellet. The lipid content in each fraction was determined as described above. The density of each fraction was determined using a density meter, DMA35N (Anton Paar, Graz, Austria).
Immunoblot Analysis-- Samples of each fraction were dissolved in the sampling buffer consisting of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue and analyzed by 12.5% Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE as reported previously (42). The separated proteins were transferred onto Immobilon membranes with a semidry electrophoretic transfer apparatus (Nihon Eido, Tokyo, Japan) using a transfer buffer (0.1 M Tris, 0.192 M glycine, and 20% methanol). Blots were probed for 4 h at room temperature with a goat anti-apoE polyclonal antibody, AB947 (1:2,000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and a goat anti-apoJ antibody (1: 2,000; Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). Band detection was carried out with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). For determination of the concentration of apoE released into the culture medium, signals corresponding to apoE of each sample in the immunoblot membrane were quantified by densitometry with NIH image software, with varying concentrations of synthetic apoE protein (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) as standards. Standard signals were demonstrated to be linear in the range of apoE protein amounts from 0 to 2  microg per lane. The apoE concentrations in the conditioned culture media within this range were used for analysis. For detection of the oligomeric apoE protein in the conditioned culture media, Western blot analysis was performed under nonreducing conditions. Aliquots of each conditioned culture medium of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes were mixed with the same volume of the 2 x  nonreducing Laemmli buffer consisting of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 4% SDS, and 0.01% bromphenol blue, but no -mercaptoethanol, and analyzed by Western blotting as described above.
Size Determination of Lipoprotein Particles-- The conditioned culture media of astrocytes expressing human apoE3 and apoE4 were concentrated 5-fold using a Centriprep-YM10 tube (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by centrifugation in a JA-12 rotor using a Beckman J-25I ultracentrifuge at 4  degrees C for 40 min at 3,000  x  g. After centrifugation, the sample was subjected to density gradient ultracentrifugation with a discontinuous sucrose gradient as described above. Two milliliters of the HDL fraction (fraction number 4) in a Centricon YM10 tube (Millipore) was further concentrated to 200  microl in a JA-20.1 rotor using a Beckman J-25I ultracentrifuge at 4  degrees C for 2 h at 5,000  x  g. The concentrated conditioned culture medium was then subjected to nondenaturing 4-20% TBE (pH 8.3)-buffered PAGE to evaluate the particle size heterogeneity of the apoE fractions. Ten microliters of apoE-lipid particles (unboiled and nonreduced) containing 10% sucrose and 0.02% bromphenol blue was applied onto 4-20% gradient gel. Native high molecular weight protein standards (Amersham Biosciences) were used as size standards (43). Electrophoresis was performed at 4  degrees C with a prerun of 15 min at 125 V before the entry of samples into the stacking gel, followed by migration at 100 V for 8 h. The separated apoE that migrated as a lipid-apoE complex was transferred onto Immobilon membrane with a semidry electrophoretic transfer apparatus (Nihon Eido, Tokyo, Japan) using a transfer buffer (0.1 M Tris, 0.192 M glycine and 20% methanol). Separated proteins were probed for 4 h at room temperature with a goat anti-apoE polyclonal antibody, AB947 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) (1:2000). ApoE protein was detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The mean apoE-lipid particle size was obtained based on the migration of the size standards, which were stained by 0.5% Ponceau S (Sigma) and 1% acetic acid in distilled water.
Statistical Analysis-- StatView computer software (Macintosh) was used for statistical analysis. Statistical significance of differences between samples was evaluated by the Student's t test.     RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES
The apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes became confluent 7 days after replating and appeared morphologically comparable. The time-dependent curves for the release of cholesterol and phospholipids from cultured astrocytes expressing human apoE3 and apoE4 are shown in Fig. 1, a and b, respectively. We found that the amounts of cholesterol (Fig. 1a) and phospholipids (Fig. 1b) released from cells of both genotypes increased in a time-dependent manner and that the amounts of these lipids released from apoE3-expressing astrocytes were significantly higher than those from apoE4-expressing astrocytes at days 3 and 5, when compared on the basis of cellular protein. In contrast, the levels of [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine in both apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes were at similar at each time point (Fig. 1, c and d). Similarly, the total amounts of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids in both genotypes of astrocytes were similar at each time point (Fig. 1, e and f).
View larger version (35K):    Fig. 1.   Characterization of lipid metabolism in cultured astrocytes prepared from human apoE3 and apoE4 knock-in mouse brains. Astrocyte-rich cultures were prepared as described under "Experimental Procedures." Three-week-cultured astrocytes were washed three times with DMEM and incubated in DMEM. At the time points indicated, the lipids released into the medium and the intracellular lipids were extracted and analyzed as described under "Experimental Procedures" (a, b, e, and f). For determination of the synthesis rates of cholesterol and phospholipids, the cultured astrocytes were washed three times with DMEM, followed by incubation with [14C]acetate for 2 h at 37  degrees C. The cells were then washed in cold PBS three times, and the amount of [14C]acetate incorporated into cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine was determined as described under "Experimental Procedures" (c and d). The amounts of cholesterol (a) and phospholipids (b) from apoE3-expressing astrocytes () were significantly greater than those from apoE4-expressing astrocytes (), respectively, and there were no significant differences in cellular cholesterol/phospholipids concentrations (e and f) or the rate of cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine synthesis (c and d) between apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes. Data are means  plus or minus  S.E. for 4 samples. *, p  <  0.001 versus apoE4-expressing astrocytes. Six independent experiments show similar results.
We next determined the amounts of apoE3 and apoE4 released into each culture medium. Western blot analysis of the conditioned culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes at culture days 1, 3, and 5 shows that the total amount of apoE released into the culture media of both apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes increased with culture time (Fig. 2, a and b). The densitometric analysis of these signals shows that comparative amounts of apoE were released from apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes (Fig. 2b).
View larger version (26K):    Fig. 2.   Amount of apoE protein released into the conditioned culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes. Astrocyte-rich cultures were prepared as described under "Experimental Procedures." Before experiments, the cells were washed three times with DMEM and cultured in DMEM. At the time points indicated, the lipids released into the medium were extracted and analyzed as described under "Experimental Procedures." The aliquots (5  microl) from each sample were subjected to immunoblot analysis using the polyclonal anti-apoE antibody, AB947, as the primary antibody (a). The intensity of each band was quantified by densitometric analysis using NIH imaging software for Macintosh (b). The amount of apoE released into the culture media from apoE3-expressing astrocytes was similar to that from apoE4-expressing astrocytes. Four independent experiments show similar results.
The characteristics of the lipid particles released into the serum-free media from cultured astrocytes were examined. The results of density gradient ultracentrifugation of the cultured media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes, shown in Fig. 3, indicate that the lipid distribution in each sample contains two peaks. They show that most of the cholesterol and phospholipids are distributed similarly in the fractions with densities of 1.04-1.13 (fractions 3-5). They also show that smaller amounts of cholesterol and phospholipids are distributed in the fractions having densities of 1.14-1.21 g/ml (fractions 8 and 9). These results show that the major parts of cholesterol and phospholipids were present in the lighter density fractions 3-5, and the minor parts of these lipids were present in the heavier density fractions 8 and 9, the densities of which corresponded to those of HDL. Next, we performed immunoblot analysis of each fraction using anti-apoE and anti-apoJ antibodies. ApoE3 and apoE4 were detected mainly in fractions 4 and 5 of each sample of the conditioned culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes, which is consistent with the major peak of lipid distribution, as shown in Fig. 4, a and b, respectively. In contrast, apoJ in each sample of the conditioned culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes was detected in fractions 6-11, which are distinct from those containing apoE (Fig. 4, a and b). The distributions of apoE and apoJ across the fractions of each sample as quantified by densitometric analysis are shown in Fig. 4c, indicating the difference in distribution between apoE and apoJ.

Three-week-cultured astrocytes plated in 6-well dishes were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS (324  microg/ml cholesterol). The astrocytes were rinsed three times with fresh DMEM and incubated in DMEM for 5 days. The culture medium was collected and centrifuged at 1,600  x  g for 15 min to exclude cell debris. The supernatant was collected and subjected to the initial discontinuous density gradient prepared with sucrose solutions as described under "Experimental Procedures." After centrifugation, fractions were collected and analyzed for their cholesterol (a) and phospholipid (b) contents. The density of each fraction was also determined using a density meter, DMA35N (a). apoE3-Ast, apoE3-expressing astrocytes; apoE4-Ast, apoE4-expressing astrocytes. Six independent experiments showed similar results.
View larger version (32K):    Fig. 4.   Distribution of apoE3 and apoE4 across the fractions separated by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Twelve fractions obtained from the culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes as described in Fig. 3 were used for determination of the distribution of apoE and apoJ. Aliquots of 10  microl from each fraction were mixed with the same volume of sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins from the culture media of apoE3- (a) and apoE4-expressing astrocytes (b) were immunoblotted with an anti-apoE antibody and an anti-apoJ antibody. To determine the distribution pattern of apoE ( and ) and apoJ ( and ) across the fractions, immunoblot membranes were subjected to scanning, and the intensity of each band was determined by densitometric analysis using computer software (c). apoE3-Ast, apoE3-expressing astrocytes; apoE4-Ast, apoE4-expressing astrocytes. Six independent experiments show similar results.
In addition, because we found that neurons synthesize and secrete apoJ to form HDL-like particles without secretion of apoE, we characterized the apoJ-mediated lipid release from neurons to compare it with that from astrocytes. The apoJ-mediated lipid release into the conditioned media of cultured neurons was found to be distributed across the fractions at densities from 1.092 to 1.180 g/ml, which is similar to that of apoJ-mediated lipid release from astrocyte cultures (Fig. 5). The distribution peaks of apoJ (Fig. 5a), cholesterol (Fig. 5b), and phospholipids (Fig. 5c) across the fraction densities were found to be identical at 1.127 g/ml. These results show that apoJ-containing lipoproteins in both conditioned media of cultured neurons and astrocytes are heavier than those generated by apoE in the conditioned media of cultured astrocytes and that the characteristics of apoJ-containing lipoproteins generated from neurons and astrocytes examined in this study are comparable.
View larger version (24K):    Fig. 5.   Comparison of the distribution pattern of apolipoproteins and lipids in the conditioned media of cultured astrocytes and neurons. Density gradient ultracentrifugation of the conditioned culture media of neurons was performed to obtain 12 fractions. The neurons were cultured in serum-free N2-supplemented DMEM/F-12 medium (N2 medium) for 2 days, washed with fresh DMEM, and incubated in N2 medium for another 2 days. The culture medium was centrifuged at 1,600  x  g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected and subjected to the initial discontinuous density gradient analysis using sucrose solutions as described under "Experimental Procedures." After centrifugation, fractions were collected and analyzed for their cholesterol and phospholipids contents. Aliquots of 10  microl from each fraction were mixed with the same volume of sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were immunoblotted with an anti-apoE antibody and an anti-apoJ antibody. No apoE signal was detected in the conditioned culture medium of neurons. The intensities of apoJ signals detected by Western blotting were determined by densitometric analysis as described under "Experimental Procedures." For comparison, the results of the distribution of apoE3 and lipids across the fractions of the conditioned culture media of astrocytes are used. The values of each parameter are expressed in terms of the density of each fraction (x axis). The distributions of apoE3 () and apoJ () across the density of the conditioned culture medium of astrocytes and that of apoJ () of the conditioned culture medium of neurons are shown (a). The distributions of cholesterol and phospholipids for the astrocyte culture medium are shown as open circles (b and c), and those for neuronal culture medium are shown as closed circles (b and c). Astro-CM, the conditioned culture medium of astrocytes; Neuron-CM, the conditioned culture medium of neurons.
These results indicate that apoE-lipid complexes have isoform-dependent stoichiometry of lipids to apoE. Thus, we next determined the molar and weight ratios of cholesterol and phospholipids to apoE. The quantification of apoE in a given fraction was carried out by Western blot analysis, followed by densitometric analysis using recombinant human apoE3 and apoE4 as standards. As shown in Table I, the molar ratio of cholesterol to apoE with apoE3-lipid particles was 2.1-fold greater than that with apoE4-lipid particles. On the other hand, weight ratio of phospholipids to apoE with apoE3-lipid particles was 2.3-fold greater than that with apoE4-lipid particles. These values are comparable with the difference in the amount of lipids released from apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes (Fig. 1).
                              View this table:    Table I The molar and weight ratios of cholesterol and phospholipids to apoE associated with lipid complex released to cultured media The culture media of astrocytes expressing human apoE3 or apoE4 were changed to DMEM without serum. The cultures were incubated for 5 days, and then the conditioned media of each culture were collected. The conditioned culture media were fractionated by density gradient ultracentrifugation, and the amounts of cholesterol and phospholipids in the HDL fraction (fraction number 4) were determined as described under "Experimental Procedures." The amount of apoE in the same fraction was determined by quantitative Western blot analysis as described under "Experimental Procedures." ND, not determined.
These results show that the ability of apoE3 to form lipid particles is greater than that of apoE4, indicating that lipid particles are generated in a stable form by apoE3 with less number of apoE molecules than apoE4. We further determined and compared the sizes of the particles associated with apoE3 and apoE4. The sizes of the apoE-lipid particles in HDL fraction 4 were analyzed by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Each sample from the conditioned culture media of the apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes was separated by electrophoresis and subsequently analyzed by apoE Western blotting (Fig. 6). Two populations of prominent apoE-lipid particles with diameters of 6.3 and 8.97 nm were present in fraction 4 of the conditioned culture medium for both apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes. Equivalent amounts of aliquots were used for Western blot analysis with an anti-apoJ antibody, and no signal was detected (data not shown). The apoE-lipid particle sizes were determined by calculation of the size of each band based on the size standards. The particle sizes of the apoE3-expressing astrocytes are similar to those of apoE4-expressing astrocytes (Table II).

Two milliliters of the HDL fraction (fraction number 4) was further concentrated to 200  microl using Centricon YM10 (Millipore). The samples were electrophoresed on a nondenaturing 4-20% gradient gel, and the separated proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and probed with an anti-apoE antibody, AB947. As shown in Fig. 6, apoE associated with HDL-like particles was visualized as separated bands, and the sizes were determined in comparison with the migration of the standard proteins of known diameters (HMW calibration kit, Amersham Biosciences). There was no significant difference in the size of lipid particles obtained between apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes. n = 3 for each sample.
It has been suggested that disulfide-linked dimeric apoA-II exhibits stronger ability to promote lipid release than monomeric apoA-II because of its increased number of helical segments (44). Because apoE3 contains cysteine at residue 112 and apoE4 does not, the higher ability of apoE3 to promote lipid release may be caused by its increased number of helical segments due to the formation of disulfide-linked dimers. To examine this possibility, we performed immunoblot analysis of the conditioned culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes under reducing and nonreducing conditions. In the absence of -mercaptoethanol, the conditioned culture media of apoE3-expressing astrocytes contained oligomers, mainly dimers and less amount of tetramers, in addition to monomers, whereas those of apoE4-expressing astrocytes contained monomers (Fig. 7a). Obviously, the band representing apoE3 dimer was higher than the expected one (Mr = 68,400). Because it is known that serum apoE3 forms homodimers that migrate anomalously on SDS gel under nonreducing conditions (45), this may also be the case for apoE3 dimer in the conditioned culture media. The oligomers found in the conditioned culture media of apoE3-expressing astrocytes were found to be monomers, when the samples were incubated with 10% -mercaptoethanol (Fig. 7b).

Shown are the results of Western blot analysis under nonreducing or reducing conditions of apoE3 and apoE4 in the conditioned culture medium of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes, respectively. Oligomeric apoE (mainly dimers and less amount of tetramers) was found in the samples of apoE3-expressing astrocyte cultures, but not in those of apoE4-expressing astrocyte cultures (a). When the samples were incubated in Laemmli buffer containing 10% -mercaptoethanol (-ME), such oligomers were not detected in both samples (b). Five independent experiments show similar results.

Here, we demonstrate the apoE isoform-dependent lipid release from cultured astrocytes prepared from apoE3 and apoE4 knock-in mice. Although we have found no apoE isoform-dependent differences in size between the apoE3 and apoE4 lipid particles, nor in the total amount of released apoE between apoE3 and apoE4 astrocytes, the apoE3-specific enhancement of lipid release from the cells was observed. These results indicate that apoE3 has a higher ability to generate apoE lipid particles with less numbers of apoE molecules per particle than apoE4, suggesting that apoE3-expressing astrocytes could supply more cholesterol to neurons than apoE4-expressing astrocytes, thereby supporting neuronal plasticity and promoting neuronal regeneration.
It was reported that apolipoproteins with multiple -helix segments of 20-30 amino acid residues, in which hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues are aligned on opposite sides of the axis, induce cholesterol efflux from cells when added to the culture medium (44, 46-50). ApoE is one of such apolipoproteins, and the effects of apoE on cholesterol release have been examined in various cell systems (51-54). This apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol release results in the generation of pre--HDL, which contains apolipoproteins, cellular cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine. Recent studies (31, 37) have demonstrated that HDL-like particles in association with exogenous or endogenous apoE are also generated in the cultured medium of the central nervous system cells such as astrocytes and neurons. In addition, we have found that the addition of exogenous apoE promotes lipid release from the central nervous system cells generating HDL-like particles in an apoE isoform-dependent manner (34). Consistent with our previous findings using exogenous apoE, the present study also shows that the amount of lipids released from apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes is apoE isoform-dependent, with the order of potency being apoE3  >  apoE4. However, the mechanism underlying this isoform-dependent cholesterol release remains undetermined.
Therefore, the next question to be addressed is what is the mechanism underlying the apoE isoform-dependent cholesterol release. We found that the amount of lipids released from apoE3-expressing astrocytes is ~2.5-fold greater than that from apoE4-expressing astrocytes, whereas the amount of apoE3 released is similar to that of apoE4. One possible explanation to this may be that each particle contains equal amount of apoE proteins; however, particles containing apoE3 contain ~2.5-fold greater amounts of lipids than those containing apoE4. Another possible explanation may be that each particle contains equal amounts of lipids, but apoE3-containing particles contain lower numbers of apoE molecules than apoE4-containing particles. This implies that apoE3 has the ability to form lipid particles with a lower number of apoE molecules than apoE4, and thus to generate ~2.5-fold greater numbers of apoE-lipid particles than apoE4 with the same number of apoE molecules. Between these two possibilities, our experiment favors the latter because, as shown in Fig. 6 and Table II, the sizes of particles in both conditioned culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes are similar.
The apoE isoform-dependent difference in the association of lipoprotein particles may be explained in terms of the mechanism underlying the apoE isoform-specific formation of apoE oligomers; apoE3 protein forms dimers, and apoE4 does not. This difference may be because apoE3 has cysteine at position 112 of the N-terminal domain, whereas apoE4 has arginine at the same position. Previous studies have shown that the number and the length of amphiphilic helices are responsible for determining the ability of a given apolipoprotein to promote lipid release (44, 49, 55). Interestingly, human apoA-II is known to form disulfide-linked dimers and exhibit stronger ability to promote lipid release than monomeric apoA-II (44). These lines of evidence allow us to postulate that the higher ability of apoE dimers than apoE monomers to promote lipid release may explain the greater amounts of lipids released in the conditioned culture media of apoE3-expressing astrocytes than apoE4-expressing astrocytes. Based on this assumption, we propose a model of the isoform-dependent association of apoE with lipid particles (Fig. 8). Consistent with our present results, previous studies have revealed the conformational adaptability of apoE the N-terminal domain as a function of lipid availability (56) or the presence of competitor apolipoproteins (for review see Ref. 57). In these studies, a model of two possible conformations of apoE on spherical lipid particles was proposed; at a high apoE concentration, the N-terminal domain is displaced from the lipid surface to form a helix bundle in a closed conformation, whereas at a low concentration on the surface, the four helix bundles of the N-terminal domain are in an open conformation, and all the helices are in contact with the lipid surface. Based on these lines of evidence together with our findings that an apoE3-containing HDL-like particle contains approximately one-half the number of apoE molecules compared with an apoE4-containing particle, it may be possible that the apoE isoform-dependent conformational change occurs on the surface of lipid particles; the N-terminal domain of apoE3 is in an open conformation, whereas that of apoE4 is in closed helix bundle conformation.
View larger version (40K):    Fig. 8.   Model of apoE lipid particles generated by apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes. The present data indicate that apoE3 has the ability to generate similarly sized apoE lipid particles with less number of apoE molecules than apoE4. Based on these findings, we propose a model showing that one apoE4-containing lipid particle contains ~2-fold numbers of apoE molecules compared with an apoE3-containing lipid particle.
Another possible explanation may be the preferential association of apoE isoforms with lipoproteins; apoE4 preferentially associates with very low density lipoprotein, whereas apoE3 associates with HDL. This assumption is based on the facts that the N-terminal domain modulates the lipid-binding preference elicited by the C-terminal domain (58, 59) and that the interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains is responsible for this isoform preference (60, 61). It has been suggested that in apoE4, the interaction of arginine 61 with glutamic acid 255 may stabilize an extended helical structure in the carboxyl terminus that is best accommodated on a less curved very low density lipoprotein surface, whereas this interaction does not exist in apoE3, which therefore lacks stability and has shorter helices and preference for HDL (61, 62). Based on these lines of evidence, apoE3 may preferentially bind to an HDL particle with a lower number of apoE molecules to stabilize the particle, whereas apoE4 has less binding efficacy to an HDL particle, which requires higher numbers of apoE molecules to stabilize the particle. Because the physical properties of apoE are assumed to influence its functions (i.e. how it associates with lipid particles and stabilizes them), the apoE-isoform-dependent difference in the stability among the 22-kDa N-terminal fragments of apoE (63) may be involved in the isoform-dependent binding efficacy of apoE to HDL particles.
Previous studies (48-50, 54) have demonstrated that various cells generate cholesterol-rich HDL-like particles with exogenous apolipoproteins. However, this is not the case with astrocytes, because we and other researchers have found that generation of HDL by endogenous apoE and by exogenous apoE is differently regulated in cultured astrocytes; HDL-like particles that are generated with exogenous apolipoproteins have low amounts of cholesterol (34, 37), whereas HDL-like particles generated with endogenous apoE are cholesterol-rich (37). In support of these findings, the present study has shown that apoE-lipid particles generated by the endogenously synthesized and released apoE are cholesterol-rich, compared with those generated by the addition of exogenous apoE (34). Because the amount of apoE that is free from lipid particles in the cultured medium and CSF is below detection limit (see Ref. 31 and this study) (Fig. 4, a and b), these results suggest that under physiological conditions, cholesterol-rich lipid particles associated with endogenous apoE are the major cholesterol source for neurons in the central nervous system. In this regard, it is of interest to note that apoE3-expressing astrocytes could supply more cholesterol in the form of apoE lipid particles to other cells including neurons with comparable levels of apoE secretion than apoE4-expressing astrocytes. Under the steady-state conditions, the lipid metabolisms in the central nervous system appear similar between the brains of apoE3 and apoE4 knock-in mice; the concentrations of free and esterified cholesterol in the postnuclear supernatant, plasma membrane, and endoplasmic reticulum of the brain homogenate are similar (64). However, under different conditions such as during recovery phases after brain injury and cell damage, endogenous apoE-mediated generation of HDL-like particles could play a critical role in cholesterol delivery to neurons, which are an essential material for axonal regeneration and synapse formation (65-68). Actually, previous studies (69, 70) have demonstrated that traumatic brain injury is the most robust environmental risk factor for development of AD. These lines of evidence may allow us to postulate that the apoE isoform dependence of the development of AD may be explained by the apoE isoform-dependent ability in the cholesterol supply to neurons after injury and cell damage, leading to neuroregeneration.
