0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Amyloid- peptides (A) are widely presumed to play a causal role in Alzheimer disease. Release of A from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) requires proteolysis by the -site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1). Although increased BACE1 activity in Alzheimer disease brains and human (h) BACE1 transgenic (tg) mice results in altered APP cleavage, the contribution of these molecular alterations to neurodegeneration is unclear. We therefore used the murine Thy1 promoter to express high levels of hBACE1, with or without hAPP, in neurons of tg mice. Compared with hAPP mice, hBACE1/hAPP doubly tg mice had increased levels of APP C-terminal fragments (C89, C83) and decreased levels of full-length APP and A. In contrast to non-tg controls and hAPP mice, hBACE1 mice and hBACE1/hAPP mice showed degeneration of neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus and degradation of myelin. Neurological deficits were also more severe in hBACE1 and hBACE1/hAPP mice than in hAPP mice. These results demonstrate that high levels of BACE1 activity are sufficient to elicit neurodegeneration and neurological decline in vivo. This pathogenic pathway involves the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments but does not depend on increased production of human A. Thus, inhibiting BACE1 may block not only A-dependent but also A-independent pathogenic mechanisms..

In an alternative pathway, -secretase generates a shorter secreted N-terminal fragment and APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) C89 and C99, which remain membrane-bound. The latter fragments are then further cleaved by -secretase, resulting in the production of A peptides. The -site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) accounts for most of the -secretase activity in the brain (1, 5 to 7, 9). BACE1 is a typical aspartic protease; cleavage of the prodomain to generate the mature enzyme occurs at the C-terminal site resulting in the generation of a mature protein starting at Glu-46 (12)..

0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	9	Recent evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of AD involves alterations in the activity of BACE1. A polymorphism in the BACE1 gene has been reported to influence AD risk (13). Compared with nondemented controls, BACE1 immunoreactivity was increased around amyloid plaques in AD brains; levels of BACE1 were elevated in AD brain homogenates (14 to 17) and correlated with the levels of APP CTFs and with A1 to x and A1 to 42 (18). The potential pathogenic role of increased BACE activity has been investigated in vivo by analyzing the metabolism of APP in human (h) BACE transgenic (tg) mice (19 to 22). These studies have shown that expression of hBACE1 at moderate levels in hAPP tg models results in increased generation of hAPP CTFs and A, which in some cases was associated with enhanced amyloid deposition. These studies have confirmed the importance of hBACE1 in APP processing in vivo. However, the relationship between high levels of hBACE1 activity, APP processing, and neurodegeneration remains to be established. To address this issue, we used the strong Thy1 promoter to express hBACE1 in neurons of tg mice, either alone or in combination with hAPP. High levels of BACE1 activity significantly increased the cerebral accumulation of hAPP CTFs, but not of A, and caused prominent age-related neurodegeneration and neurological decline..

This cDNA includes a Kozak consensus sequence (GCC ACC ATG) at the 5'-end to enhance expression. The hBACE1 cDNA was inserted between exons 2 and 4 into the mThy1 expression cassette (kindly provided by Dr. H. van der Putten, Ciba-Geigy, Basel, Switzerland), purified, and microinjected into one-cell embryos (C57BL/6 x DBA/2 F1). Transgenic founder mice were identified by PCR analysis of genomic DNA extracted from tail biopsies. Doubly tg mice were generated by crossing heterozygous hBACE1 mice from lines 1 or 39 with the hAPP tg line 41 we described previously (23). hAPP line 41 expresses mutant hAPP751 under the direction of the mThy1 promoter and produces high levels of A1 to 42 resulting in plaque formation by 3 months of age. All tg lines were maintained by crossing heterozygous tg mice with non-tg C57BL/6 x DBA/2 F1 breeders. All tg mice analyzed in this study were heterozygous with respect to individual transgenes, and non-tg littermates were used as controls..

Reaction mixtures were diluted 1:5, incubated at 37  degrees C for 2 h, and the quenched reaction mixtures were then loaded onto 96-well plates coated with a polyclonal antibody raised to MBP. Cleaved products were detected using biotinylated Sw192 as specific reporter antibodies, and purified hBACE1 was used as a standard for both activity assays..

Compared with non-tg controls, high expresser hBACE1 tg mice had decreased levels of FL APP (Fig. 2A and B); this decrease was most marked in the two upper bands. In contrast, levels of APP CTFs were 2 to 3-fold higher in hBACE1 mice than in non-tg controls, as determined by Western blot analysis with the CT15 antibody, which recognizes the hBACE1-generated C89 and C99 fragments of APP (Fig. 2, A and C), as well as the -secretase-generated C83 fragment (32). Double labeling analysis confirmed that intraneuronal accumulation of APP CTFs was higher in hBACE1 mice than in non-tg controls (Fig. 2, D to I). Moreover, neurons displaying the highest levels of hBACE1 expression also showed the highest levels of APP CTF immunoreactivity (Fig. 2, G to I). To further characterize the effects of high levels of hBACE1 expression on hAPP processing, homogenates from hAPP singly tg mice expressing a familial AD-mutant hAPP (line 41 (23)) and hBACE1(line 1)/hAPP(line 41) doubly tg mice were analyzed by Western blot. Singly tg hAPP mice showed an increase in overall levels of cerebral APP expression compared with non-tg controls (Fig. 3, A to C). Compared with these mice, hBACE1/hAPP mice had lower levels of FL APP and higher levels of APP CTFs (Fig. 3, A to C). Immunoreactivities for hBACE1 and APP CTFs in hBACE1/hAPP mice were colocalized in the same neurons (Fig. 3, G to I), consistent with the notion that the increase in APP CTFs resulted from increased cleavage of hAPP by hBACE1..

This analysis revealed that the increase in APP CTFs in hBACE1/hAPP mice represents primarily an accumulation of C89, which results from APP cleavage at the ' site (Fig. 4A). Whereas -secretase cleavage of C99 would result in the production of A1 to x, -secretase cleavage of C89 would result in the production of A11 to x. Surprisingly, hBACE1/hAPP mice had decreased levels of both A1 to x and truncated A species. Hippocampal levels of A1 to x (Fig. 4B) and A1 to 42 (Fig. 4C) were much lower in hBACE1/hAPP mice than in hAPP singly tg mice. Because the ELISAs used to obtain these measurements specifically detect peptides containing the first five amino acids of A, we also analyzed A levels with antibody 266, which was raised against the middle portion of the A peptide (amino acids 13 to 28, TABLE ONE) (25). Extraction of hippocampal proteins with formic acid, followed by high resolution acid urea-PAGE and Western blot analysis with the 266 antibody, confirmed reductions in all detectable A species in hBACE1/hAPP mice compared with hAPP singly tg mice (Fig. 4D).

Immunoblot analysis with antibodies against neprilysin or IDE showed roughly comparable levels of these enzymes in hBACE1 mice, hAPP mice, hBACE1/hAPP mice, and non-tg controls (Fig. 4, G and H). In addition, levels of Notch, another -secretase substrate, were comparable among the four groups of mice (Fig. 4, G and H).

Immunoblot analysis with antibodies against neprilysin or IDE showed roughly comparable levels of these enzymes in hBACE1 mice, hAPP mice, hBACE1/hAPP mice, and non-tg controls (Fig. 4, G and H). In addition, levels of Notch, another -secretase substrate, were comparable among the four groups of mice (Fig. 4, G and H). These results suggest that the decrease in A levels in mice with high levels of hBACE1 activity does not result from increased degradation of A or decreased -secretase activity..

Consistent with this possibility, Western blot analysis with an antibody against APP-p-threonine 668 revealed that the cerebral levels of FL APP-p and C99-p were lower in hBACE1/hAPP mice than in hAPP mice (Fig. 4, I and J). These results support the notion that high levels of hBACE1 activity increase hAPP cleavage in the early secretory pathway, depleting mature hAPP-p before it is transported to the axon terminals, where a large proportion of A generation by the -secretase complex takes place (19)..

Compared with non-tg controls (Fig. 6D), pyramidal neurons in layers 2 to 3 of the neocortex were also shrunken and condensed in all three hBACE1 tg lines (Fig. 6, E and F). In contrast to the normal labeling of neurites with antibodies against neurofilament (Fig. 6G) and MAP2 (Fig. 6J) in non-tg controls, axonal and dendritic processes of pyramidal neurons in hBACE1 mice were diminished, disrupted, and vacuolized (Fig. 6, H and K).

At 12 months of age, the neurodegenerative alterations in hBACE1 tg mice were associated with a reactive astrocytosis (Fig. 6N) not observed in non-tg controls (Fig. 6, M and O). In contrast to non-tg littermate controls (Fig. 6P), hBACE1 mice from line 1 showed collapsed neuronal cytoplasm, accumulations of electrodense material, extensive vacuolization of dendritic arbors (Fig. 6Q), and wide-spread degeneration of axonal processes with splinting and disorganization of myelin laminations (Fig. 6R). Significant loss and alterations of neuritic structures were also detected in hAPP singly tg mice, but only hBACE1 mice and hBACE1/hAPP mice had considerable damage also in the CA3 region of the hippocampus (Fig. 7).

Although BACE1 is required for the generation of A, high levels of neuronal hBACE1 activity decreased rather than increased A levels in hBACE1/hAPP mice compared with hAPP singly tg mice, suggesting that A was not the main mediator of the increased neuronal deficits identified in the doubly tg mice. Because APP-deficient mice (33, 34) do not show the neurological and neuropathological alterations we observed in several lines of hBACE1 tg mice, it is also unlikely that the decrease in FL or -secretase-processed APP accounts for the neuronal deficits seen in hBACE1 tg mice.

Moreover, the levels of APP CTFs in different lines of hBACE1 mice were related to the extent of neurological and neuropathological alterations: the highest levels of APP CTFs were found in the most severely impaired line 1. Although previous studies (19 to 21, 40, 41) have shown an increase in C99 and C89 and a decrease in C83, in the present study we found that the most significant increase was in levels of C89, whereas C83 levels were decreased. This suggests that in our model APP processing may occur preferentially at the ' cleavage site (15, 35). Interestingly, despite an overall increase in C99 and C89 in previous studies, levels of C99-p were decreased significantly in hBACE1/hAPP mice, and this decrease in C-99 phosphorylation was more apparent in mice expressing higher levels of hBACE1 (19). Compared with hAPP tg mice, our hBACE1/hAPP mice showed lower levels of C99, and C99-p was decreased with hBACE1 overexpression. Because phosphorylation of APP is a post-translational modification necessary for maturation and axonal transport of C99 (42, 43), the decrease in C99-p indicates that APP cleavage in the hBACE1/hAPP mice might occur in early compartments (19)..

It will therefore be interesting to test whether preventing the generation of C31 prevents neurodegeneration in hBACE1/hAPP mice. In a similar vein, expression of hBACE1 in mAPP-deficient mice might reveal APP-independent mechanisms of hBACE1-induced neurotoxicity. Conceivably, increased BACE1 activity might trigger neurodegeneration by cleavage of substrates other than APP. For example, both in vitro (12) and in vivo (46) BACE1 cleaves ST6Gal I, a sialyltransferase whose cleavage product is secreted. Recently, it has been shown that BACE1 also cleaves -subunits of voltage-gated sodium channels (47).

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Alzheimer's disease is devastating in terms of suffering of affected individuals, stress on carers and cost to society. Medication can effect symptomatic improvement (Burns et al, 1999) and psychological support can reduce strain in carers (Mittelman et al, 1996; Donaldson et al, 1997). Cognitive-behavioural therapy for carers can reduce carer stress and burden, and behavioural disturbance in affected individuals (Marriott et al, 2000). However, no studies have investigated psychotherapeutic intervention directed at those with Alzheimer's disease. In the early stages of disease, psychotherapeutic interventions may be beneficial as insight is often preserved and psychological adjustment is difficult for those who may assume they face a future of inevitable decline. Denial, as a defence mechanism, is common for those affected and their relatives (Bahro et al, 1997). Individual psychodynamic therapy has been described (Bahro et al, 1997) but there is no systematic research (Cheston, 1998). Some related  emotion-oriented  therapies, including validation and reminiscence, have been promising (Woods, 2002). A Cochrane review of non-drug therapies found a benefit only for reality orientation (Koger et al, 1999; Neal  and  Briggs, 2000; Spector et al, 2004)..

The principal aim of the therapy (in its brief format) is the identification of interpersonal conflicts or difficulties, which are causing or helping to maintain emotional distress. Client and therapist work together to find and test solutions to these problems, and both intrapsychic and practical changes are encouraged..

The main adaptations included delivery in the individual's home and involving the carer in the treatment. Four specific psychological areas were targeted. Autobiographical narrative was used to strengthen self-worth. Important past conflicts, which resonated with current difficulties, were explored and resolved. The illness itself was discussed and emphasis placed on improving social and interpersonal relationships including, but not emphasising, the role of the partner. In addition to the individual therapy, the therapist spent 10 min each session with the carer, listening to the carer's needs and informing the carer of therapeutic progress..

Traditional therapies have tended to be pharmacological in nature, targeting either cognitive or non-cognitive symptoms (Tariot, 1999). Non-pharmacological interventions, aside from some behavioural techniques (Allen-Burge et al, 1999), have concentrated on carers, and psychological approaches are of proven benefit in reducing carer strain (Marriott et al, 2000). As far as we are aware, this is the first randomised controlled trial of a psychotherapeutic intervention in people with Alzheimer's disease using standardised outcome measures. The psychotherapeutic approach was determined following a pilot study and adapted to the individual needs of the participants, as the model dictates. The joint sessions with the participants and carers merely helped the therapist to focus on those symptoms that were considered important and distressing..

Only six sessions were provided which, in psychotherapeutic terms, is a low-dose treatment, and this may partly explain the lack of effect. In addition, a longer study would be needed to assess the more likely benefits in terms of stabilisation of disease. The beneficial effect on carers is indicated by the scores on the Ways of Coping Checklist, which showed that the therapy helped carers by providing someone to talk to and, for those caring for people with mild dementia, diminished the carers' sense of self-blame. There was minimal involvement of the carers in the therapy. A beneficial effect on patients themselves can be inferred from the improvement in the global rating of well-being..

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	5	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Plasma amyloid ss protein (Ass42) levels and late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) have been linked to the same region on chromosome 10q. The PLAU gene within this region encodes urokinase-type plasminogen activator, which converts plasminogen to plasmin. Ass aggregates induce PLAU expression thereby increasing plasmin, which degrades both aggregated and non-aggregated forms of Ass. We evaluated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PLAU for association with Ass42 and LOAD. PLAU SNP compound genotypes composed of haplotype pairs showed significant association with AD in three independent case to control series. PLAU SNP haplotypes associated significantly with plasma Ass42 in 10 extended LOAD families. One of the SNPs analyzed was a missense C/T polymorphism in exon 6 of PLAU (PLAU_1=rs2227564), which causes a proline to leucine change (P141L). We analyzed PLAU_1 for association with AD in six case to control series and 24 extended LOAD families. The CT and TT PLAU_1 genotypes showed association (P=0.05) with an overall estimated odds ratio of 1.2 (1.0 to 1.5). The CT and TT genotypes of PLAU_1 were also associated with significant age-dependent elevation of plasma Ass42 in 24 extended LOAD families (P=0.0006). In knockout mice lacking the PLAU gene, plasma but not brain Ass42 as well as Ass40 was significantly elevated, also in an age-dependent manner. The PLAU_1 associations were independent of the associations we found among plasma Ass42, LOAD and variants in the IDE or VR22 region. These results provide strong evidence that PLAU or a nearby gene is involved in the development of LOAD. PLAU_1 is a plausible pathogenic mutation that could act by increasing Ass42, but additional biological experiments are required to show this definitively..

Together these two independent studies provide strong evidence for a novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk gene at this locus that acts on Ass42. The urokinase-type plasminogen activator gene (PLAU) is located on chromosome 10q21 to 22 at 95 cM within the 1 to LOD support interval of the linkage peak at 81 cM. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator is a serine protease that converts plasminogen to plasmin (3). PLAU expression is induced by Ass aggregates, and plasmin degrades both aggregated and non-aggregated Ass in vitro in a possible negative feedback loop. Thus, PLAU could have an important role in controlling Ass aggregation, which is widely believed to play an important role in AD pathogenesis. Ass is the major proteinaceous component of senile plaques, one of the main pathologic hallmarks of AD (4). Ass composed of 42(43) amino acids (Ass42) is present in all senile plaques, and Ass40 is also found in most cases (5). Ass42 was shown to be elevated in serum, brain and cell culture studies performed in patients and animal models of familial AD due to known autosomal dominant mutations (6 to 12). Some of these studies have also shown elevations in Ass40, though not as consistently and to the same degree as Ass42. Thus, it is postulated that although both Ass42 and Ass40 associate with one of the pathogenic hallmarks of AD, owing to its consistent and more prominent presence along with the biochemical properties of greater fibrillogenicity and aggregation potential, Ass42 is a more pathogenic biomarker of AD..

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	9	Given its genomic location and potential functional relevance to AD, we tested PLAU as a candidate gene for LOAD. PLAU is a relatively small, 5970 bp gene found on the NT_008583 chromosome 10 contig and also defined by the AF377330 sequence (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). We genotyped a total of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the whole length of this gene from the 72nd to the 5885th bp. We found evidence for significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) among these variants, allowing for complex genotype analysis. In this article, we initially depict the results of the association analyses between plasma Ass42 and PLAU haplotypes in 10 LOAD families and between AD and PLAU compound genotypes forming the  haplotype pairs  in three case to control series. After establishing significant association between PLAU variants and two AD phenotypes, plasma Ass42 levels and AD-affected status, we focus on a single missense mutation in a larger data set of 24 LOAD families and six case to control series..

The minor T variant of PLAU_1 does not appear to affect PLAU activity, but Yoshimoto et al.

We find evidence of significant association with PLAU variants in both extended LOAD families and independent case to control series using both plasma Ass42 and LOAD-affected status as the phenotypes.

An additional SNP in exon 2 was identified using the public SNP databases. The seven PLAU SNPs, their locations and NCBI SNP names are summarized in Table 1. These SNPs, which spanned 5.8 kb in the PLAU gene, were analyzed in the 10 LOAD families used to link plasma Ass42 to chromosome 10 (1). In addition, they were genotyped in three independent case to control series collected at Mayo Clinic Rochester (MCR), Mayo Clinic Jacksonville (MCJ) and University of Kentucky (UKy). The SNP allele frequencies, deviations from Hardy to Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and allelic association results are summarized in Table 2. Given that the two exon 11 SNPs are in complete LD, the results for only one of these exon 11 SNPs are summarized in Table 2. In summary, the rare exon 2 SNP showed Hardy to Weinberg disequilibrium in the MCJ and MCR series in both the case and the control groups. Apart from this, there was only one instance where an SNP deviated significantly from the HWE in the control group (exon 6 SNP=PLAU_1 in MCJ controls)..

PLAU SNP frequencies   From the PLAU SNP genotypes of the family members, PLAU SNP haplotypes were identified using the haplotyping algorithm within the computer program Simwalk2 (17,18). Three major PLAU SNP haplotypes were identified, as were three minor haplotypes. Collectively, the six PLAU SNP haplotypes accounted for  > 95% of all of the haplotypes in these families. The frequency of each PLAU SNP haplotype in the 10 AD families is summarized in Table 1. Because there was profound LD (D' > 0.95 for all SNPs and d2 > 0.4 for all SNPs except exon 8 SNP), only five of the seven SNPs were required to construct all six haplotypes..

The profound LD between the SNPs can easily be appreciated in this table. Exon 11 deletion mutant was in complete LD with the other exon 11 SNP. Exon 2 SNP was too rare to yield meaningful results. Thus, these two SNPs were omitted from the LD analysis. LD was also estimated in the MCR, MCJ and UKy series within the cases and controls and yielded similar results. As each individual carries two haplotypes, we termed the genotype formed by these two haplotypes as  compound genotypes . As described subsequently, each compound genotype essentially unambiguously defines a haplotype pair due to profound LD between PLAU SNPs and limited haplotype diversity.

PLAU SNPs LD   Association of PLAU variants with plasma Ass42 levels in 10 LOAD families To test for association between plasma Ass42 and PLAU variants in family members, we used the variance components methodology implemented in the computer program SOLAR (20). Using the within-pedigree identity-by-state model of Hopper and Mathews (21), PLAU SNP haplotypes were initially analyzed in family members between the ages of 20 and 65 years because this was the age group in which plasma Ass42 was linked to the chromosome 10 locus (1). In this age group, there was no significant association between PLAU variants and plasma Ass42 levels (Table 4). Inspection of our data suggested that there might be an association between PLAU SNP haplotypes and plasma Ass42 in older family members, so we performed a second analysis using family members of all ages. Remarkably, this group showed significant association between PLAU SNP haplotypes and plasma Ass42 (P=0.02), with PLAU association accounting for an estimated 12% of the total variance in Ass42..

Association of PLAU SNP haplotypes with plasma Ass42 in 10 LOAD families   Association of PLAU variants with AD in three case to control series Our working hypothesis is that any gene with variants influencing Ass42 is likely to have variants influencing risk for AD. To determine whether PLAU has variants that are associated with AD in case to control series, we analyzed the PLAU SNPs in three independent series obtained at MCR, MCJ and UKy. All three series were entirely composed of Caucasian subjects, and in every AD patient the age of onset was 59 years. Using the computer program GOLD (22) to analyze the PLAU SNPs, we determined that there is profound LD among the five PLAU SNPs in the case to control series similar to the LOAD family founders (data not shown)..
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	21	An important consequence of the profound LD among the five PLAU SNPs that we analyzed was that there were relatively few common genotypes such that 96 to 100% of the subjects were accounted for by only 12 compound genotypes (Table 5). In Table 5, the two haplotypes producing six of the 12 compound genotypes (A, D, F, I, J and K) were unambiguous, because no more than one SNP was heterozygous. Each of the remaining six genotypes is produced by one and only one pair of the six haplotypes identified in the LOAD families (Table 1). The only other pairs that could produce these categories would include at least one haplotype that is so rare it was never identified unambiguously in the case to control series or by Simwalk2 haplotype analysis of the LOAD families. As these combinations will be rare, the PLAU SNP haplotypes in 96 to 100% of the subjects in our LOAD case to control series were easily identified and essentially unambiguous (Table 5)..

In each of the three series examined, these genotypes showed significant association with AD (MCR, P=0.001; MCJ, P=0.03 and UKy, P=0.03). Some compound genotypes tended to have the same trends in two or more series analyzed (e.g. 2/2, 1/4 and 3/5), suggesting the presence of functional variants on the backbones of these genotypes..

Plasma Ass42, which is elevated in young subjects, first decreases and then increases again with age  > 50. This is shown in Figure 1, where plasma Ass42 stratified by PLAU_1 genotype is plotted as a function of age. Non-linear analysis, in which we analyzed age, age(2) and PLAU_1 genotype (CC, CT, TT or CT+TT) and the interactions among age, age(2) and PLAU_1 genotype in the variance components framework, showed a significant age-dependent association between plasma Ass42 and PLAU_1 CT and TT genotypes (CTxage, TTxage(2), CT+TTxage(2) and age(2) were all significant at P < 0.05) (Table 6). As our main concern was to determine whether there is a significant age-dependent elevation of plasma Ass42 in elderly subjects associated with the CT, TT or pooled CT+TT genotypes, we performed a second analysis in which family members  > 50 years (Fig. 2) were analyzed using linear regression in the variance components framework. This analysis showed that the CTxage and TTxage covariates had significant effects (P=0.003 and P=0.007, respectively) in the 24 LOAD families (Table 7). When the CT and TT variables were tested as a single CT+TT variable, the CT+TTxage covariate was even more significant (P=0.0006). It is noteworthy that even when we correct for the fact that three age groups were tested prior to the analysis of the 50 age group summarized in Table 7, using the most conservative approach of Bonferroni correction, there is still highly significant age-related PLAU genotype effect in these families (overall corrected P-values are 0.000024 for Model 1 and 0.00006 for Model 2)..

To test this, we analyzed plasma Ass42 in 11 PLAU KO mice (16) and 14 control mice with the same genetic background. For comparison, KO mice lacking a functional neprilysin gene, which is known to be involved in Ass degradation (24), were analyzed in parallel. When compared with controls, 3 to 6-month-old PLAU KO mice showed a highly significant increase in plasma Ass42 (P=0.006 by Mann to Whitney test) (Fig. 4A). Plasma Ass40 also increased (P=0.003) in the PLAU KO mice (Fig. 4B). By 11 months, plasma Ass42 and Ass40 increased and the difference between KO and control mice appeared to increase in the small number of mice analyzed (two PLAU KO versus six controls). Thus, the PLAU gene influences plasma Ass42 and our data suggest that this effect may become more pronounced with aging, consistent with our genetic analyses in LOAD families. Remarkably, brain Ass42 (Fig. 5A) and Ass40 (Fig. 5B) showed no detectable increase in PLAU KO mice when compared with control mice. The implications of this result are presented in the Discussion..

PLAU is both a good functional and a good positional candidate gene that converts plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn degrades Ass. We genotyped seven SNPs within this relatively small gene spanning almost its entire length. We found that these SNPs were in profound LD with each other leading to limited haplotype diversity in the region analyzed, a finding consistent with previous work (25 to 27). The limited haplotype diversity allowed us to perform association analysis using the compound genotypes that make up the haplotype pair for each subject. The advantage of this approach is that it does not require phase information as each compound genotype forms a group per se. Nonetheless, given the small number of compound genotypes observed in all series, one can identify the underlying haplotype pair for  > 95% of all subjects essentially unambiguously. The other advantage of the compound genotype approach is that it allows for the analysis of the  haplotype pair  rather than individual haplotypes. Thus, variants that are effective in an additive fashion, but not when encountered alone, will be easier to identify using this approach. We determined significant association between the PLAU compound genotypes with AD in three independent case to control series..

In the extended families, this SNP was associated with an age-related elevation in plasma Ass levels in individuals  > 50 years of age. Plasma Ass displays a complex characteristic in that it appears to decline in an age-related fashion until 50 years of age and increase thereafter. This characteristic is much more pronounced in subjects who have the CT or TT genotype for PLAU_1. It is also noteworthy that the significance of association with PLAU haplotypes is enhanced when the  > 50 age group is analyzed separately in the 10 families, as expected (Table 4). The finding of age-related increase in Ass is also evident in the plasma Ass of PLAU KO mice, consistent with the finding in humans. These mice have significantly higher plasma Ass levels when compared with wild-type littermates; however, their brain Ass levels did not show significant difference. This finding could have several explanations. This may suggest that PLAU variants influence AD through an effect on plasma but not brain Ass42. While this is conceivable, it is more likely that PLAU influences both plasma and brain Ass in a way that is not evident in KO mice. Thus, PLAU may have a greater influence on secreted than on cell-associated Ass. As most brain Ass is cell-associated (28), effects on secreted Ass that are easily detected in plasma could be hard to detect in brain. Alternatively, compensatory changes triggered by PLAU KO may maintain brain Ass more effectively than plasma Ass..

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	46	We analyzed PLAU_1 in six case to control series using meta-analysis. Lohmueller et al. (29) reported their meta-analyses of published genetic associations with various disease phenotypes. Of the 25 reported associations that they investigated by meta-analysis, eight showed significant association that replicated the original study, with most ORs in the 1.1 to 2.0 range. On the basis of these findings, the authors recommended that large, collaborative genetic association studies should be encouraged, that all sound studies, positive or negative, should be published and that reports of association should include a meta-analysis of all available data. Our meta-analyses of the PLAU_1 SNP in six case to control series indicate that the PLAU_1 CT+TT is associated with a modest (OR=1.21), but marginally significant (P=0.051 to 0.056) increase in risk for AD. This result is similar to that of Lohmueller et al. (29), whose meta-analyses identified many other common genetic variants with modest, but significant effects on other disease phenotypes. Two other groups had previously published their findings on this SNP (15,30). Finckh et al. (15) found significant association in three case to control series from Germany, Switzerland and Italy, whereas Myers et al. (30) did not find evidence of association with any of the PLAU SNPs they analyzed including PLAU_1. Interestingly, the former found that in their series, it is the CC genotype that is associated with increased risk for LOAD, whereas in our series, it is the CT and TT genotypes. Furthermore, another group from Germany also found significant association with the CT and TT genotypes (M. Riemenschneider, personal communication). Thus, there clearly is heterogeneity among all these findings, with one group having significant results in the same direction as our series (M. Riemenschneider), another finding significance with the common genotype (15) and a third group not finding any significance. Clearly, all results need to be analyzed in one meta-analysis subsequent to their publication. Nonetheless, as demonstrated by Lohmueller et al. (29), such discrepancies are frequent among studies of common genetic variants in complex diseases, particularly when the effect size is modest. There are many reasons for such discrepancies including small sample size, gene to gene and gene to environment interactions not modelled in studies, intra-sample heterogeneity/population substructure and analysis of the  marker  variant instead of the  disease  variant with varying degrees of LD. While we tried to minimize these factors by gathering large series, age matching the Mayo Clinic series and choosing a variant that is likely to be functional itself, it is still plausible that some of these problems may be contributing to inter-series variations observed for PLAU_1..
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	47	Indeed, the association for PLAU_1 is marginally significant with the confidence interval of 1.0 to 1.47 in the six series analyzed. Nonetheless, this statistical result should be considered in the presence of evidence from the family and animal data on the effect of PLAU in Ass; and with the understanding that there likely exist other variants in PLAU that affect the risk of AD, as suggested by the  compound genotype  data in the case to control series. Furthermore, given the likely presence of important variants in other genes, such as VR22 and IDE, the finding of highly significant P-values for variants of modest effect in complex diseases may need to await the identification of most, if not all, functional mutations in multiple genes and their analyses in multiple large series..

Of all of the variants, only those in VR22 account for the linkage on chromosome 10. PLAU variants are different from the other two in their age-related effects that manifest themselves more strongly after age 50. Thus, each of these genes appears to act independently of one another via apparent separate mechanisms. While the unequivocal effects of these genes in the pathogenesis of AD await the identification of all of the functional variants and testing them in large series, these findings provide evidence for the existence of LOAD risk variants that affect Ass, within and/or in the vicinity of these genes..

This program determines various pairwise statistical parameters for LD, such as Lewontin's standardized disequilibrium coefficient (19) D' and d2. LD was detected from the founders and married-ins using the expectation to maximization algorithm of Slatkin and Excoffier (37). We also detected LD within the ADs and controls from MCR, MCJ and UKy series using the same program..

This is a matrix whose ijth element is equal to 1 if individuals i and j share a specified environment, and 0 otherwise. Our family collection is largely composed of extended pedigrees, where we have measured the plasma Ass of most members from each family in a single batch of ELISAs. To rigorously account for any possible assay batch to batch variations that may affect the variance in plasma Ass, we included a household matrix in the models. As almost all individuals from each family were measured in one batch, the household matrix included an element equal to 1 for those individuals from the same extended family, and 0 otherwise. We realize that by doing so, we may be overly conservative. Our collection is largely weighted towards families with high-Ass segregating within the family. Given that the shared-family effect (household) overlaps with kinship, we may have over corrected and underestimated the shared-genetic effect by including the household term in the model.

The significance and coefficients for all covariates were tested using the polygenic-screen-all option of SOLAR, which provides a p-value and coefficient by comparing a model that includes the covariate to a model that excludes it. This option causes all covariates to stay in the model regardless of their significance. In Model 1, the covariates tested were CT and TT genotypes, age, CT genotypexage and TT genotypexage.

DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and... ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Alzheimer's disease is associated with characteristic neuropathology that includes the deposition of extracellular beta-amyloid (Ass) in neuritic plaques and intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles. Adults with Down's syndrome have high levels of Ass deposition by age 40 years and early onset of dementia. However, the average age at onset of clinical dementia is 55 years, and varies widely. The neuropathological manifestations of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome have been attributed to triplication and over-expression of the gene for beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), located on chromosome 21, but the factors influencing age at onset of dementia are unresolved. Factors which influence formation and deposition of Ass are reviewed, including atypical karyotypes, susceptibility genotypes, gender and oestrogen deficiency, and individual differences in Ass peptide levels. Factors which modify the rate and degree of Ass deposition, rather than over-expression of APP, may be important determinants of risk for dementia in Down's syndrome..

DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and... ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Although there has been controversy about the relative importance of plaques versus tangles in the development of Alzheimer's disease, there is increasing evidence that altered metabolism of Ass peptides and amyloid deposition in neuritic plaques causes Alzheimer's disease by triggering a complex pathological cascade that produces dementia. The Ass peptides Ass1-40 and Ass1-42, the two major species of Ass, are generated from APP by sequential proteolytic cleavage by ss- and - secretases. These enzymes are not the only ones involved in the breakdown of APP: -secretase cleaves the full-length APP, producing soluble sAPP and, subsequently, p3. Because processing by -secretase precludes production of full-length Ass peptides, it is anti-amyloidogenic (Younkin, 1998)..
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	14	Several lines of evidence suggest that deposition of Ass-42 is an important initial step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Ass1-42 aggregates more rapidly and is deposited earlier in Alzheimer's disease plaques than Ass1-40 (Iwatsubo et al, 1994). Mutations in the gene for APP and in presenilin (PS1/2) genes are associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease and with a selective increase in Ass1-42 (Borchelt et al, 1996; Mann et al, 1996; Scheuner et al, 1996; Kosaka et al, 1997; Younkin, 1998). Brain levels of Ass1-42 increase early in the development of Alzheimer's disease and are strongly correlated with cognitive decline (Cummings  and  Cotman, 1995; Naslund et al, 2000), and plasma levels of Ass1-42 are higher in elderly people who subsequently develop Alzheimer's disease than in those who remain free of dementia (Mayeux et al, 1999)..

Brain levels of Ass1-42 increase early in the development of Alzheimer's disease and are strongly correlated with cognitive decline (Cummings  and  Cotman, 1995; Naslund et al, 2000), and plasma levels of Ass1-42 are higher in elderly people who subsequently develop Alzheimer's disease than in those who remain free of dementia (Mayeux et al, 1999)..

Despite the nearly universal occurrence of Alzheimer's disease pathology by middle age, there is wide variation in age at onset of dementia. The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease at age 65 has ranged between 30% and 75% (Zigman et al, 1997). Most studies have shown that the average age at onset of dementia is between 50 and 55 years, with a range from 38 to 70 years (Lai  and  Williams, 1989; Prasher  and  Krishnan, 1993). Methodological problems may account for some of the variation in estimated prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome. Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in this population requires both documentation of clinically significant decline in cognitive and adaptive competence from previously attained levels of performance and documentation of the absence of any other condition that might cause declines in performance (Aylward et al, 1997). Both these requirements are particularly difficult to address for adults with Down's syndrome, given their lifelong intellectual disability. The wide range of premorbid levels of performance associated with differences in level of intellectual disability requires specific criteria for clinically significant decline indicative of dementia for each level of function, and these are just beginning to be developed. There is, as yet, no consensus on a set of cognitive assessment tasks or on diagnostic criteria for existing cognitive assessment batteries that can differentiate adults with Down's syndrome who do and do not have dementia in its early stages. Presently, most diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome are made clinically, at relatively late stages of the disease, without systematic cognitive or functional testing over time..

Recent neuropathological studies have shown that diffuse plaques, the most prevalent Alzheimer-type lesion seen in individuals with Down's syndrome before age 50, are not associated with dementia. Diffuse plaques contain non-fibrillar amyloid, appear at younger ages than do neuritic plaques, are not associated with neuronal degeneration, and do not appear to affect the structure and function of neurons. In contrast, increases in the numbers of neuritic plaques, containing substantial amounts of fibrillised Ass peptides, are observed in adults with Down's syndrome predominantly after 50 years of age and are associated with neuronal degeneration and loss of function (Wisniewski, T. et al, 1995). Examination of the age-specific prevalence of dementia in Down's syndrome supports the hypothesis that the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome are closely associated with the development of these fibrillised plaques (Lai  and  Williams, 1989; Visser et al, 1997; Holland et al, 1998; Lai et al, 1999) (see Fig. 1). Although prevalence studies have employed varying sampling and diagnostic methods, there is remarkable agreement across studies that risk of Alzheimer's disease increases primarily after 50 years of age. In addition, not all adults with Down's syndrome will develop dementia even if they reach ages when the presence of high densities of neuritic plaques can be presumed. Thus, while triplication of the gene for APP may serve to increase diffuse plaques in adults with Down's syndrome, factors distinct from APP triplication must account for individual differences in susceptibility to the formation of fibrillised plaques and for the wide range in age at onset of dementia. A central task of the epidemiology of dementia in Down's syndrome is to identify factors that may influence risk of Alzheimer's disease by accelerating formation of Ass. Several avenues of investigation are suggested by existing findings and I will review the role of (a) atypical karyotypes; (b) genetic susceptibility factors; (c) gender and oestrogen deficiency; and (d) individual differences in Ass peptide levels..

DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and... ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   There is evidence from case studies of adults with Down's syndrome that atypical karyotypes, including translocations, partial trisomies and varying degrees of mosaicism, are associated with improved survival and decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Prasher et al (1998) presented an interesting case of a 78-year-old woman with partial trisomy 21 [46,XX,rec(21)dup q, inv(21)(p12q22.1)] and conducted a comprehensive analysis of the clinical and molecular genetic correlates of the partial trisomy. While her general appearance was suggestive, but not typical, of the Down's syndrome phenotype, she experienced several of the common age-related medical conditions characteristic of Down's syndrome, including hypothyroidism, cataracts, hypotonia and hearing impairment. Analysis of gene sequences on chromosome 21 using fluorescent in situ hybridisation showed that the partial trisomy excluded the region containing the gene for APP, which was present in only two copies. There was no evidence of decline in cognitive or adaptive competence for the 5 years preceding her death from pneumonia, and no evidence of Alzheimer's disease found on magnetic resonance imaging or neuropathological assessment. Similarly there are two reports of women with Down's syndrome with 25% and 86% disomy for chromosome 21, respectively (Chicoine  and  McGuire, 1997; W. B. Zigman, personal communication, 2000). Both women had a characteristic Down's syndrome phenotype and typical age-related medical conditions, including hypothyroidism and cataracts. The woman with 25% disomy for chromosome 21 died at age 83 following hospitalisation for a hip fracture and was free of dementia at her death, while the woman with 86% disomy is still living at age 74 and shows no evidence of dementia based on evaluations of cognitive and adaptive behaviour..

DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and... ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Four genes that increase risk of Alzheimer's disease have been identified. Mutations in three genes, APP, presenilin-1 (PS1) and presenilin-2 (PS2), are associated with early-onset familial forms of Alzheimer's disease that are transmitted as an autosomal dominant (Goate et al, 1991; Levy-Lehad et al, 1995; Sherrington et al, 1995). Homozygosity for a common variant of PS1, the 1-allele, has been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in some, but not at all, studies (Higuchi et al, 1996; Kehoe et al, 1996; Scott et al, 1996; Wragg et al, 1996). Only one study has examined the influence of PS1 alleles on risk of dementia in Down's syndrome. In that study of adults with Down's syndrome, there were no significant differences in allele frequencies between individuals with dementia and age-matched individuals without dementia (Tyrrell et al, 1999)..

There are three common variants of the gene for APOE, encoded for by three alleles, 2, 3 and 4. In numerous cross-sectional and case control studies, patients with Alzheimer's disease have been found to be significantly more likely than their peers to have one or more copies of the APOE 4 allele (Corder et al, 1993; Mayeux et al, 1993; Saunders et al, 1993). The APOE 4 protein may act by increasing the rate of the process which leads to Alzheimer's disease, predisposing to greater accumulation of Ass in those with and without Alzheimer's disease (Roses et al, 1994; Hyman et al, 1995; Polvikoski et al, 1995). The presence of the least common allele, APOE 2, has been associated with a delay in disease onset or even protection by most investigators (Corder et al, 1994; Roses et al, 1994)..

All studies have consistently found that the presence of the APOE 2 allele increases longevity and reduces the risk of dementia but the role of the 4 allele has been controversial (Hardy et al, 1994; Royston et al, 1994; Martins et al, 1995; van Gool et al, 1995; Cosgrave et al, 1996; Lambert et al, 1996; Schupf et al, 1996; Prasher et al, 1997; Schupf et al, 1998; Sekijima et al, 1998; Tyrrell et al, 1998; Lai et al, 1999; Rubinszstein et al, 1999; Deb et al, 2000). Small sample sizes and, importantly, failure to consider differences in the age at onset of dementia among those with and without an 4 allele may account for some of the negative findings. Since the effect of the 4 allele is not expressed until midlife, inclusion of sufficient numbers of adults over 50 years of age and analysis using survival methods that can adjust for age and years of follow-up are important methodological considerations. Our group used survival methods for analysis and found that the presence of the 4 allele was associated with earlier onset of dementia and greater decline in adaptive behaviour (Schupf et al, 1996). Compared with those with the APOE 3/3 genotype, adults with Down's syndrome with an 4 allele were five times as likely to develop dementia by age 65, while no one with an 2 allele developed dementia (see Fig. 2). Among affected individuals, mean age at onset of dementia was 53.3 years for those with the 4 allele and 58.0 years for those with the 3/3 genotype. Four other studies found an increased frequency of the 4 allele in adults with Down's syndrome and dementia compared with those with Down's syndrome without dementia (Martins et al, 1995; Sekijima et al, 1998; Rubinsztein et al, 1999; Deb et al, 2000)..

One large study examined 100 adults with Down's syndrome (40-70 years of age) and used survival analyses to examine age at onset of dementia by APOE genotype (Lai et al, 1999).

Cumulative incidence to age 55 was 0.71 among those with an 4 allele and 0.40 among those with the APOE 3/3 genotype.

Before menopause, oestrogen promotes the growth and prolongs survival of cholinergic neurons in brain regions serving cognitive function (Toran-Allerand et al, 1992), increases cholinergic activity, has antioxidant properties and regulates the metabolism of the APP to protect against the formation of Ass (Jaffe et al, 1994; Goodman et al, 1996; Petanceska et al, 2000)..

Few studies have presented results separately for men and women. Studies that have compared women with men have found conflicting results, with different studies showing earlier onset (Raghaven et al, 1994; Lai et al, 1999), later onset (Farrer et al, 1997; Schupf et al, 1998) or no difference in age at onset (Visser et al, 1997; Lai  and  Williams, 1989) by gender. Two studies employed survival methods to examine age at onset distributions by gender, adjusting for both age and level of learning disability, and found conflicting results. My colleagues and I found that men with Down's syndrome were three times as likely as women to develop Alzheimer's disease by age 65 (see Fig. 3a); the effect of gender was observed in all age groups over 50 years (Schupf et al, 1998). Both men and women with Down's syndrome show elevations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone at puberty indicative of primary gonadal dysfunction, which appear to progress with age and be more frequent in men than in women (Hasen et al, 1980; Campbell et al, 1982; Hsiang et al, 1987; Hestnes et al, 1991). Thus, older men may not benefit from the relative preservation of oestrogen proposed to account for lower risk of Alzheimer's disease in men in the general population. In contrast, another study found that women with Down's syndrome were approximately twice as likely to develop dementia as men (Lai et al, 1999) (see Fig. 3b). In that study, the effect of gender was seen primarily at younger ages. In both studies, gender differences were largest in those with the APOE 3/3 genotype, suggesting that the high risk associated with the presence of the APOE 4 allele can mask gender effects. The basis for the different results in studies of gender differences is not clear..

Studies that have compared women with men have found conflicting results, with different studies showing earlier onset (Raghaven et al, 1994; Lai et al, 1999), later onset (Farrer et al, 1997; Schupf et al, 1998) or no difference in age at onset (Visser et al, 1997; Lai  and  Williams, 1989) by gender. Two studies employed survival methods to examine age at onset distributions by gender, adjusting for both age and level of learning disability, and found conflicting results. My colleagues and I found that men with Down's syndrome were three times as likely as women to develop Alzheimer's disease by age 65 (see Fig. 3a); the effect of gender was observed in all age groups over 50 years (Schupf et al, 1998). Both men and women with Down's syndrome show elevations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone at puberty indicative of primary gonadal dysfunction, which appear to progress with age and be more frequent in men than in women (Hasen et al, 1980; Campbell et al, 1982; Hsiang et al, 1987; Hestnes et al, 1991). Thus, older men may not benefit from the relative preservation of oestrogen proposed to account for lower risk of Alzheimer's disease in men in the general population. In contrast, another study found that women with Down's syndrome were approximately twice as likely to develop dementia as men (Lai et al, 1999) (see Fig. 3b). In that study, the effect of gender was seen primarily at younger ages. In both studies, gender differences were largest in those with the APOE 3/3 genotype, suggesting that the high risk associated with the presence of the APOE 4 allele can mask gender effects. The basis for the different results in studies of gender differences is not clear..

Menstrual profiles and risk of dementia in 143 women with Down's syndrome were studied. Twelve women were postmenopausal and diagnosed with dementia. There was a significant relationship between age at menopause and age at onset of dementia in this subsample (r=0.57). Although the sample size is small, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that higher endogenous oestrogen levels can lower risk of dementia by decreasing Ass peptide levels and maintaining cholinergic function in critical neuronal populations. If the association between age at menopause and onset of dementia can be confirmed and supporting hormonal data provided, oestrogen replacement therapy might prove to be an important intervention to delay onset of dementia..

DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and... ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   In Down's syndrome, as in Alzheimer's disease, deposition of Ass1-42 precedes the appearance of Ass1-40 (Iwatsubo et al, 1995). Ass1-42 was the predominant species in the brains of young (age  < 50 years) individuals with Down's syndrome; Ass1-40 deposits were observed only a decade or more later. Compared with age-matched controls from the general population, plasma levels of both Ass1-42 and Ass1-40 are increased in adults with Down's syndrome (Tokuda et al, 1997; Mehta et al, 1998), but one study found that this increase was not related to dementia status (Tokuda et al, 1997). Our group studied plasma Ass1-42 and Ass1-40 levels in 108 adults with Down's syndrome with and without dementia and compared them with plasma levels in 64 adults without dementia from the general population (Schupf et al, 2001). Ass1-42 and Ass1-40 levels were significantly higher in the adults with Down's syndrome than in controls from the general population (P=0.0001), and highest in adults with dementia and Down's syndrome, mean plasma levels of Ass1-42, but not Ass1-40, were higher in individuals with the APOE 4 allele than in those without an 4 allele, regardless of dementia status (see Fig. 4). The effect of the APOE 4 allele on Ass1-42 levels may be related to acceleration of the rate of amyloid fibril formation (Ma et al, 1994) or diminished clearance of Ass (McNamara et al, 1998)..

DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and... ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Factors that influence the formation of Ass, such as the APOE 4 allele, oestrogen deficiency and high levels of Ass1-42 peptides, are associated with earlier onset of dementia in Down's syndrome, while factors that decrease the formation of Ass, such as the APOE 2 allele or atypical karyotypes that reduce APP gene dose, are associated with lower mortality and reduced risk of dementia. An important task for future work will be to identify the sources of individual variation in premorbid Ass levels. Since 95% of people with Down's syndrome have triplication of APP associated with free trisomy, overexpression of APP cannot account for the differences in age at onset of dementia within this population. Rather, the joint effects of a variety of factors, including those reviewed here and others not yet identified, must influence the development of Alzheimer's disease. This suggests that we will need to focus on younger adults with Down's syndrome to identify causes of individual differences in lifespan development and to determine when they begin to exert their effects..

Linkage to the same region was obtained independently in a study of affected LOAD sib-pairs. Together, these two studies provide strong evidence for a novel LOAD locus on chromosome 10 that acts to increase Ass42. VR22 is a large (1.7 Mb) gene located at 80 cM that encodes -T catenin, which is a binding partner of ss catenin. This makes VR22 an attractive candidate gene because ss catenin interacts with presenilin 1, which has many mutations that elevate Ass42 and cause early onset familial AD. We identified two intronic VR22 SNPs (4360 and 4783) in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) that showed highly significant association (P=0.0001 and 0.0006) with plasma Ass42 in 10 extended LOAD families. This association clearly contributed to the linkage at 80 cM because the lod scores decreased when linkage analysis was performed conditional upon the VR22 association. This association replicated in another independent set of 12 LOAD families (P=0.04 for 4783 and P=0.08 for 4360). Bounding of the association region using multiple SNPs showed VR22 to be the only confirmed gene within the region of association. These findings indicate that VR22 has variant(s) which influence Ass42 and contribute to the previously reported linkage for plasma Ass42 in LOAD families..

Twin studies have suggested that as much as 74% of the risk for LOAD may be due to genetic factors (2,3). It is well established that ApoE plays an important role in the genetics of LOAD (4,5). A recent study has estimated, however, that four additional loci make a contribution to the variance in LOAD age at onset that have an effect size similar to or greater than that of ApoE (6). Given the heterogeneity that is likely if at least five loci contribute substantially to the genetics of LOAD, it is not surprising that the large number of single gene association studies that have been performed have so far failed to identify variants that associate reproducibly with LOAD. Other reasons for failure of replication are possible gene to gene, gene to environment interactions that can be difficult to account for and poor study design..

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	9	In our studies, we have focused on levels of the amyloid ss protein (Ass), specifically Ass42, as a quantitative intermediate phenotype for LOAD. Ass is a secreted protein (10 to 12) derived from a set of large precursor proteins collectively referred to as the amyloid ss protein precursor. Secreted Ass, which is produced by virtually all cells, is readily detected in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Most secreted Ass has forty amino acids (Ass40) but a small fraction (5 to 10%) has two additional amino acids at the carboxyl terminus (Ass42) (13 to 15). In the brains of all patients with AD, a large amount of Ass aggregates and is deposited in senile plaques, much of it in the form of highly insoluble amyloid fibrils. To make a definite diagnosis of AD, large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles must be demonstrated in the brain at autopsy (16). In all LOAD patients, a large amount of the Ass deposited in senile plaques ends at Ass42. In one-third of cases, Ass ending at Ass42 is essentially the only form of Ass deposited, in one-third it is the predominant form and in one-third a large amount of Ass40 is also deposited (17). It is worth noting that synthetic Ass40 and Ass42 both spontaneously assemble into amyloid fibrils in vitro, but Ass42 forms amyloid fibrils far more rapidly than Ass40 (18,19). The brain has very high levels of APP mRNA; the concentration of Ass in cerebrospinal fluid is 50 times higher than in plasma; and mixed fetal brain cultures produce far more Ass than other types of cultured cells (12,20,21). Thus it is likely that senile plaques form specifically in the brain because Ass levels are higher in the brain than in other organs..

We and others have shown that the EOFAD mutations all increase Ass42 and sometimes increase Ass40 as well (15,26 to 30).

In this study, we analyzed VR22 for variants that contribute to the linkage signal on chromosome 10. Both its location and function make VR22 a strong candidate gene. Located at 80 cM at the peak of the previously reported linkage signal, VR22 encodes a novel catenin, -T catenin, which was recently cloned by Jannsens et al. (39). The catenins interact closely with ss catenin and play an important role in intercellular adhesion as strong intercellular adhesion depends on linkage of the cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton via the /ss catenin complex. -T catenin is closely homologous to -N catenin, which is neuron specific, and to -E catenin, which is expressed in all tissues. -T catenin is expressed at high levels in testis and heart, but it is also expressed in human and mouse brain (39). -T catenin has overall sequence identity of 56 and 58% with -E and -N catenin respectively. Importantly, Jannsens et al. (39) have shown that that -T catenin interacts with ss catenin in a functionally effective fashion. This makes VR22 a strong functional candidate because ss catenin interacts with presenilin 1 (40), which has many mutations that increase Ass42 (26,29,31) and cause early onset familial AD (24). Zhang et al. (40) has shown that loss of signalling through the ss catenin pathway leads to enhanced neuronal vulnerability to Ass. In addition, ss catenin and presenilin forms a complex that leads to stabilization of the former, such that destabilization of this complex leads to ss catenin degradation and enhanced neuronal apoptosis. Presenilin mutations were shown to lead to destabilization of the ss catenin to presenilin complex, degradation of the ss catenin and enhanced Ass production. Given that catenins provide the link between ss catenin and its binding counterparts (such as presenilins) to the actin cytoskeleton, it is possible to postulate that mutations in catenins could lead to disruption of the stability of the ss catenin to presenilin complex resulting in enhanced neuronal vulnerability of cells to Ass and increased Ass production..

Presenilin mutations were shown to lead to destabilization of the ss catenin to presenilin complex, degradation of the ss catenin and enhanced Ass production. Given that catenins provide the link between ss catenin and its binding counterparts (such as presenilins) to the actin cytoskeleton, it is possible to postulate that mutations in catenins could lead to disruption of the stability of the ss catenin to presenilin complex resulting in enhanced neuronal vulnerability of cells to Ass and increased Ass production..

These SNPs (Table 1), which spanned 465 bp, were genotyped in the 10 extended LOAD families previously analyzed for linkage (35). In order to minimize age and dementia-related environmental effects on plasma Ass42 levels, we performed all of our analyses on the 20 to 65 year age group, as in our previous studies (34,35). The effect of each of the three VR22 SNPs was analyzed by encoding it as a covariate and testing its effect on the variance of plasma Ass42 in a regression style approach implemented in SOLAR (Table 1). To control for the effect of linkage, the linkage component was included in both the null and alternative models tested. The 4360 (T/C) and 4783 (A/G) SNPs, which were in strong linkage disequilibrium, both showed strong association (P=0.0001 and 0.0006, respectively). The 4825 SNP showed only marginal association (P=0.06, Table 1). All three SNPs were also examined in a second set of 12 additional LOAD families (Table 1) (34). The VR22 4783 SNP showed significant association (P=0.04), VR22 4360 SNP yielded marginal association (P=0.08) and VR22 4825 SNP did not yield significant association (P=0.98) in this additional and smaller dataset. When all 22 families were combined, the significance of association reached P=5.9x10-6 for 4783 and 2.1x10-6 for 4360 SNPs (Table 1). Figure 1 depicts the box plots for the 10*logAss42 levels in the 22 families stratified by the most significant VR22 4360 SNP genotypes.

P-values for association with plasma Ass42 in 20 to 65-year-old subjects from extended LOAD families   Bounding of the association between VR22 SNPs and plasma Ass42 To bound the region of VR22 4360/4783 association, we evaluated a total of 49 additional SNPs spaced on either side of the 4360 and 4783 SNPs. These SNPs were selected to be in several groups, which were designed to span the entire VR22 gene at 250 kb intervals as well as the region 3' of VR22. The known exons in VR22 were 43.3 kb (median) away from the closest SNP in the closest SNP group (mean=53.8 kb, 22 to 149 kb). Given that the extent of LD in the human genome was estimated in different studies to be anywhere between 10 and  > 100  kb (41 to 45); and that this extent in any one genomic region is not predictable a priori, it is possible to miss association signals due to variants in-between our SNP groups. However, given the size of VR22, and our extent of coverage throughout and outside this gene, association signals we did identify with the 4360 to 4783 VR22 SNPs will be well-bounded within VR22 with this SNP genotyping design. Three to six SNPs were analyzed in each group, and linkage disequilibrium between the most significantly associating 4360 SNP and the other SNPs was analyzed in the 22 combined families (Fig. 2A). Using a covariate style regression approach, each SNP was analyzed for association with plasma Ass42 in the 10, 12 and 22 combined LOAD families (Table 2 and Fig. 2B)..

After regressing out the effect of this SNP, the multipoint linkage signal diminished substantially in the 10 combined families (Fig. 3). This marked diminution in lod scores indicates that a substantial proportion of the linkage signal for plasma Ass42 is accounted for by the VR22 4360 association.

Variance components models depicting the effect of the 4360 SNP on multipoint and twopoint linkage      DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION SUBJECTS AND METHODS REFERENCES   In this study, we analyzed the VR22 gene on chromosome 10 to determine if it has functional SNP(s) that contribute to the linkage signal for plasma Ass42 that we previously reported in extended LOAD families. We found two VR22 SNPs, 4360 and 4783, which showed significant, robust association with plasma Ass42 in 20 to 65-year-old family members of the extended LOAD families. These two SNPs are 423 bp apart, and they are in such strong LD that they give virtually identical results. The 4360 and 4783 SNPs are located in the 177 kb intron between exons 10 and 11 at a distance of 1.4 kb from exon 11. We identified 11 additional SNPs within 6 kb of 4360/4783, eight in the intron between exons 10 and 11 and three in the intron between exons 11 and 12, but none of these SNPs gave more significant association than 4360/4783. Careful bounding showed that the large (1.7 Mb) VR22 gene is the only confirmed gene within the region of 4360/4783 association. Analyses in which 4360 was used as a covariate in both the null and linkage models reduced the multipoint lod score indicating that the VR22 4360/4783 association contributes to linkage. The large reduction observed when all 10 families were analyzed suggests that the 4360/4783 association contributes substantially to the linkage signal observed in these families. The presence of residual linkage after regressing out the effect of VR22 4360 SNP indicates, however, that the 4360 association does not entirely account for linkage. Thus our data provide substantial evidence that VR22 variant(s) contribute to the linkage signal we previously reported. Though the residual linkage signal may be due to random variation, it could also indicate that there may be additional variants that contribute to linkage. Whether these variants are in the large VR22 gene or in nearby gene(s) remains to be determined..

The results reported here are useful because they identify VR22 as a gene with variants that influence plasma Ass42, thereby increasing the likelihood that VR22 is the gene (or one of the genes) in the 80 cM region of chromosome 10 with variants that influence risk for LOAD. An important, unanswered question is how well the effect of a SNP on plasma Ass42 will correlate with its effect on the AD phenotype. It is unlikely that the change in plasma Ass42 caused by a specific genetic variant directly increases risk for AD; increased risk for AD is probably produced by a related effect that the variant has within the brain. Thus it is conceivable, perhaps even likely, that a specific variant with a strong influence on plasma Ass42 may sometimes have little or no influence on the AD phenotype and vice versa. It is only by thoroughly studying several genes and elucidating the effects of the entire set of functional variants on the plasma Ass42 and AD phenotypes that this question can be answered. It may be that effects on the two phenotypes correlate well for the variants in some genes and poorly in others..

Except for this one family, the distinction between the  extreme  and  non-extreme  families were made a priori, before the family collection, based on the plasma Ass42 levels of the proband. The detailed collection strategies and family profiles for these families are provided elsewhere (34,35). In addition to these 10 families, 12 independent extended LOAD pedigrees were collected. These additional pedigrees, all of which had a proband who was a first degree relative of a LOAD patient and who had elevated plasma Ass levels (34), contributed 88 subjects between the ages of 20 and 65. This study was approved by the appropriate institutional review board; and appropriate informed consent was obtained from all participants..

Genotypes for the microsatellites were obtained using ABI 377 and 3100 sequencers and associated Genescan/Genotyper software packages. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using the TaqMan chemistry and software for designing primers and probes implemented within the ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detection System. Pedigree structure, phenotypic and genotypic information were maintained in PEDSYS (http://www.sfbr.org/sfbr/public/software/pedsys/pedsys.html) (50), which also produced output files for the analyses performed with SOLAR, as explained below. The order and location of 27 chromosome 10 microsatellite markers were determined from the Marshfield linkage map. Two markers, D10S1435 and D10S1211, which did not have locations on the Marshfield linkage map (51), were placed on the linkage map according to the location estimates obtained from the MAP-O-MAT program (http://compgen.rutgers.edu/mapomat/) (52). Two SNPs found in the VR22 gene were also used as markers in linkage analysis. These SNPs, 4360TC and 4783AG, are located at 61137462 and 61137039 bp, respectively, on the chromosome 10 genomic map in the Celera database (http://www.celera.com). The two SNPs were placed on the linkage map based on their approximate centimorgan locations estimated from the physical maps..

In order to identify SNPs, primers were designed to cover all known exons and a 7 kb intronic region between exons 10 and 11. LOAD cases, elderly control subjects and family members from the extended LOAD pedigrees were then sequenced to identify polymorphisms. The initial sequencing of the VR22 exons and the 7 kb intronic region identified three SNPs in the intronic 7 kb region (4825, 4783 and 4360). Subsequently, many additional SNPS in VR22 and flanking genes were identified using the Celera database. Our aim was to cover this region using SNP groups that are located at every 250 kb, with each group composed of 3 to 5 SNPs separated by 1 to 5 kb. A total of 51 SNPs, including VR22 4360 and 4783 were genotyped throughout VR22 and the 3 (ANXA2P3) and 5 (SIRT1) flanking genes. The SNPs within each group were found to be in strong LD with each other. The SNP locations were obtained from the Celera sequence map..

This method, described in detail elsewhere (53,54), estimates the amount of variance in a quantitative trait due to a particular genetic locus (q2), residual genetic factors (g2) and individual-specific, random environmental factors (e2), based on the phenotype covariance between arbitrary relative pairs. The covariance matrix takes the form.

This is a matrix whose ijth element is equal to 1 if individuals i and j share a specified environment, and 0, otherwise. Our family collection is largely composed of extended pedigrees, where we have measured the plasma Ass of most members from each family in a single batch of ELISAs. To rigorously account for any possible assay batch to batch variations that may affect the variance in plasma Ass42, we included a household matrix in the models. Since almost all individuals from each family were measured in one batch, the household matrix included an element=1 for those individuals from the same extended family and 0, otherwise. We realize that by doing so, we are probably being overly conservative. Since the shared-family (household) effect employed to account for potential batch to batch variance in the assay overlaps with the kinship effect (55), inclusion of the household matrix almost certainly overcorrects for batch to batch variance and underestimates the shared-genetic effect. For this reason, we performed the heritability and linkage analyses, both with and without the household matrix in the model. The multipoint results shown in Figures 2 and 3 include the household matrix. The analyses without the household matrix yielded slightly better lod scores and higher heritabilities in general..

The linkage analyses were performed by comparing the polygenic model to the linkage model where q2 was also estimated. The difference between the two log10 likelihoods for the models produces a lod score that is equivalent to the classical lod score of linkage analysis. We incorporated sex, age, age2, sex*age, and sex*age2 as covariates in the heritability estimations.

Since variance components methods are based on the underlying assumption that the quantitative trait being analyzed has a normal distribution, 10log(Ass42) levels were used as the phenotypes. Extreme outliers with plasma Ass levels  plus or minus 4 standard deviations beyond the mean were excluded from the analyses. Thus the 10log(Ass42) phenotype analyzed had a normal distribution. Plasma Ass measurements were done using a well established sandwich ELISA system as described previously (15). All samples were measured in duplicate. Each ELISA plate included samples from five volunteers.

These IBD estimates were used to obtain the twopoint lod scores. Multipoint IBD probabilities were also estimated at each centimorgan between each pair of adjacent markers using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multipoint IBD estimation approach implemented in the Simwalk2 package (46,47). The MCMC process was run twice, once with the default length of 1000 replicates and a second time by doubling this process length. Multipoint linkage analyses using these MIBD matrices were done using the variance components methodology implemented in SOLAR. The results using the shorter and longer runs were similar. The results of the latter are presented here. Given that the computation time increases with the marker number and that our two most upstream markers yielded no evidence for linkage in any of the datasets, these two markers (D10S1435 and D10S189) were omitted from the MIBD estimations. There are two major differences between the MIBD estimations utilized in our previous report of linkage on chromosome 10 and the current study (35). The results of the previous linkage were obtained as result of genotyping seven markers in a 13 cM region, and the current study utilizes 31 markers spread from 28.3 to 165.3 cM on chromosome 10. Second, the MIBD estimation approaches that we used in the previous and current studies are different. The MCMC approach implemented in Simwalk2 (46,47) that we utilized in this study is different from the MIBD probability estimation algorithm implemented in SOLAR, which was the approach we utilized in our initial analysis of seven chromosome 10 markers. Sobel et al. (47), demonstrated significant differences between the results obtained by these two methods using the same dataset and concluded that the multipoint MCMC approach yielded more accurate MIBD probability estimates for inter-marker loci. For this reason, we utilized the MCMC approach in this study..

The measured genotype approach is a classical test for differences in trait mean by genotype described theoretically previously (56,57). This approach was also utilized in previous association studies of SNPs and various quantitative traits in extended families (58,59). For individuals with an XX, XY or YY SNP genotype, we used a covariate that takes the value of 0, 1 or 2, respectively. This formulation assumes that the SNP is an additive QTL. The model that includes the covariate is tested against the model that does not include it to determine its effect on the quantitative trait of interest. Twice the difference in natural log likelihoods of these two models is distributed as a 2 distribution with 1 degree of freedom. In order to test for association above and beyond linkage, residual genetic and same-household effects, these three components were included in both the null and alternative models. We first tested for association between the SNPs and Ass42 in the 10 LOAD families that we previously used to describe linkage to chromosome 10 (35). In order to control for the effect of linkage, residual genetic effects and same-household effects in this group, we estimated the effect of each SNP on the background of a model that included our 80 cM multipoint identity-by-descent matrix, as well as kinship and household matrices. We then tested each SNP for association with Ass42 in a second, independent set of 12 LOAD families, and also analyzed the combined group of 22 families..

As with other synucleins, persyn is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative diseases. However, in contrast to other synucleins, high levels of persyn mRNA expression were also found in advanced breast carcinomas, suggesting an involvement of the encoded protein in breast tumour progression. Here we have used an antibody specific to human persyn to demonstrate that the level of this protein is increased in ageing cerebral cortex and in breast tumours. We cloned, characterized and sequenced the human persyn genomic locus and localized it to the long arm of chromosome 10 in the q23.2-q23.3 region. Sequence information was used to search for specific mutations in the protein coding regions of persyn mRNA and the persyn gene in breast tumours and tumour cell lines. No tumour-specific mutations were found, but two linked polymorphisms in the coding region were detected, both in mRNA and exons III and IV of the gene. These results suggest that development of breast tumours correlates with overexpression of the wild-type persyn protein. Detailed characterization of the human persyn locus is important for further studies of the involvement of persyn in neurodegeneration and malignancy..

The first two code for [alpha]- and [beta]-synucleins, which are closely related presynaptic proteins that have similar patterns of expression and are most abundant in evolutionarily recent regions of the central nervous system (1-5). Both proteins are believed to be `natively unfolded' or random coiled (6,7) and tend to aggregate in solution, forming amyloid-like fibrils (8). Another important feature of synucleins is their ability to bind and trigger aggregation of amyloid A[beta]-peptides (9-11). These results, together with the detection of a peptide (NAC) derived from [alpha]-synuclein in the senile plaques of Alzheimer's brains (2,8), raise the possibility that synucleins are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (12). Although mutations or polymorphisms in synuclein genes have yet to be correlated with Alzheimer's disease (13,14), two point mutations of the human [alpha]-synuclein gene were found in several families with early onset, autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (15,16). These findings, together with the immunohistochemical detection of a high level of [alpha]-synuclein in Lewy bodies of Parkinson's disease patient brains (17,18), implicates [alpha]-synuclein in the pathogenesis of certain forms of this neurodegenerative disorder..

During mouse embryonic development, persyn is expressed only in primary sensory neurons and motoneurons. Postnatally, persyn expression remains high in these neurons and becomes detectable in sympathetic neurons and a subset of neurons of the cerebral cortex. In contrast to the decrease in [alpha]-synuclein expression in ageing cerebral cortex (20), persyn mRNA expression increases and persyn protein accumulates in the mouse cerebral cortex with age (19)..

One of these cDNA clones (clone H1) was used to screen a human genomic library in [lambda]EMBL4 (22). Two identical, independent clones were isolated from this genomic library and the positions of the exons were determined by restriction analysis, hybridization with cDNA and oligonucleotide probes, direct sequencing of the locus and genomic Southern hybridization. Figure 1 shows that the human persyn gene consists of five exons that span ~5 kbp. There were no differences between the sequence of cDNA clone H1 used to probe the genomic library and the exonic sequences of the genomic clones isolated. However, in another shorter cDNA clone (4C) isolated from the same juvenile human cDNA library, two substitutions in the coding region were found (G->C at position 243 and T->A at position 377 of cDNA sequence AF017256, boxed in Fig. 1), the latter resulting in the amino acid substitution Val110Glu.

Two of these (at positions 243 and 377 of the cDNA sequence, boxed in Fig. 1a) are identical to the substitutions found in cDNA clone 4C. The other substitutions were not present in any of our clones and may be correlated with the transformed phenotype of the cells from which the BCSG1 EST was isolated. To study the presence and frequency of these mutations of the persyn gene in breast cancer cells, we carried out RT-PCR of mRNAs isolated from breast tumours and tumour cell lines. As a control, we used mRNA isolated from post-mortem cerebral cortices and PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes of normal donors. The PCR amplification products were digested with restriction endonucleases HphI, StyI and MnlI. Using these digestions, four mutations in the coding region reported for BCSG1, including two polymorphisms present in cDNA clone 4C, could be detected. In all studied samples, digestion with MnlI generated the same pattern of fragments (Fig. 5a), which corresponds to the pattern predicted from the sequence of the persyn clones. Identical, predicted patterns were also obtained with StyI (not shown). These results reflect the absence of two G->A (and consequently Glu->Lys) substitutions reported for the BCSG1 EST in all studied tumour cell lines, tumours and control tissues. In contrast, when RT-PCR products were digested with HphI, three types of fragment patterns were revealed (Fig. 5a). The pattern represented in Figure 5a by the GI101 cell line corresponds to persyn transcripts with a sequence similar to H1 (G243, presence of HphI site, 120 bp but not 135 bp HphI fragment; T377, absence of HphI site, 155 bp but not 79 and 76 bp fragments).

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	46	In addition to its potential involvement in neurodegeneration, persyn is possibly involved in breast tumour progression. It has been shown that expression of an EST (BCSG1) that is nearly identical in nucleotide sequence to persyn mRNA is increased dramatically in infiltrating breast cancers compared with normal breast tissues and benign tumours (21). We have shown that expression of persyn protein also follows this pattern: no persyn could be detected by western blotting in normal breast tissues, whereas persyn protein was detectable in breast tumour tissue. In established breast cancer cell lines, the levels of persyn protein expression were found to be substantially different and correlated with levels of persyn mRNA. We did not find amplification of the persyn gene in the studied cell lines (data not shown). These observations suggest that persyn expression is regulated predominantly at the level of persyn gene transcription and/or persyn mRNA stability. Thus, breast cancer cell lines could be used for further studies of the mechanisms that regulate persyn expression and to investigate the physiological consequences of persyn overexpression. We have shown previously that experimental overexpression of persyn in cultured sensory neurons leads to dramatic changes in the neurofilament network (19). It will be interesting to see if acute overexpression of persyn has a similar effect on the intermediate filament network in epithelial cells. Our immunocytochemical data suggest that persyn could be associated with membranous structures in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells. However, subcellular fractionation of neural tissues and breast cancer cells demonstrated the presence of persyn in cytosolic but not in particulate fractions (data not shown). These results are similar to results obtained in studies of [alpha]-synuclein, which is believed to be very loosely associated with synaptic vesicle membranes in presynaptic terminals (5,28-30). This is interesting in the light of the recent demonstration that [alpha]-synuclein is able to bind synthetic membranes in vitro. This association dramatically changes the protein secondary structure from natively unfolded to predominantly [alpha]-helical and perhaps alters the functional features of the protein (31). One of these features is the ability of both [alpha]- and [beta]-synuclein to inhibit phospholipase D2 (32). This inhibition is dependent on the bulk lipid concentration in the reaction, suggesting that interaction with the enzyme occurs on the membrane surface (32) and thus involves [alpha]-helical but not natively unfolded synucleins. As phospholipase D2 is implicated in various intracellular pathways, including regulation of cell growth and differentiation, it will be interesting to study the effect of persyn on the activity of this enzyme in neurons and tumour cells..
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	47	In addition to its potential involvement in neurodegeneration, persyn is possibly involved in breast tumour progression. It has been shown that expression of an EST (BCSG1) that is nearly identical in nucleotide sequence to persyn mRNA is increased dramatically in infiltrating breast cancers compared with normal breast tissues and benign tumours (21). We have shown that expression of persyn protein also follows this pattern: no persyn could be detected by western blotting in normal breast tissues, whereas persyn protein was detectable in breast tumour tissue. In established breast cancer cell lines, the levels of persyn protein expression were found to be substantially different and correlated with levels of persyn mRNA. We did not find amplification of the persyn gene in the studied cell lines (data not shown). These observations suggest that persyn expression is regulated predominantly at the level of persyn gene transcription and/or persyn mRNA stability. Thus, breast cancer cell lines could be used for further studies of the mechanisms that regulate persyn expression and to investigate the physiological consequences of persyn overexpression. We have shown previously that experimental overexpression of persyn in cultured sensory neurons leads to dramatic changes in the neurofilament network (19). It will be interesting to see if acute overexpression of persyn has a similar effect on the intermediate filament network in epithelial cells. Our immunocytochemical data suggest that persyn could be associated with membranous structures in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells. However, subcellular fractionation of neural tissues and breast cancer cells demonstrated the presence of persyn in cytosolic but not in particulate fractions (data not shown). These results are similar to results obtained in studies of [alpha]-synuclein, which is believed to be very loosely associated with synaptic vesicle membranes in presynaptic terminals (5,28-30).

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	48	Substantial changes in persyn expression not only accompany breast tumour progression but also take place during nervous system development. In our current study we have shown that persyn is not expressed in human fetal cerebral cortex but is abundant in cerebral cortices of elderly individuals. This is consistent with our previous observation that persyn expression is increased in ageing mouse cerebral cortex (19). We did not observe substantial differences in the levels of persyn protein in cerebral cortices of patients that suffered from Alzheimer's disease and normal age-matched individuals. These results are in agreement with immunohistochemical data that implicate persyn in the axonal pathology of neurodegenerative conditions (dot-like structures in white matter) without significant changes in persyn immunoreactivity in cortical neurons (V.L. Buchman, H.J.A. Hunter, L.G.P. Pinon, J. Thompson, E.M. Privalova, N.N. Ninkina, J. Lowe and A.M. Davies, submitted for publication)..

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	50	The important question is whether wild-type or mutated persyn protein is expressed in breast tumours. Sequence analysis suggests that the protein from tumour cells (BCSG1) is different from the protein expressed in the nervous system (cDNA clones H1 and 4C) and that coded by the genomic clone W6H. Substitution of two lysines by glutamates in BCSG1 changes the overall charge of the persyn molecule and disturbs EKTKEGV repeats that are highly conserved in the synuclein family. Such changes should have serious consequences for protein structure and function. However, the fact that BCSG1 is only an EST generated by RT-PCR amplification raises the question of how accurately the sequence of this clone reflects the sequence of the mRNA in tumour cells. We studied a number of breast tumours and tumour cell lines for the presence of mutations that underlie Lys->Glu amino acid substitutions in the human persyn sequence. Although both persyn mRNA and exons of the persyn gene were analysed by MluI and StyI digestion of PCR products, no such mutations were found in any of the studied tissues or cell lines. In contrast, using HphI digestion, we were able to detect two nucleotide polymorphisms that had been initially recognized as sequence differences between persyn cDNA clones H1 and 4C. These two linked polymorphic sites discriminate two alleles of the human persyn gene. Both alleles are transcriptionally active and are expressed with similar efficiency in heterozygotes. We did not find any obvious correlation between the presence of particular persyn alleles and pathological phenotype. Although a limited number of samples were analysed, the two alleles in breast tumours and tumour cell lines occur with the same frequencies as in normal cells. These data suggest that, at least in spontaneous breast tumours, the high level of wild-type persyn protein correlates with malignant phenotype and that the reported mutations in the BCSG1 EST are artefactual and may be the result of Taq polymerase errors..

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	52	We have mapped the human persyn gene to the long arm of chromosome 10 in the q23.2-q23.3 region. A few hereditary disorders for which affected genes are not yet known have been located in this locus. Taking into account the pattern of persyn expression in the sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system and motoneurons of the central nervous system, it will be interesting to check the possible involvement of the persyn gene in infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia with sensory neuropathy (IOSCA, SCA8) (33). Also, it is intriguing that the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 10q23 occurs at high frequency in different human tumours. Mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene, which is located in the region, have been implicated in many breast carcinomas and germline mutations of this gene are believed to be associated with Cowden disease, a rare autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome with a high risk of breast cancer (34). However, not all families and individuals with Cowden disease have mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene; somatic mutations of this gene occur in only a small fraction of primary breast cancers and LOH in breast cancers does not necessarily involve the PTEN/MMAC1 locus (35-37). Because of the correlation between persyn expression and breast tumour progression it will be interesting to search for mutations in the coding and regulatory regions of this gene in hereditary and spontaneous forms of breast cancer. Defining the organization of the human persyn gene reported here is an important step towards genetic studies of the involvement of this gene in neurodegenerative and neoplastic disorders..

As a result it is conceivable that effective treatments to delay or prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease could be available within a decade   something that was virtually unthinkable only 10 years ago. Old age psychiatry clinicians are near enough to this buzz to feel it and be excited by it. The differential diagnosis of dementia subtype is now an important part of assessment, the convergence of clinical descriptions of Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia (to give but two examples covered in this issue) allowing increased sophistication in terms of diagnostic reporting by clinicians. These distinctions can lead directly to important management decisions, such as the avoidance of neuroleptic agents in Lewy body disease or the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease. Recognition that disorders hitherto regarded as functional in nature have an organic basis has stimulated research into uncovering aetiological factors and has again influenced clinical practice.

This is clearly a field where there is much promise in terms of treatment. This is a theme continued by Bullock (2002, this issue) in his summary of new drugs for Alzheimer's disease. We now have three anticholinesterase drugs available for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease that have been approved by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the UK. The role of these drugs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease will become apparent with continued clinical practice influenced by an appropriate audit of their use and benefit to patients. Snowden et al (2002, this issue) provide an up-to-date summary of frontotemporal dementia, drawing together the clinical, neuropsychological and pathological expertise of the group, who were instrumental in the clinical descriptions of what is a relatively common, but underrecognised, cause of dementia, particularly in younger people. Vascular dementia, which in most samples pips frontotemporal dementia to the post as one of the more common causes of the syndrome, is summarised by Stewart (2002, this issue) and the lack of clear blue water between Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia is plainly acknowledged   a problem that is increasingly influencing clinical practice as well as taxing epidemiologists. The theme of vascular disease is continued with the review of the vascular basis of depression by Baldwin  and  O'Brien (2002, this issue). This condition may explain some elements of treatment resistance in practice and also has implications for the management of patients. Subcortical dementia is summarised by Turner et al (2002, this issue), who emphasise the phenomenological aspects of dementia that have aetiological importance. Jacoby (2002, this issue) brings to the fore many of the legal aspects of old age psychiatry which are increasingly becoming part of everyday clinical practice, particularly in relation to consent, euthanasia and mental capacity. The interface between health and social care is highlighted by Challis  and  Hughes (2002, this issue), and the current political climate is such that this distinction   while clinically blurred in many situations   is becoming more important in administrative and financial terms. Costs of care are an essential underpinning of considerations of clinical care, and Kavanagh  and  Knapp (2002, this issue) describe some of the models underlying many of the assumptions made by those predicting the cost of caring for people with cognitive impairment. Our own contributions concern dementia with Lewy bodies (McKeith, 2002, this issue) and the use of rating scales in old age psychiatry (Burns et al, 2002, this issue)..

Jacoby (2002, this issue) brings to the fore many of the legal aspects of old age psychiatry which are increasingly becoming part of everyday clinical practice, particularly in relation to consent, euthanasia and mental capacity. The interface between health and social care is highlighted by Challis  and  Hughes (2002, this issue), and the current political climate is such that this distinction   while clinically blurred in many situations   is becoming more important in administrative and financial terms. Costs of care are an essential underpinning of considerations of clinical care, and Kavanagh  and  Knapp (2002, this issue) describe some of the models underlying many of the assumptions made by those predicting the cost of caring for people with cognitive impairment. Our own contributions concern dementia with Lewy bodies (McKeith, 2002, this issue) and the use of rating scales in old age psychiatry (Burns et al, 2002, this issue)..

When both education and SES were introduced into the same model, only education remained significantly associated with AD. Combinations of low education with low or high SES were associated with similar increased risks of AD, but well-educated subjects with low SES were not at high risk. Low SES at 20 years of age, even when SES was high at age 40 or 60 years, was associated with increased risk; however, this increase disappeared when education was entered into the model. In conclusion, the association between low education and increased AD risk was not mediated by adult SES or socioeconomic mobility. This suggests that early life factors may be relevant..

Different mechanisms have been suggested to explain this association. Katzman (5) proposed that education might increase brain reserves by increasing synaptic density in the neocortical association cortex. Stern et al. (6) extended the cognitive reserve hypothesis and took into account the possible beneficial influence of mental activity throughout the entire life span, where occupational attainment along with level of education could influence the risk of Alzheimer s disease. Education might also be a surrogate measure for an intellectual outlook (7), as well as a proxy for intelligence, which in turn could be inversely related to the risk of Alzheimer s disease (8, 9). In addition, the issue of a possible detection bias due to later diagnosis of dementia in highly educated subjects has been raised (4, 10)..

(2) found that all of the investigated markers of SES (education, occupational prestige, and income) predicted the development of Alzheimer s disease. It has been reported that manual work, when it involves production of goods, could increase the risk of clinical Alzheimer s disease or dementia (18). However, these studies focused on principal occupation, not all occupational periods. In addition, the relation of social mobility through different socioeconomic levels over the life course to the risk of dementia in old age has not been studied..

Specifically, we examined how the risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia varied by different combinations of 1) education and main occupation-based SES and 2) education and lifetime number of years spent in a low occupation-based SES. Since education and occupation-based SES are interrelated, special attention was given to the categories that deviated from the expected pattern, that is, the combinations of high education/low occupation-based SES and low education/high occupation-based SES. Furthermore, we investigated social mobility patterns to explore whether later advancement or setbacks in occupation-based SES may affect the relation between education and Alzheimer s disease incidence..

Instead they were classified as nonmanual periods, because 1) these women often held nonmanual jobs in their other occupational periods and 2) they were generally more highly educated than the nonhousewives.

Compared with persons with a high level of education (=" BORDER="0">11 years), the adjusted relative risks of dementia of the Alzheimer s type and dementia of all types were similar for subjects with an intermediate amount (8 to 10 years) of education and elevated for subjects with a low level (2 to 7 years) of education (see model 1A). In model 1B, we merged the high and intermediate levels of education into one reference category. In model 1B and model 2, subjects with either a low level of education or a low occupation-based SES were found to be at higher risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia, even after adjustment for all covariates examined. However, when both education and SES were introduced into the same model simultaneously (table 2, model 3), only low education remained a significant risk factor for Alzheimer s disease and dementia. These results were similar for men and women, although the relative risks for men were not statistically significant, probably because of less statistical power..

Evans et al. (2) reported that each of the socioeconomic measures (education, income, and occupational prestige) predicted Alzheimer s disease risk. However, when they included all three measures in the same model, only education (not income or occupational prestige) retained a significant association with Alzheimer s disease.

This interpretation is in agreement with a number of previous reports. In a recent article, Kaplan et al. (28) concluded that higher childhood socioeconomic position, as well as greater educational attainment, was associated with better cognitive function in adulthood. In a study of education and dementia in an Italian population with a middle-to-high socioeconomic level, the first decade of life was suggested to be a critical period for development of dementia later in life (29). Hall et al. (30) discussed the possibility that low education by itself is not a major risk factor for Alzhei-mer s disease but rather a marker for other accompanying deleterious socioeconomic or environmental influences in childhood. Poor-quality childhood or adolescent environments have been suggested to prevent the brain from reaching complete levels of maturation, which in turn may put people at higher risk of Alzheimer s disease (31, 32). Results from the PAQUID Study (33) showed that occupation did not change the risk of Alzheimer s disease, which instead was related to cognitive abilities in childhood and adolescence. The early-life factors in question may be early socioeconomic factors, mental stimulation, or cognitive abilities. The cognitive abilities may be affected by both environmental (34) and genetic influences (9). Since many studies, like ours, lack an independent measure of intelligence, the importance of early-life cognitive abilities is difficult to evaluate..

However, it remains that occupation-based SES is more difficult to evaluate than education. Estimation of SES from occupation was difficult for the housewives in the cohort (21 percent).

We performed additional analyses (data not shown) treating the housewives as a third occupational category, and this did not affect our results..

In fact, there is the possibility of unmeasured confounders  being responsible for the patterns of associations found in the study. For example, work-related stress may be associated with occupation-based SES but not with education and may increase the risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia, though there is currently no clear evidence in the literature concerning such an association..

The results are not inconsistent with the already-suggested hypotheses of cognitive or brain reserves (5, 6). Alternatively, these findings may partly reflect a detection bias by which subjects with a low level of education tend to be clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer s disease and dementia at an earlier point in time (4). However, the possibility that factors related to early-life SES may play a role in the development of Alzheimer s disease and dementia should not be disregarded. Our findings support this hypothesis and stress the importance of collecting data on early life conditions when studying dementia in old age..

0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	4	Behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia is an umbrella term that embraces a heterogeneous group of non-cognitive symptoms and behaviours that occur in people with dementia. The concept of BPSD is a descriptive one and does not reflect a diagnostic entity but rather high-lights an important clinical dimension of dementia that has until recently been ignored from both research and therapeutic points of view. One approach to the description of BPSD is the use of a list of observed behaviours (wandering, agitation, sexually inappropriate behaviours) and elicited psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, delusions) (Finkel et al, 1996). This approach fails to take into account the fact that many so-called elicited symptoms (depression, delusions) also represent observed behaviours ( looks depressed ,  acts as though hallucinating or deluded ), and the fact that most of these symptoms and behaviours do not occur in isolation but tend to occur together in clusters or syndromes. A number of syndromes have been described on the basis of factor analytical studies using rating instruments designed to measure BPSD (Frisoni et al, 1999). These syndromes include depression, psychosis, psychomotor agitation, aggression and apathy. Both depression and psychosis are included as descriptors in the DSM-IV criteria for Alzheimer's disease (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and, more recently, diagnostic criteria for a distinct syndrome of psychosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and for depression of Alzheimer's disease have been proposed (Jeste  and  Finkel, 2000; Olin et al, 2002). It is likely that diagnostic criteria for other behavioural syndromes of dementia will also be developed in the near future and this will facilitate recognition and future therapeutic targeting of more specific aspects of BPSD..

0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	6	Although behaviour and psychological symptoms are not included as core features in the definition of the dementia syndrome, about two-thirds of people with dementia experience some BPSD at any one time point, and for one-third of community-dwelling people with dementia the level of BPSD will be in the clinically significant range (Lyketsos et al, 2000). The figure for clinically significant BPSD rises to almost 80% for people with dementia residing in care environments (Margallo-Lana et al, 2001). Prevalence estimates for BPSD vary widely because of the heterogeneity of patient populations studied in terms of setting and type of dementia, and the different definitions used for BPSD. The recent application of standardised and validated assessment instruments is resulting in more consistent data for community-and clinic-based populations. Two population-based studies, one from the USA (Lyketsos et al, 2000) and one from the UK (Burns et al, 1990), show similar prevalence figures of about 20% for BPSD in people with Alzheimer's disease. Unlike the cognitive dysfunction in dementia, which progressively worsens over time, many BPSD tend to fluctuate, with psycho-motor agitation being the most persistent (Devanand et al, 1997). Further research is needed into the natural history and longitudinal course of BPSD to inform clinicians about the appropriate duration of pharmacological interventions and what advice and information should be given to families distressed by these symptoms and behaviours..

0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	8	The occurrence of BPSD is often the triggering event for recognition and referral of people with dementia to specialist services, to which patients and families present in crisis and disarray, relatively late in the course of the illness. The development of BPSD is a major risk factor for caregiver burden (Coen et al, 1997) and institutionalisation (O'Donnell et al, 1992), and is more important in this regard than the enduring cognitive deficits of the disease process (Steele et al, 1990). All aspects of BPSD can be associated with caregiver burden, but paranoia, aggression and sleep wake cycle disturbance appear to be particularly important drivers of caregiver burden and institutionalisation (O'Donnell et al, 1992). The development of BPSD is also associated with a worse prognosis and a more rapid rate of illness progression (Paulsen et al, 2000), and adds significantly to the direct and indirect costs of care. Expert assessment and targeted treatment of BPSD can alleviate patient suffering and promote caregiver well-being, but will be less effective if interventions occur after the support system has been ruptured..

The development of BPSD is a major risk factor for caregiver burden (Coen et al, 1997) and institutionalisation (O'Donnell et al, 1992), and is more important in this regard than the enduring cognitive deficits of the disease process (Steele et al, 1990). All aspects of BPSD can be associated with caregiver burden, but paranoia, aggression and sleep wake cycle disturbance appear to be particularly important drivers of caregiver burden and institutionalisation (O'Donnell et al, 1992). The development of BPSD is also associated with a worse prognosis and a more rapid rate of illness progression (Paulsen et al, 2000), and adds significantly to the direct and indirect costs of care. Expert assessment and targeted treatment of BPSD can alleviate patient suffering and promote caregiver well-being, but will be less effective if interventions occur after the support system has been ruptured..
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	10	In the assessment of individuals with dementia at all stages of the illness, careful enquiry must be made regarding the presence of BPSD. The emphasis here must be to detect BPSD before caregiver burn-out and irretrievable damage to the support environment occur. Just as the collateral history and the use of an objective performance-based test must be part of any comprehensive cognitive assessment, so too should the history and assessment focus on behavioural and psychological symptoms, given their high frequency and impact on both patient and caregiver quality of life..

0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	12	Recognition of BPSD is the first and most important step in devising a management plan and will be facilitated by the use of standardised assessment scales such as the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (Behave AD) (Reisberg et al, 1987) or the Neuro-psychiatric Inventory (NPI; Cummings et al, 1994). The characteristics of the behaviour or symptoms together with the frequency, severity and impact on the patient and caregiver must be identified before formulating a tailored and targeted plan of action which is likely to involve pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. It is useful to identify target syndromes in the patient: is this primarily a psychotic syndrome (hallucinations or delusions), or is the main problem psycho-motor agitation and sleep disturbance? The context of the behaviour or symptom and its impact are also key elements in assessment. Aggressive resistance when a personal activity is being carried out with the patient may not warrant immediate pharmacological intervention. Also, mis-identification symptoms as part of a psychotic syndrome can be more distressing to carers than to patients and in such instances education of family members rather than drug treatment is required..

0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	14	Pharmacological treatments Drug treatments in BPSD should be evidence-based and targeted to specific syndromes that are clinically significant because of their frequency, pervasiveness or impact. For depression in dementia, although there is little placebo-controlled evidence to guide practice, clinical experience indicates that selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors are safe and effective. Neuroleptic agents have been shown to be more effective than placebo for aggression, psychosis and agitation in dementia (Devanand et al, 1998; De Deyn et al, 1999; Street et al, 2000), and novel agents are superior to conventional neuroleptics in terms of tolerability and side-effect profile. Non-neuroleptic treatments such as carbamazepine have demonstrated efficacy over placebo in the treatment of agitation (Tariot et al, 1998). Recent placebo-controlled studies suggest that cholinesterase inhibitors improve the apathetic syndrome in Alzheimer's disease and also decrease psychotic symptoms, particularly hallucinations, in Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia (Cummings, 2000; McKeith et al, 2000)..

Interventions with carers may not only decrease carer burden and improve the tolerability of the particular symptom (Hepburn et al, 2001) but can also have a positive impact on patient behaviour (Marriott et al, 2000) and possibly delay institutionalisation (Brodaty et al, 1993; Teri, 1999)..

Some degree of special interest development in the area of BPSD should be encouraged within the multi-disciplinary team and the adoption of evidence-based guidelines and standardised assessments promoted.

The main underlying cause was assumed to be atherosclerosis: a pathological substrate for  old age . Pioneering work around the 1960s and early 1970s challenged this assumption, establishing the importance of Alzheimer pathological changes in the majority of cases. However, multiple cerebral infarctions also appeared to underlie a substantial proportion. This led to the division of dementia into the two conditions of Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia. This system has persisted to this day but is coming under increasing criticism, particularly from those who wish to investigate vascular disease as a risk factor for dementia. In the following sections the current status of and future directions for  vascular dementia  are considered, both as a diagnostic category and as a heading for a broad field of research..

0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	12	Research diagnostic criteria treat Alzheimer's disease as a diagnosis of exclusion (McKhann et al, 1984). This system may be useful for examining issues relating to this disorder as a  pure  entity. However, it may also miss potentially important influences from factors such as vascular disease, which have been excluded by definition. In addition, having begun by excluding major vascular disease such as clinical stroke or multiple cerebral infarctions on computed tomographic imaging, studies that use this diagnostic system now have to consider what to do with evidence of more subtle, subclinical disease, such as white-matter abnormalities seen on magnetic resonance imaging. Increasingly sophisticated measurements of cerebrovascular disease in vivo raise the question of where exclusion criteria should stop. If detectable levels of vascular disease continue to be excluded, the  pure  Alzheimer's disease group will become progressively smaller, defining an increasingly select group of persons who, for whatever reason, have remained free of any vascular disease into old age. The question, of course, is what level of vascular disease may cause dementia; this cannot be answered by using criteria that assume that it is or is not a cause..

0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	14	A major problem with the concept of multi-infarct dementia has been that diagnostic criteria tried to do the same thing as those for Alzheimer's disease: that is, to define a  pure  entity. However, while Alzheimer's disease at least has a reasonably well-defined pathological basis, the same is not true for dementia related to cerebrovascular disease.  Vascular dementia  subsumed multi-infarct dementia as a term because of recognition of this heterogeneity, and large numbers of other subtypes have subsequently been proposed (Konno et al, 1997). These range from syndromes where dementia appears to have resulted from small, discrete  strategic  infarctions (such as bilateral thalamic infarction or lesions of the angular gyrus), to dementia associated with more diffuse cerebrovascular disease: ischaemic or haemorrhagic, cortical or subcortical (Brun, 2000). More diffuse disease obviously exists across a spectrum of severity and with advancing age is increasingly likely to be comorbid with Alzheimer's disease, raising questions as to how (or whether) the two should be distinguished in a diagnostic system. An additional obstacle for research is that the term  vascular dementia  makes assumptions about causation and therefore is of limited use when it comes to investigating potential causes. It would not be considered particularly noteworthy if a study was to report that people who have a stroke are more likely to have hypertension or diabetes. Similarly, it would not be very surprising if they were found to have higher mortality or higher levels of depression. The problem with  vascular dementia  as a term is that comparisons with Alzheimer's disease or control groups are inevitably comparisons of populations with different rates of cerebrovascular disease, and it is impossible to conclude what is related to cerebrovascular disease and what is related to a particular dementia syndrome..

0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	21	Particularly high rates of dementia are observed following clinical stroke, with an approximately nine-fold increase in risk over the first year followed by a smaller, two-fold raised annual risk which has been found to persist at least 25 years later (Kokmen et al, 1996). Vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia have also been established as risk factors for dementia in large prospective studies (Stewart, 1998). Early reports that smoking might be a protective factor, at least for Alzheimer's disease, have not been confirmed by more rigorously designed investigations which, if anything, report a raised risk of both subtypes of dementia in smokers (Ott et al, 1998). An important issue arising from these studies concerns the stage of cognitive decline at which these factors have an effect. Raised blood pressure in mid-life is, for instance, a strong risk factor for later cognitive impairment (Elias et al, 1993). However, blood pressure in later life tends to be lower in association with dementia (Skoog et al, 1996). Therefore hypertension appears to exert its effect at an early stage in cognitive decline and the association may no longer be apparent by the time cognitive function has deteriorated sufficiently to be classified as dementia. The same pattern has been described for raised cholesterol concentrations (Notkola et al, 1998), and has important potential implications for preventive or therapeutic intervention..

An increasing body of epidemiological evidence suggests that vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia are risk factors not only for the development of vascular dementia but also for Alzheimer's disease (Stewart, 1998). Community-based research can be criticised in that neuroimaging has not been routinely used in diagnostic assessment, so that subclinical levels of cerebrovascular disease may have been missed and  mixed dementia  misidentified as Alzheimer's disease. This issue, however, should be more a consideration of mechanisms by which vascular risk factors are associated with dementia rather than one of arbitrarily defined diagnostic categories. Post-stroke studies have found that dementia appears to follow an Alzheimer's disease-like course in the majority of cases (Kokmen et al, 1996) and that approximately 10% of people with post-stroke dementia have had gradually deteriorating cognitive function before the stroke occurred (Pohjasvaara et al, 1999). Since Alzheimer's disease has a long latency period, it can be assumed that a substantial further proportion may have had subclinical disease..

0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	26	What is becoming increasingly apparent is that dementia associated with vascular disease frequently resembles Alzheimer's disease in its clinical course and, in many cases, is not obviously explained by a multiple infarction mechanism. One possibility is that vascular processes cause a gradually progressive dementia syndrome. However, recent pathological studies have suggested that isolated cerebrovascular disease (i.e. with no Alzheimer lesions) is rarely found in association with dementia (Hulette et al, 1997). These findings contrast with those from the early post-mortem series, although it should be borne in mind that people with dementia in the late 1960s would be expected to display much more florid and severe cerebrovascular disease. The next question is whether vascular disease may directly cause or  drive  Alzheimer's disease processes. Many potential mechanisms exist and have been proposed for vascular induction of Alzheimer's disease, including amyloid deposition secondary to ischaemia or peri-infarct inflammation and microglial activation. Abnormal protein glycation may provide a link between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of cerebrovascular pathology in Alzheimer's disease such as vascular amyloid deposition and microangiopathy. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype may also provide a potential explanation for the association. However, although the ApoE 4 variant is associated with increased vascular risk, neither lipid levels nor vascular disease have been found to be mediating factors between 4 and risk of Alzheimer's disease (Prince et al, 2000)..

The  nun study  found no direct association between cerebrovascular disease and level of Alzheimer pathology, but instead found that less Alzheimer pathology was  required  to produce dementia if cerebrovascular disease was also present (Snowdon et al, 1997). One possible explanation is that memory impairment secondary to hippocampal pathology in Alzheimer's disease is more likely to manifest as clinical dementia if there is also impairment of executive function secondary to vascular subcortical pathology. Executive function impairment is an important, although frequently unmeasured, factor associated with memory decline, and decline in executive function alone, an important potential consequence of cerebrovascular disease, has been suggested as a dementia syndrome in its own right (Royall, 2000)..

The  nun study  found no direct association between cerebrovascular disease and level of Alzheimer pathology, but instead found that less Alzheimer pathology was  required  to produce dementia if cerebrovascular disease was also present (Snowdon et al, 1997). One possible explanation is that memory impairment secondary to hippocampal pathology in Alzheimer's disease is more likely to manifest as clinical dementia if there is also impairment of executive function secondary to vascular subcortical pathology. Executive function impairment is an important, although frequently unmeasured, factor associated with memory decline, and decline in executive function alone, an important potential consequence of cerebrovascular disease, has been suggested as a dementia syndrome in its own right (Royall, 2000)..
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	30	Considering the length of time vascular disease has been accepted as a common and potentially reversible risk factor for dementia, evidence for interventions to modify this risk has been woefully scant. As summarised in Table 1, the likely success of any intervention depends crucially on the mechanism of association. Of particular interest for clinicians is the extent to which patients with dementia may benefit from treatment of vascular disease or risk factors. However, there has been no optimally designed trial of such interventions. Treatment of vascular risk factors may have an impact on cognitive decline through preventing stroke   and increasing evidence suggests that there may be no upper age limit for stroke prevention (Staessen et al, 2000). In addition, there would be benefit if vascular disease was accelerating the progression of Alzheimer lesions. On the other hand, if vascular disease predominantly accelerates the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease, treatment should be directed at Alzheimer's disease rather than the vascular component once dementia has developed. This issue has become particularly important with the licensing of pharmacological agents for use in Alzheimer's disease. If stroke continues to be considered as an exclusion criterion, a large number of people with Alzheimer's disease will fail to receive appropriate treatment because of comorbid disease. Whatever lies ahead for the treatment of dementia associated with cerebro-vascular disease, the potential for its prevention is likely to be substantial since vascular risk factors have high prevalence rates. A modest reduction in vascular risk across a population could therefore be expected to result in a large reduction in future cases of dementia, if only through delaying its clinical onset. Supporting this, preliminary findings from the large Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst Eur) trial of antihypertensive treatment in older people suggested a 50% reduction in incident dementia (principally Alzheimer's disease) occurring in those treated with a calcium channel blocker compared with placebo (Forette et al, 1998)..

In addition, evidence from adequately designed therapeutic and preventive trials, even if negative, is likely to provide useful information regarding underlying mechanisms. What may well become increasingly apparent is that dementia is a very late stage to be considering useful intervention. One challenge is to develop public health strategies that can affect large populations, reducing vascular risk earlier in life with an aim of decreasing the burden of dementia for that generation 10-20 years later. However, from a clinical standpoint (directed towards individual-rather than population-level risk) there will also need to be a move towards identifying cognitive decline at a much earlier stage than dementia. In particular, with regard to vascular disease, the focus on memory decline influenced by Alzheimer's disease will need to shift towards an appreciation of executive function impairment (Bowler  and  Hachinski, 2000)..

What is less clear is whether it retains any usefulness as a diagnosis. Vascular dementia implies a primary cause (cerebrovascular disease) linked with a specific consequence (a distinguishable dementia syndrome). However, increasing evidence suggests that dementia associated with vascular disease involves a very broad spectrum of manifestations, from strategic infarct syndromes to Alzheimer's disease. In addition, although vascular disease is a powerful risk factor for dementia, it is questionable how often it is actually the sole cause of dementia in the absence of underlying vulnerability or comorbid disease. Dementia research has suffered, in common with other areas of epidemiology, from a simplistic conceptual framework of risk factor outcome relationships. What is increasingly evident is that there are many potential factors operating across an entire life course (and possibly extending back into previous generations) which may influence or mediate each other's effects (Table 2). Designing appropriate studies and systems of analysis to take into account these multiple influences and interactions is likely to provide a major challenge for future research..

A recent editorial has suggested that, rather than tinkering with existing criteria, they should be discarded and replaced wholesale (Bowler  and  Hachinski, 2000). Certain syndromes can be reasonably considered as diagnoses, for example dementia due to strategic infarcts or genetic disorders such as CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy). However, for the majority of vascular dementia syndromes arising in later life, although these may manifest as  pure  disorders, it is questionable whether valid distinctions can truly be drawn between sub-categories or between vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The result is that clinical research diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia involve a high degree of subjective judgement (Skoog  and  Aevarsson, 2000), leading inevitably to poor agreement between raters (Lopez et al, 1994) and between different diagnostic instruments (Chui et al, 2000). For depression, we do not feel the need to define  life event depression  or  poor physical health depression ; rather, we direct treatment at the symptoms and, holding in mind our formulation of possible underlying causes, attempt to modify potential maintaining factors and risk factors for recurrence. Perhaps there may be lessons to be learned for cognitive impairment and dementia. A complex picture of overlapping and interacting pathological entities is one of the challenges and rewards of health care for older age groups that we enthuse about to students and trainees. Is a diagnostic system that attempts to separate these processes into artificially pure diagnoses doing us or them   or those we treat   any favours?.

Interaction with other biological factors may modulate the effect of the apoE isoforms. However, previous work suggested that other genetic variability within the APOE locus, influencing the effect of the [epsis]4 allele, may exist. Such variability could modify the expression of the APOE gene and, in particular, the level of expression of APOE alleles could be an important determinant of disease pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis we examined the levels of expression of APOE in heterozygotes with AD and in controls, using a new method of semi-quantitation. We report that relative [epsis]4 mRNA expression is increased in AD compared with controls and suggest that genetic variability in the neural expression of APOE contributes to disease risk.

0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	6	The [epsis]4 allele of the APOE gene is a major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) (1), and is also implicated as a risk factor for early-onset disease in some populations (2,3). Previous studies have described [epsis]4 homozygotes as having a higher risk of developing disease than [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes. However, individuals bearing one or two [epsis]4 alleles, do not inevitably develop the disease. Detailed genetic analysis around the APOE locus has suggested the existence of other genetic variability in this region which could contribute to disease risk (4). There are two possible explanations for these observations: (i) there is another genetically variable locus in the vicinity of the APOE gene involved in the pathogenesis of the disease; (ii) there is a genetic variability in the control of expression of the APOE gene (4)..

The available evidence suggests that APOE expression is increased by neuronal damage (7,8) and that the bulk of the expression occurs in astrocytes (5). This expression is believed to be part of a compensatory mechanism aimed at aiding reafferentation and reactive synaptogenesis (9). Only a few studies have examined the expression of the apoE protein in AD cases and controls relative to the APOE genotype (9,10). Bertrand et al. have suggested that the amount of apoE protein could be inversely correlated to the number of [epsis]4 alleles carried by subjects: higher levels were observed in [epsis]3 homozygotes, lower in [epsis]4 homozygotes and intermediate levels in [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes (10)..

We observed that [epsis]3 mRNA expression was consistently greater than [epsis]4 mRNA expression in all cases (Fig. 2). In addition, there was a clear and consistent difference in the [epsis]4 allelic expression ratio between AD cases and controls (Fig. 2), with AD cases showing a higher relative expression of [epsis]4 mRNA than controls (34.4  plus or minus  2.6% versus 22.6  plus or minus  1.8%, respectively, P = 0.001 with Mann-Whitney test). Regarding the other heterozygous genotypes, the small size of each group prevented us from reaching any definite conclusion. Nevertheless, a trend towards the same situation as observed in the [epsis]3[epsis]4 group could be noted, an increase in the expression of the [epsis]4 allele in the [epsis]2[epsis]4 group (42.6  plus or minus  3.7% in the AD cases versus 28.9  plus or minus  1.2% in the only control), whereas nothing was apparent in the [epsis]2[epsis]3 group (39.0  plus or minus  1.4% in the only AD case versus 45.8  plus or minus  4.3% in controls). Furthermore, a difference in the allelic expression ratio between [epsis]2[epsis]4 and [epsis]3[epsis]4 AD cases was observed, since [epsis]2[epsis]4 patients showed a 1.25-fold increase of the [epsis]4 allele ratio (P = 0.01 with Mann-Whitney test)..

0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	19	As can be seen in Figure 2, the level of expression of the [epsis]3 allele is consistently higher than that of the [epsis]4 allele in the AD group as well as in the control group. These data suggest that there is either differential stability of the different mRNA species, or that there is genetic variability in the expression of the two alleles in disequilibrium with the coding polymorphism. However, in addition there was a clear and consistent difference in the [epsis]4 allelic expression ratio between AD cases and controls. These results are consistent with the notion that part, at least, of the genetic risk of developing AD encoded at the APOE locus relates to the expression of this protein in the brain. It would seem that heterozygote individuals who express a relatively high proportion of the [epsis]4 allele are at greater risk for developing disease than those expressing a relatively low proportion. The observation that the different alleles of APOE are not equally expressed may be of importance in the formulation of hypotheses relating to the role of APOE in the pathogenesis of AD in general. At present, there is much speculation and experimentation designed to determine the nature of the role of the different alleles of APOE in the pathogenesis of AD. As previously suggested, the E4 isoform may facilitate (12) or not limit (13) the amyloid substance deposition. This isoform would not protect against oxidative stress, conversely to the E2 isoform (14). Finally, it has been suggested that the E2 and E3 isoforms may prevent the aggregation of Tau protein, while the E4 isoform may not prevent the paired helical filament formation (15). However, these hypotheses are based on the premise that the APOE allele isoforms are equally expressed and present at similar concentrations in the brain. These isoform-specific differences could be enhanced by a different representation of each isoform in an individual..

These isoform-specific differences could be enhanced by a different representation of each isoform in an individual..

Several studies had explored this issue reporting contradictory findings in brain (10,16), cerebrospinal fluid (17,18) and plasma (19). But even if the apoE level was tested according to the APOE genotype, none of the previous studies have been able to determine the relative ratio between the different isoforms and thus our results are not comparable with them. The development of isoform-specific monoclonal antibodies would help to determine whether the variation that is observed in our population is also present at the protein level (20)..

0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	25	It is interesting to note that APOE is up-regulated as a consequence of an insult. Poirier et al. showed an increase in the level of expression of APOE mRNA in rat after lesioning of the cerebral cortex (6). Similarly, Diedrich et al. showed that APOE mRNA was increased in AD brains (5). Together these results support an event, which may lead to an increase of the APOE mRNA and, in parallel, a distortion of the allelic expression. The distortion of the allelic expression may be specific to brain, and possibly restricted to certain areas (21). This suggests a neural genetic susceptibility for AD associated with the APOE gene..

Using haplotype data from markers surrounding the APOE locus, including the APOE polymorphism, Templeton showed that the coding polymorphism in the APOE gene was not sufficient to explain the increased risk for AD (22). Our data suggest that the influence of non-coding polymorphism on ApoE expression may supply the rest of the answer. MATERIALS AND METHODS RNA extraction.

Whether deficiency in ACE activity, arising from genetic alteration or pharmacological inhibition, can decrease A degradation and allow A accumulation in intact cells is unknown. We cloned ACE from human neuroblastoma cells and showed that it had posttranslational processing and enzymatic activity typical of the endogenous protease. Cellular expression of ACE promoted degradation of naturally secreted A40 and A42, leading to significant clearance of both species. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we determined that both active sites within ACE contribute to A clearance, and an ACE construct bearing mutations in each catalytic domain had no effect on A levels. Pharmacological inhibition of ACE with a widely prescribed drug, captopril, promoted the accumulation of cell-derived A in the media of -amyloid precursor-protein expressing cells. Together, these results show that ACE can lower the levels of secreted A in living cells and that this effect is blocked by inhibiting the protease's activity with an ACE inhibitor. This work, combined with the genetic studies, supports the hypothesis that ACE may modulate the susceptibility to and progression of AD via degradation of A. Our data encourage further analyses of the ACE gene for disease association and raise the question of whether currently prescribed ACE inhibitors could elevate cerebral A levels in humans..

0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   An early and pathogenically important feature of Alzheimer disease (AD)2 is the progressive accumulation and deposition of the amyloid -protein (A) in brain regions serving memory and cognition. Biochemical, cell biological, animal modeling, genetic, and emerging clinical data all suggest that A is an upstream initiator of the disease process and its associated neuropathology (1-4). Although no proven disease-modifying treatments are currently available, recent efforts to treat AD have focused on both decreasing the production of A and enhancing its clearance from the brain. One little studied approach to A clearance is augmenting the degradation of the peptide by various proteases expressed in the brain. Thus far, the metalloproteases neprilysin (NEP) (5), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) (6), and the endothelin-converting enzymes 1 and 2 (7) have each been implicated as A-degrading proteases in the mammalian brain. The serine protease plasmin has been implicated in A degradation in vitro (8), although genetic plasmin deficiency did not promote accumulation of murine A in vivo (9). Supporting a role for therapeutic regulation of A-degrading proteases, the overexpression of IDE or NEP in a murine model of AD decreased cerebral A levels and produced significant attenuation of A-associated neuropathology (10)..

0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	7	Somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc metalloprotease containing two homologous regions, termed the N- and C-domains, each of which is proteolytically active (11). ACE has a single transmembrane domain and is cleaved from the cell surface at a low rate, resulting in the secretion of its ectodomain into the media of cultured cells and plasma (12, 13). ACE has been intensively characterized for its role in the regulation of blood pressure by cleaving angiotensin I to angiotensin II and inactivating bradykinin (14). This function of ACE is modulated pharmacologically by ACE inhibitors, which bind competitively to the active site zinc to prevent substrate hydrolysis. This commonly prescribed class of drugs is used for the treatment of hypertension and other disorders. In addition to regulating vasoactive peptides, ACE shows a broad substrate specificity, including several neuropeptides, and it is able to metabolize substrates using both exopeptidase and endopeptidase activities (15). Interestingly, despite their homology, the N- and C-domains display differential capacity to degrade some substrates and can be inhibited selectively by certain ACE inhibitors (16, 17). Recently, ACE was found to participate in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signal transduction pathway, apparently independently of its proteolytic function (18)..

Specifically, the I allele was associated with an increased risk for AD, whereas the D allele was associated with protection (20, 21). Of potential mechanistic relevance, inheritance of the D allele has been associated with increased plasma ACE levels (22). Regarding disease specificity, the I allele has been found to associate positively with AD but not with vascular dementia or vascular pathology (23, 24). The I/I genotype has also been linked to smaller volumes of the hippocampus and the amygdala (24). Importantly, post-mortem analyses of AD patients determined that those with the I/I genotype had a trend toward increased brain A42 load compared with the D/D genotype (25). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ACE gene have also been shown to associate with AD, and there is a decrease in the prevalence of the AD-susceptible genotype with increased age, consistent with a modulation of longevity (26)..

This hypothesis suggests that reduced ACE activity, either by genetic mechanisms or chronic pharmacological inhibition, could increase cerebral levels of A40 and/or A42 and thus presumably increase the risk of developing AD and/or contribute to its progression. To address this hypothesis in intact, living cells, we cloned and characterized human neural ACE and determined its role in the clearance of secreted A.We demonstrate that ACE promotes the clearance of naturally produced A40 and A42 and leads to secondary degradation of both A species. Further, by using site-directed mutagenesis in the context of the full-length enzyme, we show that both the N- and C-domains of ACE are capable of promoting A degradation with similar capacity. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment of A-secreting cells with a commonly prescribed ACE inhibitor prevents ACE-mediated A clearance and results in accumulation of the A peptide..

0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	15	   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Cloning of ACE and Creation of Active Site Mutants The 4.0-kb ACE cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR of RNA isolated from the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH. 5'- and 3'-end primers used to amplify the sequence were (5'-GGAAGCTTGCCGAGCACCGCGCACCGC-3') and (5'-CAGTGTTCCCATCCCAGTCT-3'), respectively. This coding region contains the full-length ACE protein, including signal peptide, N- and C-catalytic domains, transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic C terminus (Fig. 1B). The neurally derived ACE cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA5/FRT expression vector and confirmed by DNA sequencing to be identical to the reported human ACE cDNA sequence. The full-length ACE cDNA was used as the template for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange  XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to generate the catalytically inactive ACE constructs. The two ACE zinc metalloprotease active site glutamates (amino acids 362 in the C-domain and 960 in the N-domain) were changed to aspartates using the following primers: for E362D, 5'-CCACAGTGCACCATGACATGGGCCATATACAG-3' (forward) and 5'-ACTGTATATGGCCCATGTCATGGTGCACTGTGG-3' (reverse); for E960D, 5'-GGCCCACCACGACATGGGCCACATC-3' (forward) and 5'-GATGTGGCCCATGTCGTGGTGGGCC-3' (reverse). Mutant constructs were cloned into pcDNA5/FRT and screened by DNA sequencing to ensure that no other mutations had occurred. Four constructs were thus generated: the N-domain mutant, the C-domain mutant, the combined N- and C-domain mutant, and the wild-type enzyme.

0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	16	   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Cloning of ACE and Creation of Active Site Mutants The 4.0-kb ACE cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR of RNA isolated from the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH. 5'- and 3'-end primers used to amplify the sequence were (5'-GGAAGCTTGCCGAGCACCGCGCACCGC-3') and (5'-CAGTGTTCCCATCCCAGTCT-3'), respectively. This coding region contains the full-length ACE protein, including signal peptide, N- and C-catalytic domains, transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic C terminus (Fig. 1B). The neurally derived ACE cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA5/FRT expression vector and confirmed by DNA sequencing to be identical to the reported human ACE cDNA sequence. The full-length ACE cDNA was used as the template for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange  XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to generate the catalytically inactive ACE constructs. The two ACE zinc metalloprotease active site glutamates (amino acids 362 in the C-domain and 960 in the N-domain) were changed to aspartates using the following primers: for E362D, 5'-CCACAGTGCACCATGACATGGGCCATATACAG-3' (forward) and 5'-ACTGTATATGGCCCATGTCATGGTGCACTGTGG-3' (reverse); for E960D, 5'-GGCCCACCACGACATGGGCCACATC-3' (forward) and 5'-GATGTGGCCCATGTCGTGGTGGGCC-3' (reverse). Mutant constructs were cloned into pcDNA5/FRT and screened by DNA sequencing to ensure that no other mutations had occurred. Four constructs were thus generated: the N-domain mutant, the C-domain mutant, the combined N- and C-domain mutant, and the wild-type enzyme. All expression plasmids were characterized by both restriction digestion and DNA sequencing of the entire ACE cDNA. The HA-tagged IDE construct in the pcDNA5/FRT vector has been previously described (31)..

When assaying samples with captopril, a 15-min preincubation with the drug was performed at 4  degrees C before substrate addition. Time 0 values were calculated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM prior to the addition of Hip-His-Leu.

In the brain, we observed similar expression of ACE protein in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and basal ganglia/brainstem (Fig. 1A).

As expected, deglycosylation with several enzymes specific to O-linked sugars produced no shift in ACE size, whereas removal of N-linked modifications yielded a shift in the ACE protein from 182 to 154 kDa (Fig. 2A).

Thus, in a human cell line transfected with human cDNAs encoding both APP and either IDE or ACE, A levels were significantly reduced. Further, cell-derived A in ACE-transfected cells showed greater secondary degradation of the peptide than has been reported in vitro (30). This result suggests that ACE degrades A at additional sites when in a cellular context and/or that A species cleaved by ACE are subsequently degraded by other cellular proteases. Transfection efficiency was assayed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3C). Whereas both transfected constructs resulted in robust expression, total IDE levels were only increased 2.5-fold over endogenous IDE (Fig. 3C, bottom panel). In contrast, no detectable endogenous ACE was expressed by the HEK293 cells (Fig. 3C, top panel)..

To discriminate between these possibilities, we used an ELISA specific to internal residues 13-28 of A for capture and to either the 40 or 42 C termini for detection; the measured species are denoted A-(X-40) and A-(X-42). We found IDE to decrease A-(X-40) levels to 78% and A-(X-42) levels to 68% of those of control cells (p  <  0.05 for A-(X-40) and p  <  0.001 for A-(X-42)).

To determine which active site mediates A clearance, we generated three ACE mutant constructs: two containing only one functional catalytic domain and one catalytically inactive enzyme bearing mutations in both sites. Mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis to change the active site sequence HEMGH to HDMGH, a conservative mutation previously shown to inactivate ACE proteolysis (11). The C-domain was inactivated by mutating ACE glutamate residue 362 to aspartate (termed E362D), and the N-domain was similarly mutated by changing glutamate residue 960 to aspartate (termed E960D). Singly mutated constructs were combined by restriction digestion and ligation to form the catalytically inactive double mutant (E362D/E960D). Each construct was analyzed by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing to ensure that no mutations were made outside of those produced by the site-directed mutagenesis. Each was cloned into pcDNA5/FRT to achieve identical levels of cellular expression..

Thus, each stable cell line contained APP as well as one of the transfected constructs integrated into the same genomic locus by site-directed recombination of the pcDNA5/FRT vector (cell lines are designated as APP + X, where X is the integrated construct). The resulting ACE stable lines produced identical levels of the wtACE or mutant ACE proteins as well as indistinguishable levels of human APP (Fig. 4A). Notably, the APP + empty vector line expressed an estimated 11% higher level of APP than the four APP + ACE lines (Fig. 4A, middle panel), presumably the result of modest cytomegalovirus promoter competition between the APP and ACE constructs..

Canonical enzymatic activity of the mutant constructs was confirmed by degradation of the substrate Hip-His-Leu (Fig. 4C). The wtACE and E362D proteins were found to degrade this substrate at similar rates, whereas E960D had a far reduced efficiency of hydrolysis, conforming to the published kinetic parameters of each active site for Hip-His-Leu (11). Both the enzymatically inactive E362D/E960D and the wtACE protein incubated with 1  microM captopril produced no detectable degradation product (Fig. 4C)..

Normalizing A values of the APP + empty vector condition to APP content, there was no significant difference in A levels between APP + empty vector and the catalytically inactive APP + E362D/E960D. The N- and C-catalytic domains of ACE were each found to decrease cell-derived A levels to a quantitatively similar degree as wtACE. E362D reduced A levels to 52%, E960D to 43%, and wtACE to 34% of the APP + empty vector condition (Fig. 4D). Both single mutants and the wtACE enzymes were significantly different from APP + empty vector (p  <  0.001) but not significantly different from each other. These differences in A content could not be ascribed to the ACE enzyme altering the levels of the - or -secretase-generated APP C-terminal fragments, since both C99 and C83 were not significantly changed compared with APP + empty vector (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). Thus, using conservative mutations to inactivate the ACE catalytic domains, these experiments demonstrate that both the N- and C-domains are capable of mediating clearance of naturally produced, cell-derived A in intact cells..

Increasing doses of captopril were tested, and the resulting conditioned media were analyzed by ELISA for total A content. A values were normalized to those of the same cell line with no drug treatment. Captopril was found to have no significant effect on A levels in the catalytically inactive APP + E362D/E960D cell line, as expected. In contrast, the captopril-treated APP + wtACE cells accumulated nearly 2-fold more A than untreated cells at drug concentrations above 1  microM (p  <  0.01). At 0.1  microM captopril, the lowest concentration tested, A levels were elevated 1.5-fold in APP + wtACE cells compared with the same cell line without drug (p  <  0.05).

In that study, the ACE catalytic domains were cloned in isolation, producing recombinant truncation proteins bearing one ACE active site. In contrast, we find that both the N- and C-domains of ACE are able to degrade naturally produced A in a cellular context. In our studies, we used conservative mutations to inactivate each catalytic domain in the same molecule, conserving the overall structure and sequence of the full-length protein. It is possible that the C-domain is only able to degrade A in intact cells, not in vitro. There is evidence that each catalytic domain of ACE regulates the activity of the other (41), suggesting that the full-length protein is required for normal substrate recognition and degradation. The C-domain, when expressed outside of the context of the full-length enzyme, may not retain the tertiary structure required to degrade larger substrates such as A, whereas much smaller substrates are still processed (40). It is unlikely that incomplete inactivation of the N-domain in our E362D mutant enzyme could account for the observed decrease in A, because when both domains are inactivated in the E362D/E960D ACE construct, we observe no change in A levels compared with the empty vector control..

Further, post-mortem analysis of AD brain tissue has shown significant elevation of ACE protein compared with control (28), perhaps representing an up-regulation of an A clearance mechanism. Interestingly, initiation of ACE-mediated signal transduction by its substrates has been shown to up-regulate the enzyme's own expression via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway (18, 42). This feedback system provides a hypothetical mechanism by which ACE could modulate its own expression depending on levels of the A substrate, leading to elevated levels of ACE in AD cortex..

Neuropathological examination can detect occasional individuals in whom the microscopic features typical of late-onset Alzheimer's disease are present yet a clinical history of dementia is absent. On other occasions, the converse seems true: individuals seriously disabled in life by dementia show at death only mild pathological features of Alzheimer's disease. Observations of this type, although often made by experienced neuropathologists, are not widely discussed by molecular neurobiologists, among whom the assumption has largely prevailed that Alzheimer's disease is a well-validated nosological entity, discontinuous with ageing and with its own discrete molecular pathology. This reasoning extends to the repeated proposition that understanding the pathogenesis of amyloid deposition will provide a sound and sufficient basis from which to develop novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease (Selkoe, 1999)..

First, they encourage dementia researchers to re-examine the basis for the belief that there are valid boundaries between non-pathological ( normal ) ageing in the absence of dementia and the dementias. Second, they suggest that the central role often assigned to amyloid deposition requires review. Longitudinal follow-up studies such as the MRC-CFAS raise important issues about the nature of the phenomena to be explained. This editorial considers the early contributions to brain development as influences on cognitive decline in later life. In turn, this approach requires a deeper understanding than is as yet available of those brain mechanisms and processes most affected by ageing..

It was impossible to accept the validity of contemporary neuropathological criteria for dementia, or the definitions of the boundary, if any, that existed between the dementias and  normal  ageing. The study showed that in 209 old people weighted to contain 100 people who met clinical criteria for dementia before death, the majority showed mixed Alzheimer and vascular pathologies. At postmortem examination the brains of dementia and non-dementia subjects overlapped in neuritic and diffuse plaque density and no single pathological criterion reliably distinguished between groups. Coexistent vascular lesions did not provide sufficient explanation for the presence of dementia, but did encourage the view that interactions between Alzheimer and vascular pathologies may be critical determinants of progression to clinical dementia..

They also do much to weaken the pivotal position claimed for amyloid deposition in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Without the inclusion of some other factor or factors, the  amyloid cascade  hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease is no longer tenable. The MRC-CFAS programme may yet identify such factors. Not until their sample size has more than doubled and there are improved descriptions and quantifications of vascular lesions will it be possible to begin to disentangle the pathological processes that contribute to clinical presentations of dementia and, critically, to establish their true relationships with age..

When several cognitive domains are used to predict later onset of dementia, cognitive decline is typically non-uniform across those domains, with the exception of early memory impairment   largely because of its inclusion among criteria for dementia (Chen et al, 2001).

Links between increased late-life dementia risk and lower educational attainment suggest the association between dementia and childhood IQ reported by Whalley et al (2000). Explanations of associations of this type are complex and not mutually exclusive. Not least are the strong intergenerational and lifelong continuities of material advantage, which award entry to a safer, healthier environment to the mentally more able youngster. More usual is the concept that the mature brain possesses sufficient  reserve  (or redundancy) to withstand age-related pathologies as described by Esiri et al (2001) and that this reserve is determined by early life experiences. The belief that childhood educational attainment or mental ability could determine a threshold which brain ageing or dementia pathology must be sufficient to exceed to cause dementia was supported by the data reported by Whalley et al (2000). The association between lower childhood IQ and dementia was confined to late-onset cases and was most marked in those presenting after age 72 years..

It is the most usual contemporary approach to age-related disease, where the disease of interest (in this case dementia) is defined as present or absent. It contrasts with a second and potentially more powerful research method, which investigates the rate of change in premorbid characteristics over a specified age interval (National Institute of Aging Working Group on Aging and Genetic Epidemiology, 2001). Here, risk factors for dementia are examined not simply as contributing to duration of survival up to becoming a  case  of dementia, but as possible determinants of rate and timing of change in parameters believed to be closely linked to the pathogenesis of dementia..

0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	18	Age-related abnormalities of glucose metabolism are just one of these hypothetical parameters. Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for stroke and a possible risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia (Luchsinger et al, 2001). Matureonset (type 2) diabetes is also associated with cardiovascular risk factors that include hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, which may cause or accelerate unrecognised progressive cerebrovascular disease. There are at least two plausible biological mechanisms to link enduring age-related abnormalities in glucose metabolism with neuronal death: the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs); and hyperinsulinaemia. Separate strands of evidence link foetal growth, adult hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance at age 64 years (Hales et al, 1991). Taken together, these observations advocate longitudinal studies on individual differences in glucose metabolism and age-related cognitive variation. When studies of this type extend across the life span, they are subsumed under the title  life course approaches  to late-onset dementia and dementia-associated traits. They sometimes suggest parallel experimental routes to better understanding of mechanisms of age-related cognitive impairment (Strachan et al, 1997)..

0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	20	Explanations of associations between suboptimal foetal and infant growth and late-onset disease include failure to acquire lasting control of complex central regulatory systems. In brain development, foetal nutritional and hormonal environments are also important because of their critical roles in the expression of specific genes (Dauncey et al, 2001). Major differences in the foetal and infant nutritional environment induce large differences in expression of hormonal receptor isoforms and may provide the means whereby dietary micro-nutrients affect cognitive functions across the life span. Nutritional influences can be as apparently diverse as the contributions of folate and vitamin B12 to neurodevelopment and the greater age-related cognitive impairment linked to dietary and plasma folate concentrations (Miller, 2000; Duthie et al, 2002)..

0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	22	Diversity in timing and nature of single nutritional influences represents an important obstacle when taking a life course approach to understanding dementia. It can obscure the best route to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which early nutritional experience affects neurodevelopment and later cognitive performance. For example, observational studies in late life suggest hyperhomocysteinaemia (attributed to reduced transformation of homocysteine to methionine by folate and vitamin B12) as a possible risk factor for cerebrovascular disease (Miller, 2000) and dementia (Seshadri et al, 2002). Polymorphisms in the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR, an enzyme essential to folate metabolism) are, therefore, possible susceptibility factors for age-related cognitive decline; however, they possess the potential to influence brain metabolism throughout life. Similar critiques can be made of studies of interactions between genes and early nutrition. These may be as specific as their influences on peripheral insulin sensitivity and neuro-development, when the same factors might influence synaptogenesis in late life..

Largely because ageing studies are only just beginning, brain ageing is yet to be linked informatively to what is known about the neurobiological basis of cognitive decline. Higher brain functions comprise abilities like language, learning, memory, planning, abstract reasoning and self-awareness; most of these are impaired as age-related cognitive decline progresses to dementia. The neural foundations of higher functions are supported by the complex organisation of synaptic connections. One current paradigm attaches a central role to modulation of synaptic functions, some of which are enduring but the majority of which (especially in brain areas serving higher functions) require constant remodelling to respond optimally to environmental demands..

In one disease model, progression of age-related cognitive decline to dementia is best represented by a reversal of corticogenesis (Arendt, 2001). To develop such models further requires better understanding of ageing processes than is now available. Biological components of ageing certainly involve complex interplay between intrinsic (mostly genetic) and extrinsic (mostly environmental) factors. Recent progress encourages some optimism that a small number of highly conserved genes affect life span and do so through a similarly small number of metabolic processes. This view contrasts with the previous  degenerative  position that held biological ageing to be haphazard and not amenable to study. Generation of metabolites of oxygen termed  reactive oxygen species  (ROS) is an important cause of oxidative stress and ROS are intimately involved in the biology of ageing (Finkel  and  Holbrook, 2000). There are some parallels between ageing and altered metabolic states induced in lower organisms by adverse circumstances that are surprisingly similar in yeasts, nematodes, fruit flies and mammals (Guarente  and  Kenyon, 2000). They permit postponement of reproduction during unfavourable environmental conditions, and control expression of genes that protect against ROS damage and genes involved in insulin signalling (Finch  and  Ruvkun, 2001). Reduced expression of ageing genes involved in insulin-like receptor signalling extends life span, and this may be a specific property of neurons (Boulianne, 2001)..

Acquired defences against ROS damage are largely derived from dietary antioxidants which oppose ROS production. When ROS defences falter, additional burdens are placed on the brain's capacity to maintain structural integrity, most often threatened by increased peroxidation of neuronal lipid membranes, oxidative damage to DNA or large regulatory molecules (Whalley, 2001). Terminally differentiated cells such as neurons cannot dispose of DNA damage by cell division and must rely on their own DNA repair enzymes. This type of damage may not only compromise the performance of neuronal sub-populations that provide higher mental functions but also impair the capacity to make good or compensate for performance decrements..

In his view, there is much compelling evidence to accept, first, that abnormal dendritic sprouting occurs in Alzheimer's disease, and second, that  morphoregulatory molecules  involved in neurodevelopment re-emerge as part of Alzheimer molecular pathology. He suggests, for example, that the conserved functions of amyloid precursor protein (APP), the presenilins and apolipoprotein E (all implicated in Alzheimer's disease) are the key roles of morphoregulatory molecules in synaptic formation, turnover and stabilisation. They are preferentially expressed in adult brain in areas that retain most capacity to modify synaptic function. Morphogenesis of neurons has been of enormous relevance in understanding neurodevelopment and differential survival of cell types. Arendt (2001) now extends their significance to late life. First, he argues that these molecular processes underpin the  functional sculpting  used by the immature brain to  self-organise  the acquisition of higher functions such as language. Second, he identifies among the detritus of dementia, features that imply reactivation of brain self-organising molecular machinery. In Arendt's view, it is this reactivation that triggers the cascade of events which results eventually in the selective loss of cortical neurons..

Age-related endogenous oxidative damage to neurons (summarised above) further stresses brain adaptive mechanisms. The gradual and pervasive result is to jeopardise the high investment made by those neurons that retain a capacity for synaptic remodelling after completion of brain maturation. Missing from Arendt's model are mechanisms that account for individual and gender differences in rate of change in traits associated with dementia. This dilemma is familiar to developmental neuroscientists and has a strong likeness to current research problems in the molecular genetics of cognition (Plomin  and  Craig, 2001). Potentially, hormonal and genetic contributions to synaptic remodelling could be relevant. For example, there is evidence that oestrogens induce synapse formation in rat hippocampus and that this induction is dependent on apolipoprotein E (Stone et al, 1998). Diversity in efficiency of self-organisation may contribute to variation in childhood mental ability; these differences may extend into late life, leading to the divergence between brain ageing and dementia..

Recent studies have also suggested a regulatory role for this protein in controlling the activity of cytoplasmic protein complexes, including the proteasome [multicatalytic proteinase (MCP)] and the glucocorticoid and androgen receptors. Binding of IDE to these complexes increases their activity, whereas the addition of substrates for IDE inhibits activity. This provides a potential mechanism of action for internalized insulin and other IDE substrates in the control of protein turnover. To examine further the interactions, partially purified IDE-MCP complex was treated with EDTA or EGTA, and activity was measured in the absence and presence of various divalent cations (Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Zn2+) and insulin. EDTA treatment reduced MCP activity and eliminated the effect of insulin on the complex. Divalent cations partially or completely restored MCP activity, but did not restore the effect of insulin. EGTA treatment had a lesser effect on MCP activity, but abolished insulin inhibition of activity. Divalent cations restored the insulin effect. Inhibitors of IDE also blocked the insulin effect on MCP activity, as did treatment with SDS. These findings suggest that conformational changes in the complex may play a role in the insulin control of MCP activity..

0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	5	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   INSULIN-DEGRADING enzyme (IDE; EC 3.4.24.56), is an intracellular protein with binding, regulatory, and degradative functions. In vitro, its most characteristic function is proteolytic activity, with a relatively high specificity for insulin, thus leading to its name (1). Although insulin is the substrate with the highest affinity, IDE also degrades a number of other peptides and hormones, including glucagon (2), insulin-like growth factor II (3), atrial natriuretic peptide (4), and transforming growth factor- (5). It is not a general proteinase, because it does not degrade a wide variety of other similarly sized peptides, and no specific amino acid sequence is required for proteolysis (2). These findings have led to the conclusion that IDE recognizes a three-dimensional structure for binding and degradation (5, 6). The requirement for a specific ligand structure is reflected in the binding properties of IDE. This protein binds proinsulin, insulin-like growth factor I, and epidermal growth factor with high affinities, but has little degrading activity toward them (7). In fact, IDE was first identified in Drosophila by its binding properties and was considered a new intracellular growth factor receptor (8)..
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	6	The regulatory properties of IDE are a relatively new finding. IDE associates with and activates the cytosolic glucocorticoid and androgen receptors (9, 10). IDE also complexes with the proteasome and regulates its activity (11). Substrates that bind to IDE, including insulin and the various growth factors, inhibit proteasome activity when IDE is complexed with multicatalytic proteinase (MCP), but not after separation of the two proteins (12, 13). Furthermore, insulin inhibits proteasome activity toward an artificial substrate in intact cells (14). This has led to the hypothesis that intracellular actions of insulin and other growth factors on cellular protein turnover are due to interactions with IDE and inhibition of proteolysis by the proteasome..

Ca2+, however, restored both the LLVY degradative activity and the effect of insulin..

The effects of Ca2+ are shown for comparison. The metals have variable effects on restoring MCP activity to the EDTA-treated complex, but none restores the insulin effect. However, Zn2+, Ca2+, and Co2+ restore the regulatory function of IDE on MCP activity in the EGTA-treated material. Manganese appeared to restore insulin sensitivity, but did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.066 in a one-tailed t test)..

This effect is presumably mediated by removal of the Zn2+ found at the active site of IDE, which is required for activity. This treatment also reduces the chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activities of the proteasome and eliminates the ability of insulin to inhibit these activities.

0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	58	We propose that one metal, zinc, is tightly bound to IDE, and is essential for its activity, and the other, possibly Mn2+ or Ca2+, is more loosely bound and is required for the productive interaction of IDE and the proteasome. EDTA can chelate the tightly bound Zn2+ and the more loosely bound metal associated with the complex. This inhibits IDE, thereby lessening its stimulatory effect on the proteasome. Loss of the Zn2+ molecule causes a conformational change in IDE, dissociating it from the proteasome and disrupting the ability of insulin to alter proteasome activity. Readdition of divalent cation restores IDE activity, but because it is no longer part of the complex, IDE cannot alter proteasome function. However, EGTA only has effects on the more loosely bound metal and disrupts IDE s ability to affect chymotrypsin-like activity, but does not cause IDE to dissociate from the complex. Thus, addition of cations can restore insulin sensitivity..

0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	62	Finally, we studied the IDE proteasome interactions using SDS, which has been shown to alter proteasome conformation. As shown in Fig. 7, the chymotrypsin and trypsin-like activities of the proteasome are insulin sensitive in the absence of SDS, but lose both sensitivity and considerable activity at 0.005% SDS. Presumably, this is due to SDS altering the interaction between IDE and the proteasome. At higher concentrations, SDS further alters the conformation of the proteasome and stimulates the chymotrypsin-like and peptidyl glutamyl-degrading activities. However, at these high concentrations, IDE is still unable to interact with the proteasomes, and insulin does not inhibit. This effect is reversible..

0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	65	The physiological effect of insulin is to inhibit cellular protein degradation, with greater effects during catabolic states (e.g. starvation, diabetes, and traumatic stress). As cell survival requires continued protein turnover, it would not be expected that insulin could totally inhibit MCP activity or completely block protein degradation. Rather, the IDE-MCP interaction may serve as an activator of basal cellular protein degradation, analogous to activation of the glucocorticoid and androgen receptors by IDE (9), with insulin and other substrates then acting to inhibit the stimulated process. Thus, selective effects on cellular protein degradation in insulin-sensitive cells are under the control of insulin-IDE interactions. MCP comprises a relatively large proportion of the protein in many cells (up to 1%), and IDE, although expressed at high levels in some tissues (33), is not present in sufficient quantities in all tissues to be a universal regulator of all of MCP s activities. Our results show that insulin substantially inhibits only two of the activities of MCP, the chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities. The proteasome may have as many as five different proteolytic activities (34). It also remains to be determined whether the degradation of ubiquitinylated proteins is inhibited by insulin through IDE..

Our recent studies have provided a potential mechanism for these previously unexplained observations. In this scheme, the IDE portion of the complex acts as an intracellular receptor for insulin and possibly other growth factors. The insulin-IDE interaction then alters activity of the protein complex (i.e. MCP, glucocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor, and perhaps others) and contributes to the biological actions of insulin. The insulin effect on MCP can be prevented by altering the activity of IDE. Although speculative, cellular activity regulated by the IDE complexes may be affected by cellular redox state and divalent cation distribution due to changes in IDE. Alterations in insulin action have been associated with ion flux and redistribution and with redox state. These effects could be explained in part by regulatory effects of IDE.

In this study, Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze longitudinal data from 1,262 elderly subjects without dementia at baseline (1991 to 1996) who were followed for an average of 4.3 years between 1992 and 1997. Outcomes were incident Alzheimer's disease and dementia associated with stroke. The prevalence of diabetes was 20% at baseline. The adjusted relative risk of Alzheimer's disease among persons with diabetes as compared with those without diabetes was 1.3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.8, 1.9). The adjusted relative risk for the composite outcome of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment without dementia (without stroke) in subjects with diabetes was 1.6 (95% CI: 1.2, 2.1). The adjusted relative risk of stroke-associated dementia in persons with diabetes was 3.4 (95% CI: 1.7, 6.9). Among Blacks and Hispanics, approximately one third of the risk of stroke-associated dementia was attributable to diabetes (33% (95% CI: 31, 36) and 36% (95% CI: 33, 37), respectively), as compared with 17% (95% CI: 13, 22) among Whites. The finding of an association between diabetes and the composite outcome of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment without dementia (without stroke) is consistent with prior reports of a modest relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease..

The 537 excluded persons were slightly older than the analytical sample (mean age = 78 years vs. 75 years), were similar with regard to gender and ethnic distributions, and had a lower prevalence of diabetes (14 percent vs. 20 percent). The final sample comprised 1,262 subjects..

Dementia diagnosis was based on the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (30), and it required evidence of cognitive deficits on the neuropsychological test battery as well as evidence of impairment in social or occupational functioning (Clinical Dementia Rating  > 0.5) (31). Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was based on the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) (32). Diagnosis of dementia associated with stroke (hereafter called stroke-associated dementia) was made in all subjects with dementia in whom stroke was judged to be the main cause of the dementia based on evidence of the focal effects of the stroke, its temporal relation with dementia, or both. Brain imaging was available in 85 percent of cases of stroke; in the remainder, World Health Organization criteria were used to define stroke (33). Subjects without dementia but with a history of stroke at the baseline examination were included in the analyses. A diagnosis of cognitive impairment without dementia (hereafter called nondementia cognitive impairment) was made if neuropsychological testing detected memory impairment that was more than one standard deviation lower than normal for the subject's age but the individual reported no impairment or only mild impairment in social or occupational activities (Clinical Dementia Rating 0.5) (30)..

The time-to-event variable was age at onset of dementia; the models were stratified by year of entry into the cohort in order to control for period effects, as recommended for longitudinal studies (38). There was one model for each outcome mentioned above. All covariates were treated as time-constant covariates using the baseline values. In 26 of the 255 subjects with diabetes, the diagnosis was made after baseline, but these persons were treated as having had diabetes at baseline. An additional analysis was carried out treating diabetes as a time-dependent covariate taking into account the date of reporting of the diabetes diagnosis; this analysis was conducted to examine how the definition of diabetes (baseline vs. follow-up) affected the analysis. A similar analysis was carried out treating all variables as time-dependent covariates with the beginning of exposure used as the beginning of observation (or later for the 26 subjects diagnosed with diabetes after baseline), to compare the results with the time-constant covariate model. Subjects without the outcome were censored at the time of the last follow-up visit. Subjects with a type of dementia different than the one considered in the specific model were censored at the time of onset of dementia. For example, when Alzheimer's disease was examined as the outcome, persons with stroke-associated dementia were censored at the time of dementia onset. Additional analyses were performed using nondementia cognitive impairment without stroke and nondementia cognitive impairment with stroke as the outcomes; persons with nondementia cognitive impairment at baseline were excluded..

We addressed this issue by reclassifying all subjects with Alzheimer's disease who had also had a stroke as subjects with stroke-associated dementia (including cases in which the temporal relation between dementia and stroke was unclear), but the hazard ratios in this analysis remained essentially unchanged. The criteria for the diagnosis of stroke-associated dementia used in the last analysis are consistent with those of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) (54). The NINDS-AIREN criteria are not as sensitive in the detection of vascular dementia as the California criteria used in the study that found no relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (27).

The finding of a slightly greater risk of Alzheimer's disease among subjects using insulin than among those using oral hypoglycemic agents is consistent with findings from the Rotterdam Study (23, 26) and may reflect the possibility that diabetic subjects who used insulin had more severe or prolonged diabetes..

The NINDS-AIREN criteria are not as sensitive in the detection of vascular dementia as the California criteria used in the study that found no relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (27). However, misclassification of cases of stroke-associated dementia as cases of Alzheimer's disease is an unlikely explanation for our finding of a relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease: The results were unchanged both with exclusion of stroke cases from the analyses and with the reclassification of dementia subtypes described above. The finding of a slightly greater risk of Alzheimer's disease among subjects using insulin than among those using oral hypoglycemic agents is consistent with findings from the Rotterdam Study (23, 26) and may reflect the possibility that diabetic subjects who used insulin had more severe or prolonged diabetes..

There are inconsistent reports of an association between diabetes and cognitive impairment (21, 22, 55). Subjects with cognitive deficits and no functional disability have been determined to be at higher risk of dementia (40). Thus, the association between diabetes and cognitive impairment would be expected to be similar to that between diabetes and dementia. The findings for nondementia cognitive impairment support the results of the main analyses..

0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	54	One explanation for our finding of a nonsignificant weak association between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease may be that a relation truly exists but this study lacked statistical power to detect it. Our analysis using the composite outcome of Alzheimer's disease and nondementia cognitive impairment without stroke, showing a statistically significant association with diabetes as compared with the absence of diabetes (hazard ratio = 1.6, 95 percent CI: 1.21, 2.10), is consistent with this interpretation. Another possible explanation for this nonsignificant finding is that misclassification error for diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or both may have diluted the relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Self-reported diabetes as used in this study almost certainly underestimated the true prevalence of diabetes; true prevalence has been reported to be twice the prevalence of self-reported disease when subjects with undiagnosed diabetes are considered (3)..

It was a longitudinal study of nondemented elderly subjects in three ethnic groups that used standardized procedures for the diagnosis of dementia and its subtypes in a prospective fashion. The main limitations of the study were a lack of data on duration of diabetes, severity of diabetes, and the presence of undiagnosed diabetes. The multivariate models assumed a lifetime duration of exposure, which could have resulted in error in the measurement of exposures such as diabetes, lipid levels, and hypertension. However, as we noted above, this did not appreciably affect the hazard ratios for diabetes in relation to Alzheimer's disease and stroke-associated dementia..

0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	2	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Despite the magnitude of the problem, little is known about the duration of dementia. Survival and risk factors of mortality with dementia and the impact of dementia on the risk of death were investigated using the Personnes Agees Quid (PAQUID) prospective population-based cohort study between 1988 and 1998. Statistical models dealing with interval censoring were performed. Among 3,675 participants aged 65 years or older and initially nondemented, 2,923 have been followed up for 8 years. Of these, 281 persons with incident dementia were actively diagnosed. The mean age of onset of dementia was 82.3 years. In the total population, the relative risk of dying after developing dementia was estimated to be 1.82 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.77, 2.68) when adjusted for sociodemographic variables and comorbidity. Deaths from cerebrovascular diseases and respiratory diseases were particularly increased among persons with dementia, compared with those without. The median survival time of the persons with dementia was estimated to be 4.5 years. Women with dementia had a longer survival than did men with dementia, particularly for Alzheimer-type dementia (relative risk = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.83). Educational level was not significantly associated with survival in persons with dementia. These results provide further evidence of the malignancy of dementia, which will be a challenge for the 21st century..

However, data are often not obtained from community-based studies but from selected groups, that is, institutions or clinical settings, and cannot be applied to the general population. Indeed, in a review of the literature, van Dijk et al. (2) found that survival is conditioned by the reference population, with a lower survival for studies conducted in an institution than in community-based studies. In addition, even among community-based studies, 2-year survival was found to vary from 37 percent to 86 percent, probably depending on study designs (2). The majority of the studies conducted on community-based samples (3 to 11) have been based on prevalent cases, in which the onset of the disease is not known. Onset of dementia is insidious and progressive and thus cannot be determined exactly. Onset is often considered either as the time of the first symptoms of the disease or as the time of the first consultation. However, the earlier one sees the patient after the onset, the more precise the estimation of the onset will be; thus, onset will be estimated more precisely in incident than in prevalent cases..

Active detection of dementia makes it possible to take into account cases undiagnosed by their practitioner, a scenario frequent in France (15). In such a recent study in Sweden based on the Kungsholmen project (14), the risk of death among Alzheimer's disease cases was estimated to be 2.0 compared with that of nondemented persons. However, in the latter study, the onset of the disease was considered to be the time of diagnosis, and statistical analyses did not take into account the problem of interval censoring in cohort studies, where participants are not followed up continually but receive repeated cross-sectional screenings at time intervals. This could bias the results, particularly because of a lack of accuracy in the determination of disease onset..

The PAQUID research program is a prospective cohort study of a representative sample of community residents aged 65 years or over, living in southwestern France (Departments of Gironde and Dordogne). The cohort began in 1988. Three criteria had to be met for inclusion: to be at least 65 years of age by December 31, 1987; to be living at home at the time of the initial data collection phase; and to give written informed consent to participate in the study. The sample was randomly chosen from the electoral rolls, on which each French citizen, except those under guardianship, can register. A three-step procedure with stratification by size of the urban unit, age, and sex was used. Among the 5,554 persons selected, 3,777 (68 percent) agreed to participate in the study. These 3,777 participants (2,792 in Gironde and 985 in Dordogne) were representative of the age-sex distribution of the elderly of this area (15). Nonresponders did not differ from responders for age, gender, and educational level. The general methodology of the PAQUID study has been described previously (16).

Then, the psychologists systematically filled in a standardized questionnaire designed to obtain the A (memory impairment), B (impairment of at least one other cognitive function), and C (interference with social or professional life) criteria for dementia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R) (20). In a second stage, participants who met these DSM-III-R criteria were seen by a senior neurologist, who confirmed and completed the DSM-III-R criteria for dementia and filled in the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for Alzheimer's disease (21) and the Hachinski score for vascular dementia (22) to document the dementia diagnosis and its etiology: probable or possible Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease with cerebrovascular disease, and other types of dementia. An informant was consulted by the neurologist when available. All ancillary information was considered, including medical charts and brain imaging, if available. Finally, a consensus meeting allowed us to definitely classify each case. Comparable procedures of screening of dementia are usually used in other cohort studies (23). Diagnosis of incident dementia cases followed the same procedure at each follow-up assessment as for the baseline screening, but in order to increase the screening sensitivity, another criterion was added to qualify for the neurologic examination. Participants were selected for this stage if they met the A, B, and C DSM-III-R criteria for dementia or if they had lost three points or more on the Mini-Mental State Examination score..

Then, we analyzed the mortality with dementia among persons with incident dementia. 1. To quantify the impact of dementia on total mortality, we performed a Cox model with delayed entry, in which the time-scale is the age of the participants (25), taking the occurrence of dementia as a time-dependent variable and considering the age of onset of dementia to be at the middle of the interval between the last follow-up without dementia and the first follow-up with dementia. Relative risks of death from dementia and Alzheimer's disease were provided with 95 percent confidence intervals. Relative risks for competing causes of death were provided. 2. Mortality among persons with incident dementia, from the onset of the clinical stage until death, was analyzed using a multistate approach (semi-Markov model). We performed a statistical model dealing with interval censoring, which is a common problem in cohort studies. Indeed, in the PAQUID study, participants are not followed up continuously but with cross-sectional screenings at discrete times. Thus, the onset of the disease is not known exactly, and the only information available is that this onset occurred between two follow-up times. We therefore used a semi-Markov model that includes two transitions. The first transition represents the age-specific incidence rates of dementia. The second transition represents the mortality rates of persons with dementia. The model uses information from the incidence data of all people in the cohort. The fact that the time of onset of dementia is not known is taken into account by a penalized likelihood approach (26)..

The median times of survival according to risk factors are summarized in table 2. Whatever the age of onset of dementia, the median times of survival were higher among women than among men.

Our model provides results at each age of dementia onset, so we chose to provide results for persons developing dementia at 75 and 85 years. The median times of survival according to risk factors are summarized in table 2. Whatever the age of onset of dementia, the median times of survival were higher among women than among men. Among persons with Alzheimer's disease, there was a protective effect of female sex for the risk of dying, adjusted for educational level, comorbidity, and activities of daily living scale dependency at the time of diagnosis (RR = 0.47, 95 percent CI: 0.27, 0.83).

0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	43	Studying mortality with dementia in the general population raises special difficulties. First, one needs to conduct the study in the community, because dementia diagnosed in a hospital or in a nursing home setting is not representative of cases in the general population. Second, dementia should be actively screened, because it is widely underdiagnosed in the population (15, 27). Third, it is necessary to use incident cases of dementia, for whom the disease onset is better known. Finally, incident cases of dementia have to be followed up for a long time to observe death. Because of these methodological difficulties, few previous studies have investigated mortality with dementia in the community, by using incident cases of dementia (12 to 14). Even in these few studies, the onset of the disease was difficult to assess. Indeed, unless participants are screened for dementia continuously, the onset of dementia is always imprecise, clearly because of an insidious onset, but also because of interval censoring between the last time when the participant was considered as dementia free and the first time he was diagnosed as having dementia. Thus, the onset has to be estimated, even for incident cases of dementia. With the PAQUID study, we had the opportunity to analyze actively screened incident cases of dementia who were prospectively followed up for several years. In addition, we applied statistical models, taking into account the fact that the disease onset was not known precisely..

Twenty percent of the participants in our cohort were never reevaluated; among them, a large part (55 percent) had died before the follow-up, and the others refused the follow-up examinations. Participants who refused the follow-up examinations could be at higher risk of developing dementia; thus, nonresponse could lead to an underestimation of the incidence of dementia. However, this could bias the prognosis in the group of persons with dementia only if the mortality among persons with dementia who refused the follow-up differed from the mortality among persons with dementia who were evaluated, which is unlikely..

For these standard models, the onset of dementia was considered to be the middle of the interval between the last follow-up without dementia and the first follow-up with it. Although differences between the two models were slight, the median survival after developing dementia was about 2 months longer with standard models than with the three-state approach. The larger the interval between the two follow-up evaluations, the greater this overestimation of survival. In addition, using standard models tended to increase the effect of risk factors on the mortality among persons with dementia and also to slightly underestimate confidence intervals.

These results are in agreement with but are slightly lower than those found in previous community-based studies, ranging from 1.4 to 4.1 for Alzheimer's disease and from 1.9 to 3.0 for dementia (4 to 7, 12 to 14, 28), and even higher (RR up to 9.6) among younger participants (11, 28). This can be explained by inclusion of incident rather than prevalent cases of dementia in our study, and by the fact that we took into account morbidity when evaluating the risk of death..

Death due to respiratory diseases, which has already been found to be an important cause of death among Alzheimer's persons (30, 31), was also increased in both persons with dementia and those with Alzheimer's disease, compared with those without dementia..

0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	58	Survival among persons with dementia As in the general population, the median duration of survival among persons with dementia was most dependent on the sex and age of participants. The median survival times observed in our study were longer than those reported in most previous studies of prevalent cases in the community (3, 5, 7, 10) and even in some studies of incident cases (14). If incident cases are considered, this leads automatically to longer survival. However, clinical studies or Alzheimer Center studies have reported median survival times as long as or longer than ours (32 to 34), up to 6-year survival. Several explanations may account for this longer survival. First, persons referred to clinical settings for their memory are probably more interested in their health than others and may have less medical comorbidity. Second, the treatment and management of persons with dementia who present to clinical settings could increase their survival. Finally, the mean age of patients in clinical settings is often lower than that in community-based studies..

As in the general population, women with dementia are at lower risk of mortality than are men. Although the interaction between age and sex for the risk of dying among persons with dementia was not significant, the effect of sex seemed to decrease with age, with a greater difference between women and men at 75 years than at 85 years. These results are concordant with those observed in the Kungsholmen project, in which sex affected survival among persons with dementia but only under 85 years (14). Factors that explain the longer survival among women in the general population could remain unchanged during the course of the disease. Trials are currently in progress to test the hypothesis that estrogen replacement therapy could affect the progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, in the PAQUID study, very few women have taken such a therapy, and this cannot explain the longer survival of women with dementia in our sample..

Previous results concerning the relation between education and mortality among persons with dementia are controversial; some authors have found an increased risk of mortality associated with a high educational level (9, 38), whereas others have not replicated these findings (10) or even found the opposite (37). The hypothesis of brain reserve capacity, according to which development of the cerebral lesions of Alzheimer's disease at the time of diagnosis is more advanced among more highly educated people than in others, has been proposed to explain the association between high educational level and increased risk of mortality (9, 39). We also observed a tendency, although slight and nonsignificant, to a lower survival in persons with dementia who had the CEP but only among the youngest. A possible bias of detecting dementia according to educational level cannot be excluded. Indeed, participants with a low educational level have low premorbid cognitive performances and thus could be detected earlier than more highly educated participants. However, this bias is probably reduced by taking into account not only the DSM-III-R criteria but also a loss on the Mini-Mental State Examination score in the screening procedure..

A2M has been implicated biochemically in binding and degradation of the amyloid [beta] (A[beta]) protein which accumulates in SP. We studied the relationship between Alzheimer's disease and a common A2M polymorphism, Val1000 (GTC)/Ile1000 (ATC), which occurs near the thiolester active site of the molecule. In an initial exploratory data set (90 controls and 171 Alzheimer's disease) we noted an increased frequency of the G/G genotype from 0.07 to 0.12. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is over-represented in Alzheimer's disease in an additional independent data set: a group of 359 controls and 566 Alzheimer's disease patients. In the hypothesis testing cohort, the G/G genotype increased from 0.07 in controls to 0.12 in Alzheimer's disease (P  <  0.05, Fisher's exact test). The odds ratio for Alzheimer's disease associated with the G/G genotype was 1.77 (1.16-2.70, P  <  0.01) and in combination with APOE4 was 9.68 (95% CI 3.91-24.0, P  <  0.001). The presence of the G allele was associated with an increase in A[beta] burden in a small series. The A2M receptor, A2M-r/LRP, is a multifunctional receptor whose ligands include apolipoprotein E and the amyloid precursor protein. These four proteins have each been genetically linked to Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that they may participate in a common disease pathway..

0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	6	[alpha]2-Macroglobulin (A2M) is a proteinase inhibitor which inhibits proteinases of all classes by a steric trapping mechanism. The tetrameric A2M structure undergoes a conformational change upon cleavage of a peptide bond in the bait region by a proteinase and this conformational change traps the proteinase. A2M has been implicated in several pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer's disease. A2M immunostains senile plaques (SP) (1-3) and binds amyloid [beta] protein (A[beta]) 1-42 with high affinity (apparent Kd  <  1.0 nM) (4). Moreover, recent data suggest that a serine proteinase-A2M complex can degrade A[beta] (5) and trypsin-activated A2M efficiently degrades A[beta] in vitro and prevents in vitro formation of thioflavin S-positive A[beta] fibrils as well as A[beta]-induced toxicity of cultured human cortical neuronal cells (6)..

A2M-r/LRP is a multifunctional receptor and interestingly is also the primary neuronal apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptor (7,8). LRP also binds and clears the Kunitz proteinase inhibitor containing isoforms of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (9). Thus A2M potentially impacts both apoE and APP metabolism in the brain..

0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	10	Because of these biological links to Alzheimer's disease, we studied the possible association of a previously reported polymorphism in the A2M gene with Alzheimer's disease. Poller et al. (10) screened 30 normal and 30 pulmonary disease patients for A2M polymorphisms at or near the active site and reported three A2M polymorphisms. The most common occurred 25 amino acids downstream from the thiolester site, interchanging Val1000 (GTC) and Ile1000 (ATC) (10). (Numbering is based on the cDNA sequence which includes a 24 amino acid signal peptide; this corresponds to Val/Ile976 in the mature protein.) Allele frequencies in their 60 probands were 0.3 (GTC) and 0.7 (ATC). No difference in A2M serum levels was associated with the two alleles. This polymorphism is especially interesting because it has the potential to be biologically relevant to the function of A2M as a proteinase inhibitor because it occurs near the thiolester active site of the molecule..
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	11	Our initial exploratory experiment tested the possibility that the less common form of A2M (the `G' allele) would be associated with Alzheimer's disease. Because of the potential for error due to multiple hypothesis testing, we planned to use the initial data set as an exploratory data set, with the intent to formulate specific hypotheses which would then be tested formally in a second independent data set. We genotyped 90 non-Alzheimer's individuals who had either undergone screening tests with the Blessed dementia scale (11) or whose DNA had been isolated from autopsy material and were demonstrated to not have Alzheimer's disease and 171 individuals who either had a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or neuropathologically proven Alzheimer's disease (Table 1). Genotypes were determined by PCR amplification of DNA and restriction enzyme digestion (Fig. 1). In our control series, the G allele frequency was 0.28 and six of 90 individuals contained the G/G genotype (0.067). In the Alzheimer's disease set, the G allele frequency was 0.32. We noticed that the G/G genotype frequency was increased in the Alzheimer's group at 0.12 (Table 1). These results suggest a possible influence of this A2M polymorphism as a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease..

0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	15	To formally test the hypothesis that the G/G genotype of A2M is over-represented in Alzheimer's disease, we collected and genotyped additional independent groups of patients and controls. Power analysis showed that >500 Alzheimer's disease and control individuals would be necessary to have an 80% chance of showing a difference between genotype frequencies of 0.07 and 0.12. We therefore collected cases and controls from several sites in order to approximate this number of samples. The second data set consisted of individuals who met the same criteria for Alzheimer's disease or control as the hypothesis generating set and were derived from sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients in Massachusetts, from three European centers and from probands of a multicenter US study of sib pairs and small families. The results from the second data set supported the hypothesis, with G/G genotype frequencies of 0.07 in controls and 0.12 in Alzheimer's disease (P  <  0.05, Fisher's exact test) (Table 1). The G allele was not over-represented in this data set (control = 0.32; Alzheimer's disease = 0.34). No difference in age of onset between G/G and non-G/G was found in the second data set. Multivariate analysis showed that site of collection did not influence genotype frequencies. We also compared the rate in controls to the subset of 387 clinic-based Alzheimer's disease cases (G/G frequency = 11.4%, P = 0.06) and the subset of 179 familial Alzheimer's disease samples (G/G frequency = 12.7%, P = 0.056) and found essentially equal over-representation of G/G in each. These data support an association of the G/G genotype with Alzheimer's disease..

0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	17	We then carried out a series of exploratory analyses using pooled data from all individuals (737 Alzheimer's disease patients and 449 controls). The G/G genotype was present in 11.9% of the Alzheimer patients and 7.3% of the controls (P  <  0.01, Fisher's exact test). The genotype frequency in controls was consistent with a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Age of onset was not different between Alzheimer's disease patients with G/G (70.0  plus or minus  9.2, mean  plus or minus  SD) and non-G/G carriers (70.6  plus or minus  9.1). A multivariate logistic model that controlled for the presence of the APOE4 allele and gender showed an odds ratio of 1.88 (95% CI 1.20-2.95, P  <  0.01) for the presence of A2M G/G genotype. The presence of APOE4 in this model was associated with an odds ratio of 4.21 (95% CI 3.20-5.55, P  <  0.001). The odds ratio of the combination of G/G and APOE4 is 9.68 (95% CI 3.91-24.0, P  <  0.001) relative to those with neither risk factor. To explore whether the G/G-mediated risk was influenced by the presence or absence of APOE4, we stratified the sample by the presence or absence of APOE4. Similar over-representations of the G/G genotype were seen in the strata with or without APOE4, suggesting that the effects of the two risk factors are independent. Multivariate analysis for interaction between the G/G genotype and either APOE4 or gender demonstrated no interactions (P > 0.5 for interaction terms). Analysis based on the Mantel-Haenszel estimator suggested no heterogeneity of odds ratios between strata with and without APOE4 (P > 0.5), consistent with the absence of an interaction between A2M and APOE4 in our logistic regression model..

Analysis based on the Mantel-Haenszel estimator suggested no heterogeneity of odds ratios between strata with and without APOE4 (P > 0.5), consistent with the absence of an interaction between A2M and APOE4 in our logistic regression model..

Our previous studies of A2M immunohistochemistry in Alzheimer brain suggested that SP in different cases stained with varying intensity (3). We explored the possibility that this variability was due to different genotypes by immunostaining eight Alzheimer's disease cases known to be G/G or A/A genotype. In all instances, A2M immunoreactivity was present robustly on SP, astrocytes and neurons and no qualitative differences were observed between the genotype groups..

We have previously used stereological techniques and quantitative image analysis to measure the amount of A[beta] present (amyloid burden) in the neocortical association area surrounding the superior temporal sulcus and the number of neurofibrillary tangles present in the same region (12). Thirty one of these previously analyzed Alzheimer's disease cases were A2M genotyped and selected for further analysis. Initial inspection of the data suggested an increase in A[beta] in individuals who were A/G or G/G, with no difference between these two groups. A statistically significant increase in A[beta] deposition was seen when comparing the G-containing cases with the non-G-containing cases (8.8  plus or minus  2.8 versus 6.6  plus or minus  1.9%, P  <  0.03, unpaired t-test). The effect appears to be primarily due to the presence of at least one G allele, in that no difference between A/G and G/G genotypes was observed, although our sample size limits the power of this comparison. There were no statistically significant differences in neurofibrillary tangle number with G alleles, suggesting a specific effect on A[beta] deposition..

Alternatively, type II errors can occur if sample size is insufficient. In order to overcome some of the difficulties inherent in exploratory studies of genetic risk factors we used independent data sets to first generate, then test the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Two separate control populations gave identical genotype frequencies; our hypothesis testing data set was itself made up of two groups (sporadic AD and probands from a multicenter study of Alzheimer's disease sib pairs and small families) each of which gave essentially identical genotype frequencies and over-representation of the G/G genotype. The A2M G/G effect was not dependent on APOE genotype and the effect was additive and substantial: the odds ratio of G/G in the presence of an APOE4 allele showed an almost 10-fold increased risk. Power analysis using the size of effect observed in our combined data set (using ~500 samples) suggests that a group size of 578 controls and 578 Alzheimer's disease patients would be necessary to have an [alpha] of 0.05 and a [beta] of 80% for the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is increased from 0.07 to 0.12 in Alzheimer's disease..

0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	26	The association of the G/G A2M genotype as a risk factor in Alzheimer's disease leads to several interesting mechanistic interpretations. Previous data have shown that A2M immunostains SP and have implicated A2M in amyloid precursor protein metabolism (13) as well as possible interactions with binding of A[beta] (4) and mediation of degradation of A[beta] (5,6). A2M-A[beta] complexes undergo endocytosis via the A2M-r/LRP receptor (14). A2M associates with A[beta] and prevents fibril formation (15). In addition, A2M can be viewed as a (sub)acute phase reactive molecule and as a potent proteinase inhibitor which might participate in the inflammatory response in Alzheimer brain. Interestingly, A2M has also been implicated as a trophic factor, possibly as a result of binding and transporting a number of polypeptide growth factors and cytokines (16). Like apoE, A2M may serve as a binding protein for targeting various bioactive molecules to their site of action or clearing them (3). Finally, the fact that apoE and APP, two other ligands of the A2M-r/LRP receptor are clearly involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, support the plausibility of the idea that an A2M polymorphism might contribute to risk of Alzheimer's disease. In fact, a polymorphism in A2M-r/LRP itself has recently been reported in two studies to show a genetic association with Alzheimer's disease (17,18)..

0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	28	Although there is a strong biological rationale for the involvement of an A2M polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease, the possibility remains that the genetic association we observe reflects linkage with another mutation or polymorphism either in the A2M gene itself or in a nearby gene on chromosome 12. The A2M gene resides ~25 cM distal of the marker D12S1042, which yielded the maximal LOD score in a recent linkage study, suggesting that chromosome 12 contains an Alzheimer risk factor (19). However, the likelihood that A2M itself is a risk factor is supported by the results of a recent separate study, in which we observed an association between an intronic (5[prime] splice site of exon 18) pentanucleotide deletion (allele 2) within the A2M gene and Alzheimer's disease in a sibship analysis of Alzheimer's disease sib pairs and small Alzheimer's disease families (20). Our current results extend this observation by showing linkage of a missense mutation in a case-control sample rather than family-based association. We are currently studying how the two A2M polymorphisms relate to one another; our preliminary results are consistent with the hypothesis that they act as independent risk factors. Initial study of a group evaluated for both polymorphisms suggests that the G allele is inherited with the 1 allele; of 70 G chromosomes examined (35 G/G individuals), 97% were allele 1 and 3% were allele 2, compared with an allele 2 frequency of ~15% (P  <  0.005, [chi]2 analysis with Yate's correction)..

Wine is enriched in antioxidant compounds with potential neuroprotective activities. However, the exact molecular mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of wine intake on the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer's disease brain remain to be clearly defined. Here we show that resveratrol (trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene), a naturally occurring polyphenol mainly found in grapes and red wine, markedly lowers the levels of secreted and intracellular amyloid- (A) peptides produced from different cell lines. Resveratrol does not inhibit A production, because it has no effect on the A-producing enzymes - and -secretases, but promotes instead intracellular degradation of A via a mechanism that involves the proteasome. Indeed, the resveratrol-induced decrease of A could be prevented by several selective proteasome inhibitors and by siRNA-directed silencing of the proteasome subunit 5. These findings demonstrate a proteasome-dependent anti-amyloidogenic activity of resveratrol and suggest that this natural compound has a therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease..

In an alternative nonamyloidogenic pathway, APP is endoproteolyzed within the A region by -secretase to generate the C-terminal fragment C83 and the soluble N-terminal fragment secreted APP. Finally, a -secretase-mediated -cleavage of APP allows the intracellular release of the transcriptionally active APP intracellular domain (AID (3) or AICD) (4 to 6)..

To this end, we treated APP695-transfected HEK293 cells with increasing concentrations of the different polyphenols and analyzed A levels by ELISA and WB. Total secreted A (Fig. 2, A and B, panel a), including secreted A40 (Fig. 2B, panel b) and A42 (Fig. 2B, panel c), were markedly reduced by 20 to 40  microM resveratrol after 24 h of incubation, whereas quercetin and catechin were apparently ineffective at these concentrations (Fig. 2, A and B, panel a). At the same concentration range, resveratrol also reduced total intracellular A (Fig. 2B, panel d). Because resveratrol treatment did not lead to intracellular accumulation of A (Fig. 2B, panel d), we concluded that A secretion was not impaired.

Cleavage of N-cadherin by -secretase produces the transcriptionally active intracellular fragment N-Cad/CTF2 from the proteolytic cleavage of the intermediate C-terminal fragment N-Cad/CTF1 (15). Using a similar cell-free assay we determined that production of N-Cad/CTF2 was not affected by resveratrol treatment (Fig. 4c), confirming the absence of inhibitory effect of resveratrol on -secretase activity. Together with the observation that resveratrol did not affect the levels of APP holoprotein and its C-terminal proteolytic fragments, these data indicate that resveratrol did not target an A-producing activity but rather promoted A clearance..

0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	40	Based on these observations, we aimed to determine whether resveratrol treatment promotes A degradation. A peptides are degraded in vivo by at least four metalloendopeptidases, NEP, endothelin-converting enzyme-1 and -2 (ECE-1 and -2), and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) (17). Recent evidence indicates that long term treatment with resveratrol promotes NEP activity in SK-N-SH cells (18). Using thiorphan-sensitive enzymatic assays on intact HEK293 cells, we confirmed that NEP activity was significantly increased upon resveratrol treatment (Fig. 5A). However, inhibition of NEP with phosphoramidon or thiorphan in APP695-HEK293 cells could not prevent the decrease of A levels triggered by resveratrol (Fig. 5B). Because phosphoramidon also inhibits ECE-1 and -2, we concluded that these enzymatic activities were also not involved in the resveratrol-mediated decrease of A. Further, pretreatment with insulin, which acts as a competitive inhibitor of IDE, did not rescue A levels during resveratrol treatment (Fig. 5B). Thus, resveratrol did not promote A degradation by NEP, ECE-1 and -2, or IDE in HEK293 cells..

Because the proteasome has been shown to modulate A levels (22), we asked whether proteasome inhibition rescues A levels upon resveratrol treatment. Fig. 5B shows that treatments with the selective proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin, Z-GPFL-CHO, or YU101, significantly prevented the resveratrol-induced decrease of A. To confirm the involvement of the proteasome in the anti-amyloidogenic effect of resveratrol, we sought to down-regulate proteasome activity by siRNA-directed silencing. The proteasome is a multicatalytic protease complex formed by different subunits encoded by several genes (23). Because YU101 is highly selective for the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome (24) and because the subunit 5 is critical for this proteolytic activity (23), we asked whether siRNA-directed silencing of the proteasome subunit 5 prevents the resveratrol-induced decrease of A. Transfection of siRNAs directed against the subunit 5 strongly decreased 5 protein expression (Fig. 5C, panel a) and inhibited more than 60% of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome (Fig. 5C). Under these conditions, we observed a strong inhibition of the resveratrol-induced A decrease (Fig. 5C, panel b)..

0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	46	  We then investigated whether resveratrol directly stimulates proteasome activity. In Fig. 5D, the chymotrypsin-like activity of purified proteasome was monitored upon in vitro incubation with resveratrol. The same activity was also assessed from endogenous proteasome in cell extracts after treatment with the polyphenol in cell cultures (Fig. 5C). No significant effect of resveratrol on the chymotrypsin-like activity of purified or endogenous proteasome was observed (histograms in Fig. 5, D and C, respectively). Because resveratrol effectively reduced A levels after 24 h of incubation, we also asked whether resveratrol modifies proteasome subunit transcription. We found that resveratrol treatment does not markedly affect the steady-state levels of several proteasome subunits in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5C, panel a, and Fig. 5E, panel a). Together these results demonstrate that resveratrol promotes a proteasome-dependent intracellular degradation of A via a mechanism that does not increase total proteasome activity. Consistent with this conclusion, levels of -catenin, a cytosolic protein degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (25), are not affected by resveratrol in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5E, panel b)..

Interestingly, the three analogues were able to decrease A levels (Fig. 6). However, compared with resveratrol (Fig. 2A), piceatannol and trimethoxy-resveratrol were less potent, whereas TMS had a very comparable potency in reducing the amounts of A (Fig. 6)..

Resveratrol acts by promoting the intracellular degradation of the amyloid peptide by a mechanism that implicates the proteasome.

Finally, we demonstrate the anti-amyloidogenic activity of two methoxy analogues of resveratrol, trimethoxy-resveratrol and TMS, suggesting that chemical modifications of resveratrol can be done in the context of improving its potency, stability, and bioavailability and therefore its therapeutic use..

0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	51	Additional studies will be needed to fully elucidate the role of the proteasome in this mechanism of intracellular clearance of A. A number of possible functions of the proteasome in the regulation of A metabolism have been ascribed to the multicatalytic complex (22). The proteasome targets for degradation C99 and three core components of the -secretase complex, presenilins, APH-1, and Pen-2 (22), suggesting that proteasome activation may decrease A levels by reducing the amounts of C99 available and by altering -secretase activity. Our data show no reduction of C99 levels (Fig. 3A, panel c) or alteration of the -secretase-mediated cleavages of APP or N-cadherin upon resveratrol treatment (Figs. 3 and 4), thus excluding the possibility that resveratrol lowers A by promoting the proteasomal degradation of C99 or any -secretase components. Recent evidence also suggests that A can be degraded by a proteasome-dependent endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (26). Using cell-free reconstitutions of ER-derived brain microsomes, Schmitz et al. (26) show that A can translocate from the ER to the cytosol where it is directly degraded by the proteasome. It is conceivable that resveratrol promotes such a clearance mechanism. However, because ER A represents a small fraction of total A produced and because a small pool of A produced in the ER appears to be controlled by ER-associated degradation, it is unlikely that the severe reduction of A levels observed in the presence of resveratrol is entirely due to an increase of this clearance mechanism. We therefore hypothesize that resveratrol may act indirectly by selectively stimulating the proteasomal degradation of yet to be identified critical regulators of A clearance..

Resveratrol interacts with several proteins, including members of the sirtuin family. Sirtuins are evolutionarily conserved deacetylases with important functions in longevity (27). Resveratrol was found to act as a potent activator of the human sirtuin SIRT1 in vitro and of the yeast homologue Sir2 in vivo, a mechanism that may extend life span in yeast (28). Moreover, resveratrol and SIRT1 activation have recently been linked to neuroprotective pathways in models of axonal degeneration (29) and of neuronal dysfunctions caused by mutant polyglutamines (30). It would therefore be of interest to determine whether SIRT1 is involved in the resveratrol-induced decrease of A..

It is unclear, however, whether this decrease in proteasome activity is in parallel with an increase in A levels.

The authors performed a meta-analysis of 14 studies (16 comparisons) with CTSD genotyping (3,174 Alzheimer s disease cases and 3,298 controls). Overall, the random effects odds ratio for the T versus the C allele was 1.17 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95, 1.44), with some between-study heterogeneity (p  <  0.01). There was significant between-study heterogeneity but no evidence of a significant association when the first hypothesis-generating study was excluded from the calculations (odds ratio (OR) = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.35; p = 0.29). The summary odds ratio for T carriers versus T noncarriers was similar in subjects carrying or not carrying an apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4). The increased susceptibility to Alzheimer s disease conferred by APOE*4 carriage tended to be more prominent in the presence of the T allele (random effects OR = 6.07, 95% CI: 4.19, 8.79, and OR = 4.09, 95% CI: 3.15, 5.31, in T carriers and noncarriers, respectively). The meta-analysis shows that the CTSD polymorphism is not a major risk factor for Alzheimer s disease, although a small effect or an enhancement of the APOE*4 effect cannot be excluded..

The cathepsin D gene (CTSD) is located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p15.5) and consists of nine exons. The synthesis of beta-amyloid peptide is a putative key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer s disease. Beta-amyloid derives from its precursor protein via proteolytic cleavage by secretases. Therefore, it has been postulated that variants in the genes coding for enzymes involved in the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein or in the degradation and clearance of beta-amyloid from the central nervous system may be potential risk factors for Alzheimer s disease..

This polymorphism results in an Ala38-to-Val substitution in the cathepsin D profragment (3). The polymorphism has been associated with increased secretion and altered intracellular maturation of the cathep-sin D profragment in one study (3). Moreover, the T allele has been associated with a 50 percent decrease in beta-amyloid peptide 1 to 42 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer s disease (4).

There is also controversy on whether this polymorphism may interact with the apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4), which is the best known genetic determinant for sporadic Alzhei-mer s disease (20). Single studies may have been underpowered to detect interactions or even overall effects. Given the amount of accumulated data, we deemed it important to perform a quantitative synthesis of the evidence using rigorous methods. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of all available studies relating the CTSD polymorphism to the risk of Alzheimer s disease..

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	15	   DISEASE TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION GENE GENE VARIANTS DISEASE META-ANALYSIS METHODS META-ANALYSIS RESULTS DISCUSSION LABORATORY TESTS POPULATION TESTING REFERENCES   Alzheimer s disease is the most common cause of progressive cognitive impairment in the elderly, with an annual incidence of approximately 1 percent at 65 to 69 years increasing up to 40 percent in the very elderly ( > 85 years of age) (21, 22). Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1, and presenilin 2 genes account for 5 percent of the cases and result in an autosomally dominant pattern that is expressed with complete penetrance and early manifestations (23). Alzheimer s disease is probably slightly more common in females (24). Other proven or postulated risk factors include head injury (in particular among males) (25), as well as family history, low income, low education, low occupational status, depression, exposure to aluminum in drinking water, hypertension, and Down s syndrome (26, 27). Conversely, the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to treat arthritis has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzhei-mer s disease, as has been estrogen use by postmenopausal women (27). Physical activity, diets with high levels of vitamins B6, B12, and folate, and red wine in moderate quantities may be protective (27). The prevalence of Alzheimer s disease varies considerably among different population groups (28). At least a few dozens of polymorphisms have been examined in relation to sporadic Alzheimer s disease, and published reviews are available (23, 29). Among them, there is conclusive evidence from several studies and meta-analysis thereof that APOE*4 is a strong risk factor for developing Alzheimer s disease for both male and female subjects and for both early onset ( < 65 years) and late-onset disease (20), with an approximately fivefold increase in the odds of developing Alzheimer s disease. Single studies have also implicated other polymorphisms as being important, although the reported odds ratios are much smaller than those seen for APOE*4, and attempts at replication in subsequent research have not been conclusive. Meta-analyses for some other polymorphisms have already appeared in the literature (30 to 35). They suggest no significant overall associations for several of these polymorphisms, including the myeloperoxidase gene promoter polymorphism (30), intronic or promoter region polymorphisms of presenilin 1 (for late-onset disease) (31), an insertion-deletion polymorphism or a missense mutation in the alpha-2 macroglobulin gene (32), and several polymorphisms of the protein tau gene (33). Associations of modest effect size (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.30 to 1.35) have been claimed in meta-analyses of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein gene exon 3 polymorphism (34) and of an insertion-deletion polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme I gene (35)..

For each genetic contrast, we estimated the between-study heterogeneity across all eligible comparisons using the chi-square-based Q statistic (36). Heterogeneity was considered significant for p  <  0.10. Data were combined using both fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) and random-effects (DerSimonian and Laird) models (37). Random effects incorporate an estimate of the between-study variance and tend to provide wider confidence intervals, when the results of the constituent studies differ among themselves. In the absence of between-study heterogeneity, the two methods provide identical results. Random effects are more appropriate when heterogeneity is present (37)..

Inverted funnel plots and the Begg-Mazumdar publication bias diagnostic (nonparametric correlation coefficient) (42) evaluated whether the magnitude of the observed association was related to the variance of each study, that is, whether large studies gave different results compared with smaller ones (43).

The T allele was more highly represented among controls of American descent (overall prevalence of 8.6 percent, 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 7.1, 10.1) than in controls of European (7.8 percent, 95 percent CI: 7.0, 8.6) or Asian (0.9 percent, 95 percent CI: 0.3, 1.5) descent. There was significant heterogeneity in the prevalence rates of the T allele even across the control subjects of European descent, with a rate of 14.3 percent among Hispanic Americans, 10.4 percent in Italy, 10.1 percent in Spain, and lower rates in northern European countries (7.6 percent in the United Kingdom, 6.3 percent in Sweden, 6.1 percent in Germany, and the lowest prevalence rate of 4.5 percent in a Polish population). Overall, the prevalence of T/T homozygosity was 0.3 percent, 0.8 percent, and 0.2 percent in control subjects of American, European, and Asian descent, respectively. The respective prevalence rates of C/T heterozygosity were 16.6 percent, 14.0 percent, and 1.5 percent, and the respective rates for C/C homozygosity were 83.1 percent, 85.2 percent, and 98.3 percent.

The T allele was more highly represented among controls of American descent (overall prevalence of 8.6 percent, 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 7.1, 10.1) than in controls of European (7.8 percent, 95 percent CI: 7.0, 8.6) or Asian (0.9 percent, 95 percent CI: 0.3, 1.5) descent. There was significant heterogeneity in the prevalence rates of the T allele even across the control subjects of European descent, with a rate of 14.3 percent among Hispanic Americans, 10.4 percent in Italy, 10.1 percent in Spain, and lower rates in northern European countries (7.6 percent in the United Kingdom, 6.3 percent in Sweden, 6.1 percent in Germany, and the lowest prevalence rate of 4.5 percent in a Polish population). Overall, the prevalence of T/T homozygosity was 0.3 percent, 0.8 percent, and 0.2 percent in control subjects of American, European, and Asian descent, respectively. The respective prevalence rates of C/T heterozygosity were 16.6 percent, 14.0 percent, and 1.5 percent, and the respective rates for C/C homozygosity were 83.1 percent, 85.2 percent, and 98.3 percent. The distribution of genotypes in control groups was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all studies..

Distribution of CTSD alleles among Alzheimer s disease cases and controls in the included studies   Overall effects There was a trend suggesting that the T allele may confer increased susceptibility to Alzheimer s disease (figure 1). As shown in table 3, the summary odds ratio was 1.17 by random effects (p = 0.14), and there was significant heterogeneity among the 16 study comparisons (p  <  0.01 for heterogeneity). We found no evidence of an association of the T/T genotype with the risk of Alzheimer s disease relative to the C/C genotype. There was no significant between-study heterogeneity. No evidence of an association with Alzhei-mer s disease was discerned also when the recessive model was examined for the effect of T, while a trend for an association was seen in the dominant model (by random effects, OR = 1.19, 95 percent CI: 0.97, 1.47; p = 0.10). There was no between-study heterogeneity in the recessive model contrast, while significant heterogeneity (p  <  0.05) was still seen for the dominant model contrast. Subgroup analysis of studies with cases and controls of European descent yielded similar results (15 comparisons (11,436 alleles): OR = 1.18, 95 percent CI: 0.96, 1.46; p = 0.12) (p  <  0.01 for heterogeneity)..

Summary odds ratios for various contrasts   Bias diagnostics In cumulative meta-analysis and recursive cumulative meta-analysis, the magnitude of the summary odds ratio had not been stable over time, and it had changed considerably per year with an apparent dissipation of the postulated effect (by random effects, summary OR for T vs. C: 2.05 at the end of 1999, 1.41 at the end of 2000, 1.16 at the end of 2001, 1.14 at the end of 2002, and 1.17 in 2003). Excluding the first hypothesis-generating study (9), we found that the summary odds ratio became 1.11 (95 percent CI: 0.91, 1.35; p = 0.29) with significant between-study heterogeneity (p  <  0.05), and there was no evidence of any association even in the comparison of the homozygotes (T/T vs. C/C: OR = 0.96, 95 percent CI: 0.48, 1.90; p = 0.91), with no between-study heterogeneity. There was no relation between the effect size and the variance of each study, suggesting that larger studies agreed with the results of smaller studies. Analyses limited to studies with more intensive efforts to exclude Alzheimer s disease from controls yielded similar results (11 comparisons (10,382 alleles): OR = 1.22, 95 percent CI: 0.96, 1.54; p = 0.10) (p = 0.02 for heterogeneity)..

Among carriers of the high-risk APOE*4 allele, T allele carriers had a random-effects odds ratio of 1.38 (95 percent CI: 0.89, 2.15) for Alzheimer s disease compared with subjects not carrying the T allele. Among subjects not carrying the APOE*4 allele, the respective odds ratio was 1.13 (95 percent CI: 0.90, 1.42). There was significant between-study heterogeneity in the APOE*4-positive group (p = 0.07). The two effect sizes overlapped widely..
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	44	Among carriers of the T allele, the presence of APOE*4 increased the risk of Alzheimer s disease 6.07-fold (95 percent CI: 4.19, 8.79), with no between-study heterogeneity. Among subjects without the T allele, the presence of APOE*4 increased the risk of Alzheimer s disease 4.09-fold (95 percent CI: 3.15, 5.31), with significant between-study heterogeneity (p  <  0.01). The two estimates overlapped widely in individual studies and overall, but typically the odds ratios were larger in the group of T allele carriers (figure 2)..

Cathepsin D is an intracellular acid protease with beta-secretase activity in vitro (1, 2) that can cleave amyloid precursor protein and the tau protein to generate fragments with intact microtubule-binding domains (44), which might play a role in the pathogenesis of paired helical filaments. One study has shown that the CTSD polymorphism is associated with increased secretion and altered intracellular maturation of procathepsin D (3). It should be noted that it is not clear whether the CTSD polymorphism has functional consequences for the mature form of the enzyme. Although we cannot exclude a biologic effect for the CTSD polymorphism, our findings are in accordance with the results of a recent full genome scan showing no significant linkage of Alzheimer s disease to the short arm of chromosome 11, the region where the CTSD gene is located (45 to 47)..

However, some young control subjects may have developed Alzheimer s disease at older ages. The choice of an appropriate age window for assessing a postulated genetic risk factor for Alzheimer s disease is difficult.

Our analyses addressed interactions with APOE*4, the major known genetic determinant of Alzhei-mer s disease. Interactions with other genetic or environmental factors have not been studied. The trend for a stronger effect of APOE*4 in the presence of T allele carriage is interesting in the light of data suggesting that T carriage may affect the general intelligence (5). However, subgroup and interaction analyses should be interpreted cautiously, since differences between subgroups may occur by chance (49) and their validation would require studies with even larger sample sizes than the several thousand included in this meta-analysis. Finally, population stratification may theoretically have affected the results of the constituent studies in the meta-analysis (50), since we documented that the frequency of the T allele varied considerably among the different ethnic groups or even among the different ethnic groups of European descent. However, most studies were strictly ethnically defined, so the population stratification effect is unlikely to have been of any considerable magnitude..

Thus, the list of identified polymorphisms that may influence the risk of Alzheimer s disease is continuously expanding (23, 29), but most of the reported associations of candidate genes to date remain nonreplicated or at least controversial after subsequent investigation. Early and small genetic association studies may come up with spurious findings (41, 51, 52). Even when genetic associations are replicated, usually they do not have a major public health impact that would lead to screening recommendations (53).

All participants were cognitively normal in 1991 when they completed a risk factor questionnaire.

The analysis included 194 Alzheimer s disease cases and 3,894 cognitively normal controls. Increasing age, fewer years of education, and the apolipoprotein E 4 allele were significantly associated with increased risk of Alzheimer s disease. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, wine consumption, coffee consumption, and regular physical activity were associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer s disease. No statistically significant association was found for family history of dementia, sex, history of depression, estrogen replacement therapy, head trauma, antiperspirant or antacid use, smoking, high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke. The protective associations warrant further study. In particular, regular physical activity could be an important component of a preventive strategy against Alzheimer s disease and many other conditions..

Its impact on health services and society is of increasing concern to health policy makers and service providers as life expectancy increases and, more particularly, as the baby-boom generation ages. Among Canadians aged 65 years or older, Alzheimer s disease accounts for almost two thirds of prevalent cases of dementia (1). The majority of epidemiologic studies of risk factors for Alzheimer s disease to date have been retrospective case-control studies that compared prevalent Alzheimer s disease cases with nondemented controls (2). Retrospective studies are subject to methodological problems including survival bias and recall bias. In addition, collecting very detailed exposure information is difficult because the information must be obtained from proxies (3). Some risk or protective factors for Alzheimer s disease suggested in prevalence studies, such as family history of dementia, have not been upheld in prospective studies..

The EURODEM group also found that female sex and low educational level were associated with increased risks of Alzheimer s disease. Conversely, sex and education were not reported as risk factors for incident Alzheimer s disease in other studies (7, 8).

Next, a physician conducted a standardized physical and neurologic examination. Finally, for those participants deemed testable (a 3MS Examination score of 50 or above), a psychometrist administered a series of neuropsychological tests (16), which were interpreted later by a neuropsychologist..

Family history of Alzheimer s disease or senile dementia was not associated with late-onset Alzheimer s disease. Those participants who had at least one APOE4 allele had 3.28 times the risk of Alzheimer s disease compared with those who had two 3 alleles. Of the antecedent or coexisting chronic conditions included in the risk factor questionnaire, only arthritis was significantly related to a reduced risk of Alzheimer s disease. No statistically significant relation was observed between Alzheimer s disease risk and high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease, depression, head trauma, diabetes, thyroid condition, cancer (any type), or stomach ulcer. Use of NSAIDs reduced the risk of Alzheimer s disease by 35 percent. This effect was due mostly to nonsalicylates. Inclusion of both NSAID use and arthritis along with age, sex, and education in the same model yielded similar odds ratio estimates; both factors remained protective for Alzheimer s disease, while testing of the interaction between NSAIDs and arthritis was not significant (p = 0.10). No association of Alzheimer s disease with antihypertensive agents, antacids, corticosteroids, or estrogen therapy was found..

The CSHA-1 case-control study found an increased risk of Alzheimer s disease that increased significantly by two- to threefold for family history of dementia (10). However, as in the EURODEM pooled data set (3), the prospective analysis of CSHA data did not find this association. These contradictory findings might reflect misclassification of the information because of recall bias and/or the uncertainty of information collected with the help of informants in retrospective investigations compared with longitudinal studies. In a case-control study, Mayeux et al.

Thus, it would seem reasonable that we did not observe this association in our older cohort. It may be surprising that family history of dementia was not associated with Alzheimer s disease while an increased risk of Alzheimer s disease was observed for subjects who had the APOE4 allele, since family history of dementia is believed to be a potential indicator of this genetic factor.

Whether the risk of Alzheimer s disease associated with less education corresponds to an artifact or represents a true risk factor is still unclear.

Intriguing protective associations observed in our study warrant further research. Few preventive strategies for Alzheimer s disease have been explored. Regular physical activity could represent a novel and safe preventive strategy against Alzheimer s disease and many other conditions, and it should be examined further..

Potential for discrimination does not by any means stop here. A particular difficulty they highlight is the central role of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) instrument in determining treatment  eligibility  and response. Scores on the MMSE are strongly influenced by previous education and cross-cultural validity is poor. The guidelines are, therefore, unhelpful for people with lower educational attainment or for growing numbers of older people from minority ethnic groups in the UK. Comorbid cerebrovascular disease will also be more frequent in people from more disadvantaged backgrounds and, in particular, minority ethnic groups such as African Caribbean populations (Stewart et al, 1999). This reduces the likelihood of a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (and therefore eligibility for anti-cholinesterase treatment) according to standard diagnostic criteria (McKhann et al, 1984), despite growing evidence for overlapping pathological processes in dementia (Holmes et al, 1999)..

The US study population comprised 3,375 men and women aged 65 years or older, free of dementia at baseline, who participated in the Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study in 1992 to 2000. Leisure-time energy expenditure and an activity index reflecting number of different physical activities were calculated. Analyses were based on Cox proportional hazards models. There were 480 incident cases of dementia over an average of 5.4 years of follow-up. After multivariate adjustment, participants in the highest quartile of physical energy expenditure had a relative risk of dementia of 0.85 (95% confidence interval: 0.61, 1.19) compared with those in the lowest quartile, and participants engaging in 4 activities had a relative risk of dementia of 0.51 (95% confidence interval: 0.33, 0.79) compared with those engaging in 0 to 1 activity. These associations were more marked in apolipoprotein E genotype (APOE) 4 allele noncarriers but were absent in carriers. A similar pattern was observed for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.

An estimated 1.9 to 4 million persons are currently living with Alzheimer's disease, the most common type of dementia, in the United States alone (1). Unless an effective preventive strategy is realized, the number of dementia cases is expected to expand as the number of persons living into later decades continues to increase (2). Advancing age, family history of dementia, educational level, and presence of the apolipoprotein E genotype (APOE) 4 allele remain the only established risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (3)..

Physical activity may preserve neuronal plasticity, increase synapses and dendritic receptors following injury, and release hormonal factors that may assist in neuronal creation and function (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, epinephrine) (4). In addition, physical activity lowers cardiovascular risk, decreases blood pressure, and increases high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and glucose tolerance (5), each of which may be related to neuronal integrity and cognitive function (6, 7). Finally, engaging in physical activity may indicate a more enriched social environment, which may decrease dementia risk (8)..

Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from whole-blood samples and was amplified by using polymerase chain reaction. After cleaving and electrophoresis on agarose gels, restriction patterns were determined according to the methods of Hixson and Vernier (33). APOE genotypes were grouped as APOE 4 carriers (2/4, 3/4, 4/4 genotypes) and noncarriers (2/2, 2/3, 3/3 genotypes)..

Sociodemographic variables included age, gender, educational level, and ethnicity. Information on smoking, alcohol intake, and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy use was self-reported. Prevalent cases of myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and congestive heart failure at baseline were ascertained by participant self-report of a physician's diagnosis. Functional impairment was measured by using a modified version of the instrument for assessing basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living from the National Health Interview Survey (34). Social network was assessed by using the Lubben Social Network Scale (35), and a series of questions asking participants about life satisfaction and personal relationships was summed to represent a measure of social support. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (36) was administered at CHCS baseline, and a more sensitive version of the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) Examination (37), was administered annually. The 3MS assesses several domains of cognition in greater detail than the Mini-Mental State Examination does, with scores ranging from 0 to 100; higher scores reflect better performance. If a person did not receive a clinical evaluation, attempts were made to evaluate cognition by using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (38). For participants who died between examinations, further information was obtained by using the Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (39) and data concerning circumstances of death..

Persons with more developed social networks have a lower risk of all-cause mortality than persons who are socially isolated, and social supports attenuate the rate of cognitive decline in older adults (51). Social networks may also promote overall health, particularly cardiovascular risk factors, and thereby may impact dementia risk. Similarly, involvement in physical activities is associated with mastery and self-efficacy (52). In turn, these attributes may motivate persons to be more attentive to health needs and health behaviors. We adjusted for social network and social support in multivariate models, however, and the activity index continued to be associated with dementia risk. If physical activity is operating through social mechanisms, it appears to be at a level not captured by these two measures of social functioning..

Both organizational, or executive, and memory processes are regulated by neuroanatomical regions adversely affected by aging and dementing illnesses. Exercising may help buffer or preserve cognitive reserves in the face of cognitive decline via continued use and corresponding cortical and synaptic stimulation of intact neurons (53). In cross-sectional studies, variety of lifestyle activities has been positively associated with indices of cognition among nondemented older women, particularly in the domain of memory (M. Carlson, The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, unpublished manuscript)..

Similarly, our findings suggest differing risk patterns between dementia and physical activity by APOE genotype, and they imply that any potential protective effect associated with physical activity is not enough to overcome the effect of APOE 4 alleles, or that physical activity and dementia are simply unrelated in persons with APOE 4 genotypes. However, our findings contrast with a previous study in which an inverse association between physical activity and cognitive decline was observed predominantly in APOE 4 carriers (13). It is difficult to know whether these findings extend to dementia; not all elderly persons who experience cognitive decline progress to clinical dementia. We note, however, that the interaction between physical activity and APOE 4 in this study was based on only 28 cases of cognitive decline and was thus subject to considerable variability. Replication of these findings in larger studies will be required to resolve this apparent discrepancy..

We were able to assess physical activity levels during older adult life only, but it is unclear during what period of life physical activity is most relevant to preserving cognition and impacting dementia risk. Our finding that number of activities has a stronger association with dementia risk than does kilocalorie expenditure may be an artifact of measurement. Reliability of the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity Questionnaire may be lower at low-to-moderate levels of activity (57), levels at which most older adults participate. It is therefore possible that number of activities may be a more sensitive indicator at these levels. Furthermore, persons with established physical activity habits may be more precise in their recall than persons who exercise sporadically. Similarly, recall of number of activities may be more reliable than specifics about exercise frequency and duration, both factors heavily weighted in calculating total energy expenditure. In this sample, number of activities was significantly and positively correlated with total physical activity energy expenditure. Understanding which components of physical activity reduce dementia risk deserves further attention..

We addressed this possibility by using several different approaches. First, we excluded all persons with a 3MS score of less than 80 or with prevalent dementia at baseline. However, it is possible that the 3MS is not sensitive enough to detect persons with subclinical dementing illness and that some of these persons were included in our study. Second, we adjusted our analyses for baseline cognitive function, and the inverse association of number of physical activities with dementia risk persisted. Third, we reran the analysis by excluding persons who developed incident dementia within the first year of the follow-up, and the results were essentially unchanged. Furthermore, we used information on physical activity from two time points approximately 5 years apart to obtain a more stable estimate of regular physical activity in older adulthood prior to dementia onset. Finally, we also evaluated the association of physical activity with dementia risk after excluding persons who had one or more difficulties in activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living; again, the results were similar..

Physical activity is already recommended to enhance cardiovascular health and help maintain independence and quality of life in older adults (52).

A total of 25 case-control and cohort studies that reported an odds ratio/relative risk were included. Study-specific log relative risks were weighted by the inverse of their variances to obtain pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. The authors divided the reports into studies with prevalent dementia cases, studies with incident dementia cases, and studies where cognitive decline was used as the clinical endpoint. The pooled relative risks of the three groups of studies were 0.51 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.37, 0.70), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.92), and 1.23 (95% CI: 0.70, 2.31), respectively. Within these subgroups, heterogeneity was present only in the studies with prevalent cases (p = 0.001). Because the benefit of NSAIDs in preventing dementia or cognitive impairment was 50% in studies with prevalent dementia cases, declined to 20% in studies with incident dementia cases, and was absent in studies where cognitive decline was used as the endpoint, the authors conclude that most of the reported beneficial effects of NSAIDs may result from various forms of bias: recall bias, prescription bias, and publication bias..

0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	12	Data were independently extracted from each study by two reviewers (A. J. M. C. and J. G.) using preprinted forms. We recorded study design, characteristics of exposure, definitions of cases and controls, prevalent or incident case ascertainment, total number of cases in the exposed group and total number of cases in the unexposed group, the measure of association (odds ratio, relative risk, or hazard ratio), the magnitude of the association with its corresponding 95 percent confidence interval, and the variables adjusted for in the analysis. When separate results were reported within one study for both Alzheimer s disease and dementia, the results for dementia were recorded. When varying levels of NSAID use were reported, we took the results for the largest group of NSAID users..
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	13	Statistical analysis Results of cohort studies were typically expressed as relative risk or hazard ratio, while results of case-control studies were usually expressed as odds ratio. A hazard ratio is the ratio of instantaneous probability of the outcome event (Alzheimer s disease, dementia, or cognitive decline) in the exposed group compared with that in the nonexposed group and can be considered a relative risk. Because dementia is a rare event ( < 5 percent), odds ratios from case-control studies are also good estimates for the relative risk. For simplicity, we refer to relative risk for all three types of measures of association. The logarithm of the relative risk with its corresponding standard error, taken directly from the studies or calculated from the reported 95 percent confidence interval, provided the data points for the meta-analysis. We used the DerSimonian and Laird (36) random effects model to compute pooled relative risks and to assess statistical heterogeneity. We did not exclude outliers simply on the basis of the statistical test, because heterogeneity is expected in a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies, but we searched for the sources (i.e., methodological or biologic). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were carried out when appropriate. We evaluated publication bias by means of visual inspection of funnel plots and formal statistical testing (37). In a funnel plot, the relative risk of the study is displayed against the weight of the study, which is the inverse of the square of the standard error. Funnel plots generally show a peak. This is the point where the studies with smaller standard errors are found and usually represents the point of the approximate true effect. Formal statistical assessment of funnel plot asymmetry was done with linear regression analysis, where the log odds ratio divided by its standard error was regressed against the inverse of the standard error (37). Reported p values are from the intercept of the regression analysis, which provides a measure of asymmetry. Case-control studies with incident dementia cases and cohort studies were classified as studies with incident cases. Studies where cognition was the main outcome of interest among users and nonusers of NSAIDs were classified as studies with cognitive decline cases..

The funnel plot (figure 1) shows the relative risks of the 25 studies plotted against their weights. A relative risk smaller than one indicates that use of NSAIDs is beneficial. The pooled relative risks of these three groups of studies were 0.51 (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 0.37, 0.70) for studies with prevalent dementia cases, 0.79 (95 percent CI: 0.68, 0.92) for studies with incident dementia cases, and 1.23 (95 percent CI: 0.70, 2.31) for studies with cognitive decline as the endpoint. Within these subgroups, heterogeneity was present in the studies with prevalent cases (p = 0.001) but not in the studies with incident cases (p = 0.60). Statistical testing for heterogeneity of studies where cognitive decline was used as the endpoint gave a p value of 0.08. Within the three subgroups, there was an indication for the presence of publication bias in the studies with prevalent cases (p = 0.04), whereas there was no indication in the studies with incident cases (p = 0.96) or in the studies where cognitive decline was used as the endpoint (p = 0.38)..

0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	24	There are at least three forms of bias that could explain why the benefit from NSAIDs was larger in studies with prevalent cases than in studies with incident cases: recall bias, prescription bias, and publication bias. First, subjects from studies with prevalent cases have impaired memory at the time of study, which makes data collection between cases and controls likely to be different, resulting in recall bias. Second, prescription bias occurs more frequently in studies with prevalent cases because demented patients have a reduced perception of pain (38, 39), possibly leading to a reduced use of NSAIDs. Moreover, because of the adverse effects of NSAIDs, physicians might be less inclined to prescribe NSAIDs to demented subjects. Hence, in the studies with prevalent cases, the reduced intake of NSAIDs might be more the consequence of the dementia than the cause. Third, it is apparent from the funnel plot that the studies with prevalent cases are more heterogeneous and more skewed to the left than the follow-up studies, resulting in larger pooled estimates of benefit of NSAID use in these studies..

Third, it is apparent from the funnel plot that the studies with prevalent cases are more heterogeneous and more skewed to the left than the follow-up studies, resulting in larger pooled estimates of benefit of NSAID use in these studies..

However, a total number of 10 studies to investigate the presence of recall bias is rather small. Therefore, the interpretation of the absence of a significant difference between the two types of design with incident dementia cases should be interpreted with caution..

Within these 10 studies, there were four case-control studies with incident dementia cases and six cohort studies. Both types of study gave a similar pooled estimate of relative risk. If recall bias was a major form of bias, the relative risk of the case-control studies should have been smaller. However, because of the wide confidence intervals around both estimates (because of the small number of studies), it is difficult to ascertain whether the studies truly had equal estimates..

Prescription bias might also be the cause of this difference. Incident subjects with cognitive decline will be relatively free from cognitive dysfunction at baseline, while incident cases with dementia are in a relatively later stage of the disease. In the earlier stages of the disease, prescription bias might not be present. To explore whether prescription bias is the cause of the observed association between NSAID use and Alzheimer s disease or whether there is a true beneficial effect, we decided upon randomized clinical trials whose patients were without early signs of Alzheimer s disease (40)..

With a short period between exposure and outcome, reduced intake of NSAIDs among subjects with dementia could also be the consequence of the disease. Four studies (14, 16, 20, 26) tried to avoid this bias by evaluating the use of acetaminophen, to control for differing patterns of drug use between demented and nondemented subjects. Many authors argued that, because the demented and nondemented subjects did not differ in their acetaminophen use but did vary in their NSAID use, NSAIDs must be associated with better cognitive function. We think, however, that, in demented patients who might report less pain than nondemented subjects, NSAIDs are the first drugs to be prescribed less frequently. This means that studies with prevalent cases are more likely to suffer from prescription bias than studies with incident cases..

For example, the Canadian Study of Health and Aging and the Rotterdam Study both contributed two publications. However, in both cases, one publication addressed the association in the prevalent dementia cases and the other publication addressed the association in the incident dementia cases. Hence, we decided to include both articles in our analyses. Moreover, the study named Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly consists of four cohorts. In our analyses, we used estimates reported from the separate cohorts. The study reported by Saag et al. (27) uses data from the Iowa cohort, while Hanlon et al. (28) use data from the Duke cohort. The study reported by Rozzini et al. (5) uses data from the East Boston, Massachusetts, New Haven, Connecticut, and Iowa cohorts. In discussing their results, Rozzini et al. indicate that the study by Saag et al. is "substantially different in measure of cognitive functioning and analytical approach, ... making comparability between that study and our study problematic" (5, p. 1029). Including the study by Rozzini et al. in our analyses would have overweighted the data of the Iowa cohort in the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly. We could have chosen to include the study reported by Rozzini et al. in our analyses instead of the study by Saag et al. This would have resulted in a lower pooled relative risk. However, including the study reported by Rozzini et al. instead of the study by Saag et al. does not affect our interpretation of the data..

Hence, we cannot exclude that NSAIDs might have a beneficial effect on a specific cognitive domain. However, on average, the effect of use of NSAIDs on cognitive decline is null, which is consistent with the finding that most randomized trials so far have shown: no beneficial effect on the course of dementia as measured with the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer s Disease Assessment Scale. Moreover, the two studies that were excluded from our meta-analysis (2, 3) because a relative risk could not be extracted both showed no association between use of NSAID and cognitive decline..

0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	40	A recent meta-analysis of NSAIDs and risk of dementia concluded, "NSAIDs offer some protection against the development of Alzheimer s disease" (41, p. 128). This conclusion was based mainly on the observation that short-term users ( < 1 month) had far less risk reduction than long-term users ( > 24 months) (relative risk = 0.95 vs. 0.27, respectively). These authors did not address possible confounding factors (42), nor did they explain the discrepancy between the studies with prevalent cases and the studies with incident cases. Again, the discrepancy in risk reduction between short-term and long-term users can well be explained by recall bias and prescription bias. By including studies with cognitive decline as the endpoint and thereby creating more distance between exposure and effect, we now demonstrate that bias and confounding are more likely explanations for the observed association..
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	41	Traditional teaching holds Alzheimer s disease and vascular dementia as two separate clinical entities that can be differentiated by careful clinical and necropsy evaluation. Several recent observations, however, suggest that the situation might be different. Vascular risk factors also contribute to Alzheimer s disease (43) and, conversely, ss-amyloid depositions are also frequently found in subjects with vascular dementia (44). Hence, it is likely that Alzheimer s disease and vascular dementia are two extreme expressions of one disease entity, dementia (45). A prominent feature of both disease entities is progressive cognitive decline. Hence, combining and comparing the various endpoints in one analysis gives a good indication for the possible benefits of NSAIDs in the various stages of the disease..

There might be three explanations for these negative studies. First, there is no protective effect of NSAIDs. Second, most of these studies were carried out in subjects with early signs of cognitive impairment. Administration of antiinflammatory drugs at that point in the disease process might simply be too late. Third, it has recently been demonstrated that various NSAIDs have differential propensities on the inflammatory response and deposition of ss-amyloid (46). This finding calls for identification of the critical pathways in the inflammatory response and the corresponding drugs that are capable of interfering in that pathway..

This indicates that most of the beneficial effects of NSAIDs from observational studies are likely to be the result of recall bias, prescription bias, and publication bias. Before further large and costly trials are designed to assess the potential protective effects of NSAIDS, the specific critical pathways in the inflammatory process in dementia amendable to drug intervention should be identified..

Family studies revealed that more than one-third of the DAT cases are members of one hamula (tribal group) within Wadi Ara. To map chromosomal loci contributing to DAT susceptibility, we conducted a 10 cM scan in a series of five cases and five controls selected from this hamula. Markers from 18 chromosomal regions showed significant allelic association with DAT (P < 0.05). Locations on chromosomes 2, 9 and 10 remained significant after testing additional affected and non-demented individuals. Significant associations were also observed for markers on chromosome 12 which overlap with a locus implicated in previous genome scans. Analysis of allele frequency distributions for 12 markers spanning 20 cM on chromosome 9 narrowed the possible location of an DAT susceptibility gene to a 13 cM interval between D9S157 and D9S259 (most significant result: P=2.3x10-7). Analysis of 14 markers spanning 24 cM on chromosome 12 narrowed the possible location to a 14 cM interval distal to the LRP1 locus (most significant result: P=1.3x10-6). Evidence for linkage on chromosome 9 stemmed primarily from excess homozygosity of marker alleles in cases compared with controls, suggesting that the gene at this location behaves in either a recessive or additive fashion. The unique characteristics of this community together with the emergent human genome data should allow for the rapid identification of DAT genes in these candidate regions..

AD usually begins after age 65 however, its onset may occur as early as age 30. The early-onset forms of the disease appear to have a strong genetic component, and mutations in several genes have been identified including the amyloid precursor gene (APP; 104760), presenilin-1 (PSEN1; 104311), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2; 600759)..

0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	8	The basis of the more common, late-onset form of AD is less well understood. The genetic risk factor with the highest attributable risk for AD is the 4 allele of the APOE gene on chromosome 19q (1). Among Caucasians, the odds of AD for 4 homozygotes and for 3/4 heterozygotes are 14.9 and 3.2, respectively, greater than that associated with 3 homozygotes (2). Many other genes have been studied because of the possible role of their gene products in the disease, or because of their proximity to known AD loci. The evidence implicating other susceptibility genes is much less compelling. Associations have been reported for no fewer than 40 genes (3,4), yet none has been clearly established as an AD risk factor. Linkage studies have implicated regions on chromosomes 9 (5), 10 (6 to 8), and 12 (9 to 11). Candidate genes in these regions include insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) on chromosome 10 and 2-macroglobulin (A2M) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related gene (LRP1) on chromosome 12 (8,12,13), although none has been proven to be an AD gene (14 to 17)..

0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	10	In this report, we examined the genetic basis of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) in a unique community. In a population based study, we screened all residents ages 60 years and older (n=821) of Wadi Ara, an Arab community near Tel-Aviv in northern Israel and observed a prevalence higher than that found in Israel, China, Europe or the USA, even after adjustment for age, education and gender (18,19). This unusually high prevalence is apparently not due to an increased frequency of the APOE 4 allele, which is actually reduced in this community (0.02 for non-demented elders) as compared with other Caucasians (20). We hypothesized that the increased prevalence of DAT in Wadi Ara is associated with a limited number of unique susceptibility alleles whose frequency was enriched by inbreeding. The current residents of Wadi Ara are members of 14 hamulas (family groups). Until recently, there has been minimal immigration or emigration from the community. We designed and carried out an efficient 10 cM genome scan by exploiting the unique population structure. Results of this study confirm the existence of DAT loci on chromosomes 9, 10 and 12 and provide evidence for a new DAT locus on chromosome 2..

The genetic hypothesis was bolstered by examination of 187 pedigrees showing a smaller number of surnames in those families containing DAT cases than in those without DAT cases. In fact, more than one-third of the 168 prevalent DAT cases were from one of the 14 hamulas. Despite the large concentration of DAT cases in this hamula, few individual pedigrees contained more than one living affected member. Therefore, traditional family-based linkage study approaches were not feasible. However, given the high degree of inbreeding in Wadi Ara evidenced by frequent first-cousin and second-cousin marriages, and the limited number of founders, we reasoned that prevalent DAT susceptibility alleles may be identical by descent and, therefore, frequency distributions of alleles or genotypes for markers linked to an DAT locus would differ between DAT cases and controls. A 10 cM genome scan was conducted by genotyping 375 markers from the ABI genome scan panel in DNAs from five DAT cases (ages 68 to 85 years) and five non-demented controls (ages 63 to 85 years) from different families in the hamula with the highest disease prevalence. Markers at 18 linkage regions on 13 different chromosomes showed a significant difference in the allele frequency distribution between DAT cases and controls (Table 1). In many instances, the difference was not attributable to a specific allele. There was no evidence for either excess marker homozygosity in cases compared with controls or association at the genotype level..

Results which remained significant in the enlarged sample were pursued by analysis of additional markers flanking the positive signals. Significant allelic association remained for locations on chromosomes 2, 9 and 10 only (Fig. 1). We also genotyped several markers in a region on chromosome 12 implicated in other linkage studies (5,9,10,11), but not in our genome scan, and evidence of allelic association was also found at this location (Fig. 1)..

0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	19	On chromosome 9, significant allelic association was observed with four markers located in the interval between 32 and 45 cM (Fig. 1). The associations with three of these markers (D9S925, D9S9162 and D9S259) were due to over-representation of a specific allele. Further examination revealed significant excess homozygosity of these marker alleles and a marker allele at D9S171 in DAT cases compared with non-demented subjects (Table 2). The observation of alleles with sizes 244 bp or greater in 16.5% of DAT cases but in none of the controls contributed to the highly significant association at AFM220XF2 (P=2.3x10-7)..

Evidence for an additive or recessive AD locus on chromosome 9   Taking into account the results from the genome scan and previous linkage studies, we evaluated intensively a 90 cM interval on chromosome 10 (Fig. 1). Although significant allelic associations were observed with markers located in separate linkage groups [e.g. D10S1426 @ 59 cM (P=0.007), D10S1225 @ 80.8 cM (P < 0.02), D10S1765 @ 108.8 cM (P=0.004)], the most conservative conclusion is that an DAT susceptibility gene is located in the interval between 105 cM and 115.3 cM which contains four contiguous markers (D10S1686, D10S1765, D10S1753 and D10S583) showing evidence for allelic association (Fig. 1) and genotypic association involving carriers of the associated allele (data not shown). Concomitant allelic and genotypic association was observed for only two other chromosome 10 markers (D10S1426 and D10S208)..

The history of this region suggests that the residents of this community were descendants of a small number of founder individuals. Since then, it has remained a relatively closed society with a high degree of consanguinity. Because only 10 distantly related individuals (five DAT cases and five non-demented controls) from one extended kindred were genotyped, this approach is both efficient and economical relying, of course, on the assumption that the genes contributing to DAT in Wadi Ara are identical by descent and prevalent among affected members. The genome scan with 375 microsatellite markers revealed evidence of association (P < 0.05) with 18 locations, however, after testing additional markers in a larger number of people, only association to chromosomes 2, 9 and 10 remained..

Motivated by linkage findings from previous studies of outbred populations, we genotyped many closely spaced markers in the region adjacent and distal to LRP1 and observed significant association with DAT. Careful inspection of the results from the genome scan revealed that two of the markers flanking the linked region (D12S83 at 76.5 cM and D12S351 at 96.7 cM) failed to show association in the genome scan or the follow up (Fig. 1). Unfortunately, the genotyping assay for the one marker in this interval (D12S326 at 81.6 cM) which yielded a very significant result in the follow-up analysis failed in the genome scan, thus accounting for the false-negative result for this locus. The large number of alleles per locus (Table 3) may have further increased the false-negative rate. These observations illustrate a potentially serious limitation of a 10 cM genome scan using few subjects. Nonetheless, this strategy successfully detected the loci on chromosomes 2, 9 and 10..

Polymorphism characteristics among markers in the regions showing linkage   Results of this study attest to the utility of genetic isolates, including those from this region of the Middle East (23 to 25), for mapping genes responsible for disease susceptibility in outbred Caucasian populations. Our strategy, evaluating linkage disequilibrium between microsatellite marker alleles and DAT, differs from traditional linkage approaches in genetic isolates in several respects. First, we focused our efforts on regions identified by a genome scan including only 10 individuals. Second, the DAT patients in the current cohort, all purportedly descendants from 14 founder matings, are members of distinct pedigrees. Gene mapping designs which rely on linkage or family-based association approaches (23 to 25) are thus not suitable for our situation in which relationships between individuals in the sample are distant or unclear. Third, although the efficacy of linkage disequilibrium mapping in isolated founder populations for recessive traits was demonstrated by Hastbacka and colleagues (26), the efficacy of this approach has not been proven for complex traits. Notably, the allele-frequency-dependent homozygosity mapping method, which enabled the localization of a gene for recessive deafness in Bali using only 13 affected individuals (27), does not require evaluation of DNA from parents and is thus perhaps well suited to the Wadi Ara population, however, it is effectively limited to recessive traits..

The marker on chromosome 2 showing the most significant association with DAT (D2S305) is located about 6 to 10 cM from two markers showing linkage disequilibrium in the case to control sample from Finland (28). The chromosome 9 location overlaps with peaks observed in two other studies with overlapping data sets (5,29) and the chromosome 10 location with several other studies (7,8,29,30). While we detected evidence of association to chromosome 12 in this population, the precise region is 20 to 35 cM distal to the linkage peaks observed by others (9 to 11,22,31). Thus, it is unclear if the region we identified on chromosome 12 is the same as that reported in other studies..

One or more of the loci might represent a false-positive result, although as discussed above all four loci correspond to approximate locations identified in studies of other populations. A more likely explanation is the unfortunate aggregation of multiple susceptibility loci in a single community. Such heterogeneity is consistent with the remarkably high prevalence of DAT in Wadi Ara (18). Alternatively, the high prevalence of DAT can be explained by an oligogenic mode of transmission requiring coincident inheritance of susceptibility alleles at multiple loci. Discrimination among these hypotheses will require simultaneous examination of marker haplotypes or, preferably, the actual susceptibility alleles from each locus in groups of affected and non-demented individuals..

0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	34	While Wadi Ara has one of the highest prevalence rates of DAT in the world (18), the very low frequency of the APOE 4 allele in both non-demented individuals (2.4%) and DAT cases (3.6%) indicates that the genetic basis of the disorder in this population is due entirely to other loci (20). A low impact of APOE on AD risk has been reported in Yoruba living in Nigeria, but the baseline frequency of 4 is more than 20% and the incidence of AD is low (33,34). In contrast, Pericak-Vance and colleagues observed only the APOE 3/3 genotype among AD cases in the Amish, an inbred religious sect (35). However, the Amish have a lower prevalence of dementia than Wadi Ara and even most outbred Caucasian populations of European origin. Non-genetic factors including diet, low levels of education and physical activity may also be partly responsible for the high prevalence of the disease in Wadi Ara (36)..

Alternatively, the large number of alleles may be due to the relative instability of microsatellilte markers from generation to generation. Interestingly, substantial marker polymorphism was also observed in a study of AD in 98 members from a genetic isolate in Finland (28). In the Finnish study, global tests for allelic association were significant at the 0.05 level for 21 out of 366 markers tested genome-wide, but two-thirds of these regions were not confirmed by follow-up analysis with additional linked markers. The very high proportion of marker heterozygosity, while perhaps enabling the detection of individual marker association, hindered meaningful haplotype analysis because without parental data to establish linkage phase the power for estimating haplotypes in this sample is poor, even with the assistance of maximum likelihood approaches (37). A more efficacious strategy for assessing linkage disequilibrium over small intervals defined by haplotypes and, ultimately, for identifying candidate genes, is the evaluation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)..

APOB is the main apolipoprotein of chylomicrons and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and is important for lipid and cholesterol metabolism. ADAM17 is a disintegrin-metalloprotease that is responsible for S2 cleavage of NOTCH1. This cleavage makes NOTCH1 susceptible to cleavage by a gamma-secretase-like protease, leading to activation of the notch pathway (38). This is analogous to the action of presenilins that also act through the notch pathway. The peak on chromosome 10 between D10S1686 and D10S583 includes several genes previously associated with AD including cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) which encodes a membrane protein that synthesizes oxysterol regulators of lipid metabolism (39), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a neutral metalloproteinase and has been shown to degrade beta-amyloid (40), an important protein found in the plaques seen in AD, and urinary plasminogen activator (PLAU), a protease that converts plasminogen to plasmin and is elevated in AD patients (41)..

Exact tests were used to evaluate associations in the genome scan and global 2 tests were used in follow-up studies in the enlarged sample. Because the number of alleles and genotypes for these microsatellite markers far exceeded that expected for genetic isolate (as many as 19 alleles and 60 genotypes), the frequency distributions for all global tests were inspected visually to suggest one or two single-allele and collapsed-genotype group tests. All reported significant P-values (P0.05) are based on these latter tests, unless indicated otherwise, and are not adjusted for multiple testing. To correct for testing multiple markers on the same chromosome in the follow-up studies, P-values were transformed to lod scores using the equivalence.

Hereditary influences were actually discounted because of a high monozygotic twin discordance rate found in studies that were later shown to be inadequate and inconclusive. There has recently been a resurgence of interest in investigating hereditary factors in PD when it became more and more apparent that a positive family history was a major risk factor for the disease. Meanwhile, it also became increasingly apparent from neuropathological studies that the common, idiopathic form of Parkinson's disease had, in fact, a pathological correlate, i.e., the existence of Lewy bodies, an eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion body, distributed diffusely throughout the substnatia nigra, hypothalamus, hippocampus, autonomic ganglia and olfactory tracts. Although candidate gene approaches to linkage in PD families have not been rewarding, a genome wide scan mapped PD to 4q21-23 in one large family with PD with diffuse Lewy bodies, where a candidate gene, [alpha]-synuclein, resides. This gene encodes a presynaptic protein of which a peptide fragment is known to be a constituent of Alzheimer's disease plaques. The identification of a missense mutation in the [alpha]-synuclein gene in four independent PD families suggests that at least some fraction of familial PD with diffuse Lewy bodies is the result of an abnormal protein that interferes with normal protein degradation leading to the development of inclusions and ultimately neuronal cell death. There may be common pathogenetic mechanisms involved in [alpha]-synuclein mutations in PD and [beta]-amyloid and presenilin gene mutations in Alzheimer's disease. INTRODUCTION.

0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	6	The first factor was a lack of agreement on precisely what constitutes `typical' PD and whether familial forms of the disease are the `real' PD or not. This attitude is typified by one medical school professor who, during hospital rounds with a colleague of ours, asserted that a lack of family history was a diagnostic criterion for PD. As a result, research into PD that emphasized familial forms of the disease was seen to be off the mark and not directed at real PD. The idea that there was little or no genetic contribution to the etiology of PD was strengthened by a series of twin studies (3 -6 ) during the 1980s that failed to demonstrate increased concordance rates for PD in monozygotic versus dizygotic twins..

This attitude is typified by one medical school professor who, during hospital rounds with a colleague of ours, asserted that a lack of family history was a diagnostic criterion for PD.

Much of the research community's energies and efforts became focused on identifying the nature and effects of environmental agents thought to be responsible for causing the disease. The 1918 influenza pandemic associated with encephalitis lethargica and, as a late sequela, post-encephalitic PD, pointed to viral infection as a major cause for PD (7 ). The significance of this association seemed so strong at one point that one investigator suggested that PD would disappear by 1980 as a clinical entity as the survivors of the pandemic grew old and died (7 ). Other strong support for an environmental cause for PD was the occurrence of irreversible symptoms and signs of PD occurring after the injection of illicit drug preparations contaminated with N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (8 ,9 ). MPTP metabolites interfere with complex I of the electron transport chain, thus depleting cells of the products of oxidative phosphorylation and exposing the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra to irreversible damage from energy depletion and oxidative stress from free radicals (2 ,10 )..

Duvoisin and Z. Wszolek. As a result, there is currently much more research investigating the role of heredity and gene-environment interactions in causing PD. Rather than choosing between the false dichotomy of an exclusive environmental or genetic etiology, geneticists are attempting a synthesis of the epidemiological and genetic data by focusing on three areas of inquiry: (i) inherited and somatic mitochondrial genome abnormalities causing defects in energy metabolism; (ii) candidate gene linkage and association studies of genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes; (iii) whole genome scans to locate and identify the genes involved in families with highly penetrant, autosomal dominant PD. Two excellent, relatively recent, reviews of the genetic aspects of Parkinson's disease have been published (11 ,12 ). CLINICAL PHENOTYPE.

An accurate clinical diagnosis is crucial when trying to categorize patients and families for genetic studies in what is certainly a heterogeneous disorder with multiple etiologies. It is generally accepted that the motor symptoms of PD, or parkinsonism, result from a deficiency or dysfunction of dopamine, or of the neurons producing dopamine, in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, regardless of etiology. However, idiopathic PD, the most common form of the disease, has been difficult to approach for genetic study because the name can mean different things to different researchers..

The disease is progressive and usually has an insidious onset in mid to late adulthood. In one study (13 ) of 100 patients, only three-quarters of patients carrying a diagnosis of PD as determined by qualified neurologists actually had the disease confirmed by autopsy.

0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	15	For the neuropathologist, autopsy demonstration of diffuse Lewy body disease has come to be the hallmark of PD (14 ). In diffuse Lewy body disease, the Lewy body, a characteristic intracellular cytoplasmic inclusion named at the beginning of the 20th century after its discoverer, is found in many regions of the brain, particularly in the neurons of the substantia nigra, in other nuclei in the brain stem, in the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, in the autonomic neurons of the esophagus and gastrointestinal tract and occasionally in the cortex (12 ). Lewy bodies are very frequently found in the brains of patients dying with PD even though there can be extreme variation in the age of onset, severity and clinical manifestations of the PD. In 100 patients carrying a diagnosis of PD who came to autopsy, the 24 patients who did not have Lewy bodies were found not to have PD and instead to have other causes for their clinical signs (15 ). However, the presence of Lewy bodies per se is not uniquely pathognomic of PD. A form of Alzheimer's disease, known as Lewy body variant AD, has been described in which a few Lewy bodies are found in brain cortex along with the pathognomic amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of AD (16 ). Conversely, it is possible to have the motor dysfunction characteristic of PD, even on a familial basis, without the pathological process whose characteristic marker is the Lewy body (reviewed in 12 ). Examples of hereditary parkinsonism syndromes without diffuse Lewy body disease include juvenile autosomal recessive parkinsonism mapping to chromosome 6q25-27 (17 ), the rapidly progressive autosomal dominant parkinsonism associated with dementia, dystonia and disinhibition, located on chromosome 17q21, and X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (18 -20 ). These are well-defined but rare familial disorders that have the motor signs of parkinsonism in common with diffuse Lewy body PD but are certainly different diseases. In the case of acquired parkinsonism due to MPTP toxicity, the typical Lewy body pathology of PD is not seen after acute MPTP exposure in humans nor in monkeys undergoing chronic MPTP administration although some atypical inclusions have been reported in the brains of these animals (21 -23 ). Thus, over the past 10 years, neurologists have come to accept that the highly prevalent disorder, idiopathic PD, is a distinctive disorder usually occurring in middle to late adulthood with characteristic pathology of diffuse Lewy body disease and the classical motor and central nervous system manifestations of parkinsonism (14 ,24 ,25 ). For the purposes of this review, we will concentrate on the genetics of this common form of the disease. GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY OF PD.

0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	17	Familial clustering of PD was observed a century ago (11 ,25 ) when 10-15% of PD patients were reported to have a positive family history. Accurate measurement of the frequency of PD among relatives of affected patients is made very difficult by the inaccuracy of making a diagnosis of PD from history, the relative insensitivity and lack of specificity of the clinical exam, the variability in age of onset, and the rarity of autopsy data required for making the diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease in relatives reported to have PD. During the 1980s, a genetic contribution to PD was thought highly unlikely when a series of twin studies failed to demonstrate an increased concordance for PD in monozygotic versus dizygotic twins (3 -6 ). As has been pointed out, however, (26 ) these studies are not interpretable because the number of twins studied and the duration of observation to either support or reject a genetic contribution to PD are inadequate. As nearly 80% of the function of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra must be lost before symptoms occur (27 ), reliance on clinical diagnosis alone and a lack of follow-up makes a determination of concordance extremely insensitive. Further evidence that clinical evaluation to determine concordance in twin studies is far too insensitive comes from the use of positron emission tomography to measure 18fluorodopa uptake into basal ganglia (28 ). Concordance rate among monozygotic twins increased when 18fluorodopa uptake into basal ganglia was used to diagnosis preclinical dysfunction of the substantia nigra (29 ). As a result, the lack of increased concordance in twin studies can be essentially discounted as the result of inconclusive and insensitive methodology..

In family studies, a family history positive for PD was found in 10-24% of patients, and the relative risk for PD in first degree relatives of PD patients ranged from 4 to 10.

Modest deficiencies of complex I of the electron transport chain (reviewed in 2 ) have been reported in the substantia nigra (21 ), muscle (37 -39 ) and peripheral blood cells (39 ,40 ) of PD patients but whether these abnormalities are primary or secondary to the disease process is unknown. The mitochondrial genome in aging brain can demonstrate striking departures from normal (41 ,42 ), but an analysis of the mitochondrial genome in the blood and brain of PD patients has failed to reveal a consistent hereditary or somatic deletion in PD patients as compared with age-matched control blood and brain samples (reviewed in 2 ). A few small studies have suggested a significant association of certain mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms with PD but the sample sizes were small and replication is ongoing (42 ,43 ). Thus, there appears to be some consistent abnormalities in oxidative phosphorylation, particularly of complex I, in PD but a direct causative role for inherited or acquired mutation of the mitochondrial genome remains unproved..

Association studies in PD have focused on polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450IA1 (encoded by the CYPIA1 gene) and the debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase cytochrome P450 (encoded by the CYP2D6 gene), as well as the monoamine oxidase A and B enzymes (encoded by MAOA and MAOB). Such association studies are always fraught with difficulties arising from unrecognized ascertainment bias and stratification. Unfortunately, the nature of a late onset disease means that parental genotypes required to permit the use of the more dependable transmission disequilibrium test for association are usually not available (44 ). Nonetheless, a number of studies have suggested significant association between PD and loci encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes and monoamine oxidase. In Japan, an MspI restriction fragment length polymorphism in CYPI1A was found to be associated with a 2-fold higher risk for PD in heterozygotes and 6.5-fold higher in homozygotes (45 ). Association studies with the CYP2D6 gene revealed a highly significant 4-fold increased risk among patients with disease onset before age 50 in a Spanish population although no such association was seen in United States and British samples (46 ,47 ). A particular haplotype at the MAOA locus was found to be 3-fold more common among PD patients as compared to controls while another haplotype was 3-fold less common among the affected patients (48 ). No such associations were found at the MAOB locus (48 ,49 ). Thus, preliminary data support a modest association for certain alleles at these loci with PD but, as has been the history with many association studies, replication of these findings is difficult and requires larger, carefully controlled studies before they can be accepted as definite..

Their hypothesis has now received substantial support. Linkage mapping of PD to 4q21-q23 in the Contursi pedigree suggested a number of candidate genes for PD that mapped to this region. One of them, [alpha]-synuclein, was a particularly good candidate. The protein is a neuron-specific presynaptic membrane protein (63 ) that was originally identified because it encodes a peptide named NACP, for non-A[beta] component of AD amyloid, isolated from plaques in AD (64 ,65 ). Sequencing of the [alpha]-synuclein gene in affected individuals from the Contursi kindred (Fig. 1 ) revealed that affected members of the kindred were heterozygous for a missense mutation, alanine - >  threonine at position 53 of the protein, that segregated with PD in the family (66 ). The same missense mutation was found in three additional unrelated PD families of Greek origin but was absent in 314 chromosomes from control European populations, including nearly 200 chromosomes obtained from random controls from the area near Contursi itself. The evidence that this mutation causes PD is based entirely on finding the mutation in four unrelated families and finding it absent in a large set of controls. Definitive proof requires elucidation of the mechanism by which this mutation causes the disease..

To date, however, there is no published data indicating whether or not Lewy bodies contain peptides derived from [alpha]-synuclein. It is interesting to note that NACP, a peptide fragment of [alpha]-synuclein, is an unusual protein in that it adopts an extended, non-globular conformation known as a `natively unfolded' random coil, in vitro. Such random coil domains promote protein-protein interactions and make the protein amyloidogenic in vitro (68 ). The discovery that [alpha]-synuclein, when mutated, predisposes with high probability to the development of PD in families with autosomal dominant disease suggests that a structural abnormality in this protein, either by changing conformation or altering normal proteolytic processing, may be the inciting event for protein aggregation leading to PD. A similar pathogenic mechanism has been hypothesized for mutant cellular proteins, such as the presenilins and beta amyloid, in causing AD (69 ). THE FUTURE.

The discovery that [alpha]-synuclein, when mutated, predisposes with high probability to the development of PD in families with autosomal dominant disease suggests that a structural abnormality in this protein, either by changing conformation or altering normal proteolytic processing, may be the inciting event for protein aggregation leading to PD. A similar pathogenic mechanism has been hypothesized for mutant cellular proteins, such as the presenilins and beta amyloid, in causing AD (69 ). THE FUTURE.

This change in focus has already begun to bear fruit in the form of a developing consensus on the relationship between diffuse Lewy body disease and PD, leading to much improved genetic epidemiological investigations of the disorder, the identification of families with clear autosomal dominant inheritance patterns, and the identification of at least one gene in which a particular missense mutation predisposes with high probability to the development of the disease. PD research is now poised to begin to ask fundamental questions of pathogenesis in human patients with classical Parkinson's disease. REFERENCES 1 Parkinson, J. (1817) An Essay on the Shaking Palsy.

One candidate gene in this region is the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which, in the GK rat model, has been associated with nonobese type 2 diabetes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to map a haplotype block in the 3' end of IDE, which revealed association with HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and mean fasting plasma glucose (mFPG) measured over 20 years. The strongest associations were found in a sample of unrelated men. The lowest trait values were associated with a haplotype (TT, f0.32) containing the minor allele of rs2209772 and the major allele of the rs1887922 SNP (FPG P  <  0.001, mFPG P  <  0.003, HbA1c P  <  0.025).

Polymorphisms in IDE have been associated with type 2 diabetes in the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat model (4). IDE can degrade a number of peptides, including insulin IGF-I and -II, transforming growth factor, atrial natriuretic peptide, and oxidatively damaged proteins (5)..

SNP positions and minor allele frequencies (fa) from the November 2002 draft (University of California Santa Cruz genome browser) are given in Table 3 and shown in Fig. 1. To assess completeness of the map, linkage disequilibrium (LD) in this region was evaluated using LDMAP, a program based on the Malecot model, where one LD unit (LDU) is defined as the distance in kilobases at which the association between two markers falls by e-1 (Fig. 1) (7). A flat line indicates complete LD between markers and defines a haplotype block. One haplotype block is observed at the 5' end of IDE, in agreement with a previously published report (8), and another at the 3' end (Fig. 1).

Association studies may be more efficient than linkage studies in identifying genetic determinants of complex traits when allele frequency is relatively high and the effect small (16). This finding is consistent with the associations we see here with the IDE CC haplotype (f16%), which is about twice as likely to be associated with type 2 diabetes as the TT haplotype. Typing of additional SNPs will be necessary to identify other gene variants on 10q23 to 25 that affect glucose homeostasis..

For the sample of unrelated subjects, FPG, measured at exam cycle 5, was available for 1,640 Offspring participants. The mFPG was the average FPG value for the 1,739 offspring who had three or more measures of FPG in the five exams that spanned 20 years. HbA1c was determined for 1,311 individuals at exam 5. In the family set, FPG was available for 837 individuals, mFPG for 951 individuals, and HbA1c for 528 individuals. Diabetes status (type 2 diabetes) was defined as either on hypoglycemic medication or two FPG levels 7 mmol/l ( > 125 mg/dl) at any time during exams 1 to 6. Using this criterion, 14.8% of men in the unrelated sample and 11% of women were classified as diabetic subjects (Tables 1 and 2). A less stringent criterion for IPG was defined as FPG 6.1 mmol/l ( > 110 mg/dl) or 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose 7.8 mmol/l ( > 140 mg/dl) or anyone being treated for type 2 diabetes. A questionnaire was used to collect information on alcohol and cigarette consumption, hormone therapy, and physical activity index, which is calculated as a weighted average of hours spent at various activity levels (19)..

0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	47	Statistical analysis. Standardized residuals were calculated using linear regression models that incorporated age, age-squared, age-cubed, sex, smoking, physical activity, BMI, and alcohol consumption as covariates. Separate regression models were used for men and women. The residuals from the models were then ranked and normalized (1). This transformation diminished slightly the significance of the results reported. For the sample of unrelated subjects, associations between traits and genotypes for each SNP were evaluated using regression models. Additionally, association with haplotypes was tested using Haplo.score (10) and haplotype effects were estimated using the REGRESSION and LOGISTIC procedures in SAS. Haplotype effects were estimated in a two-stage procedure. First, individual haplotypes were inferred by the EM algorithm using snphap (D. Clayton, http://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/clayton/software/); then, the inferred haplotype probabilities were used as predictors in regression models. Effect measures from these analyses compare each haplotype against all other haplotypes. The global significance of the haplotype-phenotype associations were determined using empirical P values (1,000 permutations) obtained from Haplo.score (10). In related individuals, a family based (empirical) test of association implemented in the program FBAT was used with an additive model (9)..

The most consistent therapeutic effect has been seen using inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which cleaves the transmitter in the cholinergic synapse. Three such compounds have now been licensed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine. These have increased awareness of Alzheimer's disease, but unfortunately cost pressures have hindered their development in the UK, even though experienced users of donepezil and rivastigmine have found consistent results (Cameron et al, 2000; Evans et al, 2000; Matthews et al, 2000). The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) were considered to be a stepping-stone to better disease-modifying compounds (Bullock, 1998). Although they undoubtedly are, no other class of drug has yet reached the clinic, and AChEIs will remain the main treatment option for some time. A variety of protocols for treatment (Harvey, 1999) have been superseded in the UK by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (2001) guidelines on the use of these three drugs..

In all trials of AChEIs, a  response , as measured by the scales used, was found in an average of 40% of the patients studied (Corey-Bloom et al, 1998; Rogers et al, 1998; Raskind et al, 2000). This compares favourably with most drugs for chronic illness, and all AChEIs have low  numbers needed to treat  (NNTs) (Livingston  and  Katona, 2000). Using the scores from published data, donepezil has an NNT of 4, rivastigmine 7 and galantamine 3. The high placebo response is often questioned, but this is common in mental health studies, where it masks a large non-drug treatment effect. Responders and non-responders are identified   but our criteria may be too harsh and the nature of a  response  needs more research and definition. Currently no hard predictor of response or non-response has been identified (Schneider  and  Farlow, 1995). The APOE4 allele was once suggested as a marker of poor response, but subsequent studies suggested no correlation..

Donepezil has the advantage of having only two dose steps, while rivastigmine and galantamine offer a wider range, making tailoring to individual patients perhaps more precise. Whichever drug is chosen, the dose should be taken to the maximum tolerated (within the licence), after which at least 3 months of treatment should be given before considering whether there has been inadequate response.

This produces increased amounts of acetylcholine in the synapse by a direct effect on presynaptic release, but again, the clinical impact is unknown and published evidence as to its significance and desirability is required. It may be that modulation, rather than agonism, protects against downregulation of post-synaptic receptors. This may allow the drug to work longer, but further studies are needed to confirm this. Modulation also improves attention, and this has been demonstrated with galantamine but not with donepezil or rivastigmine in Alzheimer's disease..

Patients with mild disease already have significant illness and should receive treatment, even with minimal symptoms. Treating mildly affected patients will mean smaller responses, and protocols should reflect this   long-term follow-up being needed to show any continuing effect beyond that expected from clinical trials. Moderate disease covers a wide range of morbidity: in trials down to a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al, 1975) score of 10, but in NICE guidelines down to 12. Patients scoring at the lower end of the range have a host of symptoms, and AChEIs here may be as valuable for their symptomatic effects on behaviour as for their effect on the underlying disease. Trial data with metrifonate (another AChEI, which was withdrawn because of side-effects) showed improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease   especially in apathy, hallucinations and agitation (Cummings et al, 1998). This effect is more noticeable in dementia with Lewy bodies where improvements in both MMSE scores and neuropsychiatric symptoms have been demonstrated with rivastigmine (McKeith et al, 2000). This suggests that dementia should be treated at any time, with symptomatic delay and retention of qualify of life being the aim early in the disease, moving towards symptomatic relief as progression occurs. No published results are available for severe dementia, though open-label follow-up from trials suggests that these drugs continue working as the cholinergic deficit increases..

Study of one of these large pedigrees revealed the transmission, from generation to generation, of a single point mutation in the gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP), found on chromosome 21 in family members developing early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Further studies of these families led to the discovery of other point mutations in the same gene and later the presence of mutations in two other genes, encoding presenilin-1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2 (PS-2), found on chromosomes 14 and 1, respectively. To date, 12 Alzheimer's disease-related mutations have been discovered in the APP gene, 69 mutations in the PS-1 gene and 5 mutations in the PS-2 gene. Significantly, research suggests that the different mutations in these three genes lead to a common result, an increase in ss-A4 peptide fragment of APP which forms the core of the neuritic plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease..

Thus, given that in the majority of cases ( >  95%) Alzheimer's disease occurs after the age of 60 years, it is clear that these genetic mutations make only a small contribution to the risk of developing the disease in general..

In cross-sectional studies the presence of a positive family history of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is a consistent risk factor for subjects with the late-onset form, but a clear autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance is rare. Both twin and family studies suggest a polygenic multifactorial mode of inheritance and as a consequence the elucidation of genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease requires different methods from those used in the early-onset disease, with its simple Mendelian patterns of inheritance. Association studies have so far dominated the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Such studies look for variation in the frequency of an allele in samples of unrelated patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease compared with unrelated control subjects. These studies have resulted in a number of candidate genes being proposed as having importance as risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and include associations with variation in genes encoding the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, PS-1 (an intronic mutation not associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease), butyrylcholinesterase, angiotensin-1 converting enzyme, 1-antichymotrypsin, the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex, 2-macroglobulin, the low-density lipoprotein-like receptor, the serotonin transporter and interleukin-1. Typically, interest in these candidates has diminished as independent replication has not been forthcoming, and little evidence now remains for an important role for genetic variation in the VLDL receptor, PS-1 or 1-antichymotrypsin genes in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The other candidate genes still have their advocates and remain hotly disputed..

Significantly, the importance of APOE4 was determined using a positional candidate gene approach. Since this finding, other studies (Artiga et al, 1998; Bullido et al, 1998; Lambert et al, 1998) have also suggested an association between a number of polymorphisms within the transcriptional regulatory region of the APOE gene and late-onset Alzheimer's disease that is independent of ApoE 4 status. Based on these data, it was suggested that there are two independent mechanisms by which risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease can be modified by the APOE gene: first, by variations in the coding regions, which alter the functional properties of APOE; and second, by the presence of promoter variants which result in quantitative differences in APOE expression (Artiga et al, 1998). However, this hypothesis is controversial, and more recent studies (Helisalmi et al, 1999; Zurutuza et al, 2000) have failed to support the independence of APOE promoter variants in the development of Alzheimer's disease..

Thus, one study of affected sib pairs suggests that shared familial effects may account for 40% of the variance (Tunstall et al, 2000).

This has led to the suggestion that the APOE4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease mainly because in old age Alzheimer's disease and death are competing risks. Any factor leading to an earlier age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in the elderly (and hence the development of the disease prior to death) will be associated with Alzheimer's disease. Evidence confirming this hypothesis has come from a large study of approximately 5000 individuals (Meyer et al, 1998). This study showed a clear decline in relative risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease in all subjects with increasing age but with a clear plateau beyond which no further new cases of the disease were reported. The age at which this plateau was reached was earlier in carriers of the APOE4 allele.

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS REFERENCES   The gene for insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) represents a strong positional and biological candidate for type 2 diabetes susceptibility. IDE maps to chromosome 10q23.3, a region linked to diabetes in several populations; the rat homolog has been directly implicated in diabetes susceptibility; and known functions of IDE support an important role in glucose homeostasis. We sought evidence for association between IDE variation and diabetes by mutation screening, defining local haplotype structure, and genotyping variants delineating common haplotypic diversity. An initial case-control analysis (628 diabetic probands from multiplex sibships and 604 control subjects) found no haplotypic associations, although one variant (IDE2, -179TC) showed modest association with diabetes (odds ratio [OR]1.25, P = 0.03). Linkage partitioning analyses failed to support this association, but provided borderline evidence for a different variant (IDE10, IVS20 to 405AG) (P = 0.06). Neither variant was associated with diabetes when replication was sought in 377 early onset diabetic subjects and 825 control subjects, though combined analysis of all typed cohorts indicated a nominally significant effect at IDE2 (OR 1.21 [1.04 to 1.40], P = 0.013). In the absence of convincing support for this association from linkage partitioning or analyses of continuous measures of glycemia, we conclude that analysis of over 2,400 samples provides no compelling evidence that variation in IDE contributes to diabetes susceptibility in humans..

In a genomewide scan of 573 U.K. type 2 diabetic pedigrees, evidence for linkage (multipoint logarithm of odds [LOD] = 1.99) peaked near to D10S1765, only 4 Mb from IDE, and conditional analyses have suggested epistatic interaction with the well-replicated susceptibility locus on chromosome 1q (1). Linkage to 10q has also been reported in Finns (2), North American Europeans (3), Mexican Americans (4), and French (5), though the latter two map 40 to 50 cM telomeric and may reflect a distinct locus..

In the GK rat model (6,7), a locus for poststimulation glycemia was mapped to a region of rat chromosome 1 syntenic with human 10q23-26 (8,9) and subsequently localized to a 1-cM region around Ide (10). Two amino-acid substitutions in Ide were found in susceptible congenic strains, which, together, conferred postprandial hyperglycemia and reduced insulin degradation in isolated muscle cells, and other diabetes-related phenotypes (10)..

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	9	Third, the known and presumed functions of IDE are consistent with a role in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. IDE, a 110 kDa Zn2+-regulated metalloproteinase, displays a wide expression profile including all insulin-responsive tissues. Strong species conservation attests to important biological functions, and diverse cellular and metabolic roles have been proposed (11,12). Although some of these remain controversial (13), IDE seems to play a major role in the breakdown of insulin in insulin-responsive tissues (14), thereby influencing the extent of the cellular response to insulin (11). This association between IDE activity and insulin clearance and resistance is supported by in vitro and clinical studies (14 to 16). Furthermore, the substrate specificity of IDE coincides with peptides capable of amyloid formation (including both amylin and insulin), indicating that IDE may prevent accumulation of amyloidogenic peptides (12). Disruption of this scavenging function might thereby promote aggregation of the islet amyloid characteristic of type 2 diabetes and contribute to deficient ss-cell capacity..

Mutation screening of all exons, adjacent intronic sequence, and 600 bp of 5' sequence in probands from 10q-linked pedigrees identified six confirmed variants (Table 1 and Fig. 1). For convenience, these are termed IDE single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9 in accordance with previous nomenclature (17). We did not detect the uncommon IDE6 and IDE7 variants previously reported (17), and IDE1 and IDE10 mapped outside the sequence surveyed. None of the variants appeared to have strong functional credentials based on sequence context. A putative nonsynonymous exon 15 coding polymorphism reported in dbSNP (rs2229708) was not validated on sequencing or direct genotyping. Analysis of 348 European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC) control samples confirmed extensive linkage disequilibrium across the gene (all pairwise D' values  > 0.60, Fig. 1).

Such linkage partitioning methods have been applied in several recent type 2 diabetes studies (18 to 21). Here, we used linkage partitioning in a purely exploratory capacity, given uncertainties over the statistical properties of these methods when the evidence for linkage is not confirmed, as well as the possible consequences of partitioning bias when stratifying on proband genotype alone. No difference was evident between "linked" and "unlinked" probands in IDE haplotype frequencies (P = 0.86), IDE2 genotypes (P = 0.61), or IDE10 genotypes (P = 0.18). The association previously seen at IDE2, between W2P and CON1, was attenuated when only linked probands were considered (genotypes P = 0.10; alleles P = 0.08). There was no difference in IDE10 genotype frequencies between 10q-linked probands and CON1 control subjects (P = 0.34). However, the complementary analysis, testing whether IDE genotype partitioned the evidence for 10q linkage, was more encouraging.

This, despite the fact that our analyses utilized several large and well-characterized populations, and selection of the diabetic individuals for early onset and positive family history was designed to enhance detection of type 2 diabetes susceptibility alleles. The only SNP showing association in the initial case-control analysis (IDE2) was not associated in our replication set.

None of the variants identified in this, or an earlier screen of U.K. subjects (17), has strong credentials for an impact on IDE structure and/or function. Clearly, our findings do not support the hypothesis that variation within IDE is exclusively responsible for the linkage signal detected on chromosome 10q. However, as with any association study, we cannot exclude the possibility that the variants typed (especially IDE2) have a lesser susceptibility role. The present study has, we estimate,  > 95% power to detect an association between IDE2 and type 2 diabetes under a multiplicative model with a genotypic relative risk of 1.2, at a threshold P value of 0.05. This falls to 60% under a more stringent significance threshold (P = 0.001) designed to reflect modest prior odds that the candidate selected plays a biologically significant susceptibility role. Furthermore, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that IDE variants other than those studied have a more marked contribution to type 2 diabetes susceptibility. If so, such variants must lie outside the regions surveyed and display limited linkage disequilibrium with any of the typed variants.

Genotype and allele frequency distributions were compared by standard contingency table methods with exact probability estimation, using STATXACT (Cytel, Cambridge, MA). Genotype comparisons used the Kruskal-Wallis statistic given the ordinal categorization. Separate data sets (e.g., the W2T and YT2D sets) were combined for contingency table analyses only after appropriate homogeneity testing. Haplotype patterns were estimated by maximum-likelihood methods (SNPHAP, www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/clayton/software/) and haplotype frequency distributions compared by likelihood-ratio testing. Significance was determined by permutation (10,000 replicates). Measures of linkage disequilibrium between SNPs were derived using the PM (Permutation and Model-free Analysis) program (25). To assess the evidence for linkage partitioning (18 to 21), two complementary approaches were adopted. First, W2P probands were subdivided into "linked" (positive family NPL score at IDE) and "unlinked," and variant frequency comparisons were repeated. Second, the evidence for linkage at 10q was recomputed (using GENEHUNTER-PLUS [1]) after conditioning on the proband s IDE genotype. The significance of changes in the linkage statistic was determined by permutation (10,000 replicates). The power calculations described assume, for simplicity, that all cases are ascertained from affected sibpairs (to incorporate the ascertainment selection) and that all control samples are population based..

0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS REFERENCES   Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) plays a principal role in the proteolysis of several peptides in addition to insulin and is encoded by IDE, which resides in a region of chromosome 10q that is linked to type 2 diabetes. Two recent studies presented genetic association data on IDE and type 2 diabetes (one positive and the other negative), but neither explored the fundamental question of whether polymorphism in IDE has a measurable influence on insulin levels in human populations. To address this possibility, 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a linkage disequilibrium block encompassing IDE have been genotyped in a sample of 321 impaired glucose tolerant and 403 nondiabetic control subjects. Analyses based on haplotypic genotypes (diplotypes), constructed with SNPs that differentiate common extant haplotypes extending across IDE, provided compelling evidence of association with fasting insulin levels (P = 0.0009), 2-h insulin levels (P = 0.0027), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (P = 0.0001), and BMI (P = 0.0067), with effects exclusively evident in men. The strongest evidence for an effect of a single marker was obtained for rs2251101 (located near the 3' untranslated region of IDE) on 2-h insulin levels (P = 0.000023). Diplotype analyses, however, suggest the presence of multiple interacting trait-modifying sequences in the region. Results indicate that polymorphism in/near IDE contributes to a large proportion of variance in plasma insulin levels and correlated traits, but questions of sex specificity and allelic heterogeneity will need to be taken into consideration as the molecular basis of the observed phenotypic effects unfolds..

IDE is the major enzyme responsible for insulin proteolysis in vitro (5) and shares structural and functional homology with bacterial protease III, which may function in the termination of the insulin response (6,7). In mice, IDE hypofunction induced by IDE gene disruption leads to hyperinsulinemia (8). Furthermore, IDE activity in the diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat is reduced by 30%, where polymorphism in IDE is likely to be the main contributing factor (9). Congruence of positional and functional data indicates that sequence variation in IDE may play a role in modifying insulin metabolism in human populations. Two recent genetic association studies investigated the IDE region in relation to type 2 diabetes. One produced significant evidence for effects on both type 2 diabetes and plasma glucose levels (10), whereas the other explored only case-control models and obtained no evidence of association (11). Neither of these studies, however, attempted to directly relate IDE variants to measures of insulin metabolism..

This study follows a recent report (13) in which we examined 26 polymorphic markers extending across IDE in relation to Alzheimer s disease in a large Swedish population. These were used to define regional linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure, which highlighted a LD block spanning 276 kb around IDE.

We began by genotyping these in the entire male sample to define LD structure and to identify common haplotypes. All 14 markers were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Pairwise marker correlations suggested strong LD in the region, in agreement with earlier data (13). Common haplotypes (those  > 5% frequency), inferred with HAPLOTYPER using all 14 markers, were similar to those obtained based on a slightly modified marker set (13). LD estimates and inferred haplotypes for the entire sample are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The definition of Patil et al. (14) ( = 0.8) was used to confirm that the studied region does represent an LD block. We also confirmed that a selection of three tag markers equivalent to those previously used (13) would be able to delineate common haplotypes and opted not to explore the use of alternative equally valid marker sets. We note that a variety of different approaches exist for defining optimal SNP sets (15), but we have not explored their use here. These and other issues may have relevance for attempts at replicating or refuting the present data, as LD structures can differ markedly between divergent populations (K.K.

The principal criterion for diplotype construction is that they can be inferred with high probability and thus reflect with fidelity combinations of common haplotypes for each individual. In the presence of limited allelic heterogeneity, this can be advantageous over single marker tests, which can fail to detect effects due to insufficient or complex patterns of LD with pathogenic variants. In addition, testing many single markers requires a substantial degree of multiple testing. Our selection of quantitative phenotypes for analyses included six traits typically examined in relation to diabetes (16 to 18), and these are listed in Table 1. We note that studies (19,20) that have investigated IDE in relation to diabetes did not report efforts to relate genotypes to either insulin levels or obesity. Trait distributions were highly skewed or partially skewed for all six studied phenotypes, and thus only log-transformed data were modeled. Correlations between traits were extremely high, as was expected (data not shown)..

Six of eight possible haplotypes are predicted using these markers, the sequences for which are H1-TCG, H2-TCA, H3-CCA, H4-TTA, H5-TTG, and H6-CCG. Posterior probability estimates were in excess of 0.80 for all phase calls that represent the various combinations of these haplotypes (a threshold that was set for retaining individuals for analyses). Significant and consistent effects upon traits were evident, with the notable exception of fasting glucose and 2-h glucose levels. Importantly, effects were evident exclusively in men, which are in agreement with results obtained by Karamohamed et al. (10). The results of these analyses are shown in Fig. 4, where data for the male sample are presented. For all analyses, we combined IGT individuals and nondiabetic control subjects and adjusted for any uniform phenotypic differences between them by including their group identity as a factor in ANOVA models. Diplotype by group interaction terms in second-order factorial ANOVA models were not significant. As the above analyses are based on probabilistically inferred data, we considered it important to also explore models that only entail the use of phase-known data. This can be accomplished by excluding individuals that are heterozygous at two or more sites (all individuals with only one heterozygote site are by definition phase known). To demonstrate this, an additional analysis was performed in men on the four associated traits shown in Fig. 4 (insulin, 2-h insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR], and BMI). Results revealed association with all four of these, but significance was highest for BMI (F7,220 = 3.5; P = 0.0014) (data for other comparisons not shown). For reference to Fig. 4, the groups that are excluded in this analysis are H1/H3, H2/H5, H3/H4, and H3/H5..

In considering multiple testing issues, we noted that the strongest individual finding in HOMA-IR (P = 0.0001) affords 500 individual tests before strict multiple testing correction renders this finding insignificant (given = 0.05). These tests, using all 14 markers, were performed only in the male sample because diplotype analyses gave us no a priori reason to suspect that latent associations for single markers would be present in the female set. These results are shown in Fig. 5, where consistent effects of rs2251101 and rs2249960 can be seen upon traits. The common allele at rs2251101 and the rare allele of rs2249960 were associated with lower trait levels. Marker rs2251101 and rs1887922 were tested against fasting glucose levels because the latter was specifically reported on by Karamohamed et al. (10), and these two markers are in extremely high LD (r2  >  0.5) (Fig. 2). Neither marker showed evidence of association, but we acknowledge that the present study has less power than the aforementioned one. The result for rs2251101 upon multiple phenotypes nonetheless supports the likely presence of a primary trait-modifying sequence in the 3' region of IDE, as has been speculated (10). The effect of rs1887922 on 2-h insulin levels was significant, however, albeit considerably attenuated in comparison with rs2251101. To further explore the effects of rs2251101, a final model was fitted in which rare-allele homozygotes and heterozygotes were combined and compared with common allele homozygotes. The results of this were as follows: F1,366 = 9.1, P = 0.0028; F1,363 = 18.4, P = 0.000023; F1,365 = 7.0, P = 0.0085; and F1,365 = 11.4, P = 0.0008; for fasting insulin, 2-h insulin, HOMA-IR, and BMI, respectively. Although throughout this study tests were conducted on the combined IGT and normal samples (and a correction applied for possible differences between them), it was considered important to confirm that an effect exists in both populations in at least one analysis. Using the above model and focusing on the rs2251101 marker and the 2-h insulin trait, significant effects were observed for both the IGT (F1,155 = 13.0, P = 0.0004) and normal (F1,206 = 6.5, P = 0.011) groups; in both cases the common allele homozygote group had the lowest trait levels..
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	21	  In an attempt to refine the possible position of pathogenic variant(s) in the region, single marker tests were conducted on the phenotypes that provided evidence of association in diplotype models. In considering multiple testing issues, we noted that the strongest individual finding in HOMA-IR (P = 0.0001) affords 500 individual tests before strict multiple testing correction renders this finding insignificant (given = 0.05). These tests, using all 14 markers, were performed only in the male sample because diplotype analyses gave us no a priori reason to suspect that latent associations for single markers would be present in the female set. These results are shown in Fig. 5, where consistent effects of rs2251101 and rs2249960 can be seen upon traits. The common allele at rs2251101 and the rare allele of rs2249960 were associated with lower trait levels. Marker rs2251101 and rs1887922 were tested against fasting glucose levels because the latter was specifically reported on by Karamohamed et al. (10), and these two markers are in extremely high LD (r2  >  0.5) (Fig. 2). Neither marker showed evidence of association, but we acknowledge that the present study has less power than the aforementioned one. The result for rs2251101 upon multiple phenotypes nonetheless supports the likely presence of a primary trait-modifying sequence in the 3' region of IDE, as has been speculated (10). The effect of rs1887922 on 2-h insulin levels was significant, however, albeit considerably attenuated in comparison with rs2251101. To further explore the effects of rs2251101, a final model was fitted in which rare-allele homozygotes and heterozygotes were combined and compared with common allele homozygotes. The results of this were as follows: F1,366 = 9.1, P = 0.0028; F1,363 = 18.4, P = 0.000023; F1,365 = 7.0, P = 0.0085; and F1,365 = 11.4, P = 0.0008; for fasting insulin, 2-h insulin, HOMA-IR, and BMI, respectively.

0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	23	  In summary, we provide strong evidence that sequence variation within or near IDE contributes to variability in measures of insulin metabolism. There are several compelling features to these results. First, both our study and the study by Karamohamed et al. (10) suggest that a primary functional variant occurs in the 3' region of IDE. In addition, the marker that previously exhibited maximum evidence of association, rs1887922 (10), is in very strong LD with the marker (rs2251101) with the greatest effect in the present study. A true pathogenic variant is likely to be in high LD with both of these (and indeed could be one of these markers). Second, both of these studies suggest effects either exclusively or predominantly in male subjects. Numerous studies have detected genetic effects exclusively in men (20,21), and sex specificity may be a major confounding factor in genetic analyses (22). Third, the marker that was in strongest association with quantitative traits related to Alzheimer s disease in our recent study (13) was rs2251101 (from among 26 markers). Importantly, however, the present analyses suggest that there may be more than one functionally relevant polymorphic site in or near IDE. This is evident in diplotype models, where no single haplotype appears responsible for either elevating or reducing trait levels and where a number of possible interactions are also apparent. Evidence of allelic heterogeneity and interaction will in general make fine mapping of the responsible variants a daunting task (23), and this will need to be considered in future studies investigating the IDE region..

0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	25	We have not directly addressed the question of whether variation in IDE influences the risk for type 2 diabetes. The two studies that have tested this relationship have produced either no or modest evidence of association, despite examining very large clinical samples. Our study provides no evidence of association with fasting glucose levels (the primary phenotype used to distinguish diabetic patients). Rather, the present data likely capture the fundamental influence of IDE upon circulating insulin levels, whereby a genetically determined deficit in enzyme activity may lead to hyperinsulinemia. This could manifest itself as a modulator role in type 2 diabetes, but might be more relevant to other phenotypes, such as coronary heart disease (24) and primary hypertension (25). We believe that continued replication efforts in both normal and morbid populations, as well as functional studies, are now highly merited and will be needed to elucidate the molecular basis and clinical relevance of these observed phenotypic effects..

0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes are characterized by increased prevalence with aging, a genetic predisposition, and comparable pathological features in the islet and brain (amyloid derived from amyloid ss protein in the brain in Alzheimer disease and islet amyloid derived from islet amyloid polypeptide in the pancreas in type 2 diabetes). Evidence is growing to link precursors of amyloid deposition in the brain and pancreas with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Given these similarities, we questioned whether there may be a common underlying mechanism predisposing to islet and cerebral amyloid. To address this, we first examined the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in a community-based controlled study, the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer Disease Patient Registry (ADPR), which follows patients with Alzheimer disease versus control subjects without Alzheimer disease. In addition to this clinical study, we performed a pathological study of autopsy cases from this same community to determine whether there is an increased prevalence of islet amyloid in patients with Alzheimer disease and increased prevalence of cerebral amyloid in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients who were enrolled in the ADPR (Alzheimer disease n = 100, non-Alzheimer disease control subjects n = 138) were classified according to fasting glucose concentration (FPG) as nondiabetic (FPG  < 110 mg/dl), impaired fasting glucose (IFG, FPG 110 to 125 mg/dl), and type 2 diabetes (FPG  > 126 mg/dl). The mean slope of FPG over 10 years in each case was also compared between Alzheimer disease and non-Alzheimer disease control subjects. Pancreas and brain were examined from autopsy specimens obtained from 105 humans (first, 28 cases of Alzheimer disease disease vs. 21 non-Alzheimer disease control subjects and, second, 35 subjects with type 2 diabetes vs. 21 non-type 2 diabetes control subjects) for the presence of islet and brain amyloid. Both type 2 diabetes (35% vs. 18%; P  <  0.05) and IFG (46% vs. 24%; P  <  0.01) were more prevalent in Alzheimer disease versus non-Alzheimer disease control subjects, so 81% of cases of Alzheimer disease had either type 2 diabetes or IFG. The slope of increase of FPG with age over 10 years was also greater in Alzheimer disease than non-Alzheimer disease control subjects (P  <  0.01). Islet amyloid was more frequent (P  <  0.05) and extensive (P  <  0.05) in patients with Alzheimer disease than in non-Alzheimer disease control subjects. However, diffuse and neuritic plaques were not more common in type 2 diabetes than in control subjects. In cases of type 2 diabetes when they were present, the duration of type 2 diabetes correlated with the density of diffuse (P  <  0.001) and neuritic plaques (P  <  0.01). In this community cohort from southeast Minnesota, type 2 diabetes and IFG are more common in patients with Alzheimer disease than in control subjects, as is the pathological hallmark of type 2 diabetes, islet amyloid. However, there was no increase in brain plaque formation in cases of type 2 diabetes, although when it was present, it correlated in extent with duration of diabetes. These data support the hypothesis that patients with Alzheimer disease are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes and the possibility of linkage between the processes responsible for loss of brain cells and ss-cells in these diseases..

The role of these aggregates of IAPP and AssP in ss-cell and cortical neuronal death in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease is controversial. Small amyloid aggregates of either of these proteins are cytotoxic (22 to 25). The mechanism of the cytotoxicity mediated by small protein aggregates has been hypothesized to be by induction of membrane damage (25 to 27). In the case of IAPP, evidence exists to suggest that abnormal aggregation occurs initially intracellularly, and after cell death, IAPP-derived fibrils accumulate extracellularly (24,28,29). Similar mechanisms are also possible in Alzheimer disease. In vivo, even though IAPP and AssP are present in an aqueous environment, in health neither protein forms fibrils, suggesting that mechanisms exist to prevent this otherwise spontaneous process. These mechanisms likely include the chaperone protein pathway, a system for protein trafficking via intracellular binding proteins (chaperone proteins), which bind nascent proteins and facilitate their transport within the cell (30)..

It is plausible that a low affinity for binding by one or more chaperone proteins to IAPP may be shared with a similar low affinity for binding to AssP. In support of this hypothesis, Schwartz (32) suggested that there might be a relationship between amyloid deposits in the brain and pancreatic islets..

Patients who were from southeastern Minnesota and had dementia were identified at the time of routine general medical examination in the Department of Community Internal Medicine at the Mayo Clinic. All studies were approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. When there was a suspicion of Alzheimer disease during a routine periodic medical examination, a neurological evaluation that included the Mini-Mental State Exam, Geriatric Depression Scale, Hachinski Ischemic Scale, Short Test of Mental Status, Record of Independent Living, and extensive neuropsychological testing was performed (33). Age- and sex-matched control subjects were randomly identified from the same community clinics. All enrolled cases had detailed evaluation to confirm or rule out (control subjects) Alzheimer disease. Once a patient had been enrolled in the ADPR as a case of Alzheimer disease or as a control, he or she was followed annually for clinical studies that included a fasting blood glucose measurement. Recruitment to the ADPR was haphazard (i.e., not deliberately biased) with respect to the presence or absence of diabetes or the blood glucose concentration. Exclusion criteria were 1) chronic treatment with glucocorticoids, 2) a history of pancreatitis, or 3) type 1 diabetes. The distinction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes was made on conventional clinical criteria. The features favoring type 1 diabetes included lean BMI (and further weight loss) and young age at onset, insulin requirement at onset, documented ketoacidosis, presence of other autoimmune diseases, and a family history of autoimmune disease. Features favoring type 2 diabetes included strong family history, prolonged insulin-independent treatment, obesity, absence of autoimmune diseases, and later age of onset. It is acknowledged that the distinction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes is not without error, but in view of the large number of cases in the present studies and the high prevalence of type 2 versus type 1 diabetes, it is unlikely that the conclusions of the present studies have been influenced by erroneous inclusion of cases of type 1 diabetes (Table 1)..

This postulate arose from the close resemblance in pathology in the brain in Alzheimer disease and islets in type 2 diabetes. In both diseases, a locally expressed protein (AssP in Alzheimer disease and IAPP in type 2 diabetes) is deposited in amyloid deposits with a gradual decline in the number of cells of the respective proteins. Amyloid deposits of both AssP and IAPP (or more likely their oligomeric precursors) are cytotoxic (22,23,35 to 40) by a mechanism that may relate to membrane disruption (25 to 27). However, as yet, there is still no clear explanation for why these amyloidogenic proteins form amyloid fibrils in those who develop type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease. Because both of these proteins spontaneously form amyloid fibrils in vitro in the aqueous environment present in the cell, mechanisms must exist in health to prevent this aggregation, which presumably include the chaperone protein pathway (30). All newly synthesized proteins are bound by a chaperone protein that has the function of preventing insoluble proteins (e.g., IAPP and AssP) from aggregating in cells and trafficking the protein to its appropriate subcellular location. Chaperon proteins have been described as promiscuous because each chaperone protein binds and traffics numerous different proteins with structurally similar properties (30). As individual chaperone proteins traffic structurally similar peptides, it is possible that IAPP and AssP share one or more chaperone proteins. In Fig. 4, the amino acid sequence and structural properties of each amino acid of IAPP1 to 37 and AssP1 to 42 are shown. They have been aligned to reveal the major overlap (90%) in structural properties of IAPP20 to 28 and AssP25 to 33, areas that are hydrophobic and therefore likely to be a target for binding by chaperone proteins. Furthermore, this region of IAPP is well-established as the amyloidogenic sequence (36) and AssP25 to 35 is neurotoxic (41). Recently it has been suggested that the toxic intermediate form of IAPP and AssP oligomers are recognized by the same antibody, suggesting a strong structural relationship (42)..

Under these circumstances, aggregation of either or both proteins might occur, resulting in the development of the relevant phenotype for Alzheimer disease and/or type 2 diabetes. In addition, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease increase in prevalence with aging, and cell chaperone protein capacity declines with aging (43), which would be expected to reveal any partial deficiency in chaperone capacity with aging. Therefore, one potential explanation for the reported shared risk for Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes and similar pathology is that IAPP and AssP share one or more chaperone proteins and that a functional defect in this shared pathway (decreased chaperone protein binding, decreased chaperone protein availability) results in a shared vulnerability for AssP to aggregate in ss-pleated sheets in cortical cells and IAPP to aggregate in ss-cells..

This possibility has been reviewed by Finch and Cohen (44). Finch and Cohen proposed that the progressive increase in plasma glucose concentration that occurs with aging in the general population may be important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. They proposed that this may be mediated by induction of oxidative stress or by glycosylation of key regulatory proteins (45,46). The current study was at least partly supportive of this interesting hypothesis. When present, the density of diffuse and neuritic plaques in brain increased with the duration of diabetes but not with age. Prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia thus might trigger brain plaque formation in those at risk.

Some studies suggest that the prevalence of Alzheimer disease is increased in type 2 diabetes (58 to 60), whereas in others, it has been reported as decreased (61 to 66) or comparable (48,49,67 to 71). A confounding factor in these studies (including the current one) is that Alzheimer disease is often accompanied by a decreased BMI presumed to be a result of decreased food intake. Because the most potent risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes is an increased BMI, it is possible that an association between these conditions has been obscured by the relative protective effect of a decreased BMI in Alzheimer disease. Alternatively, it is possible that people with Alzheimer disease exercise less and therefore have decreased insulin sensitivity and increased risk for type 2 diabetes. As type 2 diabetes tends to develop at a younger age than Alzheimer disease and is associated with a decreased life expectancy, early death from complications of diabetes might obscure subsequent development of Alzheimer disease. The current pathology studies are unique inasmuch as the Alzheimer disease and non-Alzheimer disease groups were fully characterized both in life and by autopsy, and so although the numbers are small, it is provocative that there is a distinct increase in risk of islet amyloid in patients with Alzheimer disease despite a lower BMI. The clinical data (protocols 1 and 2) are also community-based cases that have been defined extensively with respect to the presence or absence of dementia and followed over a relatively long term (33). It is of interest that a population-based study from the same region showed an association between type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease (59). Whereas the former study examined records of all known cases of type 2 diabetes in the Rochester area at the time of the study for a diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer disease (1,455 cases), the present study was focused on a much smaller cohort of patients with Alzheimer disease (100 cases) and control subjects (138 cases) enrolled in the ADPR (33), wherein the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease was rigorously established, and then the same patients were followed annually in the study thereafter and when deceased were included in the autopsy studies. One other factor that might have caused discrepancies between reported studies is the changing definition of diabetes. The present study uses the criteria adopted for FPG concentrations in 1997 by an expert committee convened by the American Diabetes Association (72). As a consequence of this report, the plasma glucose concentration required to establish the diagnosis of diabetes was decreased from 140 mg/dl to 126 mg/dl. Furthermore, a high-risk group was established for the subsequent development of diabetes with an FPG concentration of 110 to 125 mg/dl. Studies that used the higher values for diagnosis of diabetes would report lower prevalence rates in both Alzheimer disease and control subjects and possibly not observe differences between groups that might be evident with the criteria used here..

All studies performed at major tertiary referral centers such as the Mayo Clinic are subject to such bias. Efforts were made to minimize this in the present clinical studies by recruitment of patients from the local community from the community clinics of the Mayo Medical Center. Patients were therefore attending the Mayo Clinic community clinics for primary care when they were recruited for either the Alzheimer disease or control groups of the clinical studies. Nonetheless, other recruitment bias may be introduced in a study such as ours by the failure of affected patients to seek medical care and therefore be unavailable for consideration. In the present study, there is a greater proportion of women than men in the clinical studies, which might be in part a reflection of recruitment bias but also potentially be due to the shorter life span of men than women once Alzheimer disease is diagnosed. Autopsy studies of Alzheimer disease cases and control subjects (for islet amyloid) would be subject to the same ascertainment bias as the ADPR since the cases were in the ADPR until death. In autopsy studies of type 2 diabetes cases versus control subjects for brain amyloid, we sought to minimize deliberate bias by including most recent autopsies in reverse sequence from cases that were appropriate for inclusion for these criteria. People who have an autopsy are of course in themselves a subgroup of the general population, so bias has to be considered. Notwithstanding these limitations, we do have the opportunity of presenting autopsy data from cases that were well characterized in life compared with most autopsy studies..

All studies performed at major tertiary referral centers such as the Mayo Clinic are subject to such bias. Efforts were made to minimize this in the present clinical studies by recruitment of patients from the local community from the community clinics of the Mayo Medical Center. Patients were therefore attending the Mayo Clinic community clinics for primary care when they were recruited for either the Alzheimer disease or control groups of the clinical studies.

We also report increased islet amyloid in patients with Alzheimer disease compared with control subjects. However, we did not observe an increased frequency of brain amyloid in cases of type 2 diabetes, although in cases of type 2 diabetes that did have brain amyloid, the extent of this amyloid increased with longer duration of diabetes, a correlate that did not extend to the age of patients with type 2 diabetes. Taken together, these clinical and pathological studies support a possible link between the neurodegenerative processes that lead to loss of cortical brain cells in Alzheimer disease and the loss of ss-cells in type 2 diabetes..

In all these cases, the pathogenic mutation is in the protein that is deposited in the diseased tissue and in these cases the whole protein is deposited. In Alzheimer's disease, mutations in APP or presenilin 1 or 2 cause autosomal dominant disease and these are the substrate and proteases, respectively, which are responsible for the production of the deposited peptide, Ass. Thus, in all cases, the mutations lead to the disease by a mechanism that involves the deposition process. We briefly review this remarkably predictable biology, but also point out that it seems sporadic forms of all these diseases are predisposed to by genetic variability at the same loci, strongly suggesting that the quantity of the normal protein produced influences risk for the sporadic forms of the disease. The evidence for this assertion is strongest in Parkinson's disease (PD), where genetic variability in -synuclein expression affects risk of developing disease, although the oldest evidence for the notion that increased expression of normal sequence protein can lead to disease comes from the observation of Alzheimer's disease in trisomy 21 cases.

The loci underlying the autosomal dominant forms of Creuzfeldt to Jakob disease (1), frontal temporal dementia (2) and Parkinson's disease have been identified (3). In each case, the underlying locus has encoded the protein that is often deposited in the disease. In Creuzfeldt to Jakob disease, this is the prion protein: in frontal temporal dementia, it is tau, and in Parkinson's disease it is -synuclein. In Alzheimer's disease, the situation is a little more complex in that the deposited peptide, Ass, is derived from a fragment of the APP protein when metabolized by the -secretase complex: a key component of this complex are the presenilins and mutations in either APP or presenilin 1 or 2 can lead to disease (4 to 6)..

In each of these examples, the precise  pathologic species  of protein is obscure, if there is one, and it is debated whether the deposits themselves, or some intermediate species such as an oligomer, are responsible. This has been extensively investigated, with the balance of recent data favoring smaller intermediate species as the toxic entities (8); however, the generality of the fact that the mutated protein in each example can be deposited suggests that the process of pathogenicity is related to, although perhaps separable from, the process of deposition..

It has long been recognized that homozygosity at codon 129 predisposes to sporadic disease, presumably because of the necessity of prion to prion interactions and symmetry considerations (9,10). However, in addition to this well-established risk, recent genetic data have shown that the prion haplotype confers additional risk to idiopathic disease (11), clearly suggesting that genetic variability in prion expression contributes to disease risk. While these genetic data do not establish whether high expressors or low expressors are more susceptible, and since prion knockout mice are completely resistant to disease (12), it is most parsimonious to expect that those who express high levels of prion protein, and are homozygotes at codon 129, are most susceptible to disease..

This suggests that genetic variability at the APP locus contributes to disease risk, although the precise variability has not been identified. Such a finding is consistent with the longstanding observation that individuals with trisomy 21 inevitably develop Alzheimer pathology by their fifth decade (16); however, those few cases of Down syndrome caused by triplication of chromosome 21 distal to the APP gene do not develop Alzheimer's disease (17). Thus, having three copies of the APP gene leads to Alzheimer pathology in the fifth decade and as yet unidentified genetic variability at the APP locus appears to contribute to disease risk..

There are two genetic haplotype clades in Caucasian populations, designated H1 and H2, which differ in intron sizes, promoter sequence and wobble bases (19). The H1 haplotype has a frequency of 75% in Caucasians, and thus the H1 homozygotes constitute 60% of such populations. However, individuals with one of the three sporadic tau diseases, progressive supranuclear palsy (19), corticobasal degeneration (20) and argyrophilic grain disease (21), although not Pick's disease (22) or Guam disease (23), show a robust association with H1 homozygosity, with a frequency of H1 homozygotes being 95%. These data show clearly that variability in either tau expression or tau splicing variability (or both) contribute to disease risk. In this case, it is difficult to determine whether it is control of splicing or control of expression which is the key variable because it is indeed clear that many mutations which lead to Mendelian disease do so through altering alternate splicing (2,24)..

Perhaps most convincingly, triplication of the whole -synuclein locus causes autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease/Lewy body dementia with an onset age in the fourth decade (29) and duplication of the locus leads to disease in the fifth decade (30). Thus, with Parkinson's disease, there is a clear dose relationship between synuclein expression and disease occurrence, with normal genetic variability in the promoter contributing to the risk of typical idiopathic disease and with multiplications of the locus causing Mendelian disease with an onset age determined by the precise  dose .

Clearly such experiments are unlikely to yield data of direct relevance to subtle effects of variation on gene expression.

In Alzheimer's disease, where the deposited protein is a peptide fragment of the primary locus, mutations in the cleaving enzyme also lead to disease. These simple observations lead to some predictions: the mutant and wild-type proteins are quantitatively different, not qualitatively different in their properties in all cases; in other diseases where protein deposition is part of the process, such as the polyglutamine diseases and ALS, genetic variability in the promoter of the gene should be considered as a factor influencing, where applicable, risk of sporadic disease or age of onset of familial disease (see 35 for suggestions that this might also be the case in Huntington's disease); in polyglutamine diseases in which the deposited fragment is cleaved from a precursor molecule, genetic variability in the cleaving proteases or other interactors which influence stability should be assessed as a risk factor loci; other loci which impact on risk for these diseases in general, may merely cause their effect through altering the levels of the primary proteins, either because they are transcription factors, or because they are responsible for protein breakdown..

These simple observations lead to some predictions: the mutant and wild-type proteins are quantitatively different, not qualitatively different in their properties in all cases; in other diseases where protein deposition is part of the process, such as the polyglutamine diseases and ALS, genetic variability in the promoter of the gene should be considered as a factor influencing, where applicable, risk of sporadic disease or age of onset of familial disease (see 35 for suggestions that this might also be the case in Huntington's disease); in polyglutamine diseases in which the deposited fragment is cleaved from a precursor molecule, genetic variability in the cleaving proteases or other interactors which influence stability should be assessed as a risk factor loci; other loci which impact on risk for these diseases in general, may merely cause their effect through altering the levels of the primary proteins, either because they are transcription factors, or because they are responsible for protein breakdown..

CONCLUSION REFERENCES   The research of Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetics has been extremely prolific over the past decade, and currently more than 10 genes are reported to show either positive or negative evidence for disease association per month. Here, we review all 90 studies from 2003 reporting a total of 127 association findings between candidate genes and AD. While most positive results were largely contradictory, we identified three loci on chromosomes 6p21, 10q24, 11q23 that yielded positive results in three or more independent studies, in addition to the well-established AD association with the gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE). Based on these data, we suggest that it may be prudent for investigators to pay closer attention to issues such as power, replicability and haplotype structure prior to initial publication. This should serve to greatly decrease the likelihood of false positive and false negative findings reported in future years..
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	4	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION 2003: A GOOD VINTAGE... CONCLUSION REFERENCES   Several characteristics make the search for novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) genes particularly promising. First, and most importantly, the heritability of AD is high. This has been demonstrated in various studies examining familial segregation of the disease over the past decades (1 to 3). Accordingly, the probability of actually finding relevant disease-causing or predisposing genes is relatively high as well, possibly even more so than for other genetically complex neuropsychiatric disorders, like Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia or affective disorders (4). Thus far, in AD this has been achieved for four genes (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, APOE), but only variation in the latter also plays a significant role in the most common late-onset form of the disorder (see below). Fully penetrant mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2, on the other hand, lead to rare early-onset familial forms of AD via an increased generation of Ass42 and ss-amyloid deposition, a major neuropathological hallmark of the disease. Secondly, there is direct evidence, based on simulation as well as empirical data, for the presence of additional AD risk genes besides APOE. For instance, a recent simulation study predicted the existence of four to seven additional AD genes when searching for age of onset modifiers simulating a variety of different disease and inheritance models (3). This number corresponds well with empirical data obtained in full genome searches, which overlap on 11 chromosomes, six of which show  significant  results in at least one study (Table 1). Finally, the progressive neurodegeneration gradually leading to cognitive decline and dementia in AD patients exhibits distinct and well-established histopathological features upon post-mortem examination, allowing for the verification of  clinical  AD (5). Currently, the accuracy of a clinical AD diagnosis is near or beyond 90% in academic centers (6 to 8). This allows for a significant reduction of the number of phenocopies in study populations using published research criteria, and thereby increases the power of subsequent genetic or epidemiological analyses..
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	5	View this table:    Table 1. Overview of concordant linkage/association regions observed in full genome screens published until 2003   These disease-specific characteristics, together with the advent of relatively inexpensive and powerful high-throughput genotyping technologies, and the near completion of the human genome sequence have led to a steep increase in the number of laboratories studying the genetics of AD worldwide. To date, no less than 12 full-genome screens using linkage- or association-based methodologies have been published for AD, some using overlapping or identical samples, but each employing different sets of genetic markers and/or analytic strategies (8 to 19) (Table 1). On the other hand, the number of locus-specific, candidate gene-based AD association studies has now become nearly intractable. Over the course of 2003, more than 10 genes were reported to show either positive or negative evidence of association with different AD phenotypes per month in peer-reviewed journals as listed on NCBI's  PubMed . Despite these vast efforts, no single gene has yet emerged to attain nearly the degree of replication and consistency that has been observed by literally hundreds of laboratories studying the association of APOE-4 and AD. In this review, we present and discuss the findings of all genetic AD association studies published in 2003 (excluding those explicitly searching for the causes of early-onset familial AD cases, i.e. private mutations). Using these data as an example, we then attempt to pinpoint the methodological difficulties that are likely to underlie the remarkable failure to replicate genetic findings using current approaches..
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	6	   2003: A GOOD VINTAGE FOR AD GENETICS? TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION 2003: A GOOD VINTAGE... CONCLUSION REFERENCES   Genome screens As outlined above, the year 2003 has been almost unprecedented in terms of the number of studies attempting to unravel the causes of AD genetics. Three full-genome screens (8,18,19), using both association and genetic linkage methods, have been added to the nine studies already reported in the literature for late-onset AD. A study-by-study comparison using a P-value of 0.01 as cut-off reveals a total of 16 regions on 11 chromosomes that yield positive signals across at least two studies with markers no further than 25 Mb apart (Table 1). Interestingly, all chromosomes with the strongest and most consistent signals, i.e. 6, 9, 10, 12, 19 and 21, had already been implicated at least 3 years earlier, but received further support in 2003. Based on these criteria the only  new  AD region to emerge in 2003 is on chromosome 2p23 to 24, at a position between 19 and 29 Mb. Interestingly, this region was only implicated in studies using association methods and only in fairly isolated and homogeneous populations (i.e. the Finns and Wadi-Ara) (14,18). Note that inclusion and exclusion criteria applied here are arbitrary and as such may overestimate the total number of positive signals. They do, however, allow the comparison across a multitude of methodologically divergent approaches and should facilitate the interpretation of analyses based on actual candidate genes..
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	7	Candidate gene studies Searching  PubMed  (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/) with keywords  alzheimer* AND (association OR associated)  for all papers published between January 1 and December 31, 2003, retrieved a total of 1037 studies (on December 28, 2003), of which 90 directly deal with genetic association between candidate polymorphisms and AD. As can be seen in Table 2, these studies examined a total of 55 genetic loci ( locus  being a set of markers within the same 5 Mb genomic interval) on 20 different chromosomes. A total of 55 analyzed genes within these loci were found to be  positive  (as judged by the authors), while 68 tested  negative . Interestingly, even 10 years after its discovery, the largest number (n=18) of reports focusing on a single gene dealt with the association between APOE and AD, using new polymorphisms, new samples/ethnic groups or new phenotypes. When these studies were not considered, a total of 38 positive and 67 negative papers remained..
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	8	View this table:    Table 2. Overview of chromosomal loci tested for genetic association with AD in 2003   If 2003 represents one of the most prolific vintages for late-onset AD genetic studies, the next most pressing question is: did the large quantity of studies also dilute the quality of the product, perhaps even making for an unpalatable quaff? The answer, in our opinion, is yes, at least in the majority of cases. There is growing consensus that the success rate and reliability of genetic association studies in complex diseases depend on the fulfillment of several criteria (20,21), three of which are discussed in more detail below. These are in addition to the  classic  requirements of at least plausible biological and/or positional candidacy for any investigated locus, as well as direct proof of pathophysiological consequences of any positive disease association. While the former criterion is fulfilled for the vast majority of AD candidate genes investigated thus far, the latter condition has been more elusive. This is due to several factors that generally bedevil the study of genetic association in complex diseases, such as linkage disequilibrium with the actual (and functionally relevant) disease-modifying variant, small effect sizes (which impede the detection of significant effects using basic molecular and biochemical assays), and possibly the involvement of as yet unknown pathophysiological mechanisms. The situation of APOE-4 in AD serves as a good example: while the genetic association per se has been extremely well established over the past decade, there is still no consensus as to how this association translates pathophysiologically (22,23)..
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	9	Thus, before attempting to uncover the  functional consequences  of any putative new disease association, we propose that more emphasis must be placed on criteria that allow for a better distinction between false-positive as well as false-negative findings prior to initial publication..
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	10	Power: does the sample size and structure enable the investigators to detect effect sizes of only moderate or small extent? While this is an obvious concern in reports with a negative outcome, the power of a study also governs the rate of false positive findings, i.e. the probability that an observed significant association is indeed genuine and not only observed by chance (24 to 26). Other factors influencing the ability to detect meaningful effects include the attributable risk of the polymorphism to the overall genetic variance, degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the associated allele and the actual disease predisposing variant, mode of inheritance and, to a lesser extent, disease prevalence. While these variables are, of course, difficult to estimate when the true disease gene is unknown, power for any given sample size can fairly easily be calculated for a variety of possible and plausible scenarios. In practice, however, this still remains the exception. A recent study estimated that the minimal number of cases and controls sufficient to achieve 80% power at =0.05 is usually far greater than 200 when the actual disease allele is not tested directly, even under the most favorable of circumstances (26). It is interesting that, regardless of these estimates, 20% of all studies published in 2003 have still used smaller sample sizes and thus are probably not suitable for use in reaching any reliable conclusion..
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	11	Replicability: has the result been validated/replicated in an independent sample of sufficient size? While there have been reports of  significant  associations between putative candidate genes and AD on every chromosome in the human genome over the past 10 years (27), none of these findings with the exception of APOE-4 has yet been replicated consistently. Many a seemingly  positive  result could (and should) have been validated in an independent dataset prior to its first publication, as several authors have long been suggesting in guidelines for the proper  quality control  of genetic association findings (20,21,25,28,29). The current inflation of probable false-positive reports may have been avoided if independent replication had been sought earlier. If an independent sample cannot be found in-house, the establishment of at least temporary  consortia  between collaborative laboratories to test each other's positive signals prior to publication would represent an easy and effective means to restore credibility. Upon our review of the 2003 AD genetics literature, less than 20% of all studies either referred to findings in two or more independent samples at once, or were published in tandem with independent reports investigating the same candidate genes and/or genetic variants..

0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	13	Haplotype structure: have the authors made attempts to elucidate the structure of the underlying haplotype architecture? The more current and systematic assessment of haplotype structures at various regions throughout the genome in the past 3 to 4 years has emphasized the importance of performing haplotype- or systematic LD-analyses when searching for novel complex disease genes (30,31), especially when effect sizes are expected to be lower than those conferred by APOE-4. In addition to increasing the power of the analyses, this approach also reduces the number of statistical tests that need to be performed, which should lead to a further decrease of false-positive findings. Several very recently published complex disease associations would have been impossible to observe, without thorough assessment of the underlying haplotype architecture (32 to 34). Along these lines, recent studies on APOE have shown that this locus would have been easily identified by means of haplotype analysis alone, even without the prior knowledge of the 4 polymorphism (35,36). Yet, in 2003 only about one-third of all studies investigated more than one polymorphism per locus. Only half of these carried out a more or less  thorough  assessment of haplotype structure (i.e. four or more polymorphisms per gene)..

0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	17	Chromosome 6p21 This chromosomal region was implicated as harboring a putative AD gene as early as 1980, based on an association finding between variants in the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex region (HLA-A, at 30 Mb) and AD in a small case to control study (37). Two other potential AD candidates map within this 5 Mb interval, the genes encoding the hereditary haemochromatosis protein (HFE, at 26 Mb) and the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA, at 31 Mb). While in 2003 two studies reported significant evidence of association with the latter two genes (38,39), two other studies did not confirm these findings (40,41). Another candidate gene located in this region, HAPA1B, has been found to be associated with certain neuropsychological variables (42), but not disease risk itself (43). Finally, one study investigated variation in onset age as a function of the HLA A2-allele in a small sample of AD patients, but did not find any significant effects (44). A literature search for association studies with any of these genes including the years before 2003 yielded at least 15 positive studies, while 10 reports found no evidence of a genetic involvement of these factors. While there has been some evidence for a direct involvement of TNFA in Ass-production and toxicity (45), direct proof for a pathogenetic relevance for any of the other genes/proteins remains to be seen. Furthermore, the full-genome screens for AD genes have consistently yielded signals on 6p21 residing between 39 and 42 Mb, whereas the associated genes map 10 Mb further proximal. Thus, while there is increasing evidence supporting the existence of a putative AD locus on 6p21 in general, the possibility that the actual disease gene has not yet been identified cannot be excluded, despite the overlapping positive results from this year and past studies..

0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	19	Chromosome 10q24 Of the six candidate loci analyzed in the region between 10q21 and 10q25 in 2003, three were reported to be associated with AD phenotypes across multiple samples (i.e. CDC2/VR22, TNFRSF6/IDE and GSTO1/2). The only locus found to be associated by more than one group of investigators is located between 90 and 94 Mb and encompasses the genes TNFRSF6 (90 Mb) and IDE/KIFF11/HHEX (46 to 48). Probably the best candidate on biological grounds is IDE, encoding the insulin degrading enzyme (protein: IDE). This metalloprotease has been shown to degrade monomeric Ass before it can aggregate into oligomeric forms and, ultimately, into ss-amyloid plaques (49). While several issues of the proposed mode of action still remain controversial (e.g. the precise cellular location of Ass cleavage, relevance of IDE function/dysfunction on the development of AD), there are now a number of animal models available showing the predicted effects in vivo (50 to 52). Before 2003, there were two papers published showing allelic association with microsatellite markers in this region (53,54), while two reports did not find association with IDE variants or nearby markers and AD (55,56). Note that the data on one of the negative studies (55) actually largely overlaps with the positive paper by Edland et al. (46), with the important exception that the authors of the first paper did not account for potential interactions between IDE and APOE 4-status. This may be crucial, since the latter study only found a significant effect of IDE on AD risk in individuals lacking the APOE 4-allele. Clearly, more studies on independent samples of sufficient size are necessary to further elucidate the potential role of IDE variants on the development of AD in the more general population..
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	20	In addition to the IDE locus, a total of four other genes on the long arm of chromosome 10 were found to be associated with AD. Two of these (CDC2 and VR22) map 30 Mb proximal of IDE, while the other two (GSTO1/2 and PRSS11) map 10 to 30 Mb distal. While none of these associations has yet been confirmed in independent AD samples, it is noteworthy that two of these genes were also found to be associated in other neurodegenerative illnesses, frontotemporal dementia (CDC2) (57) and Parkinson's disease (GSTO1/2) (58), potentially suggesting a more common pathway leading to neuronal cell death across these syndromes. CDC2 encodes for the cell division cycle 2 protein which is involved in the phosphorylation of both tau and APP, and is found in neurons bearing neurofibrillary tangles. GSTO1 and 2 encode for glutathione S-transferase omega-1 and -2, which are involved in the physiological response to oxidative stress, and may in particular be responsible for regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines like IL1-ss. Thus, while these are all plausible AD candidate genes on positional as well as biological/biochemical grounds, further studies are still necessary to elucidate their proposed roles in influencing the risk and/or age-at-onset for AD in the general population..

Yet, there were a total of three studies showing significant association with an AD candidate gene in 2003: BACE, encoding the ss-site APP cleaving enzyme (ss-secretase) (59 to 61). This protein is an excellent AD candidate on biochemical grounds as it is only after the ss-secretase cleavage of APP that Ass can be liberated from its precursor via -secretase cleavage. Most interestingly and in contrast to all other putative AD associations discussed above there appears to be a high degree of consistency with respect to the site and allelic nature underlying these findings: all positive studies, including the initial report by Nowotny and colleagues published in 2001 (62), observe over-representations of the G-allele of a synonymous SNP located at codon 262 (in exon 5) in AD cases as compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, in all of these studies the observed effect was most pronounced in carriers of the APOE 4-allele, yielding significantly elevated odds ratios ranging from 2 to 7..

However, it must be pointed out that one of these only studied early-onset familial AD cases (63), and the remaining studies did not account for the potential interaction with the APOE 4-allele (64 to 66). Unless this is done, similar to the situation encountered for the variants tested in IDE (see above), no firm conclusions can be reached as to whether or not the exon 5 polymorphism in BACE is a genetic risk factor for AD in these samples. Thus, of the three known APP-cleaving enzymes and associated proteins [- (ADAM9,10 and 17), ss- (BACE, BACE2) and -secretase (PSEN1, APH1A, NCSTN, PEN2)], most of which have already been tested for genetic association with AD phenotypes, BACE currently shows the most promise of being a genuine and relevant risk factor for late-onset AD. As is the case for all other putative AD genes, more studies using sufficiently sized samples and appropriate analytic strategies need to be performed before more general conclusions can be reached. Note, that the first study examining the putative genetic role of BACE in late-onset AD in 2004 also reports a significant effect of the exon 5 polymorphism in a case-control sample of Chinese origin (67)..

CONCLUSION REFERENCES   While the year 2003 has been extremely productive in terms of studies examining potential associations between candidate genes and AD phenotypes, the vast majority of results as in previous years remains controversial. While in some cases this could be due to factors that are disease-specific (e.g. larger than anticipated genetic heterogeneity and/or very small effect sizes of individual risk alleles), a good proportion of these controversies are probably caused by methodological issues. Based on recent empirical and simulation data regarding the genetic make-up of complex diseases and the power of association studies in general, we propose that more attention should be paid to: (i) providing power estimates based on the structure of the analyzed sample for a variety of effect sizes and allele frequencies; (ii) replicating any positive signal in at least one independent population of sufficient size and power prior to initial publication; and (iii) thoroughly assessing the haplotype structure of any investigated locus, especially before reaching any negative conclusions. Together with statistical techniques that take into account potential interactions with other genetic and non-genetic factors, and that allow for an adequate correction of multiple comparisons, adherence to these criteria should ensure the successful distinction between clinically relevant and irrelevant/false-positive findings. Eventually, as in a good vintage of wine, this strategy will elevate the quality of AD genetics research to be on par with its quantity..

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	4	The intramembranous -secretase cleavage of the -amyloid precursor protein (APP) is dependent on biologically active presenilins (PS). Notch also undergoes a similar PS-dependent -secretase-like cleavage, resulting in the liberation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which is critically required for developmental signal transduction. -Secretase processing of APP results in the production of a similar fragment called AICD (APP intracellular domain), which may function in nuclear signaling as well. AICD, like NICD, is rapidly removed. By using a battery of protease inhibitors we demonstrate that AICD, in contrast to NICD, is degraded by a cytoplasmic metalloprotease. In vitro degradation of AICD can be reconstituted with cytoplasmic fractions obtained from neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Taking into account the inhibition profile and the cytoplasmic localization, we identified three candidate enzymes (neurolysin, thimet oligopeptidase, and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), also known as insulysin), which all are involved in the degradation of bioactive peptides in the brain. When insulin, a well characterized substrate of IDE, was added to the in vitro degradation assay, removal of AICD was efficiently blocked. Moreover, overexpression of IDE resulted in enhanced degradation of AICD, whereas overexpression of the inactive IDE E111Q mutant did not affect AICD degradation. Finally, immunodepletion of IDE significantly reduced the AICD degrading activity. Therefore our data demonstrate that IDE, which is one of the proteases implicated in the removal of extracellular A, also removes the cytoplasmic product of -secretase cleaved APP.

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	6	Current evidence strongly implicates that aggregation and deposition of amyloid -peptide (A)1 in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients is an invariant pathological feature (1). A is generated from the -amyloid precursor protein (APP) by endoproteolytic processing. Two sequential cleavages, first by -secretase and then followed by -secretase, are required to liberate A (for review, see Refs. 2 and 3). The intramembranous -secretase cleavage is dependent on biologically active presenilins (PS) that may be unusual aspartyl proteases (4, 5), which probably constitute the active site of -secretase (for review, see Refs. 2 and 3). PSs are not only involved in proteolytic processing of APP but also in a similar intramembraneous cut of Notch (6). Notch, like APP, is a type I transmembrane protein that undergoes very similar endoproteolytic processing pathways (for review, see Refs. 2 and 3). After ectodomain shedding, Notch is cleaved within or close to its transmembrane domain by the -secretase-like S3 protease activity. The S3 cut finally liberates the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), a key molecule in developmental signal transduction (7). Cleavage of Notch at S3 is PS-dependent and can be blocked by -secretase inhibitors (6). Consistent with a role of PSs in Notch signaling, the PS1/PS2 double knockout in mice has a phenotype similar to that of Notch1/ mice (8), and Notch cleavage is completely inhibited in PS-deficient cells (9, 10). The requirement of PSs in both NICD formation and -secretase cleavage of APP provided the basis for the hypothesis that the -secretase-generated cytoplasmic domain of APP may also carry out an important function in nuclear signaling. Recently, several reports (11-15) described the -secretase-generated cytoplasmic fragment of APP, which we termed AICD (APP intracellular domain) (13) in analogy to NICD. AICD is generated by a PS-dependent mechanism, since a PS1 gene knockout as well as a "dominant negative" PS1 mutation (D385N) inhibited AICD generation (13). Moreover, -secretase inhibitors, including ones that are known to bind to PSs, also blocked AICD generation in vivo and in vitro (12, 13, 15). Interestingly, the N terminus of AICD is predominantly generated by a cut between amino acids 49 and 50 of the -amyloid domain and not by the expected -secretase cut after amino acids 40 or 42 (13-15). This cleavage releases in vivo a 50-amino acid-long AICD fragment into the cytoplasm but not the predicted 57- or 59-amino acid fragment. Sequence comparison revealed that this cleavage occurs at a very similar position as the S3 cleavage of Notch (13-15). Taken together, these analogies between APP and Notch processing may favor the idea that AICD, like NICD, has a physiological function in nuclear signal transduction. Indeed, recent findings with highly sensitive reporter gene assays supported the hypothesis that AICD may be involved in gene transcription (16). However, AICD alone was not sufficient to allow the detection of a significant transcriptional activity in the reporter gene assays. Only upon co-transfection of Fe65, a nuclear adaptor protein that has been shown to bind to the APP cytoplasmic tail (17-19), a significant transcriptional activity was observed (16). This may be related to the observation that the recombinant 59-amino acid AICD-like molecules are stabilized by the co-expression of Fe65 (20), although the latter has not been confirmed by others (21)..

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	8	If AICD plays a role in signal transduction, its activity may be regulated. In the case of NICD, a ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway prevents NICD accumulation and constitutive signaling (6, 22, 23). AICD is also rapidly degraded but apparently by a protease activity different from the proteasome (12, 21). We therefore searched for the protease activity involved in AICD degradation. Surprisingly, we found that AICD can be efficiently degraded by insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a thiol-dependent metalloprotease known to degrade insulin, glucagon, and other peptide hormones (24). Interestingly, IDE is also implicated in the clearance of extracellular A (for review, see Ref. 25). Our data therefore suggest that therapeutic stimulation of IDE activity to remove A will also affect AICD metabolism and its potential function in nuclear signal transduction.

However, the in vitro generated AICD is extremely rapidly degraded, and the addition of a protease inhibitor mix containing EDTA is necessary to stabilize AICD (11, 12). To identify the protease involved in this extremely rapid degradation pathway, the in vitro assay was carried out in the presence of a variety of protease inhibitors (Fig. 1). In the absence of any inhibitor, no AICD could be detected, demonstrating that at 37  degrees C AICD degradation is even faster than de novo synthesis. Consistent with previous results a general protease inhibitor mix including EDTA inhibited AICD degradation. The additional presence of the -secretase inhibitor DAPT inhibited AICD generation as expected (13). Interestingly, the protease inhibitor mix without EDTA did not block AICD degradation, suggesting the involvement of a divalent metal ion-dependent proteolytic activity in AICD generation. Indeed, the metal-chelators EDTA and PNT allowed robust accumulation of AICD when used either alone or in combination. However, the more specific metalloprotease inhibitors phosphoramidon and bestatin, an inhibitor of aminopeptidases, did not inhibit degradation of AICD. AICD degradation was not affected by inhibitors of cysteine proteases (E64, leupeptin), serine proteases (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and aspartyl proteases (pepstatin) (data not shown). Interestingly, the potent proteasome inhibitors clasto-lactacystin -lactone and MG132 also did not block AICD degradation (Fig. 1). This is in contrast to NICD that has been shown to be rapidly degraded by a ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway (6, 22, 23). Thus, although AICD and NICD are both generated by a PS-dependent protease, they are degraded by different proteolytic activities. Taken together, we conclude that most likely a metalloprotease is involved in AICD degradation..

We first assayed crude membranes for AICD degradation after alkaline extraction with Na2CO3 that separates peripheral from integral membrane proteins (30). As shown in Fig. 2A, AICD could be recovered in the absence of PNT/EDTA from Na2CO3-extracted membranes, suggesting that the AICD degrading activity is either peripherally attached to the membrane or soluble. In addition, these data confirm previous findings that -secretase is integrally membrane-bound (11). We next separated crude membranes from residual cytosol by additional centrifugation. As shown above, when crude membranes were used in the in vitro assay, AICD could not be recovered in the absence of PNT/EDTA (Fig. 2B) due to its rapid degradation. In contrast, when crude membranes were used after additional re-centrifugation at 100,000  x  g, robust accumulation of AICD was observed in the absence of PNT/EDTA (Fig. 2B). Thus, these data suggest that the AICD degrading activity is a soluble protease that is primarily located within the cytoplasm. To further prove the cytoplasmic localization of the AICD degrading activity, the in vitro degradation assay was performed with washed cytosol-free membranes, which allowed robust accumulation of AICD in the absence of PNT/EDTA. The degrading activity could then be reconstituted by the addition of increasing amounts of cytosol from HEK293 or mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells (Fig. 2C). From these results we conclude that a cytoplasmic metalloprotease present in peripheral as well as in neuronal cells is involved in AICD degradation..

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	33	Identification of Candidate Enzymes Responsible for AICD Degradation-- Based on the inhibition profile and the cytoplasmic localization of the AICD degrading activity, we searched the MEROPS protease data base (www.merops.co.uk) for candidate AICD-degrading enzymes. This search revealed that three cytoplasmic candidate proteases from two metalloprotease families (M3A and M16A families) could be responsible for the degradation of AICD: thimet oligopeptidase (TOP, M3A family), neurolysin (M3A family), and IDE (insulysin, M16A family). Consistent with these candidate proteases being thiol group-dependent (31, 32), the SH-alkylating agents NEM strongly inhibited AICD degradation (Fig. 3A). Next, to discriminate which of these proteases could be involved in AICD degradation, the in vitro assay was carried out in the presence or absence of dynorphin A-(1-13), a known inhibitor of TOP and neurolysin (31) and potentially also of IDE. The dipeptide Pro-Ile, a highly specific neurolysin inhibitor (31), cFP-AAY-pAB (cFP), a potent TOP and less potent neurolysin inhibitor (33), and insulin, a well characterized substrate of IDE, that functions as competitive inhibitor, were investigated as well (24). As shown in Fig. 3B, weak inhibition of AICD degradation by dynorphin A-(1-13) suggests either TOP or neurolysin as a candidate protease without excluding IDE. However, Pro-Ile did not block AICD degradation ruling out neurolysin as a candidate protease (Fig. 3B). Since cFP did also not block AICD degradation (Fig. 3B), IDE remained the only candidate for AICD degradation. Indeed, insulin competed for the AICD degrading activity present in cytosol derived from N2a cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). Bovine serum albumin used to control for unspecific inhibition of degradation had no effect (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained with cytosol from HEK293 cells (data not shown). Thus, these data indicate that IDE may be one of the AICD-degrading enzymes in N2a and HEK293 cells..

Crude membrane preparations were assayed for AICD degradation as in Fig. 1. C, dose-dependent inhibition of AICD degradation by insulin. AICD was generated by incubation of cytosol-free membranes for 2 h at 37  degrees C and subsequently separated from the membranes by ultracentrifugation.

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	35	IDE Degrades AICD-- To prove whether IDE is an AICD-degrading enzyme, we generated HEK293 cell lines stably overexpressing rat IDE or an inactive IDE mutant (IDE E111Q) in which the glutamate of the HXXEH active site motif was changed to glutamine (34, 35). As shown in Fig. 4A, immunoblotting of cytosol fractions confirmed overexpression of wt and mutant IDE proteins. Cytosol fractions derived from cells overexpressing wt IDE contained significantly higher AICD degrading activity than cytosol fractions from IDE E111Q overexpressing cells (Fig. 4B). Finally, cytosol of HEK293 cells was immunodepleted of endogenous IDE by immunoprecipitation with excess amounts of an anti-IDE antibody (Fig. 4C). AICD generation was then assayed from cytosol-free membranes in the presence of these fractions. As shown in Fig. 4D, a dose-dependent AICD degradation was observed with non-depleted control fractions in contrast to a markedly reduced AICD degrading activity in IDE-depleted cytosol fractions. Thus, these data strongly suggest that IDE is a major AICD-degrading enzyme..

Very recently the corresponding cytoplasmic fragment of APP, AICD, has been identified (13-15). AICD is generated by a remarkably similar molecular mechanism like NICD (Fig. 5). If AICD functions in nuclear signaling as proposed by Cao and Sudhof (16), one may expect a rapid clearance of this fragment, since constitutive uncontrolled signaling must be avoided. Indeed this is the case for NICD, which is rapidly removed by an ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway (6, 22, 23). Here we show that AICD is not degraded by the proteasome but by a completely different protease, namely IDE (Fig. 5). The biochemical properties of IDE make it an ideal candidate for AICD degradation. It is highly expressed in the same cellular compartment as AICD; it is a common enzyme in brain tissue, where abundant APP expression is observed, and it preferentially degrades small cytoplasmic peptides of about 20-50 amino acids in length (for review, see Ref. 24)..

AICD and NICD are generated by PS-dependent -secretase and S3 protease cleavages at similar sites within the membrane. Following liberation from the membrane, NICD, and probably also AICD, translocate to the nucleus. In the nucleus NICD activates the transcription of Notch target genes. Proteasomal degradation of NICD prevents its accumulation and constitutive signaling. In contrast to NICD, AICD is degraded by IDE that, like neprilysin, is also involved in the extracellular degradation of secreted A..

However, this is in contrast to endogenous AICD with the correct N terminus that has so far not been detected within the nucleus. Due to the rather rapid turnover of endogenous AICD and the apparent lack of its nuclear localization, one may question a function of this small peptide in nuclear signaling. However, one needs to point out that NICD could not be detected in the nucleus for a long time, because sensitive techniques have been lacking. Indeed using hypersensitive reporter gene assays Cao and Sudhof (16) could provide indirect evidence that a cytoplasmic fragment of APP (which was not identical to the in vivo existing AICD) complexed with Fe65, and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 could mediate gene transcription. However, nuclear transport of authentic AICD and the formation of a nuclear Tip60 Fe65 AICD complex remains to be shown. The identification of IDE as an AICD-degrading enzyme may facilitate research on the putative role of AICD in nuclear signaling, since this function could be strongly enhanced by the inhibition of AICD degradation..

Surprisingly, A-degrading IDE appears to be released from living cells (36, 37) in very small amounts by so far unknown cellular mechanisms. In contrast to the secreted A, AICD is released into the cytoplasm where it is rapidly degraded by IDE. Since IDE is one of the A-clearing enzymes, it is tempting to increase its activity to lower the amyloid burden in Alzheimer's disease patients. Indeed this was the major goal behind the identification of the A-degrading enzymes. The finding that IDE is not only involved in A degradation but also in the removal of AICD may have important implications for therapeutic strategies involving the manipulation of IDE activity. If one assumes that AICD is required for nuclear signaling, its enhanced removal will interfere with AICD-mediated functions. Moreover, other therapeutic strategies such as the inhibition of -secretase activity will also interfere with AICD production. In that case a major reduction in ACID-mediated signaling may occur, which could also have detrimental implications. Careful analysis of AICD function and metabolism is therefore required not only to understand the biological function of APP in nuclear signaling but also for the safety of ongoing therapeutic trials.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   We have developed yeast as an expression and genetic system for functional studies of the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which cleaves and inactivates certain small peptide molecules, including insulin and the neurotoxic A peptide. We show that heterologously expressed rat IDE is enzymatically active, as judged by the ability of IDE-containing yeast extracts to cleave insulin in vitro. We also show that IDE can promote the in vivo production of the yeast a-factor mating pheromone, a function normally attributed to the yeast enzymes Axl1p and Ste23p. However, IDE cannot substitute for the function of Axl1p in promoting haploid axial budding and repressing haploid invasive growth, activities that require an uncharacterized activity of Axl1p. Particulate fractions enriched for Axl1p or Ste23p are incapable of cleaving insulin, suggesting that the functional conservation of these enzymes may not be bidirectionally conserved. We have made practical use of our genetic system to confirm that residues composing the extended zinc metalloprotease motif of M16A family enzymes are required for the enzymatic activity of IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p. We have determined that IDE and Axl1p both require an intact C terminus for optimal activity. We expect that the tractable genetic system that we have developed will be useful for investigating the enzymatic and structure/function properties of IDE and possibly for the identification of novel IDE alleles having altered substrate specificity..

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE1; EC 3.4.24.56 [EC] ) has broad substrate specificity, being able to cleave and inactivate a number of small molecules, including the A peptides and insulin (1 to 3). In animal models, IDE deficiency correlates with increased levels of insulin and A and increased risks of type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease (4 to 6). Despite these and other findings, the biological role of IDE and its importance in the clearance of insulin and A remains to be fully clarified (7)..
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	6	The Ste23p and Axl1p proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have significant sequence homology to IDE (36 and 19% identity, respectively) (8). Genetic and mutational studies indicate that Ste23p and Axl1p are required for the proteolytic maturation of the yeast a-factor mating pheromone, a lipid-modified peptide that is produced by a multistep process (9, 10). This pheromone is produced by MATa haploid cells and is required for yeast mating, the fusion of MATa and MAT haploid cells to form a diploid cell. Although Ste23p and Axl1p can independently promote a-factor maturation, the enzymes are not fully redundant. Ste23p is significantly less efficient than Axl1p at producing biologically active pheromone (9)..

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	8	Axl1p has several cellular roles. In addition to its role in pheromone production, Axl1p is required for the efficient post-conjugation fusion of haploid mating partners (11). This role may be indirectly related to the ability of Axl1p to produce a-factor, because limiting levels of pheromone similarly lead to fusion defects (12). Axl1p is also required for maintenance of the axial budding pattern that is characteristic of haploid yeast (8, 9). In the absence of Axl1p, haploid yeasts exhibit a bipolar budding pattern that is typical of diploid cells. The function of Axl1p in this process does not require its proteolytic activity, suggesting that Axl1p is a bi-functional enzyme (9). Axl1p also represses the invasive growth of haploid yeast (13, 14). Whether the proteolytic, bud site selection, or another activity of Axl1p is required for this process has not been reported. By contrast to Axl1p, the only reported cellular role for Ste23p is in a-factor production. Additional functions for this enzyme are likely because Ste23p is expressed in both the MAT and diploid cell types that do not produce a-factor.2.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	10	IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p are members of the M16A protease subfamily. M16A proteases are characterized by a core inverted zinc metalloprotease motif that is typically located within the first 200 residues of these enzymes and a pair of glutamic acid residues that are 70 and 77 amino acids distal to the core motif (i.e. HXXEHX69EX6E). The spacing between the core motif and the distal glutamates is invariant for all 46 M16A enzymes identified so far, except in the case of Axl1p where the spacing is 76 residues. The histidine residues and most distal glutamate residue are putative zinc ligands, and mutational alteration of these residues inactivates IDE and Axl1p (9, 15, 16). Some members of the M16A subfamily, including IDE, are sensitive to thiol modifiers, suggesting that a cysteine residue(s) is critical for proper structure of the active site or the overall tertiary or quaternary structure of these proteins (1, 15). Sequence alignment of IDE and its yeast orthologs reveals two conserved cysteine residues. One is within the core metalloprotease motif, and this residue can reportedly be altered without affecting enzymatic activity (15). The other conserved cysteine is exactly 67 amino acids distal to the extended motif (HXXEHX69EX6EX67C). This distal cysteine is not conserved in Escherichia coli Protease III, a bacterial M16A enzyme that is insensitive to thiol modifiers (17)..

To this end, we present evidence indicating that rat IDE can substitute for Axl1p and Ste23p in a-factor production but not for the other known functions of Axl1p. More importantly, these findings establish yeast as a genetically tractable system for future studies of IDE function. We have made practical use of this system to create and characterize novel mutations that alter the enzymatic properties of IDE..

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	20	  The general strategy for the epitope tagging of AXL1, STE23, and IDE encoding plasmids involved the creation of a novel restriction site at the end of the respective open reading frame and subcloning of a triply iterated HA tag. pWS371 (CEN URA3 AXL1-2HA) was created by modifying p80 as follows. An NcoI site was inserted immediately prior to the stop codon of AXL1 into which a DNA fragment encoding a triply iterated HA tag was inserted; in actuality, two tandem copies of the tag were inserted. The plasmid was further modified to delete a portion of the 5'-untranslated region corresponding to an XhoI fragment in order to reduce the overall size of this plasmid from 12.1 to 10.6 kb; this deletion had no effect on protein expression. pWS482 (CEN URA3 STE23-2HA) was created by modifying p137 in a similar manner to that described for p80. In this instance, a BamHI site was introduced immediately prior to the stop codon of STE23 into which a triply iterated HA tag was inserted; as with pWS371, two tandem copies of the tag were actually inserted. pWS511 (2 micro URA3 PPGK-IDE-HA) was created by PCR amplification of IDE from pSR-rat IDE such that the PCR product had ends homologous to the parent yeast vector (pSM703) and a BglII restriction site immediately before the stop codon of IDE (21). The BglII site was used for insertion of the triply iterated HA epitope tag. pWS496 is identical to pWS511 except that it contains two copies of the triply iterated HA tag. Restriction digest analysis and DNA sequencing were used to confirm the presence of the tag in each of the plasmids described above..

In brief, a DNA fragment encoding an appropriate segment of the target open reading frame was amplified by PCR where one of the oligonucleotides contained the mutation of interest and typically a silent restriction site. The DNA fragments were co-transformed with a target plasmid that had been linearized or gapped with restriction enzymes near the intended site of mutation. Recombinant plasmids were recovered from yeast, amplified in E. coli, and screened by restriction analysis and/or sequencing to verify the presence of the mutation. All mutant alleles were confirmed by immunoblot to encode the full-length protein..

DNA sequencing of an intermediate plasmid in the construction pWS482 revealed an extra nucleotide near the 3' end of the open reading frame that was not present in the public sequence of STE23. The presence of the extra nucleotide was confirmed in the STE23 sequence derived from three different sources: p137 and PCR products derived from chromosomal amplification of the STE23 gene from two distinct strain backgrounds (IH1783 and YPH499). An independent group (22) has proposed recently the identical sequence annotation as part of an effort to identify mistakes in published genome sequences. The extra nucleotide alters and extends the translation of the STE23 open reading frame such that amino acids 971 to 988 now code for 18 distinct amino acids and an additional 39 amino acids are gained as an extension to the original proposed translation..

In brief, master plates were prepared by patching MATa yeast strains expressing Axl1p, Ste23p, or IDE onto YEPD agar plates.

We also observed that IDE and Ste23p were expressed at 10 times higher levels than Axl1p as determined by comparison of immunoblot signals. The constitutive phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter was used to drive IDE expression, so the abundant expression of IDE was not unexpected. Native promoters were used to drive Ste23p and Axl1p expression, and the relative abundance of Ste23p over Axl1p was somewhat unexpected, especially because Ste23p does not promote a-factor production as efficiently as Axl1p. Thus, the reason for the decreased ability of Ste23p to promote mating cannot be simply attributed to reduced protein expression by comparison to Axl1p..

We have taken advantage of this property of yeast mating to evaluate the effectiveness of IDE in rescuing the mating defect of yeast lacking both Ste23p and Axl1p. As expected, we observed that decreasing nutrient conditions correlated with decreased mating for all strains. Ste23p and IDE-expressing strains showed significant reductions in mating relative to the Axl1p-expressing strain (Fig. 3A). Epitope-tagged versions of these enzymes had a similar activity profile in this assay (Fig. 3B). The relatively poor ability of Ste23p to promote mating, with respect to Axl1p, is consistent with previous reports on the properties of this enzyme and may be attributable to a number of factors, including altered substrate specificity and/or an altered subcellular localization pattern that prevents interaction with substrates (9). Likewise, the reduced mating observed for IDE may be attributable to similar factors. The reduced mating observed for IDE and Ste23p-expressing cells is not simply due to low expression of these enzymes because both are expressed at significantly higher levels than Axl1p (see Fig. 1)..

A, the mating competence of MATa ste23 axl1 cells transformed with the indicated M16A enzyme encoded on a plasmid was evaluated using a patch mating test. The selective growth of diploid cells on the minimal media is indicative of mating. Patch mating tests were conducted using MAT lys1 lawns containing various amounts of nutrients (100, 10, and 1% YEPD; top to bottom). Lowering the amount of YEPD in the lawn increases the stringency of the mating test and allows for discrimination of differences in mating efficiency not otherwise observable under permissive mating conditions (100% YEPD). B, patch mating tests were conducted as in A but using MATa strains expressing HA-epitope tagged M16A proteases under mildly stringent mating conditions (10% YEPD). C, the a-factor produced by each of the strains described in B was recovered from the walls of culture tubes using an organic solvent, and concentrated samples were analyzed by a spot halo test. Each strain was grown to saturation in the same volume of media. The formation of a spot in the lawn of MAT (RC757) cells is indicative of the presence of pheromone in the sample, and the relative pheromone potency can be determined by serial dilution of the sample. The highest dilution having activity is referred to as the end point and is equivalent to a concentration of 12 pg/ microl of a-factor (28). D, 2-fold serial dilutions of the IDE sample prepared in YEPD were spotted onto a lawn of RC631 (MATa sst2-1 his6 met1 can1 cyh2 rme ade2-1 ura1) serving as a control for the possibility that a toxic product was being produced by the IDE-expressing strain (27). The strains used were IH1783 transformed with pRS316 (wild type (WT)), and Y272 transformed with pRS316 (vector), p80 (AXL1), p137 (STE23), pWS491 (IDE), pWS371 (AXL1-2HA), pWS482 (STE23-2HA), or pWS496 (IDE-2HA)..

Thus, we compared the relative amounts of a-factor produced by these strains over the lifetime of a culture. We used a bioassay that relies on the natural growth-arrest response of MAT cells to the a-factor pheromone to detect and quantifiably measure a-factor activity in our samples. Our analysis revealed that both IDE and Ste23p-expressing strains produce significantly less a-factor than an Axl1p-expressing strain, despite the fact that IDE and Ste23p are significantly overexpressed relative to Axl1p (Fig. 3C). The IDE-derived sample was also bioassayed using MATa cells. These cells fail to undergo growth arrest in response to the a-factor pheromone and thus served as a control for the unlikely scenario that IDE-expressing strains were producing a toxic secreted product. No growth inhibition of MATa cells was observed with the IDE-derived sample (Fig. 3D)..

Alterations to the chemical form of a-factor (e.g. lipid removal or primary sequence alterations) can impact the function of this pheromone (37). For example, a-factor lacking a tyrosine residue has 25% of the biological activity of full-length pheromone as judged by yeast mating tests (37). Thus, the reduced production of a-factor pheromone by IDE and Ste23p-expressing yeast could be attributable to cleavage of the a-factor precursor at a site other than the Asn-Tyr cleavage site recognized by Axl1p. To determine whether the pheromone products produced by IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p were identical, we determined the mass of the a-factor species generated by these enzymes using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectroscopy. Several major species were detected in these samples, including a 1629-Da peak that corresponds exactly to the mass of bona fide a-factor (Fig. 4, A to C; IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p samples, respectively). This species was not in the negative control (Fig. 4D). The 1629-Da species was still observed in the samples after the data were de-isotoped (Fig. 4, E to G) and remained absent in the negative control (Fig. 4H). Based on these observations, we reasoned that the 1629-Da species is indeed a-factor, which implies that IDE, Ste23p and Axl1p have similar cleavage specificities..

To test this hypothesis, we created site-directed and deletion mutations of IDE and tested the ability of these mutants to promote mating. Using our genetic system, we confirmed that residues comprising the core metalloprotease motif (HXXEH) of IDE were essential for promoting mating (Fig. 5A). These residues were required for the activity of Ste23p and Axl1p as well (Fig. 5, B and C, respectively). The most distal glutamate of the extended motif (HXXEHX69EX6E) was also determined to be essential for the activity of all three enzymes, whereas the penultimate glutamate was dispensable for Axl1p activity. The penultimate glutamate is required for the activity of mitochondrial processing peptidase, an M16B protease, and has been proposed to aid in metal coordination of this enzyme (38)..

Independent mutations at these residues did not alter the abilities of IDE, Ste23p, or Axl1p to promote mating (Fig. 5). Mutation of the proximal cysteine of IDE (C110A) reportedly does not alter the thiol sensitivity profile of IDE (15), and similarly, we found that mutation of the distal cysteine of IDE (C257A) had no effect on the thiol sensitivity of IDE.2 We also determined that combining the mutations in one molecule (C110A/C257A) did not alter mating function (Fig. 5A). Moreover, the sensitivity of IDE to thiol modifiers was unaffected.2 Similar results were observed when other cysteine residues that are conserved between IDE and Ste23p or Axl1p (C819A and C414A, respectively) were mutated (Fig. 5A)..

In the absence of structural data for these enzymes, we sought to determine whether the catalytic domain of IDE was self-contained within the N-terminal portion of the enzyme. C-terminally truncated forms of IDE were created and evaluated for the ability to promote pheromone production. These truncations were created as fusions to GFP, which in and of itself did not alter the ability of IDE to function (Fig. 6A; IDE 1 to 1019). Systematic deletions of the C terminus of the IDE revealed that relatively short truncations inactivated IDE as judged by yeast mating tests. Deletion analysis of Axl1p revealed a similar requirement for an intact C terminus, although the deletion required for Axl1p inactivation was considerably larger (Fig. 6A, Axl1p 1 to 1076). Site-directed mutation of a residue conserved between IDE and Axl1p that was at the functional/nonfunctional truncation boundary of Axl1p (i.e. Ser-965 in IDE and Ser-1081 in Axl1p) did not reveal an essential requirement for this residue in either enzyme (Fig. 5)..

We observed decreased expression for certain truncations, suggesting that the C terminus of IDE, for reasons unknown, is required for normal steady state expression. Decreased expression alone cannot account for the loss of activity for IDE, because one nonfunctional truncation (IDE-(1 to 973)) was expressed comparably to the full-length IDE-GFP fusion.

Both in vitro and in vivo model systems have led to a better understanding of the biochemical and physiological properties of IDE, which has proposed roles in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease (4, 39 to 41)..

Plasmids encoding HA-tagged Axl1p, Axl1p H68A, and IDE were transformed into an axl1 haploid strain. Equal cell density suspensions of these strains were spotted onto SC-ura and allowed to grow 4 days (A), after which the plates were washed with running water to remove surface lying cells (B). The presence of cells after the washing step is indicative of invasive growth. Strains used are Sy3687 transformed with pRS316 (wild type (WT)), and Sy3721 (axl1::HIS3) transformed with pRS316 (vector), pWS371 (AXL1-2HA), pWS388 (axl1-2HA H68A), or pWS496 (IDE-2HA)..
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	84	  In this study, we have developed yeast as a tractable genetic model system for studying the functional properties of IDE. We have determined that yeast can be used to express a functional form of IDE and, more importantly, that IDE can promote a-factor production, an activity normally associated with the yeast enzymes Axl1p and Ste23p that have homology to IDE. These results imply that members of the M16A metalloprotease family, to which these enzymes belong, may have shared substrate specificity. The fact that all three enzymes can promote a-factor production supports this hypothesis. However, our inability to demonstrate insulin cleavage by the yeast enzymes implies that the substrate specificity of Ste23p and Axl1p may be more restricted. Whether the yeast enzymes cleave other established IDE substrates is currently under investigation. We are also investigating the ability of other M16A enzymes to cleave a-factor, because the studies of these enzymes may benefit from the development of a tractable genetic system..

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	86	An additional finding from our study is that IDE is enriched but does not exclusively partition into a yeast particulate fraction. We suspect that heterologously expressed IDE is either being incorporated into membranes as a loosely associated peripheral membrane protein or it is assembling into a macromolecular complex that partially sediments under the conditions used for isolation of the particulate fraction. Although IDE reportedly associates with peroxisomes, this localization is unlikely under our experimental conditions because we did not impose an induction that is required for the formation of yeast peroxisomes (42). Moreover, the putative C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal found in IDE, although potentially functional in yeast, is blocked by an epitope tag in our yeast-expressed enzyme. Alternatively, IDE may be associating with other undefined membrane sites. Axl1p has been reported to associate transiently with components that form a sub-plasma membrane complex that is required for budding (43). Thus, it is also conceivable that IDE is assembling into this complex, but as a nonfunctional component. Ultimately, defining the subcellular localization Ste23p may provide insight into the subcellular targeting of IDE because these two enzymes appear more conserved in sequence and enzymatic properties than IDE and Axl1p..

A, the sequences of IDE, Ste23p, E. coli Protease III, and Axl1p are represented in schematic format (top to bottom, respectively). The schematic has been drawn to scale. Each representation has been divided into several domains. The borders of domains I to VI are operationally defined as sites where insertions ( > 10 residues) are found in the Axl1p sequence as determined by multiple sequence alignment (ClustalW) of all four proteins. Domains at the ends of the molecules (dark gray) represent sequences that are of variable length and are not conserved between the enzymes. The N-terminal sequences range between 19 and 69 residues, and the C-terminal sequences range between 35 and 127 residues. The relative position of the shortest C-terminal truncation yielding a nonfunctional mutant is shown (filled arrowhead). The values below the schematic represent the percent identity between the indicated IDE domain and the corresponding domains of either Ste23p, E. coli Protease III, or Axl1p as determined by using DNA Strider 1.3 at default settings. B to D, several conserved motifs can be identified within domains I (B), II (C), and V (D). For the purposes of this figure, a conserved motif was defined as a block of amino acids (10) having 50% identical or highly conserved residues (i.e. S/T, K/R, or A/I/V). The second motif listed for domain I is found within the X69 sequence of the extended metalloprotease motif, whereas the third is found within the X57 sequence. The residues in boldface were mutated in this study. Neither Cys-257, which is found near the end of domain I, nor Cys-414, which is found at the beginning of domain IV, are within conserved motifs..
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	89	  The genetic model system that we have developed should have far reaching utility for the characterization of mutant IDE alleles. We have provided a practical example of this utility by detailing the functional importance of residues that compose the extended metalloprotease motif (HXXEHX69EX6E). In addition, our mutational study allows us to make certain conclusions about the cysteine residue(s) that imparts the sensitivity of IDE to thiol modifiers. Provided that a single cysteine residue is the target of thiol modification in IDE, our study excludes as targets the two cysteine residues that are invariably conserved between all three enzymes (Cys-110 and Cys-257 in IDE) and two cysteines that are semi-conserved between IDE and the yeast M16A enzymes (Cys-414 and Cys-819 in IDE). The double C110A/C257A mutant also remains sensitive to thiol modifiers. We are currently developing an in vitro assay for monitoring the activities of Ste23p and Axl1p. We expect a determination of whether these enzymes are sensitive to thiol modifiers to aid in the final identification of cysteine residues that are targeted by thiol modifiers in this enzyme family. As a second practical example of the utility of our genetic system, we demonstrate for the first time that a C-terminal region is required for the activity of IDE. In the absence of structural information for IDE, we suspect that its C-terminal region may be required for stabilizing the overall tertiary or possibly quaternary structure of IDE or its active site..

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	91	Our genetic system will also be useful for investigating the role of other residues in the function of IDE. For example, several conserved sequence motifs can be identified by multiple sequence alignment of M16A enzymes (Fig. 8). Our future studies will be aimed at determining whether these motifs are important for the function of M16A enzymes. In addition, we will investigate whether E. coli Protease III can support a-factor production in yeast. If so, our system could conceivably be used to investigate the structure/function relationships for this enigmatic protease, which also lacks a defined cellular role (44)..

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	93	Another potential utility of our genetic model system is the theoretical ability to rapidly identify IDE mutants having altered substrate specificity. We have already demonstrated that our system is amenable to screening specific mutant IDE alleles for the ability to promote mating. The same approach could be used to identify IDE mutants having altered specificity toward the a-factor. We envision a positive genetic selection that takes advantage of the observations that IDE-dependent mating is essentially nonexistent at reduced nutrient levels (Fig. 3A). Under these highly stringent mating conditions, yeast harboring IDE mutants could be screened with the expectation that those having enhanced a-factor production would now be mating-competent. These IDE mutants would represent candidates having improved a-factor recognition (i.e. altered substrate specificity). Conceivably, these mutants might also have altered specificity for insulin and/or A. IDE mutants having enhanced activity toward these substrates could potentially be used as therapeutic agents for diabetes or Alzheimer disease..

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	95	Our data clearly demonstrate that the Axl1p/Ste23p-dependent step in a-factor production can be supported by IDE. This result, in and of itself, is not surprising given the high degree of similarity between these enzymes. Of greater curiosity is the observation that all the yeast enzymes required for a-factor production can be functionally replaced by their mammalian counterparts. The first three steps associated with a-factor production (i.e. isoprenylation, CaaX proteolysis, and carboxymethylation) are part of the biosynthetic pathway of isoprenylated proteins, such as Ras and RhoB. The subsequent two proteolytic steps associated with a-factor production have no analogous counterparts in mammals. Thus, the ability of mammalian enzymes to promote these latter steps is entirely serendipitous, or it reflects the existence of an orphan biosynthetic pathway that integrates all the steps associated with a-factor biosynthesis. If the latter, by analogy, we suspect that the molecule produced by this pathway would serve as a secreted signaling molecule, possibly functioning to regulate cell-cell fusion events such as those that occur during the development of certain tissues. Curiously, the morphological and biochemical differentiation of L6 myoblasts into myotubes has been reported to involve IDE (45, 46). Thus, by analogy to a-factor production, we hypothesize that a role of IDE in these cells might be to produce a signaling molecule derived from a precursor having an aliphatic amino acid motif and an N-terminal extension that is readily cleaved by IDE. Whether such a molecule exists in mammalian systems remains to be determined..

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The active site glutamate (Glu111) and the active site histidine (His112) of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) were mutated. These mutant enzymes exhibit, in addition to a large decrease in catalytic activity, a change in the substrate-velocity response from a sigmoidal one seen with the native enzyme (Hill coefficient  >  2), to a hyperbolic response. With 2-aminobenzoyl-GGFLRKHGQ-N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)ethylenediamine as substrate, ATP and triphosphate increase the reaction rate of the wild type enzyme some 50 to 80-fold. This effect is dampened with glutamate mutants to no effect or less than a 3-fold increase in activity and changed to inhibition with the histidine mutants. Sedimentation equilibrium shows the IDE mutants exhibit a similar oligomeric distribution as the wild type enzyme, being predominantly monomeric, with triphosphate having little if any effect on the oligomeric state. Triphosphate did induce aggregation of many of the IDE mutants. Thus, the oligomeric state of IDE does not correlate with kinetic properties. The His112 mutants were shown to bind zinc, but with a lower affinity than the wild type enzyme. The glutamate mutants displayed an altered cleavage profile for the peptide -endorphin. Wild type IDE cleaved -endorphin at Leu17-Phe18 and Phe18-Lys19, whereas the glutamate mutants cleaved at these sites, but in addition at Lys19-Asn20 and at Met5-Thr6. Thus, active site mutations of IDE are suggested to not only reduce catalytic activity but also cause local conformational changes that affect the allosteric properties of the enzyme..

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   It is generally accepted that the accumulation of amyloid -peptides (A),1 particularly amyloid -peptide 1 to 42, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). The mechanisms leading to the accumulation of A in late onset AD is currently unknown but could be a result of either overproduction of the peptide or decreased clearance. In the case of autosomal dominant AD, it is clear that the early onset of the disease is linked to increased A production and results from mutations in one of several genes: APP, PS1 (presenilin 1), or PS2 (presenilin 2) (1 to 4). However, there is only a scattering of evidence that late onset AD is attributable to an overproduction of A (5). There are recent reports (6 to 8) that the -secretase involved in amyloid -peptide synthesis is increased in sporadic AD patients. Whether this increase is a cause of or a consequence of AD and whether this increase in activity will be seen in larger patient populations remains to be established..

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	8	Clearance of A is currently receiving considerable attention as a key regulatory mechanism of brain A levels. There appear to be two paths for A clearance in the brain. One pathway involves the equilibration of A between the central nervous system and plasma mediated through cerebral spinal fluid (9 to 11). The other pathway involves clearance of A through proteolysis (12 to 15). There are a number of peptidases that have been implicated in A clearance. Those that have received the most attention and are supported by in vivo studies in peptidase-deficient mice include neprilysin (16, 17), insulysin (IDE) (18, 19), and endothelin-converting enzyme (20, 21). Genetic studies have further suggested a linkage between late onset AD and IDE. A linkage of a region of chromosome 10q to late onset Alzheimer disease has been reported by several groups (22 to 25). This region of the chromosome is within 195 kilobases of the IDE gene. However, to date this analysis has not been refined to the point where the linkage to IDE can be unequivocally established..

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	10	The specificity of IDE is complex. The enzyme cleaves a variety of peptides primarily, but not exclusively, at basic or bulky hydrophobic residues (31, 32). Kurochkin (33) has suggested that IDE cleaves peptides that have a propensity to form -pleated sheet structures. Cleavage of A by IDE results in the loss of the neurotoxic effects of the peptide and prevents the deposition of A onto a synthetic amyloid deposit (34). We have recently shown that IDE exhibits allosteric properties being activated by peptide substrates. Interestingly, peptides activated IDE toward A peptide cleavage but not toward insulin cleavage (35). We further established that IDE exists as a mixture of monomers, dimers, and tetramers. During the course of our studies on the allosteric properties of IDE, we generated a number of active site mutants as control enzymes. We noted that although the activity of these mutants was significantly reduced, the residual catalytic properties were altered. We report here the results of these studies..

Scans were obtained at 280 nm with a step size of 0.001 cm. The approach to equilibrium was considered to be complete when scans made 6 h apart were indistinguishable. Typically, equilibration times equal to or greater than 20 h met this criterion. Five scans were averaged for each sample at each rotor speed. Previous results (3) indicated that IDE self-associates in a monomer-dimer-tetramer pattern. Sedimentation equilibrium data were therefore analyzed according to Equation 1,.

The parameter m is the reduced molecular weight of the monomer (m = Mm(1 to  )2/(2RT)); Mm is the monomer molecular weight; is partial specific volume; is the solvent density, is the rotor angular velocity, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and is the base-line offset. Solvent density was measured using a Mettler density meter. The partial specific volume of IDE was calculated from its amino acid composition using the method of Cohn and Edsall (40). Data sets obtained for samples run at three different rotor speeds were fit simultaneously to Equation 1 using the global fitting method first described by Johnson and co-workers (41)..
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	27	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   IDE is a zinc metallopeptidase of the inverzincin family containing the signature active site sequence H108XXEH. The two histidines, in conjunction with a downstream glutamate (Glu189) are believed to act as ligands for the active site zinc (37, 42). As with other zincins, glutamate 111 is believed to be directly involved in catalysis, most probably acting as a general base to facilitate removal of a proton from a water molecule as it attacks the scissile bond. The effect of mutating the active site glutamate and histidine has been reported to produce an inactive enzyme (37, 42). Since we noted varying extents of inactivation when mutating similar residues in the related zinc metallopeptidase puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (43), we quantitated the effect of mutating His112 and Glu111 of IDE..

We initially compared the kinetics of the various His112 and Glu111 mutants using the fluorogenic substrate Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp. Although native IDE clearly displayed a sigmoidal substrate binding curve (Fig. 1), both of the His112 mutants and all four of the Glu111 mutants displayed classical hyperbolic substrate binding curves as illustrated for the E111F mutant in Fig. 1. Table II summarizes the kinetic parameters for each of the mutants. Both of the His112 mutants exhibited a 3 to 5-fold increase in Km, with kcat decreased close to 7,000-fold for the H112D mutant but less than 100-fold for the H112Q mutant. Mutation of the active site glutamate to valine, leucine, alanine, or phenylalanine produced enzyme forms in which the effects on Km were variable from essentially no change for the E111L and E111F mutants to a greater than 7-fold increase for the E111A mutant. The range of kcat values for the Glu111 mutants varied from a decrease of 9,000-fold (E111A) to a decrease of 68,000-fold (E111L)..

The reactions with wild type enzyme contained 50 ng of protein, whereas those with the H112Q mutant contained 10  microg of protein. For the wild type enzyme, the activity in the absence of added PPPi was 0.35 nmol/min.

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	46	  We used sedimentation equilibrium to determine what if any effect the active site mutations had on IDE oligomerization (Fig. 3). We previously reported that in Tris buffer, the wild type enzyme appeared predominantly as a mixture of monomers and dimers (44). The monomer was the predominant species. The addition of 4 mM triphosphate maintained the monomer as the dominant species but eliminated the small amount of dimers (44). In this study, we found that the H112Q mutant appeared monomeric with a trace of a higher aggregate, possibly the tetramer, present. The addition of PPPi decreased solubility but did not significantly change the distribution of oligomeric species. In contrast, the H112D mutant appeared less soluble but showed predominantly tetramers. The addition of PPPi decreased solubility but clearly showed the presence of primarily monomers with higher aggregates present. E111A, E111F, and E111L all appeared as monomers with a trace of tetramer present. E111V exhibited poor solubility and could not be analyzed. The addition of PPPi to E111L and E111A had no effect on the distribution of species but induced some aggregation with E111A and complete aggregation of E111F. Thus, there is no clear correlation between oligomeric state and enzyme activity..

Samples were dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and brought to sedimentation equilibrium at 10,000 rpm and 4  degrees C. Open circles, wild type IDE; filled circles, E111A mutant IDE. The smooth curves represent global fits of Equation 1 to data sets obtained at 10,000, 15,000, and 20,000 rpm. The small, symmetric residuals demonstrate the compatibility of this equation with the data. The data for both the wild type and mutant IDE are consistent with mixtures in which monomeric enzyme predominates over relatively small mol fractions of higher oligomers..
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	48	  Perlman et al. (42) showed that His112 is a zinc-coordinating residue and provided evidence that the active site zinc was lost in the H112Q mutant. We reexamined this issue with both the H112Q and H112D mutants. To accomplish this we looked at the ability of EDTA and o-phenanthroline to inhibit the residual activity of these mutants. As shown in Table V, inclusion of 0.1 mM EDTA or 0.1 mM o-phenanthroline in the assay had little effect on the activity of wild type IDE. Similarly, 0.1 mM EDTA or 0.1 mM o-phenanthroline had no effect on the rate of insulin hydrolysis by the glutamate mutants (data not shown). In contrast, both metal-chelating agents completely inhibited the activity of the histidine mutants as shown in Table V. Although not shown, significant inhibition of the wild type enzyme and glutamate mutants was observed with higher concentrations of EDTA (1 mM) and o-phenanthroline (1 mM). Thus, the His112 mutants appear to retain active site zinc, but this zinc is bound more weakly. We thus looked at the ability of zinc to increase the reaction rate of the His mutants. As shown in Fig. 4, the addition of zinc over the concentration range of 0.1 to 10  microM caused a maximal 1.8-fold increase in the activity of the H112Q mutant and a 1.2-fold increase in the activity of the H112D mutant. This was followed by inhibition at higher zinc concentrations. In contrast, zinc, at all concentrations tested, was slightly inhibitory of the wild type activity..

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	53	  In order to determine whether the mutations introduced into IDE affected enzyme specificity, we looked at the cleavage pattern of three physiological peptides, -endorphin, insulin, and amyloid peptide 1 to 40 using each of the mutants listed in Table II. With insulin and amyloid peptide 1 to 40 as substrate, we observed the same initial cleavage products with the various mutants and wild type enzyme. This is illustrated for insulin cleavage by the E111F mutant in Fig. 5. As previously noted (32), native IDE cleaved -endorphin at the Thr17-Leu18 and Leu18-Phe19 bonds, and the two histidine mutants produced the same cleavage pattern. However, each of the glutamate 111 mutants produced, in addition to cleavage at Leu17-Phe18 and Phe18-Lys19, cleavage at Lys19-Asn20 and at Met5-Thr6. This is illustrated in Fig. 5 for the E111F mutant. Based on this result, we also compared the cleavage of small dynorphin-related peptides by native IDE and by the E111V mutant. We found that with dynorphin A-9, dynorphin A-10, dynorphin A-17, and dynorphin B-9, there was no change in cleavage site..

The His112 mutant transiently expressed in COS cells appeared to be inactive as measured in crude extracts with insulin as substrate. However, this mutant retained the ability to bind insulin as determined by cross-linking studies (37). It should be noted that insulin cross-linking was actually increased with the mutant relative to the wild type enzyme and was attributed to a "relaxation of a rigid conformation stabilized by zinc." Evidence for this increased flexibility at the active site came from the demonstration that treatment of the native enzyme with o-phenanthroline increased the extent of cross-linking; however, o-phenanthroline did not increase cross-linking with the H112Q mutant..

Our finding that the residual activity of the two His112 mutants, but not the Glu111 mutants, can be further reduced by treatment with metal chelators indicates that these mutants do contain zinc but that the zinc is bound considerably more weakly than with the native protein. Thus, our results with both the His112 and Glu111 mutants support and extend the general conclusions of Perlman and Rosner (37) that mutation of the active site histidine causes a change in the conformation about the active site of IDE. The results presented here suggest that this is not due to the loss of zinc binding but probably due to local conformational changes that occur within the active site..

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	62	A rather surprising finding is that mutation of either the catalytic glutamate or the zinc coordinating histidine converts the substrate-velocity curves from sigmoidal to hyperbolic. Thus, the homotropic allosteric activation previously reported by us (35) is absent in the mutants. Since it has been established that IDE can exist in an oligomeric state (32, 35, 50, 51), one possible explanation is that the active site of IDE is at the interface of two subunits and that mutation of the active site residues produces a local conformational change that affects subunit interaction. This does not appear to be the case, since both we (35) and Perlman et al. (42) have shown that formation of oligomers containing active and inactive subunits does not abrogate activity. However, such a mixed oligomer does eliminate allosteric activation (35). Thus, the data is probably explained by the proposal that the active site mutations produce a local conformational change that is transmitted to the adjacent subunit. Although the end result is the same, it appears that there are differences in the local conformational changes produced by mutating the catalytic glutamate and mutating the zinc-coordinating histidine. This is most evident from the observation that the cleavage profile for -endorphin is altered in the glutamate mutants but not the histidine mutants..

The large increase in activity seen with the native enzyme was significantly reduced to either no effect or less than a 3-fold increase in activity with the glutamate mutants. Even more amazing was the effect seen with the active site histidine mutants, particularly H112Q. In this case, triphosphate changed from an activator to a rather potent inhibitor. This clearly indicates that the active site of these mutants is conformationally different from the wild type enzyme and is further modulated by additional conformational changes produced by the binding of the triphosphate moiety..

Triphosphate does not affect the qualitative oligomerization mechanism of the soluble enzyme, but it increased the tendency to form insoluble aggregates in the case of the E111A and E111F mutants. Such aggregation may reflect a conformational change due to triphosphate binding. Thus, there is no obvious correlation between oligomeric state and activity, and the finding of a monomeric native enzyme is not consistent with its allosteric properties. On the other hand, gel filtration shows the native enzyme existing as dimers and tetramers, and at higher protein concentrations dynamic light scattering shows exclusively tetramers. Thus, it is clear that IDE can exist in a number of different oligomerization states. We would suggest that the allosteric kinetics observed can result from substrate induced oligomerization. In the case of mutant IDE, perhaps an altered local conformational change at the active site is transmitted through the protein such that it prevents the formation of oligomers..

Little is known about the prevention of amylin aggregation. We investigated the role of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) in amylin degradation, amyloid deposition, and cytotoxicity in RIN-m5F insulinoma cells. Human 125I-labeled amylin degradation was inhibited by 46 and 65% with the addition of 100 nmol/l human amylin or insulin, respectively. 125I-labeled insulin degradation was inhibited with 100 nmol/l human amylin, rat amylin, and insulin (by 50, 50, and 73%, respectively). The IDE inhibitor bacitracin inhibited amylin degradation by 78% and insulin degradation by 100%. Amyloid staining by Congo red fluorescence was detectable at 100 nmol/l amylin and was pronounced at 1,000 nmol/l amylin treatment for 48 h. Bacitracin treatment markedly increased staining at all amylin concentrations. Bacitracin with amylin caused a dramatic decrease in cell viability compared with amylin alone (68 and 25%, respectively, at 10 nmol/l amylin). In summary, RIN-m5F cells degraded both amylin and insulin through a common proteolytic pathway. IDE inhibition by bacitracin impaired amylin degradation, increased amyloid formation, and increased amylin-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting a role for IDE in amylin clearance and the prevention of amylin aggregation..

0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	5	Type 2 diabetes is characterized by the loss of pancreatic ss-cell mass, accompanied by the presence of islet amyloid deposits in the pancreas (1). The major component of islet amyloid is amylin (also known as islet amyloid polypeptide), a polypeptide copackaged and cosecreted with insulin by pancreatic ss-cells (2). It is presently unclear whether islet amyloid merely is a consequence of diabetes or actually contributes to the progression of the disease. However, there is evidence that intermediate precursors of amylin fibrils are cytotoxic to ss-cells, whereas mature amyloid fibrils are not toxic, suggesting that ss-cell toxicity may precede deposition of islet amyloid (3,4). Because amylin is continually produced in individuals without type 2 diabetes, the mere presence of amylin is insufficient to induce amylin-induced ss-cell toxicity and islet amyloid. Transgenic animals producing human (amyloidogenic) amylin fail to develop islet amyloid (5 to 7), but when additional diabetic traits are introduced, islet amyloid is detected (8 to 10). Therefore, there is a protective mechanism that prevents amyloid deposition under normal conditions, but is impaired under diabetic conditions. Because proteolysis is a major pathway in the regulation of protein levels, degradation of amylin may contribute to the prevention of islet amyloid aggregation. ss-cell toxicity and islet amyloid may therefore result from an imbalance in amylin levels because of impaired degradation of amylin. At present, our understanding of the proteolytic pathways that contribute to the degradation of amylin is incomplete..

0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	7	The enzyme responsible for the cellular proteolysis of insulin is insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) (11). The substrate specificity of IDE is for amyloidogenic polypeptides, including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), glucagon, and the ss-amyloid peptide found in Alzheimer s disease, and therefore may act as a scavenger that clears amyloidogenic peptides to prevent amyloid deposition (11,12). Recently, we showed that amylin was also an IDE substrate (13). Therefore, IDE may be involved in controlling the levels of amylin by degradation, similar to its role in regulating the levels of the Alzheimer s-related ss-amyloid peptide (14). Both the GK rat model of type 2 diabetes, in which IDE has been identified as a diabetes susceptibility gene, and the recently described IDE-null mice show impaired glucose metabolism. In both models, cellular insulin-degrading activity has been found to be impaired. Therefore, it is possible that in diabetes, IDE dysfunction also results in impaired amylin degradation, increased amylin aggregation, and, eventually, islet amyloid deposition. The present study was performed to address the following questions: 1) Are amylin and insulin degraded in ss-cells by a common pathway? 2) Does inhibition of IDE alter amylin degradation and islet amyloid formation? and 3) Does IDE inhibition affect the cytotoxic properties of amylin toward ss-cells? To answer these questions, a pancreatic ss-cell to derived cell line was used to characterize amylin degradation..

0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	21	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Amylin and insulin degradation by RIN-m5F cells was examined over time. The amount of degradation was limited to 20% to remain within the linear range of the assay. Degradation of 125I-amylin reached 20% by 30 min (Fig. 1).

The degradation of 125I-amylin was decreased in a dosage-dependent manner by either unlabeled insulin or amylin (Fig. 3). At all concentrations, unlabeled insulin was a more effective inhibitor than amylin. Similarly, the degradation of 125I-insulin was inhibited by both amylin and insulin (Fig. 4), with insulin generally the more effective inhibitor. These observations were consistent with previously determined enzymatic properties of IDE, in which insulin had a three- to sixfold higher affinity for purified IDE than amylin (13). Two possible complications of the cell culture system are the potential for direct interaction between human amylin and insulin (20) and membrane perturbations that may impede receptor-mediated uptake of substrates (3). Rat amylin is also an IDE substrate (13), but it does not interact with insulin or cause membrane disruption. Rat amylin (100 nmol/l) inhibited insulin degradation to 49.7  plus or minus  1.2% of baseline insulin degradation, a result similar to that found with human amylin, indicating that reciprocal inhibition of amylin and insulin degradation is attributable to a common pathway of proteolysis..

To examine whether cellular degradation by IDE may contribute to this protective process, a cell culture system to study islet amyloid formation was developed. RIN-m5F cells were cultured on poly-L-lysine-coated glass chamber slides for 3 days of culture, then treated with human amylin (10 to 1,000 nmol/l) for 48 h. Amyloid was detected by a modified Congo red fluorescence staining method (18), which includes an acidic iron hematoxylin counterstain that minimizes the intense autofluorescence seen using the original method (21). Human amylin induced a dosage-dependent increase in staining, detectable at 100 nmol/l and pronounced at 1  micromol/l (Fig. 5). This finding demonstrated that exogenous human amylin can form amyloid deposits in RIN-m5F cell cultures. When the cells were treated with the IDE inhibitor bacitracin, amyloid staining was markedly increased in intensity at all amylin concentrations compared with cells without bacitracin, including at the lowest amylin concentration (10 nmol/l).

In the presence of bacitracin, the cell viability was markedly lower at all amylin concentrations, reaching the maximum reduction (68%) at only 10 nmol/l amylin.

Whether islet amyloid is merely a marker of type 2 diabetes or actually contributes to the disease is a matter of some discussion. Several lines of evidence suggest an association between the presence of islet amyloid and diabetes and reduced ss-cell mass. In monkeys, the formation of islet amyloid correlates with early reduced insulin secretion and glucose intolerance, and, with time, correlates with greater deficiency in insulin secretion and glucose tolerance and ultimately hyperglycemia (22). In humans, the degree of amyloid formation correlates with the severity of diabetes, as evidenced by the requirement for insulin replacement therapy (23,24).

Because amylin is continually produced in nondiabetic humans with no amyloid formation, the mere presence of amylin is insufficient to cause fibril formation. Indeed, transgenic animals overexpressing human amylin do not form amyloid deposits (5 to 7,25), confirming that elevated amylin levels alone are insufficient for amyloid formation. However, when diabetic conditions are introduced, such as the ob mutation, growth hormone/steroid treatment, or a high-fat diet, these animals develop islet amyloid, islet dysfunction, reduced insulin secretion, and hyperglycemia (8 to 10). Therefore, in type 2 diabetes, the balance shifts from amylin clearance to deposition, either by increased amounts of a factor that promotes amylin aggregation or decreased amounts of a factor that clears amylin. Although there have been numerous studies regarding amylin synthesis and secretion, at present there have been few studies of amylin degradation..

The primary function of IDE in mammalian tissues has traditionally been thought to be the degradation of insulin, but a number of other proteins have been identified as IDE substrates, including proteins structurally related to insulin, such as proinsulin, IGF-II, and relaxin, and seemingly unrelated peptides, such as ANP and glucagon (11). However, insulin, ANP, and glucagon all contain regions that can form ss-pleated sheets and are potentially amyloid forming (27). It has been proposed that rather than targeting a primary sequence motif, IDE is specific toward amyloidogenic peptides (28), a concept supported by findings that IDE also degrades amylin and ss-amyloid peptide (13,29,30). Recent studies have supported a role for IDE in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer s disease, two conditions characterized by amyloid. Possible genetic linkages to type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer s disease have been mapped to the chromosomal region of the IDE gene (31 to 34). In the GK rat, a model of type 2 diabetes, IDE has been identified as a diabetes susceptibility gene; the mutations associated with this model result in lower cellular insulin degradation, hyperglycemia, reduced lipogenesis in fat cells, and reduced glucose uptake in vivo (35). The recently described IDE-null mouse model displays impaired insulin and ss-amyloid degradation, as well as hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, and cerebral accumulation of ss-amyloid, hallmarks of both type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer s disease (36).

0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	40	In a previous study using cell-free extracts (13), IDE readily degraded amylin, but with a lower affinity than for insulin. Radiolabeled amylin covalently cross-linked to IDE, and a monoclonal antibody directed against IDE immunoprecipitated both insulin- and amylin-degrading activities, confirming that IDE was the amylin-degrading protease. We have extended those findings to a rat ss-cell to derived line. Both amylin and insulin were degraded by RIN-m5F cells, but insulin was degraded much more slowly. Possible reasons for this observation include differences in binding and internalization through the different receptors or differences in receptor availability (e.g., by desensitization or cell toxicity). The differences may also be attributed to the nature of the assay. Unlike amylin, multiple cleavages are required to produce TCA-soluble fragments of insulin, and therefore, this assay tends to underestimate the level of insulin degradation. Amylin degradation began quickly, then leveled off with time. The probable explanation for this observation is based on insulin secretion by the cells. The cells were changed into fresh media containing labeled substrates, so initially there was no endogenously produced insulin in the media. RIN cells rapidly secreted insulin (reaching 5 to 10 nmol/l in 1 h), which would act as a competitive inhibitor of amylin degradation. Because the amylin was present in tracer amounts, sufficient insulin to competitively inhibit amylin degradation may well have been produced within 30 min. Both insulin and amylin were capable of competitive inhibition of either substrate, with insulin in general a better competitive inhibitor than amylin. As discussed above, this is likely attributable to the greater affinity of insulin for IDE and possibly also to the different internalization properties for insulin and amylin. The efficiency of unlabeled insulin inhibition of insulin degradation was consistent with that in previous reports showing a 50% inhibition of 50 to 100 nmol/l insulin using RIN-m5F cells (37). Taken together, the data suggest that insulin and amylin share a common pathway of degradation..

Although bacitracin is not a specific inhibitor of IDE, other IDE inhibitors (e.g., N-ethylmaleimide and 1,10-phenanthroline) were highly toxic to RIN-m5F cells (R.G.B., unpublished observations), whereas bacitracin was well tolerated by the cells. Amylin and insulin degradation by RIN-m5F cells was markedly inhibited by bacitracin. Bacitracin also accelerated islet amyloid formation at all amylin concentrations, suggesting that inhibition of amylin degradation accelerates amylin aggregation and amyloid deposition. Because amylin has been implicated in ss-cell death, cell viability was examined under the same conditions. Cytotoxicity induced by human amylin was markedly increased with bacitracin treatment, whereas rat amylin had no effect, suggesting that amylin degradation is responsible for reducing cell toxicity caused by amylin. Amylin-induced cytotoxicity in ss-cells has been shown to be caused by intermediate amylin precursors rather than mature amyloid (3). If IDE degrades amylin monomers, then the formation of both intermediate precursors and amyloid fibrils would be prevented. The experiments performed here (48-h treatment of freshly prepared amylin) cannot determine which amylin species caused toxicity in RIN cells. However, the degree of cell death seen with bacitracin treatment was increased to the maximum attained, even at the lowest amylin concentration, which could mean that the toxicity preceded amyloid deposition. Although the amylin concentration required for detection of amyloid and cell toxicity (10 to 100 nmol/l) is high relative to circulating levels, the local amylin concentration around ss-cells is unknown, but may well be higher, especially under conditions that stimulate insulin and amylin secretion..

Inhibition of this mechanism increased amyloid formation and cell toxicity. These data are consistent with the emerging concept of a role for IDE in diseases characterized by amyloid. In this regard, it is interesting to note again that transgenic animals expressing human amylin in general do not develop islet amyloid unless diabetic conditions are introduced. One of these conditions is a high-fat diet (9). Interestingly, it has been shown that increased lipid levels result in impaired insulin degradation (38) and free fatty acids directly inhibit IDE activity (39). The combination of increased expression of amyloidogenic amylin and impaired insulin-degrading activity may result in the formation of islet amyloid in these models. Therefore, it is possible that conditions leading to impaired IDE activity (e.g., elevated free fatty acids) contribute to amylin accumulation and aggregation, ss-cell toxicity, islet amyloid formation, and the progression of type 2 diabetes..
