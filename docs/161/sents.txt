0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, June 28, 2005 , and in revised form, July 13, 2005.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	3	Cleavage of APP by -secretase results in the secretion of a large N-terminal ectodomain.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In an alternative pathway, -secretase generates a shorter secreted N-terminal fragment and APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) C89 and C99, which remain membrane-bound.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The latter fragments are then further cleaved by -secretase, resulting in the production of A peptides.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The -site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) accounts for most of the -secretase activity in the brain (1, 5 to 7, 9).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	7	 BACE1 is a typical aspartic protease; cleavage of the prodomain to generate the mature enzyme occurs at the C-terminal site resulting in the generation of a mature protein starting at Glu-46 (12).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	8	Recent evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of AD involves alterations in the activity of BACE1.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	9	 A polymorphism in the BACE1 gene has been reported to influence AD risk (13).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Compared with nondemented controls, BACE1 immunoreactivity was increased around amyloid plaques in AD brains; levels of BACE1 were elevated in AD brain homogenates (14 to 17) and correlated with the levels of APP CTFs and with A1 to x and A1 to 42 (18).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The potential pathogenic role of increased BACE activity has been investigated in vivo by analyzing the metabolism of APP in human (h) BACE transgenic (tg) mice (19 to 22).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	12	 These studies have shown that expression of hBACE1 at moderate levels in hAPP tg models results in increased generation of hAPP CTFs and A, which in some cases was associated with enhanced amyloid deposition.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These studies have confirmed the importance of hBACE1 in APP processing in vivo.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	14	 However, the relationship between high levels of hBACE1 activity, APP processing, and neurodegeneration remains to be established.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	15	 To address this issue, we used the strong Thy1 promoter to express hBACE1 in neurons of tg mice, either alone or in combination with hAPP.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	16	 High levels of BACE1 activity significantly increased the cerebral accumulation of hAPP CTFs, but not of A, and caused prominent age-related neurodegeneration and neurological decline.

0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	240	 This suggests that in our model APP processing may occur preferentially at the ' cleavage site (15, 35).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Interestingly, despite an overall increase in C99 and C89 in previous studies, levels of C99-p were decreased significantly in hBACE1/hAPP mice, and this decrease in C-99 phosphorylation was more apparent in mice expressing higher levels of hBACE1 (19).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Compared with hAPP tg mice, our hBACE1/hAPP mice showed lower levels of C99, and C99-p was decreased with hBACE1 overexpression.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Because phosphorylation of APP is a post-translational modification necessary for maturation and axonal transport of C99 (42, 43), the decrease in C99-p indicates that APP cleavage in the hBACE1/hAPP mice might occur in early compartments (19).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	244	High levels of hBACE1 and APP CTFs in our hBACE1/hAPP mice were associated with decreased levels of human A1 to x and A1 to 42, as determined by highly quantitative ELISA measurements.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	245	 These results are consistent with a recent study (19) but differ from results obtained in other hBACE1/hAPP models (20, 21, 40, 41).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Several factors might account for these differences, including the genetic background of the mice analyzed.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	247	 However, the most critical factor in determining the effects of hBACE1 activity might be the levels of hBACE1 transgene expression (19).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Although low and intermediate levels of hBACE1 expression enhanced amyloid production and deposition in doubly tg mice, higher levels of hBACE1 expression reduced A production, presumably because high levels of hBACE1 activity shifted the subcellular location of APP cleavage to the neuronal cell body and early secretory pathway, resulting in a depletion of mature APP-p in the trans-Golgi compartment (19).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Thus, a lesser amount of APP might be targeted to the distal axon, which would preclude -secretase-mediated generation of A at synaptic sites.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	250	If not A, what other factors may result in the degeneration of neurons with high levels of BACE1 activity? Recent evidence suggests that the toxicity of CTFs may be mediated by the caspase-generated C-terminal C31 fragment (44, 45).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	251	 It will therefore be interesting to test whether preventing the generation of C31 prevents neurodegeneration in hBACE1/hAPP mice.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	252	 In a similar vein, expression of hBACE1 in mAPP-deficient mice might reveal APP-independent mechanisms of hBACE1-induced neurotoxicity.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Conceivably, increased BACE1 activity might trigger neurodegeneration by cleavage of substrates other than APP.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	254	 For example, both in vitro (12) and in vivo (46) BACE1 cleaves ST6Gal I, a sialyltransferase whose cleavage product is secreted.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Recently, it has been shown that BACE1 also cleaves -subunits of voltage-gated sodium channels (47).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Increased levels of hBACE1 activity could further broaden the substrate specificity of this enzyme in both tg mice and humans with AD.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	257	Indeed, recent studies have identified increased levels of hBACE1 immunoreactivity and of APP CTFs in AD brains (14 to 17), suggesting that increased BACE1 activity may be causally involved also in the pathogenesis of AD.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	258	 The current study supports and extends this notion by demonstrating that increased neuronal hBACE1 activity can cause progressive neurodegenerative alterations in vivo.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Whereas inhibiting -secretase, which does not alter - or -secretase processing, decreases A production but increases the accumulation of APP CTFs (48, 49), inhibiting BACE1 may block both A-dependent and A-independent pathogenic mechanisms in AD.

0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	10	Aims The aim was to assess, in a randomised controlled trial, whether psychotherapeutic intervention could benefit cognitive function, affective symptoms and global well-being.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	11	Method Individuals were randomised to receive six sessions of psychodynamic interpersonal therapy or treatment as usual; cognitive function, activities of daily living, a global measure of change, and carer stress and coping were assessed prior to and after the intervention.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	12	Results No improvement was found on the majority of outcome measures.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	13	 There was a suggestion that therapy had improved the carers' reactions to some of the symptoms.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	14	Conclusions There is no evidence to support the widespread introduction of brief psychotherapeutic approaches for those with Alzheimer's disease.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	15	 However, the technique was acceptable and helpful individually.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	16	The aim of this study was to assess, in a randomised controlled trial, whether a psychotherapeutic approach directed towards individuals with Alzheimer's disease could benefit cognitive function, affective symptoms and global well-being.

0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	18	 1 Design of the trial of brief psychotherapy in Alzheimer's disease.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	19	  Procedure Individuals and their carers were recruited from referrals to the memory clinic in South Manchester, UK.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The inclusion criteria were: a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al, 1984); a clinical dementia rating of 1 (Morris, 1993), indicating mild dementia; a score of 15 or above on the Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein et al, 1975); living in their own home with a carer in regular contact; and the ability to communicate verbally.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	21	Following consent, individuals were allocated to one of two groups - treatment or control - using computer-generated random numbers organised independently by the Department of Medical Statistics in South Manchester.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Those allocated to the control group could elect to have the therapeutic sessions after the study.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	23	 All assessments and therapeutic interventions were conducted in the individuals' own homes.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Those taking anticholinesterase drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease or other psychotropic medication (such as antidepressants) had to be clinically stable on these medications for at least 2 months prior to study entry.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	25	Therapeutic interventions Those in the treatment group received six sessions of psychodynamic interpersonal therapy with an experienced psychotherapist.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Those in the control group received standard care, which consisted of general advice regarding the diagnosis and treatment of dementia, with out-patient review.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	27	Psychodynamic interpersonal therapy Psychodynamic interpersonal therapy was formerly known as the conversational model of psychotherapy (Hobson, 1985) and has been used to treat a wide variety of disorders including depression (Shapiro  and  Firth, 1987; Shapiro et al, 1993), somatisation (Guthrie et al, 1991; Hamilton et al, 2000) and self-harm (Guthrie et al, 2001).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The principal aim of the therapy (in its brief format) is the identification of interpersonal conflicts or difficulties, which are causing or helping to maintain emotional distress.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Client and therapist work together to find and test solutions to these problems, and both intrapsychic and practical changes are encouraged.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	30	Adaptation of the technique The therapy was adapted for people with Alzheimer's disease.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Full details are available elsewhere (Brierley et al, 2003).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The main adaptations included delivery in the individual's home and involving the carer in the treatment.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Four specific psychological areas were targeted.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Autobiographical narrative was used to strengthen self-worth.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Important past conflicts, which resonated with current difficulties, were explored and resolved.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The illness itself was discussed and emphasis placed on improving social and interpersonal relationships including, but not emphasising, the role of the partner.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In addition to the individual therapy, the therapist spent 10 min each session with the carer, listening to the carer's needs and informing the carer of therapeutic progress.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	38	Implementation of the technique Psychotherapy sessions lasted 50 min.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The psychotherapy has been summarised in a manual (Shapiro  and  Firth, 1987) and treatment fidelity was ensured by regular supervision using audiotapes.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	40	 One session from each individual therapy was rated for adherence to the model using the Sheffield Psychotherapy Rating Scale (Shapiro  and  Startup, 1993).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	41	 This scale allows sessions to be rated according to three main subscales: one for psychodynamic interpersonal therapy; one for cognitive-behavioural therapy; and one for generic aspects of psychotherapy.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The intervention showed high scores on the psychodynamic interpersonal therapy and generic sub-scales and low scores on the cognitive-behavioural therapy scale, confirming adherence to the model.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	43	Assessments of patients The following assessments were carried out before the start of the therapy, at the end of the therapy (6 weeks after recruitment) and at 3 months follow-up.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	44	Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia This is a 19-item scale assessing depressive symptoms in people with dementia (Alexopoulos et al, 1988).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	45	 It is rated on a three-point scale of absent, mild or intermittent, and severe.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	46	 A score of 8 or above is indicative of significant depressive symptoms.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	47	Mini-Mental State Examination This is a 30-item measure of cognitive function, with a maximum score of 30 points (Folstein et al, 1975).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	48	 It normally takes 5-10 min to complete.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	49	Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist This is a 24-item questionnaire rating both the frequency of behavioural problems in those with dementia and the intensity of the reactions in their carers (Teri et al, 1992).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Frequency and reaction are both rated on a six-point scale.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	51	Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale This is a 20-item questionnaire, rated by the carer in 10-15 min (Bucks et al, 1996).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Twenty areas of daily activities are each rated on a five-point scale from no problem to severe problems.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	53	Assessments of carers General Health Questionnaire This is a 12-item self-report questionnaire to assess psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity (Goldberg  and  Williams, 1985).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	54	 It is completed in 5 min or less and each item is rated on a four-point scale.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	55	Beck Depression Inventory This is a 21-item self-report questionnaire to assess depression in the respondent (Beck et al, 1961).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	56	 It normally takes 10-20 min to complete.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Each item is scored from 0 to 3 and a total score is derived.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	58	 A total score of 12 or more suggests the presence of depression.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	59	Ways of Coping Checklist This is a 42-item self-report questionnaire to assess the carer's coping strategies (Vitaliano et al, 1985).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	60	 It normally takes 15-20 min to complete and is rated on a four-point scale, from not applicable to very much used.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	61	Global assessment Clinician's Interview-Based Global Impression of Change This is a seven-point scale used by the researcher and an external supervisor to detect change in the patients at 6-week and 3-month follow-up (Guy, 1976).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The scale goes from very much improved to very much worse.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The rating was completed following a discussion between the research assistant (F.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	64	), who was masked to group membership (treatment or control).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	65	The 20 individuals who took part in the treatment arm of the study completed a satisfaction survey.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Four statements were presented and the patients were asked to reply.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	67	Statistical analysis, randomisation and calculation of sample size All analyses used the intention-to-treat principle.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The effect of intervention was assessed by comparing changes in mean scores over time on continuous variables using analyses of covariance, with baseline scores and age as covariants.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Some scores required a natural logarithmic transformation prior to analysis to produce a satisfactory approximation to a normal distribution.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	70	 For these scores, geometric means (detransformed log means) are presented rather than simple arithmetic means.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Chi-squared tests, where appropriate, were performed on categorical measures.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	72	There are no current data upon which to base a power calculation.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	73	 In our previous study (Marriott et al, 2000), group sizes of 14 were sufficient to detect a statistically significant difference.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Based on these data, we allowed for a withdrawal rate of 20%, and chose to recruit 20 individuals in each group.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Part of the rationale for this pilot study was to obtain some normative data on which to calculate a sample size for a definitive study.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	76	Table 1 describes the study groups and main results from the assessments.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	77	 There were 20 people recruited to each group.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Most commonly it was the spouse who cared for the patient; 25% of the treatment group and 15% of the control group were on antidepressants, and approximately two-thirds of each group were on one of the anticholinesterase drugs for Alzheimer's disease.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	79	 All participants completed the study and follow-up.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	80	View this table:    Table 1 Participants' characteristics and participant and carer assessments at baseline and 6-week and 3-month follow-up  .
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	81	There were no significant differences over the course of the study in the outcome measures for the patients, including ratings on the Cornell Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination and Activities of Daily Living Scale, or in the global rating for the outcome measures for the carers.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	82	 There were no changes over the course of the study in the General Health Questionnaire or Beck Depression Inventory.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	83	 There was a trend towards a slight improvement in the carer's reaction to behavioural problems.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Section 2 of the Ways of Coping Checklist showed a significant decline (P  < 0.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	85	05); this section rates the carer's interaction with other people as an aid to coping.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	86	There was no difference in the ratings when the patients were divided into two groups by Mini-Mental State Examination score (above or below 24).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	87	 However, there was some evidence that carers of those with less cognitive impairment (score above 24) benefited more from the treatment in that they blamed themselves less for the problems (section 3 of the Ways of Coping Checklist at 3 months, mean value 0.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	88	Qualitative assessments Every participant agreed with the statement  I was able to discuss my difficulties with my counsellor and became more clear about what they are .
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Eighty-three per cent agreed with the following three statements:  I find doing things I can do and not thinking too much about what I cannot do, helps me feel less frustrated ;  Although it sometimes felt painful talking about my past, it felt good to get things off my chest, and I felt calm ; and  I have been able to talk about some things that have been difficult to talk to anyone else about .
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	90	Some of the positive comments from patients included:.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	91	 I was able to confide and talk easy in a friendly way.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	92	   She drew out some points which I never realised.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	93	   It was beneficial but I don't know why.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	94	   My counsellor allowed me to bring out some things which I would not have discussed with relatives or friends.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	95	Comments from the carers included:.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	96	(a)  It provided me with the opportunity to discuss the problems attached to being a full-time carer for my husband.

0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	99	  (c)  It was a chance to discuss openly my wife's problem.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	100	The 20 participants who received therapy were visited between 6 and 12 months after recruitment.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	101	 A semi-structured open-ended interview was carried out.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Five of the patients had some recollection of the sessions, and all five confirmed that they had found it helpful.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	103	The therapist was clearly a major source of support for the carers and the patients.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	104	Rationale for the trial We chose to target an area that has received relatively little attention in Alzheimer's disease.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Traditional therapies have tended to be pharmacological in nature, targeting either cognitive or non-cognitive symptoms (Tariot, 1999).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Non-pharmacological interventions, aside from some behavioural techniques (Allen-Burge et al, 1999), have concentrated on carers, and psychological approaches are of proven benefit in reducing carer strain (Marriott et al, 2000).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	107	 As far as we are aware, this is the first randomised controlled trial of a psychotherapeutic intervention in people with Alzheimer's disease using standardised outcome measures.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The psychotherapeutic approach was determined following a pilot study and adapted to the individual needs of the participants, as the model dictates.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	109	 The joint sessions with the participants and carers merely helped the therapist to focus on those symptoms that were considered important and distressing.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	110	Reasons for non-response The finding that the intervention had no effect on measures that reflect the core features of the illness (cognitive function, activities of daily living) is not surprising.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Only six sessions were provided which, in psychotherapeutic terms, is a low-dose treatment, and this may partly explain the lack of effect.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	112	 In addition, a longer study would be needed to assess the more likely benefits in terms of stabilisation of disease.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The beneficial effect on carers is indicated by the scores on the Ways of Coping Checklist, which showed that the therapy helped carers by providing someone to talk to and, for those caring for people with mild dementia, diminished the carers' sense of self-blame.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	114	 There was minimal involvement of the carers in the therapy.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	115	 A beneficial effect on patients themselves can be inferred from the improvement in the global rating of well-being.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	116	It is not surprising that the involvement of the therapist appeared to have a positive impact and is in accordance with other experience in the field.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	117	 What is important is that the therapy can be adapted for use in people with cognitive impairment.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	118	The trend towards improvements in both carer and patient outcomes attests to the potential benefit of non-pharmacological interventions in this group.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Future studies in this area should concentrate specifically on approaches that combine outcomes of carers and those in their care.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	120	 The interdependency of the aspirations and outcomes of people with Alzheimer's disease and their carers is emphasised by this project and will influence future studies in this area.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	121	LIMITATIONS The sample size was small.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	122	 The outcome measures chosen were probably not sensitive enough to measure marginal improvements.

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	5	Given its genomic location and potential functional relevance to AD, we tested PLAU as a candidate gene for LOAD.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	6	 PLAU is a relatively small, 5970 bp gene found on the NT_008583 chromosome 10 contig and also defined by the AF377330 sequence (www.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We genotyped a total of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the whole length of this gene from the 72nd to the 5885th bp.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We found evidence for significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) among these variants, allowing for complex genotype analysis.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In this article, we initially depict the results of the association analyses between plasma Ass42 and PLAU haplotypes in 10 LOAD families and between AD and PLAU compound genotypes forming the  haplotype pairs  in three case to control series.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	10	 After establishing significant association between PLAU variants and two AD phenotypes, plasma Ass42 levels and AD-affected status, we focus on a single missense mutation in a larger data set of 24 LOAD families and six case to control series.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	11	The missense mutation is a variant in exon 6 (rs2227564=PLAU_1) that causes a proline to leucine change (P141L) within the kringle domain of PLAU at the junction between two ss-pleated sheets (13,14).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The minor T variant of PLAU_1 does not appear to affect PLAU activity, but Yoshimoto et al.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	13	 (14) have reported that the P141-PLAU zymogen binds fibrin aggregates less efficiently than the L141-PLAU zymogen, suggesting the possibility of altered extracellular PLAU localization or stability.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	14	 (15) have shown significant association between the major C/C genotype of rs2227564 and LOAD in their series from Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In this article, we show evidence of significant association between LOAD and the minor allele of this variant and discuss potential reasons for the discrepancy.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	16	 We find evidence of significant association with PLAU variants in both extended LOAD families and independent case to control series using both plasma Ass42 and LOAD-affected status as the phenotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In addition, we provide functional data from PLAU knock out (KO) mice, supporting the role of this gene in Ass metabolism.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Our results are depicted subsequently.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	19	 PLAU SNP frequencies   From the PLAU SNP genotypes of the family members, PLAU SNP haplotypes were identified using the haplotyping algorithm within the computer program Simwalk2 (17,18).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Three major PLAU SNP haplotypes were identified, as were three minor haplotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Collectively, the six PLAU SNP haplotypes accounted for  > 95% of all of the haplotypes in these families.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The frequency of each PLAU SNP haplotype in the 10 AD families is summarized in Table 1.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Because there was profound LD (D' > 0.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	24	4 for all SNPs except exon 8 SNP), only five of the seven SNPs were required to construct all six haplotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	25	Table 3 summarizes the LD parameters, Lewontin's standardized disequilibrium coefficient (19) D' and d2, estimated from the founders in the 10 extended LOAD families.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The profound LD between the SNPs can easily be appreciated in this table.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Exon 11 deletion mutant was in complete LD with the other exon 11 SNP.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Exon 2 SNP was too rare to yield meaningful results.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Thus, these two SNPs were omitted from the LD analysis.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	30	 LD was also estimated in the MCR, MCJ and UKy series within the cases and controls and yielded similar results.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	31	 As each individual carries two haplotypes, we termed the genotype formed by these two haplotypes as  compound genotypes .
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	32	 As described subsequently, each compound genotype essentially unambiguously defines a haplotype pair due to profound LD between PLAU SNPs and limited haplotype diversity.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	33	 We next tested for association between plasma Ass42 levels and PLAU haplotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	34	 PLAU SNPs LD   Association of PLAU variants with plasma Ass42 levels in 10 LOAD families To test for association between plasma Ass42 and PLAU variants in family members, we used the variance components methodology implemented in the computer program SOLAR (20).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Using the within-pedigree identity-by-state model of Hopper and Mathews (21), PLAU SNP haplotypes were initially analyzed in family members between the ages of 20 and 65 years because this was the age group in which plasma Ass42 was linked to the chromosome 10 locus (1).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In this age group, there was no significant association between PLAU variants and plasma Ass42 levels (Table 4).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Inspection of our data suggested that there might be an association between PLAU SNP haplotypes and plasma Ass42 in older family members, so we performed a second analysis using family members of all ages.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Remarkably, this group showed significant association between PLAU SNP haplotypes and plasma Ass42 (P=0.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	39	02), with PLAU association accounting for an estimated 12% of the total variance in Ass42.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Association of PLAU SNP haplotypes with plasma Ass42 in 10 LOAD families   Association of PLAU variants with AD in three case to control series Our working hypothesis is that any gene with variants influencing Ass42 is likely to have variants influencing risk for AD.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	41	 To determine whether PLAU has variants that are associated with AD in case to control series, we analyzed the PLAU SNPs in three independent series obtained at MCR, MCJ and UKy.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	42	 All three series were entirely composed of Caucasian subjects, and in every AD patient the age of onset was 59 years.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Using the computer program GOLD (22) to analyze the PLAU SNPs, we determined that there is profound LD among the five PLAU SNPs in the case to control series similar to the LOAD family founders (data not shown).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	44	An important consequence of the profound LD among the five PLAU SNPs that we analyzed was that there were relatively few common genotypes such that 96 to 100% of the subjects were accounted for by only 12 compound genotypes (Table 5).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	45	 In Table 5, the two haplotypes producing six of the 12 compound genotypes (A, D, F, I, J and K) were unambiguous, because no more than one SNP was heterozygous.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Each of the remaining six genotypes is produced by one and only one pair of the six haplotypes identified in the LOAD families (Table 1).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The only other pairs that could produce these categories would include at least one haplotype that is so rare it was never identified unambiguously in the case to control series or by Simwalk2 haplotype analysis of the LOAD families.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	48	 As these combinations will be rare, the PLAU SNP haplotypes in 96 to 100% of the subjects in our LOAD case to control series were easily identified and essentially unambiguous (Table 5).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Association of PLAU compound genotypes with AD in three case to control series   To evaluate association between AD and the compound genotypes summarized in Table 5, we performed 2-tests on each series using the Monte Carlo approach (T1) implemented in CLUMP to determine significance.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In each of the three series examined, these genotypes showed significant association with AD (MCR, P=0.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Some compound genotypes tended to have the same trends in two or more series analyzed (e.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	52	 2/2, 1/4 and 3/5), suggesting the presence of functional variants on the backbones of these genotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	53	After we found the association between PLAU  compound genotypes  and three case to control series, MCR, MCJ and UKy, we tested for association between the missense PLAU_1 SNP and the larger data set of six case to control series, the results of which are depicted subsequently.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Finally, we went back to test for association between PLAU compound genotypes and the three additional case to control series (Gothenburg, Gothenburg-Postmortem, Scottish) and did not find significant association in these series (data not shown).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	55	Association of PLAU_1 SNP (rs2227564) with plasma Ass42 levels in 24 LOAD families Of the PLAU variants analyzed, rs2227564, which we internally termed PLAU_1, is a relatively common missense SNP, which leads to a proline to leucine change in the kringle domain of PLAU at the junction between two ss-pleated sheets (13,14) and has been shown to have a functional effect on the fibrin binding of PLAU zymogen (14).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	56	 To determine whether PLAU_1 genotypes are associated with plasma Ass42, we analyzed a larger set of 24 extended LOAD families, which includes the original group of 10 families.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	57	 To take family relationships into account, these analyses were performed using variance components methodology implemented in the program SOLAR (20).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	58	In the members of these 24 families, the change that occurs in plasma Ass42 with aging is complex.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Plasma Ass42, which is elevated in young subjects, first decreases and then increases again with age  > 50.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This is shown in Figure 1, where plasma Ass42 stratified by PLAU_1 genotype is plotted as a function of age.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Non-linear analysis, in which we analyzed age, age(2) and PLAU_1 genotype (CC, CT, TT or CT+TT) and the interactions among age, age(2) and PLAU_1 genotype in the variance components framework, showed a significant age-dependent association between plasma Ass42 and PLAU_1 CT and TT genotypes (CTxage, TTxage(2), CT+TTxage(2) and age(2) were all significant at P < 0.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	62	 As our main concern was to determine whether there is a significant age-dependent elevation of plasma Ass42 in elderly subjects associated with the CT, TT or pooled CT+TT genotypes, we performed a second analysis in which family members  > 50 years (Fig.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	63	 2) were analyzed using linear regression in the variance components framework.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	64	 This analysis showed that the CTxage and TTxage covariates had significant effects (P=0.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	65	007, respectively) in the 24 LOAD families (Table 7).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	66	 When the CT and TT variables were tested as a single CT+TT variable, the CT+TTxage covariate was even more significant (P=0.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	67	 It is noteworthy that even when we correct for the fact that three age groups were tested prior to the analysis of the 50 age group summarized in Table 7, using the most conservative approach of Bonferroni correction, there is still highly significant age-related PLAU genotype effect in these families (overall corrected P-values are 0.

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Multivariate regression analysis in members 50 years of age in 24 LOAD families   On the basis of these findings, when we re-analyzed the haplotypic associations in the 10 LOAD families for subjects 50 years of age, the association was even more significant at P=0.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	74	 We subsequently went back to analyze the haplotypes in the 24 families in this age group, which accounted for 22% of the total variance in the plasma Ass42 phenotype and was also significant (P=0.

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	76	 To analyze the missense PLAU_1 SNP, we obtained three more series from our collaborators at Karolinska Institute: the Gothenburg LOAD-control series, an autopsy-confirmed LOAD series from Gothenburg and a Scottish early onset AD (LOAD) series.

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The TT genotype was enriched in the LOAD patients of the MCR series, but this enrichment did not achieve significance.

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Three of the four remaining series (MCJ, Gothenburg and Scottish) showed some non-significant enrichment of the CT and/or TT genotypes (Table 8), but this did not occur in the autopsy-confirmed Gothenburg series.

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	89	  Analysis of Ass in PLAU knockout mice Our finding that PLAU variants are associated with elevated plasma Ass42 predicts that plasma Ass42 should be elevated in KO mice lacking a functional PLAU gene.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	90	 To test this, we analyzed plasma Ass42 in 11 PLAU KO mice (16) and 14 control mice with the same genetic background.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	91	 For comparison, KO mice lacking a functional neprilysin gene, which is known to be involved in Ass degradation (24), were analyzed in parallel.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	92	 When compared with controls, 3 to 6-month-old PLAU KO mice showed a highly significant increase in plasma Ass42 (P=0.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	93	006 by Mann to Whitney test) (Fig.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Plasma Ass40 also increased (P=0.

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Thus, the PLAU gene influences plasma Ass42 and our data suggest that this effect may become more pronounced with aging, consistent with our genetic analyses in LOAD families.

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	115	We then analyzed a common missense SNP, PLAU_1 (rs2227564) in a larger set of 24 families and six case to control series that include the initial series analyzed.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	116	 In the extended families, this SNP was associated with an age-related elevation in plasma Ass levels in individuals  > 50 years of age.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Plasma Ass displays a complex characteristic in that it appears to decline in an age-related fashion until 50 years of age and increase thereafter.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	118	 This characteristic is much more pronounced in subjects who have the CT or TT genotype for PLAU_1.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	119	 It is also noteworthy that the significance of association with PLAU haplotypes is enhanced when the  > 50 age group is analyzed separately in the 10 families, as expected (Table 4).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	120	 The finding of age-related increase in Ass is also evident in the plasma Ass of PLAU KO mice, consistent with the finding in humans.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	121	 These mice have significantly higher plasma Ass levels when compared with wild-type littermates; however, their brain Ass levels did not show significant difference.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	122	 This finding could have several explanations.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	123	 This may suggest that PLAU variants influence AD through an effect on plasma but not brain Ass42.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	124	 While this is conceivable, it is more likely that PLAU influences both plasma and brain Ass in a way that is not evident in KO mice.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Thus, PLAU may have a greater influence on secreted than on cell-associated Ass.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	126	 As most brain Ass is cell-associated (28), effects on secreted Ass that are easily detected in plasma could be hard to detect in brain.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Alternatively, compensatory changes triggered by PLAU KO may maintain brain Ass more effectively than plasma Ass.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	128	We analyzed PLAU_1 in six case to control series using meta-analysis.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	129	 (29) reported their meta-analyses of published genetic associations with various disease phenotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Of the 25 reported associations that they investigated by meta-analysis, eight showed significant association that replicated the original study, with most ORs in the 1.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	131	 On the basis of these findings, the authors recommended that large, collaborative genetic association studies should be encouraged, that all sound studies, positive or negative, should be published and that reports of association should include a meta-analysis of all available data.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Our meta-analyses of the PLAU_1 SNP in six case to control series indicate that the PLAU_1 CT+TT is associated with a modest (OR=1.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	133	21), but marginally significant (P=0.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	134	 This result is similar to that of Lohmueller et al.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	135	 (29), whose meta-analyses identified many other common genetic variants with modest, but significant effects on other disease phenotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Two other groups had previously published their findings on this SNP (15,30).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	137	 (15) found significant association in three case to control series from Germany, Switzerland and Italy, whereas Myers et al.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	138	 (30) did not find evidence of association with any of the PLAU SNPs they analyzed including PLAU_1.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Interestingly, the former found that in their series, it is the CC genotype that is associated with increased risk for LOAD, whereas in our series, it is the CT and TT genotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Furthermore, another group from Germany also found significant association with the CT and TT genotypes (M.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Riemenschneider, personal communication).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Thus, there clearly is heterogeneity among all these findings, with one group having significant results in the same direction as our series (M.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Riemenschneider), another finding significance with the common genotype (15) and a third group not finding any significance.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Clearly, all results need to be analyzed in one meta-analysis subsequent to their publication.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Nonetheless, as demonstrated by Lohmueller et al.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	146	 (29), such discrepancies are frequent among studies of common genetic variants in complex diseases, particularly when the effect size is modest.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	147	 There are many reasons for such discrepancies including small sample size, gene to gene and gene to environment interactions not modelled in studies, intra-sample heterogeneity/population substructure and analysis of the  marker  variant instead of the  disease  variant with varying degrees of LD.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	148	 While we tried to minimize these factors by gathering large series, age matching the Mayo Clinic series and choosing a variant that is likely to be functional itself, it is still plausible that some of these problems may be contributing to inter-series variations observed for PLAU_1.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	149	Indeed, the association for PLAU_1 is marginally significant with the confidence interval of 1.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Nonetheless, this statistical result should be considered in the presence of evidence from the family and animal data on the effect of PLAU in Ass; and with the understanding that there likely exist other variants in PLAU that affect the risk of AD, as suggested by the  compound genotype  data in the case to control series.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Furthermore, given the likely presence of important variants in other genes, such as VR22 and IDE, the finding of highly significant P-values for variants of modest effect in complex diseases may need to await the identification of most, if not all, functional mutations in multiple genes and their analyses in multiple large series.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	152	We recently published our findings of significant association in two other genes on chromosome 10 (31,32), IDE and VR22.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	153	 When we tested the key variants in all three genes, we did not find evidence of LD.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Joint analysis of the key variants demonstrates separate, independent effects.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Of all of the variants, only those in VR22 account for the linkage on chromosome 10.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	156	 PLAU variants are different from the other two in their age-related effects that manifest themselves more strongly after age 50.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Thus, each of these genes appears to act independently of one another via apparent separate mechanisms.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	158	 While the unequivocal effects of these genes in the pathogenesis of AD await the identification of all of the functional variants and testing them in large series, these findings provide evidence for the existence of LOAD risk variants that affect Ass, within and/or in the vicinity of these genes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	159	In addition to the extended LOAD families, six different case to control series were analyzed in this study.

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	184	 When the seven SNPs, thus identified, were analyzed in haplotype analysis, it was determined that two of them, the missense exon 2 SNP and exon 11 deletion SNP yielded redundant information.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Therefore, remainder of the analysis was carried out with five SNPs.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	186	PLAU SNP frequencies estimated in MCJ, MCR, UKy series and 24 LOAD families are summarized in Table 2.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Of all the SNPs tested in all these groups, the rare Exon 2 SNP is in Hardy to Weinberg disequilibrium in the control groups in MCJ and MCR.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	188	 This SNP is not used in the compound genotype analysis.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	189	 In addition, exon 6 SNP is in Hardy to Weinberg disequilibrium in the MCJ control series.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	190	DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using routine methods.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The Gothenburg, Gothenburg-Postmortem and Scottish series were genotyped using dynamic allele specific hybridization (34,35).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The other series were genotyped on an ABI7900 instrument using TaqMan technology.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	193	 For the TaqMan assays, software for designing primers and probes implemented within the ABI PRISM 7900 HT sequence detection system was utilized.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The NCBI GenBank PLAU gene sequence AF377330 was used.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	195	 The pedigree structure, phenotypic and genotypic information, was maintained in PEDSYS (36) (http://www.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	196	org/sfbr/public/software/pedsys/pedsys.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	197	html), which also produced output files for the analysis performed with SOLAR, as explained subsequently.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	198	Analysis of LD among the SNPs We measured LD between the SNPs within the 10 extended LOAD families by using the GOLD program (22).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	199	 This program determines various pairwise statistical parameters for LD, such as Lewontin's standardized disequilibrium coefficient (19) D' and d2.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	200	 LD was detected from the founders and married-ins using the expectation to maximization algorithm of Slatkin and Excoffier (37).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	201	 We also detected LD within the ADs and controls from MCR, MCJ and UKy series using the same program.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	202	Tests of association between PLAU SNP haplotypes and plasma Ass levels in LOAD families We estimated the haplotypes for the five PLAU SNPs genotyped in the members of the ten LOAD families using GOLD (22) and Simwalk2 (17).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	203	 There was highly significant LD among all five PLAU SNPs, and no crossover events were observed.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	204	 In our 10 extended LOAD families, we tested for association between PLAU haplotypes and plasma Ass42 phenotype using the variance components method implemented in the computer program SOLAR (20).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	205	This method, described in detail elsewhere (20), estimates the amount of variance in a quantitative trait owing to residual genetic factors (g2), shared-family environment (2h) and individual specific, random environmental factors (2e), based on the phenotype covariance between arbitrary relative pairs.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The covariance matrix takes the form.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	207	where 2 is the matrix of kinship coefficients describing polygenic factors, I is the identity matrix describing sporadic environmental factors and H is the household matrix.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	208	 This is a matrix whose ijth element is equal to 1 if individuals i and j share a specified environment, and 0 otherwise.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Our family collection is largely composed of extended pedigrees, where we have measured the plasma Ass of most members from each family in a single batch of ELISAs.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	210	 To rigorously account for any possible assay batch to batch variations that may affect the variance in plasma Ass, we included a household matrix in the models.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	211	 As almost all individuals from each family were measured in one batch, the household matrix included an element equal to 1 for those individuals from the same extended family, and 0 otherwise.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	212	 We realize that by doing so, we may be overly conservative.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Our collection is largely weighted towards families with high-Ass segregating within the family.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Given that the shared-family effect (household) overlaps with kinship, we may have over corrected and underestimated the shared-genetic effect by including the household term in the model.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The scalars g2, h2 and e2 are estimated using maximum likelihood.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	216	To formulate an association model for PLAU SNP haplotypes, we used the within-pedigree association model of Hopper and Mathews (21).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Under this model, the matrix of allelic sharing within pedigrees, =(ij), is defined such that ij=1 if individuals i and j are from the same pedigree and share both alleles of a haplotype identical in state, ij=1/2 if individuals i and j are from the same pedigree and share one allele identical in state and ij=0 otherwise.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Under the  association  model, SOLAR estimates the variance in the quantitative trait owing to association (a2), residual genetic factors (g2), same-household effects (h2) and environmental effects (e2).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Under the null-model of  no association , a2 is fixed to zero.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	220	 The difference between the log10 likelihoods of these two models produces a test statistic with the same distribution as the LOD score of genetic linkage analysis.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	221	 There is one degree of freedom between the two models (association fixed, association tested) and one-sided test is performed.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	222	Tests of association in the LOAD case to control series by CLUMP In our case to control series, we tested for association between the PLAU compound genotypes and LOAD using CLUMP.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	223	 The CLUMP program (23) measures the statistical significance of a variety of 2xm contingency tables by simulation.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	224	 We employed the T1 test within CLUMP, which analyzes the raw 2xm table where m is the total number of categories.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	225	 In our application of CLUMP, the 2xm table consisted of two diagnostic categories and m genotypic categories, each corresponding to a unique combination of genotypes at the five PLAU SNPs.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	226	Ass analysis Plasma Ass40 and Ass42 were measured as previously described (11).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	227	 The relationship between plasma Ass42, age and PLAU_1 genotypes in LOAD family members was initially analyzed by fitting polynomial regression curves separately for all family members with rs2227564 CC, CT, TT or CT+TT genotypes, using 10 log(Ass42) as the dependent variable and age and age(2) as the independent variables.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	228	 These analyses showed genotype-specific age-related effects on plasma Ass42 levels and indicated that plasma Ass42 increases with aging beginning at age 50 in those individuals with a CT or TT genotype.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	229	We had used the 20 to 65 year age group in our previous studies where we found linkage between plasma Ass levels and a locus on chromosome 10 (1).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	230	 As described previously, the 20 to 65 year age group was initially chosen because of our observation that plasma Ass is elevated in individuals  < 25 and  > 65 years old.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	231	 In addition, plasma Ass appears to have complex likely deposition-related changes in individuals with AD, who are in the  > 65 age group.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	232	 In this study, we determined significant age-related effects of PLAU_1 genotypes on plasma Ass levels in those individuals  > 50 years, depicted subsequent.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Thus, all analyses were performed in the  all ages ,  20- to 65-year-old  and   > 50 years  groups.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	234	Tests of association between the PLAU_1 (rs2227564) SNP and plasma Ass levels in LOAD families We applied variance components methodology implemented in the software package SOLAR (20) to estimate the effect of covariates on plasma Ass levels, while controlling for the pairwise genetic relationships and shared-family effects among family members in the extended LOAD pedigrees.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	235	We tested for the association of PLAU_1 genotypes on plasma Ass by performing a multivariate regression analysis, while including the kinship, identity and household matrices, described earlier, in the model.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	236	 We tested two different models.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	237	 The significance and coefficients for all covariates were tested using the polygenic-screen-all option of SOLAR, which provides a p-value and coefficient by comparing a model that includes the covariate to a model that excludes it.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	238	 This option causes all covariates to stay in the model regardless of their significance.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	239	 In Model 1, the covariates tested were CT and TT genotypes, age, CT genotypexage and TT genotypexage.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	240	 For Model 2, the CT and TT genotypes were pooled into a single CT+TT variable encoded as one for subjects with a CT or TT genotype and zero for those with a CC genotype.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	241	 All analyses were performed in family members who were 50 years of age.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	242	 We selected this subset because we determined an age-related increase in plasma Ass42 levels after age 50 in those individuals with PLAU_1 genotypes CT or TT.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	243	 All analyses were performed both with all Ass values and a second time by excluding the two extreme  outliers  with plasma Ass levels  plus or minus 4 SD beyond the mean.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The PLAU_1 CTxage and PLAU_1 CT+TTxage were still significant variables in Model 1 and 2, respectively, after excluding the outliers.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	245	To determine the age-related effect of PLAU_1 genotypes and PLAU_1 genotypes on plasma Ass42 levels in LOAD family members of all ages, we fitted two non-linear regression models, while taking into account the same variance components as described earlier.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	246	 In Model 1 for family members of all ages, age(2), PLAU_1 CTxage(2) and PLAU_1 TTxage(2) were tested as covariates in addition to age, PLAU_1 CT, PLAU_1 TT, PLAU_1 CTxage and PLAU_1 TTxage.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	247	 In Model 2, age(2) and PLAU_1 CT+TTxage(2) were included as covariates besides age, PLAU_1 CT+TT and PLAU_1 CT+TTxage.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	248	 The rationale for testing these non-linear models is described in detail in the main text.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	249	Logistic regression analysis to test for association with the PLAU_1 (rs2227564) SNP in case to controls Logistic regression analysis implemented in SAS version 8 was utilized to test for association between AD and PLAU_1 genotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Initially, a model that estimated and tested the effects of PLAU_1 CT and TT genotypes separately was utilized.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	251	 The results of this analysis suggested similar risky estimates for these genotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Given this result and that the PLAU_1 TT genotype is relatively rare, a second model was fitted, where CT and TT genotypes were combined into one variable, CT+TT, coded as 1 for those with CT or TT genotype and 0 for those with CC genotype.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	253	Meta-analysis of PLAU_1 (rs2227564) SNP in 10 case to control series Using the genotype counts for PLAU_1 CT+TT versus CC genotypes in AD cases and controls from the six series described in this article, we performed meta-analysis implemented in the StatsDirect statistical package.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Breslow to Day test was performed to test for heterogeneity among the samples.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Pooled OR estimates were calculated using both fixed effects and random effects model as implemented in the Mantel to Haenszel, and DerSimonian to Laird tests, respectively.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	256	Analysis of plasma and brain Ass in PLAU KO mice Plasma Ass42 and Ass40 were analyzed by sandwich ELISA as previously described (11).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Brain Ass42 and Ass40 were analyzed by ELISA following direct extraction into formic acid and neutralization as previously described (28).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	258	 All KO mice were homozygous for the null allele.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	259	 All results were normalized to the Ass present in 3- to 6-month-old control (wild-type) mice.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Numbers analyzed were as follows: 3- to 6-month-old PLAU KO mice (16) (n=9), control mice (n=6); 11-month-old PLAU KO mice (n=2), control (n=7) mice; 3- to 6-month-old neprilysin KO mice (24) (n=3), control mice (n=3).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	261	 The neprilysin KO mice were used for additional positive control (24).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	262	To evaluate brain Ass42 and Ass40, we used the same methods that we previously employed to demonstrate that endogenous brain Ass42 increases in transgenic mice expressing presenilin 1 mutations linked to early-onset familial AD (9).

0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	9	Results The apolipoprotein E 4 allele, oestrogen deficiency and high levels of Ass1-42 peptide are associated with earlier onset of dementia, while atypical karyotypes and the apolipoprotein E 2 allele are associated with reduced mortality and reduced risk of dementia.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	10	Conclusions Factors which influence Ass levels, rather than overexpression of APP, may account for the differences in age at onset of dementia in Down's syndrome.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	11	Several lines of evidence suggest that deposition of Ass-42 is an important initial step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Ass1-42 aggregates more rapidly and is deposited earlier in Alzheimer's disease plaques than Ass1-40 (Iwatsubo et al, 1994).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Mutations in the gene for APP and in presenilin (PS1/2) genes are associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease and with a selective increase in Ass1-42 (Borchelt et al, 1996; Mann et al, 1996; Scheuner et al, 1996; Kosaka et al, 1997; Younkin, 1998).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Brain levels of Ass1-42 increase early in the development of Alzheimer's disease and are strongly correlated with cognitive decline (Cummings  and  Cotman, 1995; Naslund et al, 2000), and plasma levels of Ass1-42 are higher in elderly people who subsequently develop Alzheimer's disease than in those who remain free of dementia (Mayeux et al, 1999).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	15	Virtually all individuals with Down's syndrome have neuropathological changes consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by the time they reach 40 years of age, including deposition of Ass in diffuse and neuritic plaques (Wisniewski, H.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	16	 et al, 1995; Mann, 1988), and most will develop dementia by the end of their seventh decade of life (Lai  and  Williams, 1989).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Despite the nearly universal occurrence of Alzheimer's disease pathology by middle age, there is wide variation in age at onset of dementia.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease at age 65 has ranged between 30% and 75% (Zigman et al, 1997).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Most studies have shown that the average age at onset of dementia is between 50 and 55 years, with a range from 38 to 70 years (Lai  and  Williams, 1989; Prasher  and  Krishnan, 1993).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Methodological problems may account for some of the variation in estimated prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in this population requires both documentation of clinically significant decline in cognitive and adaptive competence from previously attained levels of performance and documentation of the absence of any other condition that might cause declines in performance (Aylward et al, 1997).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Both these requirements are particularly difficult to address for adults with Down's syndrome, given their lifelong intellectual disability.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The wide range of premorbid levels of performance associated with differences in level of intellectual disability requires specific criteria for clinically significant decline indicative of dementia for each level of function, and these are just beginning to be developed.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	24	 There is, as yet, no consensus on a set of cognitive assessment tasks or on diagnostic criteria for existing cognitive assessment batteries that can differentiate adults with Down's syndrome who do and do not have dementia in its early stages.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Presently, most diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome are made clinically, at relatively late stages of the disease, without systematic cognitive or functional testing over time.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	26	The neuropathological manifestations of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome have been attributed to triplication and overexpression of the gene for APP located on chromosome 21 (Rumble et al, 1989) and the increased risk of dementia in Down's syndrome may be mediated by an increased substrate for cellular production of Ass peptides.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Recent neuropathological studies have shown that diffuse plaques, the most prevalent Alzheimer-type lesion seen in individuals with Down's syndrome before age 50, are not associated with dementia.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Diffuse plaques contain non-fibrillar amyloid, appear at younger ages than do neuritic plaques, are not associated with neuronal degeneration, and do not appear to affect the structure and function of neurons.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In contrast, increases in the numbers of neuritic plaques, containing substantial amounts of fibrillised Ass peptides, are observed in adults with Down's syndrome predominantly after 50 years of age and are associated with neuronal degeneration and loss of function (Wisniewski, T.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Examination of the age-specific prevalence of dementia in Down's syndrome supports the hypothesis that the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome are closely associated with the development of these fibrillised plaques (Lai  and  Williams, 1989; Visser et al, 1997; Holland et al, 1998; Lai et al, 1999) (see Fig.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Although prevalence studies have employed varying sampling and diagnostic methods, there is remarkable agreement across studies that risk of Alzheimer's disease increases primarily after 50 years of age.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In addition, not all adults with Down's syndrome will develop dementia even if they reach ages when the presence of high densities of neuritic plaques can be presumed.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Thus, while triplication of the gene for APP may serve to increase diffuse plaques in adults with Down's syndrome, factors distinct from APP triplication must account for individual differences in susceptibility to the formation of fibrillised plaques and for the wide range in age at onset of dementia.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	34	 A central task of the epidemiology of dementia in Down's syndrome is to identify factors that may influence risk of Alzheimer's disease by accelerating formation of Ass.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Several avenues of investigation are suggested by existing findings and I will review the role of (a) atypical karyotypes; (b) genetic susceptibility factors; (c) gender and oestrogen deficiency; and (d) individual differences in Ass peptide levels.

0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	40	Polymorphisms in the gene for apolipoprotein E (APOE) have been associated with risk for the more common late-onset Alzheimer's disease, that is, with onset after 65 years of age.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	41	 There are three common variants of the gene for APOE, encoded for by three alleles, 2, 3 and 4.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	42	 In numerous cross-sectional and case control studies, patients with Alzheimer's disease have been found to be significantly more likely than their peers to have one or more copies of the APOE 4 allele (Corder et al, 1993; Mayeux et al, 1993; Saunders et al, 1993).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The APOE 4 protein may act by increasing the rate of the process which leads to Alzheimer's disease, predisposing to greater accumulation of Ass in those with and without Alzheimer's disease (Roses et al, 1994; Hyman et al, 1995; Polvikoski et al, 1995).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The presence of the least common allele, APOE 2, has been associated with a delay in disease onset or even protection by most investigators (Corder et al, 1994; Roses et al, 1994).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	45	Apolipoprotein E in Down's syndrome The relation of APOE genotype to risk of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome has been difficult to establish.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	46	 All studies have consistently found that the presence of the APOE 2 allele increases longevity and reduces the risk of dementia but the role of the 4 allele has been controversial (Hardy et al, 1994; Royston et al, 1994; Martins et al, 1995; van Gool et al, 1995; Cosgrave et al, 1996; Lambert et al, 1996; Schupf et al, 1996; Prasher et al, 1997; Schupf et al, 1998; Sekijima et al, 1998; Tyrrell et al, 1998; Lai et al, 1999; Rubinszstein et al, 1999; Deb et al, 2000).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Small sample sizes and, importantly, failure to consider differences in the age at onset of dementia among those with and without an 4 allele may account for some of the negative findings.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Since the effect of the 4 allele is not expressed until midlife, inclusion of sufficient numbers of adults over 50 years of age and analysis using survival methods that can adjust for age and years of follow-up are important methodological considerations.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Our group used survival methods for analysis and found that the presence of the 4 allele was associated with earlier onset of dementia and greater decline in adaptive behaviour (Schupf et al, 1996).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Compared with those with the APOE 3/3 genotype, adults with Down's syndrome with an 4 allele were five times as likely to develop dementia by age 65, while no one with an 2 allele developed dementia (see Fig.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Among affected individuals, mean age at onset of dementia was 53.

0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Several studies that found that the APOE 2 allele decreased risk of dementia had sample sizes that were too small to demonstrate a significant effect of the 4 allele (Hardy et al, 1994; Royston et al, 1994; Wisniewski, T.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Two case control studies of adults with Down's syndrome compared allele frequencies in individuals with and without dementia and found no significant association between APOE genotype and Alzheimer's disease but did not adjust for age (van Gool et al, 1995; Prasher et al, 1997).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	61	 One large study examined 100 adults with Down's syndrome (40-70 years of age) and used survival analyses to examine age at onset of dementia by APOE genotype (Lai et al, 1999).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The cumulative incidence of dementia by age 65 was 55% for those with the APOE 2/3 genotype, 88% for those with the APOE 3/3 genotype and 100% for those with any 4 allele.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The effect of the 4 allele was stronger at younger ages, consistent with findings from studies in the general population that the effect of the 4 allele is to accelerate onset of Alzheimer's disease (Corder et al, 1993; Saunders et al, 1993; Meyer et al, 1998).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Cumulative incidence to age 55 was 0.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	65	71 among those with an 4 allele and 0.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	66	40 among those with the APOE 3/3 genotype.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The authors suggested that the 4 effect in their study may have been attenuated by the high rates of dementia at more advanced ages.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	68	 They concluded that the effect of the 4 allele may be dependent on the age of the study sample.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	69	These findings are consistent with reduced Ass deposition (Polvikoski et al, 1995) and less plaque formation (Benjamin et al, 1994; Lippa et al, 1994) in those with an 2 allele, and with acceleration of Ass pathology in those with an 4 allele (Hymen et al, 1995; Polvikoski et al, 1995).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The size of the 4 effect, the relation of the presence of an 4 allele to early mortality and the interaction of APOE genotype with other risk factors for dementia in Down's syndrome such as gender and level of learning disability remain to be resolved.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	71	 This will require larger and older samples and analytic procedures which can provide better adjustment for age and other potential confounders.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	72	In human studies, some, but not all, data show higher age-specific rates of Alzheimer's disease in women compared with men (Bachman et al, 1993) and approximately half the risk of Alzheimer's disease in women who have received oestrogen replacement therapy (Barrett-Conner  and  Kritz-Silverstein, 1993; Brenner et al, 1994; Henderson et al, 1994; Paganini-Hill  and  Henderson, 1994; Mortel  and  Meyer, 1995; Tang et al, 1996).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Such findings support the hypothesis that oestrogen deficiency contributes to the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	74	 In contrast, randomised controlled clinical trials of oestrogen replacement therapy in women with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease have failed to show cognitive improvement, suggesting that the major effect of oestrogen is to delay onset rather than reverse cognitive and functional decline (Henderson et al, 2000; Mulnard et al, 2000).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	75	Gender differences and the effects of oestrogen in Down's syndrome have not been systematically investigated and more work is needed to clarify how hormonal risk factors may influence onset of dementia.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Few studies have presented results separately for men and women.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Studies that have compared women with men have found conflicting results, with different studies showing earlier onset (Raghaven et al, 1994; Lai et al, 1999), later onset (Farrer et al, 1997; Schupf et al, 1998) or no difference in age at onset (Visser et al, 1997; Lai  and  Williams, 1989) by gender.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Two studies employed survival methods to examine age at onset distributions by gender, adjusting for both age and level of learning disability, and found conflicting results.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	79	 My colleagues and I found that men with Down's syndrome were three times as likely as women to develop Alzheimer's disease by age 65 (see Fig.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	80	 3a); the effect of gender was observed in all age groups over 50 years (Schupf et al, 1998).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Both men and women with Down's syndrome show elevations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone at puberty indicative of primary gonadal dysfunction, which appear to progress with age and be more frequent in men than in women (Hasen et al, 1980; Campbell et al, 1982; Hsiang et al, 1987; Hestnes et al, 1991).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Thus, older men may not benefit from the relative preservation of oestrogen proposed to account for lower risk of Alzheimer's disease in men in the general population.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	83	 In contrast, another study found that women with Down's syndrome were approximately twice as likely to develop dementia as men (Lai et al, 1999) (see Fig.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	84	 In that study, the effect of gender was seen primarily at younger ages.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	85	 In both studies, gender differences were largest in those with the APOE 3/3 genotype, suggesting that the high risk associated with the presence of the APOE 4 allele can mask gender effects.

0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	92	 There was a significant relationship between age at menopause and age at onset of dementia in this subsample (r=0.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received July 29, 2003; Revised September 23, 2003; Accepted October 7, 2003.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	3	Several groups (7 to 9) have suggested that quantitative, intermediate phenotypes may be useful in unraveling the complex genetics of disorders such as LOAD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Clinical disease states such as LOAD are likely to result from an uncertain, complex sequence of pathophysiologic events whereas intermediate phenotypes may be more directly related to the action of a set of genes that are more easily identified.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Thus the identification of genes with variants that contribute to specific intermediate phenotypes may be a tractable way to identify at least some of the genes that contribute to diseases governed by complex genetics.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	6	 To optimize the utility of this approach, it is important to select intermediate phenotypes that are highly heritable and have a close biological link to the disease in question.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	7	In our studies, we have focused on levels of the amyloid ss protein (Ass), specifically Ass42, as a quantitative intermediate phenotype for LOAD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Ass is a secreted protein (10 to 12) derived from a set of large precursor proteins collectively referred to as the amyloid ss protein precursor.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Secreted Ass, which is produced by virtually all cells, is readily detected in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Most secreted Ass has forty amino acids (Ass40) but a small fraction (5 to 10%) has two additional amino acids at the carboxyl terminus (Ass42) (13 to 15).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In the brains of all patients with AD, a large amount of Ass aggregates and is deposited in senile plaques, much of it in the form of highly insoluble amyloid fibrils.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	12	 To make a definite diagnosis of AD, large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles must be demonstrated in the brain at autopsy (16).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In all LOAD patients, a large amount of the Ass deposited in senile plaques ends at Ass42.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In one-third of cases, Ass ending at Ass42 is essentially the only form of Ass deposited, in one-third it is the predominant form and in one-third a large amount of Ass40 is also deposited (17).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	15	 It is worth noting that synthetic Ass40 and Ass42 both spontaneously assemble into amyloid fibrils in vitro, but Ass42 forms amyloid fibrils far more rapidly than Ass40 (18,19).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The brain has very high levels of APP mRNA; the concentration of Ass in cerebrospinal fluid is 50 times higher than in plasma; and mixed fetal brain cultures produce far more Ass than other types of cultured cells (12,20,21).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Thus it is likely that senile plaques form specifically in the brain because Ass levels are higher in the brain than in other organs.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	18	The APP, presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 genes have many, fully penetrant mutations that cause early onset familial AD (EOFAD) (22 to 25).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Apart from its early onset and causation by specific mutations, EOFAD is clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from LOAD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	20	 We and others have shown that the EOFAD mutations all increase Ass42 and sometimes increase Ass40 as well (15,26 to 30).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Importantly, we observed plasma Ass42 elevations both in EOFAD patients and in young, cognitively normal carriers of EOFAD mutations (31).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	22	 We also observed Ass42 elevations in plasma from non-demented relatives of LOAD patients between the ages of 20 and 65 (32).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Importantly, these elevations were not associated with the ApoE4 allele or with variants in any of the EOFAD genes (32).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	24	 (33) found in a longitudinal study of unrelated elderly individuals, that those who subsequently developed AD had higher plasma levels of Ass42 than did those who remained free of dementia.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Collectively these findings show that Ass42 is closely linked to AD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	26	 To investigate the heritability of plasma Ass, we analyzed extended LOAD families and found that plasma Ass40 and Ass42 levels both have substantial heritability (34).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	27	Given these findings that the level of plasma Ass42 was likely to be useful as an intermediate, quantitative phenotype for LOAD, we performed variance components linkage analysis on this trait in a group of extended LOAD pedigrees.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This analysis showed significant linkage to a locus at 80 cM on chromosome 10 (35).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Linkage to the same region was obtained independently in a study of affected LOAD sib-pairs (36).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Together, these two studies provide strong evidence for a novel LOAD locus on chromosome 10 that acts to increase Ass42.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The sib-pair group estimated the effect of this locus to be equivalent to that of ApoE, suggesting that it was likely to be a major risk factor for LOAD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	32	 A third group found linkage in a more downstream region of chromosome 10 and focused on the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) as a possible candidate gene in this region (37).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	33	 More recently, a fourth group using age of onset as a quantitative phenotype in AD and Parkinson's disease (PD) families found suggestive linkage to chromosome 10 at 133 to 135 cM (38).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	34	An important advantage of the variance components approach employed here is that candidate genes, identified through their likely effect on Ass42, can be evaluated systematically to determine how much various within-gene variants contribute to linkage.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In this study, we analyzed VR22 for variants that contribute to the linkage signal on chromosome 10.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Both its location and function make VR22 a strong candidate gene.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Located at 80 cM at the peak of the previously reported linkage signal, VR22 encodes a novel catenin, -T catenin, which was recently cloned by Jannsens et al.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The catenins interact closely with ss catenin and play an important role in intercellular adhesion as strong intercellular adhesion depends on linkage of the cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton via the /ss catenin complex.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	39	 -T catenin is closely homologous to -N catenin, which is neuron specific, and to -E catenin, which is expressed in all tissues.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	40	 -T catenin is expressed at high levels in testis and heart, but it is also expressed in human and mouse brain (39).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	41	 -T catenin has overall sequence identity of 56 and 58% with -E and -N catenin respectively.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	42	 (39) have shown that that -T catenin interacts with ss catenin in a functionally effective fashion.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	43	 This makes VR22 a strong functional candidate because ss catenin interacts with presenilin 1 (40), which has many mutations that increase Ass42 (26,29,31) and cause early onset familial AD (24).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	44	 (40) has shown that loss of signalling through the ss catenin pathway leads to enhanced neuronal vulnerability to Ass.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	45	 In addition, ss catenin and presenilin forms a complex that leads to stabilization of the former, such that destabilization of this complex leads to ss catenin degradation and enhanced neuronal apoptosis.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Presenilin mutations were shown to lead to destabilization of the ss catenin to presenilin complex, degradation of the ss catenin and enhanced Ass production.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Given that catenins provide the link between ss catenin and its binding counterparts (such as presenilins) to the actin cytoskeleton, it is possible to postulate that mutations in catenins could lead to disruption of the stability of the ss catenin to presenilin complex resulting in enhanced neuronal vulnerability of cells to Ass and increased Ass production.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	56	 These SNPs were selected to be in several groups, which were designed to span the entire VR22 gene at 250 kb intervals as well as the region 3' of VR22.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Given that the extent of LD in the human genome was estimated in different studies to be anywhere between 10 and  > 100  kb (41 to 45); and that this extent in any one genomic region is not predictable a priori, it is possible to miss association signals due to variants in-between our SNP groups.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	60	 However, given the size of VR22, and our extent of coverage throughout and outside this gene, association signals we did identify with the 4360 to 4783 VR22 SNPs will be well-bounded within VR22 with this SNP genotyping design.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Three to six SNPs were analyzed in each group, and linkage disequilibrium between the most significantly associating 4360 SNP and the other SNPs was analyzed in the 22 combined families (Fig.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	70	 On the 5 side, SNP association with Ass42 also decreased to baseline levels within the VR22 gene (Fig.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	71	 On the 3 side, the significance of SNP association decreased by more than 2 orders of magnitude (from 0.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Association was at baseline levels on the 3 side 1 000 kb from the 3 margin of VR22.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	74	This bounding approach effectively limits the region of potential association on both the 3 and 5 sides of 4360 to within VR22.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Thus, our data provide strong evidence that the association of the 4360 and 4783 SNPs with plasma Ass42 is due to variant(s) in the VR22 gene.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	76	Given that a total of 51 SNPs were genotyped, the issue of multiple testing can be raised.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Many of the SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium and therefore are not independent from one another (Fig.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Therefore, a simple Bonferroni correction under the assumption of 51 independent tests is overly conservative for this study.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Nonetheless, even when Bonferroni correction is applied, the 4783 and 4360 SNPs are still significant in the 10 families (P=0.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The association in the smaller set of 12 families are no longer significant after this overly conservative correction (P=2 and 4 for 4783 and 4360, respectively), nonetheless their inclusion in the analysis leads to improved evidence for association.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	82	Contribution of VR22 association to linkage at 80 cM We next investigated the contribution of the VR22 4360/4783 association to the linkage that we previously reported.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Our initial linkage findings were obtained using seven markers covering 14 cM on chromosome 10.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	84	 To analyze the entirety of chromosome 10, we genotyped 26 additional markers spanning 165 cM in the 10 LOAD families.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The peak described by the multipoint lod scores broadened and flattened considerably with the incorporation of the additional markers, but the maximum multipoint lod score continued to be at 80 cM (Fig.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	92	  The reason for the broader and flatter peak in this fine-mapping analysis may be several-fold.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	93	 First, we utilized the MCMC MIBD estimation implemented in the Simwalk2 package (46,47) for the multipoint linkage results presented in this paper as opposed to the regression-based MIBD estimation algorithm implemented in SOLAR, which was used in our original paper (34, see also Subjects and Methods).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Second, genotyping of additional markers leads to more information regarding recombination that could potentially lead to a decrease in the original linkage signal obtained by fewer markers.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Third, utilizing a larger number of markers increases the likelihood of map or genotyping errors, despite the implementation of strict genotype-quality control measures.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Indeed, others have also found that fine-mapping with more markers can lead to a lowering in their original lod scores obtained with a lesser number of markers (48,49).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	97	To evaluate the extent to which the 4360 and 4783 SNPs [or functional SNP(s) associated with this tightly linked pair] account for the linkage observed, we repeated linkage analysis after regressing out the effect of the VR22 4360 association by including it as a covariate in the linkage model.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	98	 After regressing out the effect of this SNP, the multipoint linkage signal diminished substantially in the 10 combined families (Fig.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	99	 This marked diminution in lod scores indicates that a substantial proportion of the linkage signal for plasma Ass42 is accounted for by the VR22 4360 association.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The residual linkage signal that persisted after regressing out the VR22 4360 association indicates that there are likely to be additional variants that contribute to linkage, though this residual signal may also be due to random variation.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The diminution in the maximum multipoint lod scores, upon inclusion of the 4360 SNP as a covariate, is also evident from the comparison of the variance component model that excludes this covariate (Table 3B) to the one that includes it (Table 3C).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The P-value for the major gene effect at the maximum multipoint locus goes from 0.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The same trend is observed when the twopoint linkage for the 4360 SNP is assessed with and without including 4360 as a covariate (Table 3D and E).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The P-value for the major gene at the 4360 locus loses significance from P=0.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	105	Since they are intronic SNPs located 1.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	106	4 kb from the nearest exon, 4360 and 4783 are unlikely to have a functional effect, and their association with Ass42 presumably occurs because they are in LD with one or several functional VR22 SNPs.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Our sequencing of all VR22 exons in the only reported VR22 transcript (39) failed to identify any potentially functional SNP(s) that could account for the 4360/4783 association.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	108	 It is possible that there are functional SNPs that affect the splicing of known or alternatively spliced exons, in strong LD with 4360/4783.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	109	The basic premise in studying plasma Ass42 as an intermediate phenotype is that genes with variants that influence plasma Ass42 will be genes with variants that influence risk for LOAD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The results reported here are useful because they identify VR22 as a gene with variants that influence plasma Ass42, thereby increasing the likelihood that VR22 is the gene (or one of the genes) in the 80 cM region of chromosome 10 with variants that influence risk for LOAD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	111	 An important, unanswered question is how well the effect of a SNP on plasma Ass42 will correlate with its effect on the AD phenotype.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	112	 It is unlikely that the change in plasma Ass42 caused by a specific genetic variant directly increases risk for AD; increased risk for AD is probably produced by a related effect that the variant has within the brain.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Thus it is conceivable, perhaps even likely, that a specific variant with a strong influence on plasma Ass42 may sometimes have little or no influence on the AD phenotype and vice versa.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	114	 It is only by thoroughly studying several genes and elucidating the effects of the entire set of functional variants on the plasma Ass42 and AD phenotypes that this question can be answered.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	115	 It may be that effects on the two phenotypes correlate well for the variants in some genes and poorly in others.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	116	The results reported here indicate that VR22 variants significantly associate with plasma Ass42 and account for a substantial portion of our linkage signal on chromosome 10.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Additional analysis is needed to identify the entire set of functional variants that account for the Ass42 linkage at 80 cM.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Once they are identified it will be important to test their effects on Ass production and VR22 gene function by biological experiments; as well as to determine whether these functional variants modify the risk for AD.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	143	In addition, the effect of shared-environment (h2) on the variance of the trait can also be estimated by including a household matrix in the model.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	144	 This is a matrix whose ijth element is equal to 1 if individuals i and j share a specified environment, and 0, otherwise.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Our family collection is largely composed of extended pedigrees, where we have measured the plasma Ass of most members from each family in a single batch of ELISAs.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	146	 To rigorously account for any possible assay batch to batch variations that may affect the variance in plasma Ass42, we included a household matrix in the models.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Since almost all individuals from each family were measured in one batch, the household matrix included an element=1 for those individuals from the same extended family and 0, otherwise.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	148	 We realize that by doing so, we are probably being overly conservative.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Since the shared-family (household) effect employed to account for potential batch to batch variance in the assay overlaps with the kinship effect (55), inclusion of the household matrix almost certainly overcorrects for batch to batch variance and underestimates the shared-genetic effect.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	150	 For this reason, we performed the heritability and linkage analyses, both with and without the household matrix in the model.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The multipoint results shown in Figures 2 and 3 include the household matrix.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The analyses without the household matrix yielded slightly better lod scores and higher heritabilities in general.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	153	The scalars q2, g2, h2 and e2 are estimated using maximum likelihood.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	154	 For heritability estimations, we compared an environmental model where q2 and g2 were fixed at zero and h2 and e2 were estimated, to the polygenic model where g2, h2 and e2 were estimated.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The linkage analyses were performed by comparing the polygenic model to the linkage model where q2 was also estimated.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The difference between the two log10 likelihoods for the models produces a lod score that is equivalent to the classical lod score of linkage analysis.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	157	 We incorporated sex, age, age2, sex*age, and sex*age2 as covariates in the heritability estimations.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	158	 None of these covariates were significant at P < 0.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	159	05 therefore, they were excluded from the multipoint linkage analysis.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	160	In order to minimize age and dementia-related environmental effects on plasma Ass42 levels, we performed all of our analyses on the 20 to 65 year age group, as in our previous studies (34,35).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Since variance components methods are based on the underlying assumption that the quantitative trait being analyzed has a normal distribution, 10log(Ass42) levels were used as the phenotypes.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Extreme outliers with plasma Ass levels  plus or minus 4 standard deviations beyond the mean were excluded from the analyses.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Thus the 10log(Ass42) phenotype analyzed had a normal distribution.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Plasma Ass measurements were done using a well established sandwich ELISA system as described previously (15).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	165	 All samples were measured in duplicate.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Each ELISA plate included samples from five volunteers.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The results from these five standard samples were used to normalize the values obtained so as to reduce plate-to-plate and day-to-day variance.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	168	Identity-by-descent probability estimations The identity-by-descent (IBD) probabilities at each genotyped marker were estimated using the pairwise likelihood-based estimation method implemented in SOLAR (53).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	169	 These IBD estimates were used to obtain the twopoint lod scores.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Multipoint IBD probabilities were also estimated at each centimorgan between each pair of adjacent markers using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multipoint IBD estimation approach implemented in the Simwalk2 package (46,47).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The MCMC process was run twice, once with the default length of 1000 replicates and a second time by doubling this process length.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Multipoint linkage analyses using these MIBD matrices were done using the variance components methodology implemented in SOLAR.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	173	 The results using the shorter and longer runs were similar.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	174	 The results of the latter are presented here.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Given that the computation time increases with the marker number and that our two most upstream markers yielded no evidence for linkage in any of the datasets, these two markers (D10S1435 and D10S189) were omitted from the MIBD estimations.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	176	 There are two major differences between the MIBD estimations utilized in our previous report of linkage on chromosome 10 and the current study (35).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The results of the previous linkage were obtained as result of genotyping seven markers in a 13 cM region, and the current study utilizes 31 markers spread from 28.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Second, the MIBD estimation approaches that we used in the previous and current studies are different.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The MCMC approach implemented in Simwalk2 (46,47) that we utilized in this study is different from the MIBD probability estimation algorithm implemented in SOLAR, which was the approach we utilized in our initial analysis of seven chromosome 10 markers.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	180	 (47), demonstrated significant differences between the results obtained by these two methods using the same dataset and concluded that the multipoint MCMC approach yielded more accurate MIBD probability estimates for inter-marker loci.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	181	 For this reason, we utilized the MCMC approach in this study.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	182	Tests of association We initially tested for association between the SNPs and plasma Ass42 in the 10 extended LOAD families using a regression based covariate approach in the variance components paradigm implemented in the computer program SOLAR (53).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	183	 In order to control for the effect of linkage, we included the linkage component (q2) in both the null and alternative models tested.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	184	 We used the multipoint IBD matrix () that yielded the maximum multipoint lod score at 80 cM in the 10 extended LOAD families.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The multipoint IBD probabilities in the matrix , were estimated in Simwalk, using the genetic marker information as described above.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	186	To test the effect of specific SNP genotypes, we used the measured genotype approach where we included the copy number of the SNP allele as a covariate in the analysis and regressed the plasma Ass42 phenotype on this covariate for each individual.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The measured genotype approach is a classical test for differences in trait mean by genotype described theoretically previously (56,57).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	188	 This approach was also utilized in previous association studies of SNPs and various quantitative traits in extended families (58,59).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	189	 For individuals with an XX, XY or YY SNP genotype, we used a covariate that takes the value of 0, 1 or 2, respectively.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	190	 This formulation assumes that the SNP is an additive QTL.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The model that includes the covariate is tested against the model that does not include it to determine its effect on the quantitative trait of interest.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Twice the difference in natural log likelihoods of these two models is distributed as a 2 distribution with 1 degree of freedom.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In order to test for association above and beyond linkage, residual genetic and same-household effects, these three components were included in both the null and alternative models.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	194	 We first tested for association between the SNPs and Ass42 in the 10 LOAD families that we previously used to describe linkage to chromosome 10 (35).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In order to control for the effect of linkage, residual genetic effects and same-household effects in this group, we estimated the effect of each SNP on the background of a model that included our 80 cM multipoint identity-by-descent matrix, as well as kinship and household matrices.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	196	 We then tested each SNP for association with Ass42 in a second, independent set of 12 LOAD families, and also analyzed the combined group of 22 families.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	197	Linkage analysis conditional upon association A conditional linkage analysis that accounts for association with a functional polymorphism (or one in strong LD with it) at the linkage locus will decrease or eliminate the linkage signal (58,59).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	198	 For this reason, we performed linkage analysis conditional on the association with our most strongly associating SNP (4360TC).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	199	 We performed this test by estimating the proportion of variance due to linkage on the background of a model that included this SNP as a covariate and comparing it to a linkage only model that excluded this covariate.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	200	Analysis of linkage disequilibrium We measured linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the SNPs and the haplotype groups within the 22 extended LOAD families by using the GOLD program (60).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	201	 We used the expectation-maximization algorithm of Slatkin and Excoffier (61) to determine various pairwise statistical parameters for LD, such as Lewontin's standardized disequilibrium coefficient D (62).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	202	 This algorithm determines LD from the founders and married-ins.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	203	 LD was estimated between the VR22 4360 SNP and all other SNPs.

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	4	Received April 23, 1998; Revised and Accepted June 18, 1998.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	5	DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession nos AF017256, AF037207.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	6	Persyn is a recently identified member of the synuclein family with a distinct pattern of expression during pre- and postnatal development of the mouse peripheral and central nervous systems.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	7	 As with other synucleins, persyn is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative diseases.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, in contrast to other synucleins, high levels of persyn mRNA expression were also found in advanced breast carcinomas, suggesting an involvement of the encoded protein in breast tumour progression.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Here we have used an antibody specific to human persyn to demonstrate that the level of this protein is increased in ageing cerebral cortex and in breast tumours.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We cloned, characterized and sequenced the human persyn genomic locus and localized it to the long arm of chromosome 10 in the q23.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Sequence information was used to search for specific mutations in the protein coding regions of persyn mRNA and the persyn gene in breast tumours and tumour cell lines.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	12	 No tumour-specific mutations were found, but two linked polymorphisms in the coding region were detected, both in mRNA and exons III and IV of the gene.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These results suggest that development of breast tumours correlates with overexpression of the wild-type persyn protein.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Detailed characterization of the human persyn locus is important for further studies of the involvement of persyn in neurodegeneration and malignancy.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	15	Three genes of the synuclein family have been recently identified in the human genome.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The first two code for [alpha]- and [beta]-synucleins, which are closely related presynaptic proteins that have similar patterns of expression and are most abundant in evolutionarily recent regions of the central nervous system (1-5).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Both proteins are believed to be `natively unfolded' or random coiled (6,7) and tend to aggregate in solution, forming amyloid-like fibrils (8).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Another important feature of synucleins is their ability to bind and trigger aggregation of amyloid A[beta]-peptides (9-11).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	19	 These results, together with the detection of a peptide (NAC) derived from [alpha]-synuclein in the senile plaques of Alzheimer's brains (2,8), raise the possibility that synucleins are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (12).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Although mutations or polymorphisms in synuclein genes have yet to be correlated with Alzheimer's disease (13,14), two point mutations of the human [alpha]-synuclein gene were found in several families with early onset, autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (15,16).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These findings, together with the immunohistochemical detection of a high level of [alpha]-synuclein in Lewy bodies of Parkinson's disease patient brains (17,18), implicates [alpha]-synuclein in the pathogenesis of certain forms of this neurodegenerative disorder.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	22	The most recently identified member of the synuclein family, persyn, shares all of the main structural features of [alpha]- and [beta]-synucleins, but has a distinctive pattern of expression (19).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	23	 During mouse embryonic development, persyn is expressed only in primary sensory neurons and motoneurons.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Postnatally, persyn expression remains high in these neurons and becomes detectable in sympathetic neurons and a subset of neurons of the cerebral cortex.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In contrast to the decrease in [alpha]-synuclein expression in ageing cerebral cortex (20), persyn mRNA expression increases and persyn protein accumulates in the mouse cerebral cortex with age (19).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	26	Although persyn is not present in senile plaques, Lewy bodies or neurofibrillary tangles in any of the clinical cases studied so far, a high level of persyn immunoreactivity is detectable in dot-like structures which are characteristic axonal lesions in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases (V.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Davies, submitted for publication).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	28	 These clinical findings are consistent with the developmental and regional patterns of persyn expression and with experimental evidence which suggests that persyn plays a role in regulating neurofilament network integrity (19).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	29	Persyn is nearly identical to a protein coded by an expressed sequence tag (EST), BCSG1, isolated from a breast cancer cDNA library (21).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Although BCSG1 mRNA cannot be detected in normal breast tissue and in benign breast tumours, its level dramatically increases in highly infiltrating malignant carcinomas (21).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	31	 If the level of the encoded protein reflects the level of persyn/BCSG1 mRNA, it could be useful as a breast cancer progression marker.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	32	The dual role of persyn in neurodegeneration and malignancy could involve common mechanisms.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Changes in organization of the cell cytoskeleton are among the most prominent characteristics of both processes.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The involvement of persyn in regulating neurofilament network integrity raises the possibility that it may also affect the intermediate filament network in malignant breast epithelial cells.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	35	 An important question is whether breast tumour progression correlates with a high level of expression of wild-type persyn or the presence of mutations in the persyn coding region is an obligatory characteristic of this process.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Multiple differences (including three that resulted in amino acid substitutions) between BCSG1 isolated from tumour tissue and persyn isolated from normal brain tissue are consistent with the latter possibility.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Such mutations could be somatic or germline and might reflect advanced tumour progression or predisposition of an individual to malignant progression of a tumour.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	38	Clarification of these and other questions requires further study of the human persyn gene and persyn protein.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Here we report the organization of the human persyn locus, its chromosomal localization and studies of human persyn protein expression.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	40	 We also show that there are no mutations in the persyn gene specific for breast tumours, all confirmed differences being the result of natural sequence polymorphisms.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	41	RESULTS Cloning and analysis of the human persyn genomic locus.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	42	Two human persyn cDNA clones have previously been isolated from a juvenile human cDNA library.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	43	 One of these cDNA clones (clone H1) was used to screen a human genomic library in [lambda]EMBL4 (22).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Two identical, independent clones were isolated from this genomic library and the positions of the exons were determined by restriction analysis, hybridization with cDNA and oligonucleotide probes, direct sequencing of the locus and genomic Southern hybridization.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Figure 1 shows that the human persyn gene consists of five exons that span ~5 kbp.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	46	 There were no differences between the sequence of cDNA clone H1 used to probe the genomic library and the exonic sequences of the genomic clones isolated.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	47	 However, in another shorter cDNA clone (4C) isolated from the same juvenile human cDNA library, two substitutions in the coding region were found (G->C at position 243 and T->A at position 377 of cDNA sequence AF017256, boxed in Fig.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	48	 1), the latter resulting in the amino acid substitution Val110Glu.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Because the cDNA library was constructed from an individual juvenile brainstem, it is likely that these substitutions are the result of natural polymorphism of the persyn gene and that both alleles of the gene were transcriptionally active in this tissue.

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	61	persyn gene expression in various normal and tumour tissues and cell lines was studied by northern blot analysis using the human persyn cDNA clone H1 as a hybridization probe.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	62	8 kb transcript was observed in some tumour cell lines; the highest level of this transcript was detected in a sub-line (MCF7[prime]) of the breast tumour cell line MCF7, which does not normally express persyn mRNA (Fig.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Similar results were obtained by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (not shown).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	64	 However, by increasing the number of amplification cycles we detected a low level of persyn mRNA in tumour cell lines that were persyn-negative on northern and western blots (for example line GI101, as shown in Figs 2, 3a and 4).

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	77	To study persyn protein expression in human tissues we used western blotting with a polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide of human persyn protein (see Materials and Methods).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	78	 This antibody does not cross-react with either [alpha]- or [beta]-synuclein and on western blots detects a single band that disappears if the antibody is preincubated with an excess of the immunizing peptide (not shown).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Persyn was not detected in human fetal cerebral cortex, but was abundant in the cortex of elderly individuals (Fig.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	80	 No substantial differences in the level of persyn were noticed in cerebral cortices of Alzheimer's disease patients and normal individuals of the same age group (Fig.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Persyn mRNA and persyn protein were also detected in unstimulated and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated cultured lymphocytes from peripheral blood of normal donors (Figs 3c and 4 and data not shown).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	82	In breast cancer cell lines the pattern of persyn protein expression corresponded to that of mRNA; it was detected by western blotting in the same cell lines in which persyn mRNA was detected by northern hybridization (Figs 2 and 3a).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	83	It has been shown previously by in situ hybridization that persyn/BCSG1 mRNA is not expressed in normal adult breast tissue, but high levels of this mRNA are present in advanced infiltrating breast tumours (21).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	84	 We detected persyn protein in breast tumours but not in normal breast tissue (Fig.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	85	We used immunocytochemistry with an anti-persyn antibody to localize persyn in cultured breast cancer cells.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	86	 In paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixed cells, persyn displayed punctuate cytoplasmic staining (Fig.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	87	 4), a pattern that is usually associated with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum or vesicular structures.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Persyn was not co-localized with cytokeratin, actin or tubulin arrays in these cells (Fig.

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	90	The nucleotide substitutions in the reported sequence of the BCSG1 transcript (21) are shown in Figure 1a.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Two of these (at positions 243 and 377 of the cDNA sequence, boxed in Fig.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	92	 1a) are identical to the substitutions found in cDNA clone 4C.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The other substitutions were not present in any of our clones and may be correlated with the transformed phenotype of the cells from which the BCSG1 EST was isolated.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	94	 To study the presence and frequency of these mutations of the persyn gene in breast cancer cells, we carried out RT-PCR of mRNAs isolated from breast tumours and tumour cell lines.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	95	 As a control, we used mRNA isolated from post-mortem cerebral cortices and PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes of normal donors.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The PCR amplification products were digested with restriction endonucleases HphI, StyI and MnlI.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Using these digestions, four mutations in the coding region reported for BCSG1, including two polymorphisms present in cDNA clone 4C, could be detected.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In all studied samples, digestion with MnlI generated the same pattern of fragments (Fig.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	99	 5a), which corresponds to the pattern predicted from the sequence of the persyn clones.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Identical, predicted patterns were also obtained with StyI (not shown).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	101	 These results reflect the absence of two G->A (and consequently Glu->Lys) substitutions reported for the BCSG1 EST in all studied tumour cell lines, tumours and control tissues.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In contrast, when RT-PCR products were digested with HphI, three types of fragment patterns were revealed (Fig.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The pattern represented in Figure 5a by the GI101 cell line corresponds to persyn transcripts with a sequence similar to H1 (G243, presence of HphI site, 120 bp but not 135 bp HphI fragment; T377, absence of HphI site, 155 bp but not 79 and 76 bp fragments).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The pattern of MCF7[prime] in Figure 5a corresponds to persyn transcripts with a sequence similar to 4C (C243, absence of HphI site, 135 bp but not 120 bp HphI fragment; A377, presence of HphI site, 79 and 76 bp but not 155 bp fragment).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	105	 PBL-N in Figure 5a is an example of cells in which both transcripts are expressed.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Direct sequencing of RT-PCR fragments amplified from four persyn-expressing breast tumours did not reveal any alterations apart from G243C and T377A.

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	115	These data were confirmed by PCR amplification of individual exons of the persyn gene followed by digestion of the products with the restriction endonucleases HphI, StyI and MnlI.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	116	 No polymorphic StyI and MnlI sites were found, but as illustrated in Figure 5b, the expected polymorphic HphI sites were present in exons three (G243C) and four (T377A) of the human persyn gene.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Both alleles of the gene were expressed in heterozygotic cells (for instance in peripheral blood lymphocytes of donor N as demonstrated in Fig.

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	128	Members of the synuclein family have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases (12,19,23-25).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	129	 In some families with a hereditary form of Parkinson's disease, a point mutation in the gene coding for [alpha]-synuclein is believed to be responsible for development of the pathology (15,26,27).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	130	 This finding suggests that mutations in the genes encoding members of the synuclein family could be linked to neurodegenerative conditions and underlies the need for further studies of these genes.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	131	We cloned and defined the structure of the human gene encoding persyn, a recently identified member of the synuclein family (19).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The general organization of this gene in terms of the positions of the exon-intron junctions and the size of introns is very similar to that of the mouse persyn gene (unpublished data).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Although the complete structures of the other genes of the synuclein family have not been published, the available sequence data (15) and deduction of the positions of some of the exon-intron junctions from known splice variants of [alpha]- and [beta]-synucleins (1,4,19) suggest close similarities in organization of all synuclein genes.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	134	In addition to its potential involvement in neurodegeneration, persyn is possibly involved in breast tumour progression.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	135	 It has been shown that expression of an EST (BCSG1) that is nearly identical in nucleotide sequence to persyn mRNA is increased dramatically in infiltrating breast cancers compared with normal breast tissues and benign tumours (21).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	136	 We have shown that expression of persyn protein also follows this pattern: no persyn could be detected by western blotting in normal breast tissues, whereas persyn protein was detectable in breast tumour tissue.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	137	 In established breast cancer cell lines, the levels of persyn protein expression were found to be substantially different and correlated with levels of persyn mRNA.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	138	 We did not find amplification of the persyn gene in the studied cell lines (data not shown).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	139	 These observations suggest that persyn expression is regulated predominantly at the level of persyn gene transcription and/or persyn mRNA stability.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Thus, breast cancer cell lines could be used for further studies of the mechanisms that regulate persyn expression and to investigate the physiological consequences of persyn overexpression.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	141	 We have shown previously that experimental overexpression of persyn in cultured sensory neurons leads to dramatic changes in the neurofilament network (19).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	142	 It will be interesting to see if acute overexpression of persyn has a similar effect on the intermediate filament network in epithelial cells.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Our immunocytochemical data suggest that persyn could be associated with membranous structures in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	144	 However, subcellular fractionation of neural tissues and breast cancer cells demonstrated the presence of persyn in cytosolic but not in particulate fractions (data not shown).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	145	 These results are similar to results obtained in studies of [alpha]-synuclein, which is believed to be very loosely associated with synaptic vesicle membranes in presynaptic terminals (5,28-30).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	146	 This is interesting in the light of the recent demonstration that [alpha]-synuclein is able to bind synthetic membranes in vitro.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	147	 This association dramatically changes the protein secondary structure from natively unfolded to predominantly [alpha]-helical and perhaps alters the functional features of the protein (31).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	148	 One of these features is the ability of both [alpha]- and [beta]-synuclein to inhibit phospholipase D2 (32).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	149	 This inhibition is dependent on the bulk lipid concentration in the reaction, suggesting that interaction with the enzyme occurs on the membrane surface (32) and thus involves [alpha]-helical but not natively unfolded synucleins.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	150	 As phospholipase D2 is implicated in various intracellular pathways, including regulation of cell growth and differentiation, it will be interesting to study the effect of persyn on the activity of this enzyme in neurons and tumour cells.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	151	Substantial changes in persyn expression not only accompany breast tumour progression but also take place during nervous system development.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	152	 In our current study we have shown that persyn is not expressed in human fetal cerebral cortex but is abundant in cerebral cortices of elderly individuals.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	153	 This is consistent with our previous observation that persyn expression is increased in ageing mouse cerebral cortex (19).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	154	 We did not observe substantial differences in the levels of persyn protein in cerebral cortices of patients that suffered from Alzheimer's disease and normal age-matched individuals.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	155	 These results are in agreement with immunohistochemical data that implicate persyn in the axonal pathology of neurodegenerative conditions (dot-like structures in white matter) without significant changes in persyn immunoreactivity in cortical neurons (V.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Davies, submitted for publication).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	157	The important question is whether wild-type or mutated persyn protein is expressed in breast tumours.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Sequence analysis suggests that the protein from tumour cells (BCSG1) is different from the protein expressed in the nervous system (cDNA clones H1 and 4C) and that coded by the genomic clone W6H.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Substitution of two lysines by glutamates in BCSG1 changes the overall charge of the persyn molecule and disturbs EKTKEGV repeats that are highly conserved in the synuclein family.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Such changes should have serious consequences for protein structure and function.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	161	 However, the fact that BCSG1 is only an EST generated by RT-PCR amplification raises the question of how accurately the sequence of this clone reflects the sequence of the mRNA in tumour cells.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	162	 We studied a number of breast tumours and tumour cell lines for the presence of mutations that underlie Lys->Glu amino acid substitutions in the human persyn sequence.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Although both persyn mRNA and exons of the persyn gene were analysed by MluI and StyI digestion of PCR products, no such mutations were found in any of the studied tissues or cell lines.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	164	 In contrast, using HphI digestion, we were able to detect two nucleotide polymorphisms that had been initially recognized as sequence differences between persyn cDNA clones H1 and 4C.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	165	 These two linked polymorphic sites discriminate two alleles of the human persyn gene.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Both alleles are transcriptionally active and are expressed with similar efficiency in heterozygotes.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	167	 We did not find any obvious correlation between the presence of particular persyn alleles and pathological phenotype.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Although a limited number of samples were analysed, the two alleles in breast tumours and tumour cell lines occur with the same frequencies as in normal cells.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	169	 These data suggest that, at least in spontaneous breast tumours, the high level of wild-type persyn protein correlates with malignant phenotype and that the reported mutations in the BCSG1 EST are artefactual and may be the result of Taq polymerase errors.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	170	We have mapped the human persyn gene to the long arm of chromosome 10 in the q23.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	171	 A few hereditary disorders for which affected genes are not yet known have been located in this locus.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Taking into account the pattern of persyn expression in the sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system and motoneurons of the central nervous system, it will be interesting to check the possible involvement of the persyn gene in infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia with sensory neuropathy (IOSCA, SCA8) (33).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Also, it is intriguing that the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 10q23 occurs at high frequency in different human tumours.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene, which is located in the region, have been implicated in many breast carcinomas and germline mutations of this gene are believed to be associated with Cowden disease, a rare autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome with a high risk of breast cancer (34).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	175	 However, not all families and individuals with Cowden disease have mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene; somatic mutations of this gene occur in only a small fraction of primary breast cancers and LOH in breast cancers does not necessarily involve the PTEN/MMAC1 locus (35-37).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Because of the correlation between persyn expression and breast tumour progression it will be interesting to search for mutations in the coding and regulatory regions of this gene in hereditary and spontaneous forms of breast cancer.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Defining the organization of the human persyn gene reported here is an important step towards genetic studies of the involvement of this gene in neurodegenerative and neoplastic disorders.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	178	MATERIALS AND METHODS Molecular cloning.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	179	Human persyn cDNA clones H1 and 4C were isolated from a juvenile brainstem cDNA library (Stratagene) by hybridization with a mouse persyn cDNA probe at low stringency as described previously (38).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The H1 clone was labelled by nick-translation and used as a probe for screening a genomic library and for Southern and northern hybridizations as described previously (39).

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The conditions of amplification and restriction endonuclease analysis were similar to the conditions used for RT-PCR products, except that the annealing temperatures were 64 degrees C for exon III and 60 degrees C for exon IV.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Primers 5[prime]-TGCGAGCCTGACTCCAGCAG-3[prime] and 5[prime]-GGTGTGGAGTGGAGTGATGC-3[prime] were used for amplification of exon III and 5[prime]-TTGAGGCCAGGGTAGACAAG-3[prime] and 5[prime]-CCACTCAGGTTCAGGGTTAG-3[prime] for exon IV.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	199	 DNA fragments were analysed in 2% agarose-TBE gels.

0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	5	It is both fashionable and necessary these days to start any presentation by declaring one's conflicts of interest.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	6	 As editors of this special supplement we therefore declare our interest in old age psychiatry.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Not so long ago cynically described as a Cinderella speciality, old age psychiatry has in the past few years become an increasingly popular clinical career choice.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Community-oriented, multi-disciplinary services that remain relatively unfettered by excessive bureaucracy would of themselves be an attractive option in a largely demoralised health care system   but there are other reasons that the speciality is thriving.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Not least are the enormous advances that have been made over the past decade in our understanding of the neurobiological basis of late-life psychiatric disorders.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Dementia, in particular, has attracted the attention of top-level neuroscientists who have applied a combination of classical neuropathology, molecular genetics and protein chemistry to reveal some of the key events underlying neurodegeneration.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	11	 As a result it is conceivable that effective treatments to delay or prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease could be available within a decade   something that was virtually unthinkable only 10 years ago.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Old age psychiatry clinicians are near enough to this buzz to feel it and be excited by it.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The differential diagnosis of dementia subtype is now an important part of assessment, the convergence of clinical descriptions of Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia (to give but two examples covered in this issue) allowing increased sophistication in terms of diagnostic reporting by clinicians.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These distinctions can lead directly to important management decisions, such as the avoidance of neuroleptic agents in Lewy body disease or the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Recognition that disorders hitherto regarded as functional in nature have an organic basis has stimulated research into uncovering aetiological factors and has again influenced clinical practice.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Furthermore, improved methods of measuring symptoms in valid and reliable ways have enabled the effects of therapeutic interventions, especially drug trials, to be assessed in ways that are sufficiently robust to allow regulatory authorities to be convinced of their worth.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	17	Our reason for presenting this series of invited papers on the subject of old age psychiatry is to inform the general reader about the major issues, challenges and successes in the speciality today.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The following contributions are not intended to be a comprehensive survey of an increasingly widening field, but have been chosen to give a flavour of the richness of clinical practice and research.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	19	 We have chosen to concentrate on descriptions of organically based syndromes, their differential diagnosis and their effects.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	20	Holmes (2002, this issue) has summarised much of the current information concerning molecular biology and Alzheimer's disease, emphasising the importance that genes can have as risk factors for the disease and stepping outside the often narrow way of thinking which tends to tunnel our vision into equating the genetics of this disease with those early-onset and rare mutations.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This is clearly a field where there is much promise in terms of treatment.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This is a theme continued by Bullock (2002, this issue) in his summary of new drugs for Alzheimer's disease.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	23	 We now have three anticholinesterase drugs available for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease that have been approved by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the UK.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The role of these drugs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease will become apparent with continued clinical practice influenced by an appropriate audit of their use and benefit to patients.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Snowden et al (2002, this issue) provide an up-to-date summary of frontotemporal dementia, drawing together the clinical, neuropsychological and pathological expertise of the group, who were instrumental in the clinical descriptions of what is a relatively common, but underrecognised, cause of dementia, particularly in younger people.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Vascular dementia, which in most samples pips frontotemporal dementia to the post as one of the more common causes of the syndrome, is summarised by Stewart (2002, this issue) and the lack of clear blue water between Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia is plainly acknowledged   a problem that is increasingly influencing clinical practice as well as taxing epidemiologists.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The theme of vascular disease is continued with the review of the vascular basis of depression by Baldwin  and  O'Brien (2002, this issue).
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This condition may explain some elements of treatment resistance in practice and also has implications for the management of patients.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Subcortical dementia is summarised by Turner et al (2002, this issue), who emphasise the phenomenological aspects of dementia that have aetiological importance.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Jacoby (2002, this issue) brings to the fore many of the legal aspects of old age psychiatry which are increasingly becoming part of everyday clinical practice, particularly in relation to consent, euthanasia and mental capacity.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The interface between health and social care is highlighted by Challis  and  Hughes (2002, this issue), and the current political climate is such that this distinction   while clinically blurred in many situations   is becoming more important in administrative and financial terms.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Costs of care are an essential underpinning of considerations of clinical care, and Kavanagh  and  Knapp (2002, this issue) describe some of the models underlying many of the assumptions made by those predicting the cost of caring for people with cognitive impairment.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Our own contributions concern dementia with Lewy bodies (McKeith, 2002, this issue) and the use of rating scales in old age psychiatry (Burns et al, 2002, this issue).
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	34	We hope that there is useful new information here for those practising old age psychiatry.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Two of the costs of being in a rapidly changing and expanding field are those of keeping abreast of the new information and of meeting rising public expectations of what can, should and might be done.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	36	 It is not uncommon now for patients to present themselves to one of the burgeoning number of memory clinics in the UK, asking for early diagnosis and treatment and well aware of recent guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence that the new antidementia drugs should be made available to them within the National Health Service, and the recently published National Service Framework for Older People sets out specific standards of care and aspirations for good practice across a wide range of mental health care issues.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	37	 So, challenges we have in plenty.

0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	6	Abbreviations: Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; SES, socioeconomic status.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	7	It is known that education is an indicator of socioeconomic status (SES).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Different studies have shown high (11) to moderate (2) correlations between education and occupation-based SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Nevertheless, these two variables represent different aspects of and periods in the life course and may generate differences in health through various mechanisms (11, 12).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Lynch and Kaplan describe education as "the transition from a socio-economic position largely received from parents to an achieved socio-economic position as an adult" (13, p.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	11	Socioeconomic factors acting over the life course have been found to affect health and premature death, as well as risk of cardiovascular disease (14, 15).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Cumulative economic hardship has been found to lead to poorer cognitive functioning (16).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	13	 (17) examined the relation between socioeconomic mobility and cognitive function among Finish men in late middle age and suggested that all stages of the life course play a role in influencing adult cognitive function.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	14	Few studies have reported an association between adult SES based on occupation and the incidence of Alzheimer s disease or dementia.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	15	 (2) found that all of the investigated markers of SES (education, occupational prestige, and income) predicted the development of Alzheimer s disease.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	16	 It has been reported that manual work, when it involves production of goods, could increase the risk of clinical Alzheimer s disease or dementia (18).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	17	 However, these studies focused on principal occupation, not all occupational periods.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In addition, the relation of social mobility through different socioeconomic levels over the life course to the risk of dementia in old age has not been studied.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	19	The general aim of this study was to determine whether the reported association between low education and increased risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia could be explained by occupation-based SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Specifically, we examined how the risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia varied by different combinations of 1) education and main occupation-based SES and 2) education and lifetime number of years spent in a low occupation-based SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Since education and occupation-based SES are interrelated, special attention was given to the categories that deviated from the expected pattern, that is, the combinations of high education/low occupation-based SES and low education/high occupation-based SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Furthermore, we investigated social mobility patterns to explore whether later advancement or setbacks in occupation-based SES may affect the relation between education and Alzheimer s disease incidence.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	23	Identification of incident cases of Alzheimer s disease and dementia At follow-up, all subjects were clinically examined by physicians, neuropsychologically assessed by psychologists, and interviewed by nurses.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Incident cases of dementia were defined as those that developed during the follow-up period.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The diagnosis of clinical dementia was made according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised (20), using a three-step procedure.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	26	 First, a preliminary diagnosis was made by the examining physician.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Second, all cases were independently reviewed by a specialized clinician, and a second diagnosis was made.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	28	 If the diagnoses were in agreement, they were accepted as final.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In cases of disagreement, a third opinion was obtained, and the concordant diagnosis was accepted.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The diagnosis of dementia was made when the subject completely fulfilled the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	31	The diagnosis of Alzheimer s disease in particular required gradual onset and progressive deterioration of cognitive functioning and exclusion of all other specific causes of dementia.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Neuroimaging and autopsy data were not available.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Our clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer s disease corresponds to the diagnosis of "probable Alzheimer s disease" according to the NINCDS-ADRDA [National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer s Disease and Related Disorders Association] criteria (21).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	34	 For the 161 deceased subjects, a preliminary diagnosis was made by a physician who consulted medical records and death certificates, and the diagnosis was then reviewed by a senior clinician.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	35	 When only discharge diagnoses from hospitals (n = 50) or only death certificates (n = 11) were available, the reported diagnosis was accepted.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	36	 When we repeated the analyses in the survivors  cohort, the results were similar.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	37	Measurement of educational attainment Information on total years of formal education was collected at baseline.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In this study, educational level was divided into two main categories: 2 to 7 years (6 years of primary school and, in some cases, 1 extra year of practical vocational training) and =" BORDER="0">8 years (intermediate and university levels).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	39	 This dichotomization was based on a previous analysis (4) in which different levels of education were examined in relation to Alzheimer s disease.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Persons with an intermediate amount of education (8 to 10 years of schooling) did not differ from university-educated subjects (=" BORDER="0">11 years of schooling) in terms of Alzheimer s disease risk.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Data on educational background were missing for three persons.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	42	 These subjects were omitted from all analyses concerning education.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	43	Assessments of occupation-based SES Main occupation-based SES Specially trained nurses interviewed a relative or another person significant to the subject about the subject s full lifetime work history.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The questionnaire was developed by an occupational hygienist.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Up to eight occupational periods with specific information regarding time and place were listed.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The subject s longest-held job was considered his or her main occupation.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Occupations were grouped according to the socioeconomic classification system developed by Statistics Sweden (22).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The Swedish socioeconomic classification system primarily contains dimensions of ownership of the means of production and division into blue-collar and white-collar occupations as assessed by normal trade-union affiliation.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	49	 It also contains aspects of skills in the subdivisions inside blue-collar and white-collar occupational categories.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	50	 However, customary educational requirements for the respective occupations are used, not information about education at the individual level.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	51	Quite a few women (21 percent) were homemakers during their longest occupational period.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Information on husband s occupation, which is frequently used to estimate the SES of wives, was not available.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Instead of including homemakers in a category of their own, we used their second-longest-held job to estimate their SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Eighteen subjects had been housewives throughout their working lives and were excluded from the analyses involving main occupation.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	55	We first analyzed the relation of SES to incidence of Alzheimer s disease and dementia by using three categories (blue-collar workers, white-collar employees, and self-employed persons plus those in academic professions).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Since the two last categories had similar risks, the two groups were merged.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	57	Lifetime occupational SES Data were gathered about the length of each occupational period over the subject s lifetime, and all occupations were classified as described above, with the exception that no substitutions from other occupational periods could be made for the homemaker work periods.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Instead they were classified as nonmanual periods, because 1) these women often held nonmanual jobs in their other occupational periods and 2) they were generally more highly educated than the nonhousewives.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Finally, we added up the numbers of years in all periods of manual labor to obtain the sum of years spent in a low occupation-based SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	60	 In the current study, we report results from analyses in which the number of years in a low SES was less than or equal to 25 versus more than 25 (the median amount of time spent in a low SES by the low-SES fraction of the population).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	61	Socioeconomic mobility We computed occupation-based SES at ages 20, 40, and 60 years in order to estimate individual socioeconomic mobility patterns.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	62	 When information about a particular time period was missing, we substituted an equal number of years from the two closest work periods.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Sixty-three persons lacked information about occupational position at 60 years of age; instead, information concerning the occupational period prior to that was chosen to represent it.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	64	Covariates We used all covariates with available information from our database that may have acted as confounding factors.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	65	 As major possible confounders, we considered age, gender, vascular diseases, and alcohol data.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	66	Information on age and gender was derived from the Swedish National Population Register.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Information on cerebrovascular and heart diseases and diabetes mellitus was derived from the computerized Stockholm Inpatient Registry System, in which all admission and discharge diagnoses from every hospital in Stockholm are recorded.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In the current study, all diagnoses made at any time from 1969 to the baseline examination were used.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Diseases were diagnosed according to the International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision (codes 430 to 438 for cerebrovascular disease, codes 410 to 414 for coronary disease, code 428 for heart failure, code 427 for arrhythmia, and code 250 for diabetes mellitus).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Information on diabetes from the in-patient register was integrated with self-reports of a doctor s diagnosis of diabetes, use of oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin, or a blood glucose level greater than 11 mmol/liter.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Arterial blood pressure was measured at baseline with a mercury sphygmomanometer by trained nurses.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	72	 If the first reading was abnormal (systolic pressure =" BORDER="0">160 mmHg or diastolic pressure =" BORDER="0">95 mmHg), two additional readings were made.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The mean of the second and third readings was used for analyses (23).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Furthermore, we created a simple additive index ranging from 0 to 5 for the vascular diseases or risk factors described above.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	75	Information on alcohol use was collected from relatives, who specified how many glasses of wine, bottles of beer, and/or glasses of liquor the proband consumed weekly.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Since consumption of alcohol in this predominantly female elderly population was found to be particularly low (82.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	77	4 percent of the persons with available data on alcohol reported that they used no alcohol at all, and only 3.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	78	5 percent consumed an amount corresponding to more than five glasses of wine per week), we decided to divide the alcohol data into three categories: no use, any use, and no information.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The latter category was included in the analyses because reporting on alcohol use can sometimes be a sensitive matter, and we found it relevant to investigate whether the absence of information was associated with the risk of dementia.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	80	Other covariates, which were controlled for in further analyses, were: 1) cognitive status at baseline, measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (24); 2) social network at baseline, measured with a four-grade index (poor, limited, moderate, and rich social network) as defined in a previous study (25); and 3) engagement in mental and physical activities at baseline, graded in three frequency categories (26).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	81	Statistical analysis Logistic regression was used to evaluate the differences in baseline characteristics between participants and dropouts.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to estimate the relative risk of incident Alzheimer s disease and dementia associated with different combinations of education and occupation-based SES, as well as socioeconomic mobility.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The follow-up time for nondemented persons was estimated from the date of the baseline interview to the date of follow-up examination or death.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	84	 For the demented persons, half of this time was calculated, since dementia onset was assumed to be the midpoint between baseline and follow-up examination.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	85	Age, gender, vascular disease index, and alcohol use were entered into all models.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Additional models were used to verify the possible confounding effect of baseline Mini-Mental State Examination score, social network, and leisure activities.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	87	 We also repeated all analyses after excluding the stroke cases, with the purpose of examining whether stroke might obscure or increase diagnostic difficulties in dementia due to cognitive dysfunction in subjects with previous stroke.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	88	The interrelation between education and SES was explored using two stratifications.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	89	 First, the study population was divided into four strata characterized by 1) high education and high SES; 2) high education and low SES; 3) low education and high SES; and 4) low education and low SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Second, we used four strata by combining low and high education as defined above, with permanence in low SES for less than or equal to 25 years versus more than 25 years.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	91	A total of 101 subjects developed clinically definite dementia during the follow-up period.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Among dementia cases of all types, 76 persons were diagnosed with clinically definite dementia of the Alzheimer s type.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Table 1 provides characteristics of the participants by dementia status at follow-up.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Baseline characteristics of the study population (n = 931) by dementia status at follow-up, The Kungsholmen Project, Stockholm, Sweden, 1987 to 1993   The relative risks for clinical dementia of the Alzheimer s type and of all types in relation to education and occupation-based SES are reported in table 2.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Compared with persons with a high level of education (=" BORDER="0">11 years), the adjusted relative risks of dementia of the Alzheimer s type and dementia of all types were similar for subjects with an intermediate amount (8 to 10 years) of education and elevated for subjects with a low level (2 to 7 years) of education (see model 1A).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	96	 In model 1B, we merged the high and intermediate levels of education into one reference category.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	97	 In model 1B and model 2, subjects with either a low level of education or a low occupation-based SES were found to be at higher risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia, even after adjustment for all covariates examined.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	98	 However, when both education and SES were introduced into the same model simultaneously (table 2, model 3), only low education remained a significant risk factor for Alzheimer s disease and dementia.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	99	 These results were similar for men and women, although the relative risks for men were not statistically significant, probably because of less statistical power.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Relative risks of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer s disease or dementia associated with education and occupation-based socioeconomic status (lifetime longest-held job), derived from separate models (models 1 and 2) and from the same model (model 3), The Kungsholmen Project, Stockholm, Sweden, 1987 to 1993   Subjects in the low education/low occupation-based SES category were more often female (83 percent) than subjects in the high education/high occupation-based SES category (71 percent).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The number of persons in the high education/low occupation-based SES group was smaller (n = 36) in comparison with the other groups, and it contained the largest proportion of women (89 percent) and housewives (33 percent).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The low education/high occupation-based SES group differed noticeably in that 26 percent of its members were self-employed, whereas only 9 percent of persons in the high education/high occupation-based SES group were self-employed.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	103	Low education in combination with either low or high occupation-based SES was associated with increased risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia, even after adjustment for the major covariates.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The combination of high education and low occupation-based SES was not associated with any increased risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia (table 3).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Relative risks of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer s disease or dementia associated with combinations of education and occupation-based socioeconomic status (lifetime longest-held job), The Kungsholmen Project, Stockholm, Sweden, 1987 to 1993   The stratified analyses of the relations of combinations of education and total years in low occupation-based SES to Alzheimer s disease showed results similar to those of the stratified analysis depicted in table 3.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Compared with persons with high education and less than 25 years in a low SES, the subgroup with both low education and 25 or more years in a low SES had an adjusted relative risk of 3.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	107	8), and in the subgroup with low education but fewer than 25 years in a low SES, the adjusted relative risk was 3.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	108	 High education in conjunction with 25 or more years in a low SES was not associated with increased risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	109	Table 4, model 1, shows the relative risks of Alzheimer s disease in relation to eight social mobility patterns after controlling for age and gender.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Having a low occupation-based SES at ages 20, 40, and 60 years resulted in a borderline-significant elevated risk of Alzheimer s disease compared with the reference category of high SES at all three ages.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Having a low occupation-based SES at ages 20 and 40 years but not at age 60 years was also associated with significantly elevated risks of Alzheimer s disease.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Furthermore, low occupation-based SES at 20 years of age, regardless of whether SES was high at age 40 and/or age 60, was associated with elevated Alzheimer s disease risks, though not statistically significantly.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	113	 However, after additional adjustment for education, none of the significant associations remained.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Twenty-eight percent of the subjects with high occupational SES at ages 20, 40, and 60 years but 91 percent of the subjects with low SES at ages 20, 40, and 60 years had a low educational level.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Analyses of all-type dementia showed similar results.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Relative risks of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer s disease associated with social mobility (occupation-based socioeconomic status at ages 20, 40, and 60 years), The Kungsholmen Project, Stockholm, Sweden, 1987 to 1993   Finally, when the baseline cognitive status variables (Mini-Mental State Examination score, social network, and engagement in physical and mental activities) were included in the model as covariates, the relations of SES and education with Alzheimer s disease and dementia did not substantially change.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	117	 When we repeated all analyses after excluding cases of stroke, the associations between education and Alzheimer s disease and between education and dementia were similar, and all results showed the same patterns as in the main analyses.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	118	Our results are in agreement with previous findings of a positive association between a low level of education and increased risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia (1 to 10).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	119	 (2) reported that each of the socioeconomic measures (education, income, and occupational prestige) predicted Alzheimer s disease risk.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	120	 However, when they included all three measures in the same model, only education (not income or occupational prestige) retained a significant association with Alzheimer s disease.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Recently, investigators from the Nurses  Health Study (27) reported a strong association between low education and cognitive decline but little association with other markers of SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	122	The fact that the association between low education and increased risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia in general was present independently of main occupation-based SES, and the fact that the association of SES with Alzhei-mer s disease and dementia was mainly due to SES in early work life, seems to indicate that unknown education-related factors acting during the first two decades of life may be involved in the development of Alzheimer s disease and dementia.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	123	 This interpretation is in agreement with a number of previous reports.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	124	 In a recent article, Kaplan et al.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	125	 (28) concluded that higher childhood socioeconomic position, as well as greater educational attainment, was associated with better cognitive function in adulthood.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	126	 In a study of education and dementia in an Italian population with a middle-to-high socioeconomic level, the first decade of life was suggested to be a critical period for development of dementia later in life (29).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	127	 (30) discussed the possibility that low education by itself is not a major risk factor for Alzhei-mer s disease but rather a marker for other accompanying deleterious socioeconomic or environmental influences in childhood.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Poor-quality childhood or adolescent environments have been suggested to prevent the brain from reaching complete levels of maturation, which in turn may put people at higher risk of Alzheimer s disease (31, 32).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Results from the PAQUID Study (33) showed that occupation did not change the risk of Alzheimer s disease, which instead was related to cognitive abilities in childhood and adolescence.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	130	 The early-life factors in question may be early socioeconomic factors, mental stimulation, or cognitive abilities.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The cognitive abilities may be affected by both environmental (34) and genetic influences (9).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Since many studies, like ours, lack an independent measure of intelligence, the importance of early-life cognitive abilities is difficult to evaluate.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	133	A number of studies have given special attention to the effect of early-life circumstances on health and mortality in general.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Early-life SES has been reported to be connected with cardiovascular diseases and general health status later in life (35 to 37).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Disadvantaged childhood living conditions have been hypothesized to trigger unhealthy life trajectories, where increased illness risk is the sum of several health-damaging factors (38).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	136	 New results from a random Swedish national sample indicate that occupational class differences in adult mortality depend, to a fairly large extent, on childhood conditions (39).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	137	 We examined the relation between SES and Alzheimer s disease and dementia from a lifetime perspective, ranging from school to retirement, but unfortunately we lacked specific data on the SES of the family of origin.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Thus, we can only suggest the involvement of early-life factors in the development of Alzheimer s disease and dementia as a hypothesis.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	139	An alternative explanation for our findings is that education may be a better indicator of adult lifestyle and habits than occupational SES, and that lifestyle and habits such as alcohol use and smoking may explain the detected association.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	140	 However, when our data were adjusted for alcohol use, and additionally when current social network index and engagement in physical and mental activities were entered into the model as covariates, we obtained similar results.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Smoking was not related to Alzheimer s disease or dementia in our population (40).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	142	With regard to cognitive function in late middle age, Turrell et al.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	143	 (17) reported that disadvantaged socioeconomic circumstances in childhood may, to some extent, be overcome by later upward mobility.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	144	 However, in our study, low education remained associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer s disease even after adjustment for adult social mobility.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	145	Some potential limitations of this study must be considered.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Persons who dropped out of the study were less educated than participants.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Since low education was related to Alzheimer s disease and dementia, this may have affected our results, but it is more likely to have skewed our findings towards underestimation of the association than towards overestimation.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	148	 The occupational data were obtained through informants.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	149	 However, a single open-ended question about occupation (without any specification of time, place, or number of years) had already been posed to the participants during the baseline interview, and it was possible to compare these responses with the informant data regarding the subject s main job.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	150	 When information from the two different sources was used to estimate SES, agreement was 80 percent.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The Swedish system for classification of SES from occupation is well established and has been evaluated (41).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	152	 However, it remains that occupation-based SES is more difficult to evaluate than education.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Estimation of SES from occupation was difficult for the housewives in the cohort (21 percent).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Our approximations were likely to create nondifferential misclassification of SES, leading to a dilution of the association.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	155	 We performed additional analyses (data not shown) treating the housewives as a third occupational category, and this did not affect our results.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	156	Finally, we must be cautious in interpreting our findings as reflecting a direct effect of education on Alzheimer s disease risk and not one that is mediated by occupation-based SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	157	 In fact, there is the possibility of unmeasured confounders  being responsible for the patterns of associations found in the study.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	158	 For example, work-related stress may be associated with occupation-based SES but not with education and may increase the risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia, though there is currently no clear evidence in the literature concerning such an association.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	159	The main conclusion that can be drawn from this study is that a low level of education is more directly associated with increased Alzheimer s disease incidence and is not mediated by low adult occupation-based SES, regardless of whether the low-SES occupational period was extended over a substantial number of years (=" BORDER="0">25 years) and regardless of adult socioeconomic mobility pattern.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The results are not inconsistent with the already-suggested hypotheses of cognitive or brain reserves (5, 6).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Alternatively, these findings may partly reflect a detection bias by which subjects with a low level of education tend to be clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer s disease and dementia at an earlier point in time (4).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	162	 However, the possibility that factors related to early-life SES may play a role in the development of Alzheimer s disease and dementia should not be disregarded.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Our findings support this hypothesis and stress the importance of collecting data on early life conditions when studying dementia in old age.

0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	1	Jonathan Swift Clinic, Department of Psychiatry, St James's Hospital, St James Street, Dublin 8, Ireland.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	2	 has received honoraria and hospitality from pharmaceutical companies working in the fields of Alzheimer's disease and behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	3	Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are common and problematic in clinical practice and represent a significant part of the day-to-day workload of the old age psychiatry team in hospital, institution and community settings.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Improving our recognition and management of BPSD can have a positive impact on the quality of life of our patients and their carers and potentially delay the transition from home to institutional care.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	5	Behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia is an umbrella term that embraces a heterogeneous group of non-cognitive symptoms and behaviours that occur in people with dementia.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The concept of BPSD is a descriptive one and does not reflect a diagnostic entity but rather high-lights an important clinical dimension of dementia that has until recently been ignored from both research and therapeutic points of view.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	7	 One approach to the description of BPSD is the use of a list of observed behaviours (wandering, agitation, sexually inappropriate behaviours) and elicited psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, delusions) (Finkel et al, 1996).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This approach fails to take into account the fact that many so-called elicited symptoms (depression, delusions) also represent observed behaviours ( looks depressed ,  acts as though hallucinating or deluded ), and the fact that most of these symptoms and behaviours do not occur in isolation but tend to occur together in clusters or syndromes.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	9	 A number of syndromes have been described on the basis of factor analytical studies using rating instruments designed to measure BPSD (Frisoni et al, 1999).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These syndromes include depression, psychosis, psychomotor agitation, aggression and apathy.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Both depression and psychosis are included as descriptors in the DSM-IV criteria for Alzheimer's disease (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and, more recently, diagnostic criteria for a distinct syndrome of psychosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and for depression of Alzheimer's disease have been proposed (Jeste  and  Finkel, 2000; Olin et al, 2002).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	12	 It is likely that diagnostic criteria for other behavioural syndromes of dementia will also be developed in the near future and this will facilitate recognition and future therapeutic targeting of more specific aspects of BPSD.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	13	Although behaviour and psychological symptoms are not included as core features in the definition of the dementia syndrome, about two-thirds of people with dementia experience some BPSD at any one time point, and for one-third of community-dwelling people with dementia the level of BPSD will be in the clinically significant range (Lyketsos et al, 2000).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The figure for clinically significant BPSD rises to almost 80% for people with dementia residing in care environments (Margallo-Lana et al, 2001).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Prevalence estimates for BPSD vary widely because of the heterogeneity of patient populations studied in terms of setting and type of dementia, and the different definitions used for BPSD.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The recent application of standardised and validated assessment instruments is resulting in more consistent data for community-and clinic-based populations.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Two population-based studies, one from the USA (Lyketsos et al, 2000) and one from the UK (Burns et al, 1990), show similar prevalence figures of about 20% for BPSD in people with Alzheimer's disease.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Unlike the cognitive dysfunction in dementia, which progressively worsens over time, many BPSD tend to fluctuate, with psycho-motor agitation being the most persistent (Devanand et al, 1997).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Further research is needed into the natural history and longitudinal course of BPSD to inform clinicians about the appropriate duration of pharmacological interventions and what advice and information should be given to families distressed by these symptoms and behaviours.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	20	The occurrence of BPSD is often the triggering event for recognition and referral of people with dementia to specialist services, to which patients and families present in crisis and disarray, relatively late in the course of the illness.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The development of BPSD is a major risk factor for caregiver burden (Coen et al, 1997) and institutionalisation (O'Donnell et al, 1992), and is more important in this regard than the enduring cognitive deficits of the disease process (Steele et al, 1990).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	22	 All aspects of BPSD can be associated with caregiver burden, but paranoia, aggression and sleep wake cycle disturbance appear to be particularly important drivers of caregiver burden and institutionalisation (O'Donnell et al, 1992).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The development of BPSD is also associated with a worse prognosis and a more rapid rate of illness progression (Paulsen et al, 2000), and adds significantly to the direct and indirect costs of care.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Expert assessment and targeted treatment of BPSD can alleviate patient suffering and promote caregiver well-being, but will be less effective if interventions occur after the support system has been ruptured.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	25	In the assessment of individuals with dementia at all stages of the illness, careful enquiry must be made regarding the presence of BPSD.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The emphasis here must be to detect BPSD before caregiver burn-out and irretrievable damage to the support environment occur.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Just as the collateral history and the use of an objective performance-based test must be part of any comprehensive cognitive assessment, so too should the history and assessment focus on behavioural and psychological symptoms, given their high frequency and impact on both patient and caregiver quality of life.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	28	Recognition of BPSD is the first and most important step in devising a management plan and will be facilitated by the use of standardised assessment scales such as the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (Behave AD) (Reisberg et al, 1987) or the Neuro-psychiatric Inventory (NPI; Cummings et al, 1994).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The characteristics of the behaviour or symptoms together with the frequency, severity and impact on the patient and caregiver must be identified before formulating a tailored and targeted plan of action which is likely to involve pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	30	 It is useful to identify target syndromes in the patient: is this primarily a psychotic syndrome (hallucinations or delusions), or is the main problem psycho-motor agitation and sleep disturbance? The context of the behaviour or symptom and its impact are also key elements in assessment.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Aggressive resistance when a personal activity is being carried out with the patient may not warrant immediate pharmacological intervention.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Also, mis-identification symptoms as part of a psychotic syndrome can be more distressing to carers than to patients and in such instances education of family members rather than drug treatment is required.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	33	Pharmacological treatments Drug treatments in BPSD should be evidence-based and targeted to specific syndromes that are clinically significant because of their frequency, pervasiveness or impact.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	34	 For depression in dementia, although there is little placebo-controlled evidence to guide practice, clinical experience indicates that selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors are safe and effective.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Neuroleptic agents have been shown to be more effective than placebo for aggression, psychosis and agitation in dementia (Devanand et al, 1998; De Deyn et al, 1999; Street et al, 2000), and novel agents are superior to conventional neuroleptics in terms of tolerability and side-effect profile.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Non-neuroleptic treatments such as carbamazepine have demonstrated efficacy over placebo in the treatment of agitation (Tariot et al, 1998).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Recent placebo-controlled studies suggest that cholinesterase inhibitors improve the apathetic syndrome in Alzheimer's disease and also decrease psychotic symptoms, particularly hallucinations, in Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia (Cummings, 2000; McKeith et al, 2000).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	38	Non-pharmacological treatments There is a dearth of controlled evidence for psychological interventions in BPSD.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Individualised music therapy, bright light treatment and specific behaviour interventions have been found to improve certain troubling behavioural symptoms in dementia, but more evidence is required in this area (Devanand  and  Lawlor, 2000).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	40	Interventions for the carer Boosting caregiver support, increasing  time for self  and providing carer education and training in the management of BPSD can be effective in decreasing burden and mollifying its impact on the carer (Ostwald et al, 1999).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Interventions with carers may not only decrease carer burden and improve the tolerability of the particular symptom (Hepburn et al, 2001) but can also have a positive impact on patient behaviour (Marriott et al, 2000) and possibly delay institutionalisation (Brodaty et al, 1993; Teri, 1999).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	42	The behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are now accepted as an important therapeutic target.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Management strategies, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, together with carer-focused training and education approaches, can be effective in decreasing BPSD but require concerted multi-disciplinary team input.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	44	 While the old age psychiatry team is well positioned to address the care needs of patients with BPSD, there are certain resource and training needs attached to the delivery of such care.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Some degree of special interest development in the area of BPSD should be encouraged within the multi-disciplinary team and the adoption of evidence-based guidelines and standardised assessments promoted.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Ongoing training and professional education of team members in BPSD should be given priority so that the highest standards of care can be provided for patients and their carers.

0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	4	Background The concept of vascular dementia has a long history but its usefulness as a diagnostic category has been called into question.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	5	Aims To evaluate vascular disease as a risk factor for dementia and the interface between cerebrovascular pathology and Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	6	Method The literature on this topic was selectively reviewed and synthesised.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	7	Results Risk factors for cerebrovascular disease are also risk factors for dementia.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, the course of dementia, once it has developed, appears to be frequently determined by Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	9	Conclusions As a public health measure, modification of vascular risk represents a potentially powerful means to prevent dementia through delaying its onset.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, an effect on progression of dementia, once it has developed, has yet to be established.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The traditional view of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease as distinguishable conditions is becoming steadily less tenable.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	12	Once upon a time, around the first half of the last century, late-onset dementia was viewed as an essentially homogeneous condition.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The main underlying cause was assumed to be atherosclerosis: a pathological substrate for  old age .
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Pioneering work around the 1960s and early 1970s challenged this assumption, establishing the importance of Alzheimer pathological changes in the majority of cases.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	15	 However, multiple cerebral infarctions also appeared to underlie a substantial proportion.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This led to the division of dementia into the two conditions of Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This system has persisted to this day but is coming under increasing criticism, particularly from those who wish to investigate vascular disease as a risk factor for dementia.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In the following sections the current status of and future directions for  vascular dementia  are considered, both as a diagnostic category and as a heading for a broad field of research.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	19	Research diagnostic criteria treat Alzheimer's disease as a diagnosis of exclusion (McKhann et al, 1984).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This system may be useful for examining issues relating to this disorder as a  pure  entity.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, it may also miss potentially important influences from factors such as vascular disease, which have been excluded by definition.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In addition, having begun by excluding major vascular disease such as clinical stroke or multiple cerebral infarctions on computed tomographic imaging, studies that use this diagnostic system now have to consider what to do with evidence of more subtle, subclinical disease, such as white-matter abnormalities seen on magnetic resonance imaging.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Increasingly sophisticated measurements of cerebrovascular disease in vivo raise the question of where exclusion criteria should stop.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	24	 If detectable levels of vascular disease continue to be excluded, the  pure  Alzheimer's disease group will become progressively smaller, defining an increasingly select group of persons who, for whatever reason, have remained free of any vascular disease into old age.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The question, of course, is what level of vascular disease may cause dementia; this cannot be answered by using criteria that assume that it is or is not a cause.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	26	A major problem with the concept of multi-infarct dementia has been that diagnostic criteria tried to do the same thing as those for Alzheimer's disease: that is, to define a  pure  entity.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	27	 However, while Alzheimer's disease at least has a reasonably well-defined pathological basis, the same is not true for dementia related to cerebrovascular disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	28	  Vascular dementia  subsumed multi-infarct dementia as a term because of recognition of this heterogeneity, and large numbers of other subtypes have subsequently been proposed (Konno et al, 1997).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	29	 These range from syndromes where dementia appears to have resulted from small, discrete  strategic  infarctions (such as bilateral thalamic infarction or lesions of the angular gyrus), to dementia associated with more diffuse cerebrovascular disease: ischaemic or haemorrhagic, cortical or subcortical (Brun, 2000).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	30	 More diffuse disease obviously exists across a spectrum of severity and with advancing age is increasingly likely to be comorbid with Alzheimer's disease, raising questions as to how (or whether) the two should be distinguished in a diagnostic system.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	31	 An additional obstacle for research is that the term  vascular dementia  makes assumptions about causation and therefore is of limited use when it comes to investigating potential causes.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	32	 It would not be considered particularly noteworthy if a study was to report that people who have a stroke are more likely to have hypertension or diabetes.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Similarly, it would not be very surprising if they were found to have higher mortality or higher levels of depression.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The problem with  vascular dementia  as a term is that comparisons with Alzheimer's disease or control groups are inevitably comparisons of populations with different rates of cerebrovascular disease, and it is impossible to conclude what is related to cerebrovascular disease and what is related to a particular dementia syndrome.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	35	It is perhaps preferable to consider vascular dementia as a series of questions rather than a diagnosis.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Does vascular disease cause dementia? What type (or types) of dementia does it cause? What can we do about it?.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	37	DOES VASCULAR DISEASE CAUSE DEMENTIA?.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	38	Systems of dementia classification have been a major obstacle for investigating this question, as previously discussed.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Another problem is that age groups in which dementia is most common contain, to an extent, healthy survivors with respect to vascular disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Also, people with both conditions together have a higher mortality and are therefore less likely to be identified in both cross-sectional and prospective studies.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	41	Particularly high rates of dementia are observed following clinical stroke, with an approximately nine-fold increase in risk over the first year followed by a smaller, two-fold raised annual risk which has been found to persist at least 25 years later (Kokmen et al, 1996).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia have also been established as risk factors for dementia in large prospective studies (Stewart, 1998).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Early reports that smoking might be a protective factor, at least for Alzheimer's disease, have not been confirmed by more rigorously designed investigations which, if anything, report a raised risk of both subtypes of dementia in smokers (Ott et al, 1998).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	44	 An important issue arising from these studies concerns the stage of cognitive decline at which these factors have an effect.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Raised blood pressure in mid-life is, for instance, a strong risk factor for later cognitive impairment (Elias et al, 1993).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	46	 However, blood pressure in later life tends to be lower in association with dementia (Skoog et al, 1996).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Therefore hypertension appears to exert its effect at an early stage in cognitive decline and the association may no longer be apparent by the time cognitive function has deteriorated sufficiently to be classified as dementia.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The same pattern has been described for raised cholesterol concentrations (Notkola et al, 1998), and has important potential implications for preventive or therapeutic intervention.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	49	WHAT TYPE OF DEMENTIA DOES IT CAUSE?.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	50	Again, traditional diagnostic criteria have hampered investigation of this question.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	51	 An increasing body of epidemiological evidence suggests that vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia are risk factors not only for the development of vascular dementia but also for Alzheimer's disease (Stewart, 1998).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Community-based research can be criticised in that neuroimaging has not been routinely used in diagnostic assessment, so that subclinical levels of cerebrovascular disease may have been missed and  mixed dementia  misidentified as Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	53	 This issue, however, should be more a consideration of mechanisms by which vascular risk factors are associated with dementia rather than one of arbitrarily defined diagnostic categories.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Post-stroke studies have found that dementia appears to follow an Alzheimer's disease-like course in the majority of cases (Kokmen et al, 1996) and that approximately 10% of people with post-stroke dementia have had gradually deteriorating cognitive function before the stroke occurred (Pohjasvaara et al, 1999).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Since Alzheimer's disease has a long latency period, it can be assumed that a substantial further proportion may have had subclinical disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	56	What is becoming increasingly apparent is that dementia associated with vascular disease frequently resembles Alzheimer's disease in its clinical course and, in many cases, is not obviously explained by a multiple infarction mechanism.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	57	 One possibility is that vascular processes cause a gradually progressive dementia syndrome.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	58	 However, recent pathological studies have suggested that isolated cerebrovascular disease (i.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	59	 with no Alzheimer lesions) is rarely found in association with dementia (Hulette et al, 1997).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	60	 These findings contrast with those from the early post-mortem series, although it should be borne in mind that people with dementia in the late 1960s would be expected to display much more florid and severe cerebrovascular disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The next question is whether vascular disease may directly cause or  drive  Alzheimer's disease processes.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Many potential mechanisms exist and have been proposed for vascular induction of Alzheimer's disease, including amyloid deposition secondary to ischaemia or peri-infarct inflammation and microglial activation.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Abnormal protein glycation may provide a link between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of cerebrovascular pathology in Alzheimer's disease such as vascular amyloid deposition and microangiopathy.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype may also provide a potential explanation for the association.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	66	 However, although the ApoE 4 variant is associated with increased vascular risk, neither lipid levels nor vascular disease have been found to be mediating factors between 4 and risk of Alzheimer's disease (Prince et al, 2000).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	67	Although many feasible mechanisms have been proposed for direct links between vascular and Alzheimer's disease processes, pathological evidence so far suggests that they interact principally in their clinical effects.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The  nun study  found no direct association between cerebrovascular disease and level of Alzheimer pathology, but instead found that less Alzheimer pathology was  required  to produce dementia if cerebrovascular disease was also present (Snowdon et al, 1997).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	69	 One possible explanation is that memory impairment secondary to hippocampal pathology in Alzheimer's disease is more likely to manifest as clinical dementia if there is also impairment of executive function secondary to vascular subcortical pathology.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Executive function impairment is an important, although frequently unmeasured, factor associated with memory decline, and decline in executive function alone, an important potential consequence of cerebrovascular disease, has been suggested as a dementia syndrome in its own right (Royall, 2000).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	71	Considering the length of time vascular disease has been accepted as a common and potentially reversible risk factor for dementia, evidence for interventions to modify this risk has been woefully scant.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	72	 As summarised in Table 1, the likely success of any intervention depends crucially on the mechanism of association.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Of particular interest for clinicians is the extent to which patients with dementia may benefit from treatment of vascular disease or risk factors.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	74	 However, there has been no optimally designed trial of such interventions.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Treatment of vascular risk factors may have an impact on cognitive decline through preventing stroke   and increasing evidence suggests that there may be no upper age limit for stroke prevention (Staessen et al, 2000).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	76	 In addition, there would be benefit if vascular disease was accelerating the progression of Alzheimer lesions.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	77	 On the other hand, if vascular disease predominantly accelerates the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease, treatment should be directed at Alzheimer's disease rather than the vascular component once dementia has developed.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	78	 This issue has become particularly important with the licensing of pharmacological agents for use in Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	79	 If stroke continues to be considered as an exclusion criterion, a large number of people with Alzheimer's disease will fail to receive appropriate treatment because of comorbid disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Whatever lies ahead for the treatment of dementia associated with cerebro-vascular disease, the potential for its prevention is likely to be substantial since vascular risk factors have high prevalence rates.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	81	 A modest reduction in vascular risk across a population could therefore be expected to result in a large reduction in future cases of dementia, if only through delaying its clinical onset.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Supporting this, preliminary findings from the large Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst Eur) trial of antihypertensive treatment in older people suggested a 50% reduction in incident dementia (principally Alzheimer's disease) occurring in those treated with a calcium channel blocker compared with placebo (Forette et al, 1998).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	83	View this table:    Table 1 Pathways of association between vascular disease and dementia and their implications with respect to preventive or therapeutic interventions  .
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	84	Further investigation into mechanisms underlying links between vascular and Alzheimer pathological processes is likely to provide important avenues for risk modification.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	85	 In addition, evidence from adequately designed therapeutic and preventive trials, even if negative, is likely to provide useful information regarding underlying mechanisms.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	86	 What may well become increasingly apparent is that dementia is a very late stage to be considering useful intervention.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	87	 One challenge is to develop public health strategies that can affect large populations, reducing vascular risk earlier in life with an aim of decreasing the burden of dementia for that generation 10-20 years later.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	88	 However, from a clinical standpoint (directed towards individual-rather than population-level risk) there will also need to be a move towards identifying cognitive decline at a much earlier stage than dementia.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In particular, with regard to vascular disease, the focus on memory decline influenced by Alzheimer's disease will need to shift towards an appreciation of executive function impairment (Bowler  and  Hachinski, 2000).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	90	What, therefore, is vascular dementia? It is certainly a convenient subject heading for a rapidly accelerating field of research.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	91	 What is less clear is whether it retains any usefulness as a diagnosis.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Vascular dementia implies a primary cause (cerebrovascular disease) linked with a specific consequence (a distinguishable dementia syndrome).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	93	 However, increasing evidence suggests that dementia associated with vascular disease involves a very broad spectrum of manifestations, from strategic infarct syndromes to Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	94	 In addition, although vascular disease is a powerful risk factor for dementia, it is questionable how often it is actually the sole cause of dementia in the absence of underlying vulnerability or comorbid disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Dementia research has suffered, in common with other areas of epidemiology, from a simplistic conceptual framework of risk factor outcome relationships.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	96	 What is increasingly evident is that there are many potential factors operating across an entire life course (and possibly extending back into previous generations) which may influence or mediate each other's effects (Table 2).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Designing appropriate studies and systems of analysis to take into account these multiple influences and interactions is likely to provide a major challenge for future research.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	98	View this table:    Table 2 A life-course model for the aetiology of cognitive decline and dementia  .
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	99	In the meantime, what is to be done with vascular dementia? A recent editorial has suggested that, rather than tinkering with existing criteria, they should be discarded and replaced wholesale (Bowler  and  Hachinski, 2000).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Certain syndromes can be reasonably considered as diagnoses, for example dementia due to strategic infarcts or genetic disorders such as CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	101	 However, for the majority of vascular dementia syndromes arising in later life, although these may manifest as  pure  disorders, it is questionable whether valid distinctions can truly be drawn between sub-categories or between vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The result is that clinical research diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia involve a high degree of subjective judgement (Skoog  and  Aevarsson, 2000), leading inevitably to poor agreement between raters (Lopez et al, 1994) and between different diagnostic instruments (Chui et al, 2000).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	103	 For depression, we do not feel the need to define  life event depression  or  poor physical health depression ; rather, we direct treatment at the symptoms and, holding in mind our formulation of possible underlying causes, attempt to modify potential maintaining factors and risk factors for recurrence.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Perhaps there may be lessons to be learned for cognitive impairment and dementia.

0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	108	CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Modification of vascular risk status in mid-life is likely to be an important means of reducing the subsequent risk of dementia for a population but evidence is lacking for an effect on the course of dementia, once this has developed.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	109	 The usefulness of vascular dementia as a diagnostic category is questionable since it involves a high degree of subjective judgement, subsumes a large number of potentially heterogeneous conditions and overlaps considerably with Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The current system of classifying dementia into mutually exclusive subtypes poorly reflects mixed disease in older age groups and has become an important issue since these  diagnoses  now determine eligibility for pharmacological intervention.

0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received July 25, 1997; Revised and Accepted August 2, 1997.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	4	The APOE [epsis]4 allele is a strong genetic susceptibility factor for Alzheimer's disease.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Interaction with other biological factors may modulate the effect of the apoE isoforms.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, previous work suggested that other genetic variability within the APOE locus, influencing the effect of the [epsis]4 allele, may exist.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Such variability could modify the expression of the APOE gene and, in particular, the level of expression of APOE alleles could be an important determinant of disease pathogenesis.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	8	 To test this hypothesis we examined the levels of expression of APOE in heterozygotes with AD and in controls, using a new method of semi-quantitation.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We report that relative [epsis]4 mRNA expression is increased in AD compared with controls and suggest that genetic variability in the neural expression of APOE contributes to disease risk.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	10	The [epsis]4 allele of the APOE gene is a major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) (1), and is also implicated as a risk factor for early-onset disease in some populations (2,3).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Previous studies have described [epsis]4 homozygotes as having a higher risk of developing disease than [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, individuals bearing one or two [epsis]4 alleles, do not inevitably develop the disease.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Detailed genetic analysis around the APOE locus has suggested the existence of other genetic variability in this region which could contribute to disease risk (4).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	14	 There are two possible explanations for these observations: (i) there is another genetically variable locus in the vicinity of the APOE gene involved in the pathogenesis of the disease; (ii) there is a genetic variability in the control of expression of the APOE gene (4).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	15	There has been little examination of the mRNA expression of APOE in AD (5,6).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The available evidence suggests that APOE expression is increased by neuronal damage (7,8) and that the bulk of the expression occurs in astrocytes (5).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This expression is believed to be part of a compensatory mechanism aimed at aiding reafferentation and reactive synaptogenesis (9).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Only a few studies have examined the expression of the apoE protein in AD cases and controls relative to the APOE genotype (9,10).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	19	 have suggested that the amount of apoE protein could be inversely correlated to the number of [epsis]4 alleles carried by subjects: higher levels were observed in [epsis]3 homozygotes, lower in [epsis]4 homozygotes and intermediate levels in [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes (10).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	20	We hypothesised that, since [epsis]4 homozygotes have a higher risk of developing disease than [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes, and a high proportion of individuals with the latter genotype reach a greater age without developing AD, a likely explanation of this was that there was genetic variability in neural expression at the APOE locus and that [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygote individuals who were high [epsis]4 expressors and/or low [epsis]3 expressors were more likely to develop AD than individuals with high [epsis]3 expressors and/or low [epsis]4 expressors.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	21	The identification of the APOE allele transcription products is easily achieved by RT-PCR, using restriction fragment length polymorphism.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	22	 We developed a semi-quantitative assay to measure allelic expression of APOE mRNA by RT-PCR using silver staining (11).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This method of quantitation has been applied to brains of heterozygote subjects collected at various centres and used to assess the percentage of [epsis]4 mRNA expression in [epsis]3[epsis]4 and [epsis]2[epsis]4 subjects and [epsis]2 mRNA expression in [epsis]2[epsis]3 individuals.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This has been carried out both in AD cases and controls.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	25	We selected a series of [epsis]3[epsis]4, [epsis]2[epsis]4, [epsis]2[epsis]3 AD cases (n = 14) and controls (n = 12) in order to measure the relative level of expression of the APOE allele in the frontal cortex (Fig.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We observed that [epsis]3 mRNA expression was consistently greater than [epsis]4 mRNA expression in all cases (Fig.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In addition, there was a clear and consistent difference in the [epsis]4 allelic expression ratio between AD cases and controls (Fig.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	28	 2), with AD cases showing a higher relative expression of [epsis]4 mRNA than controls (34.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Regarding the other heterozygous genotypes, the small size of each group prevented us from reaching any definite conclusion.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Nevertheless, a trend towards the same situation as observed in the [epsis]3[epsis]4 group could be noted, an increase in the expression of the [epsis]4 allele in the [epsis]2[epsis]4 group (42.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	31	2% in the only control), whereas nothing was apparent in the [epsis]2[epsis]3 group (39.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	32	4% in the only AD case versus 45.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Furthermore, a difference in the allelic expression ratio between [epsis]2[epsis]4 and [epsis]3[epsis]4 AD cases was observed, since [epsis]2[epsis]4 patients showed a 1.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	34	25-fold increase of the [epsis]4 allele ratio (P = 0.

0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The final [epsis]4 allele ratio calculated from this data was 21.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	37	Figure 2 Differential expression of the APOE mRNA for the three heterozygote genotypes in Alzheimer's disease cases and controls.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The [epsis]2 mRNA percentage was measured in the [epsis]2[epsis]3 population and the [epsis]4 mRNA percentage in the [epsis]3[epsis]4 and [epsis]2[epsis]4 population.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The average level of expression is indicated by a bold line in each category.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	40	 For each brain sample, RT-PCR and semi-quantitation was repeated three times.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	41	It is important to note that measurement of the ratio of expression of the two alleles in heterozygotes is likely to be a much more robust measurement than the determination of absolute levels of mRNA expression in the same tissue, since the latter will be profoundly affected by post-mortem delay, agonal state and cell population and density.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	42	As can be seen in Figure 2, the level of expression of the [epsis]3 allele is consistently higher than that of the [epsis]4 allele in the AD group as well as in the control group.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	43	 These data suggest that there is either differential stability of the different mRNA species, or that there is genetic variability in the expression of the two alleles in disequilibrium with the coding polymorphism.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	44	 However, in addition there was a clear and consistent difference in the [epsis]4 allelic expression ratio between AD cases and controls.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	45	 These results are consistent with the notion that part, at least, of the genetic risk of developing AD encoded at the APOE locus relates to the expression of this protein in the brain.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	46	 It would seem that heterozygote individuals who express a relatively high proportion of the [epsis]4 allele are at greater risk for developing disease than those expressing a relatively low proportion.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The observation that the different alleles of APOE are not equally expressed may be of importance in the formulation of hypotheses relating to the role of APOE in the pathogenesis of AD in general.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	48	 At present, there is much speculation and experimentation designed to determine the nature of the role of the different alleles of APOE in the pathogenesis of AD.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	49	 As previously suggested, the E4 isoform may facilitate (12) or not limit (13) the amyloid substance deposition.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	50	 This isoform would not protect against oxidative stress, conversely to the E2 isoform (14).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Finally, it has been suggested that the E2 and E3 isoforms may prevent the aggregation of Tau protein, while the E4 isoform may not prevent the paired helical filament formation (15).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	52	 However, these hypotheses are based on the premise that the APOE allele isoforms are equally expressed and present at similar concentrations in the brain.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	53	 These isoform-specific differences could be enhanced by a different representation of each isoform in an individual.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	54	To date, it seems difficult to link APOE mRNA and apoE protein levels.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Several studies had explored this issue reporting contradictory findings in brain (10,16), cerebrospinal fluid (17,18) and plasma (19).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	56	 But even if the apoE level was tested according to the APOE genotype, none of the previous studies have been able to determine the relative ratio between the different isoforms and thus our results are not comparable with them.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The development of isoform-specific monoclonal antibodies would help to determine whether the variation that is observed in our population is also present at the protein level (20).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	58	There are two major findings in our work.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	59	 First, that the expression of the [epsis]3 allele is consistently higher than the expression of the [epsis]4 allele.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Second, that the expression of the [epsis]4 allele beyond a certain level seems to greatly influence the vulnerability of an individual to Alzheimer's disease.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	61	It is interesting to note that APOE is up-regulated as a consequence of an insult.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	62	 showed an increase in the level of expression of APOE mRNA in rat after lesioning of the cerebral cortex (6).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	63	 showed that APOE mRNA was increased in AD brains (5).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Together these results support an event, which may lead to an increase of the APOE mRNA and, in parallel, a distortion of the allelic expression.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The distortion of the allelic expression may be specific to brain, and possibly restricted to certain areas (21).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	66	 This suggests a neural genetic susceptibility for AD associated with the APOE gene.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	67	Interestingly, Templeton reached a similar conclusion using a cladistic analysis of our previously reported genetic data (4).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Using haplotype data from markers surrounding the APOE locus, including the APOE polymorphism, Templeton showed that the coding polymorphism in the APOE gene was not sufficient to explain the increased risk for AD (22).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Our data suggest that the influence of non-coding polymorphism on ApoE expression may supply the rest of the answer.

0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The developer and silver nitrate solutions were prepared extemporaneously.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The gel was digitalised on a Sharp JX-325 high resolution colour scanner, and the fragment intensity was measured using the Image Master Software (Pharmacia) with appropriate background subtract.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	97	The percentage of the [epsis]4 allele was calculated with the equation below as described in ref.

0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	99	--> No[epsis]4 mRNA and No[epsis]3 mRNA were the initial number of the [epsis]3 and [epsis]4 mRNAs.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	100	 [alpha][prime][epsis]4 mRNA and [alpha][prime][epsis]2 or [epsis]3 mRNA were the coefficients allowing silver staining, and the phenomenon of saturation due to this staining, to be integrated and normalised.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	101	 A is a coefficient of proportionality, correcting for the length difference between each restriction fragments.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	102	 After digestion by CfoI, the [epsis]3, [epsis]2 and [epsis]4 alleles can be characterised by 91, 83 and 72 bp fragments, respectively.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The A coefficient is therefore calculated as A = 91/72 for [epsis]3[epsis]4 individuals, A = 83/72 for [epsis]2[epsis]4 individuals and A = 91/83 for the [epsis]2[epsis]3 population.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	104	Because both [epsis]2 and [epsis]3 alleles give a restriction length fragment at 91 bp, AOD[epsis]2 mRNA + OD[epsis]3 mRNA = OD91 bp.

0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, August 2, 2005 , and in revised form, September 8, 2005.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	3	Somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc metalloprotease containing two homologous regions, termed the N- and C-domains, each of which is proteolytically active (11).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	4	 ACE has a single transmembrane domain and is cleaved from the cell surface at a low rate, resulting in the secretion of its ectodomain into the media of cultured cells and plasma (12, 13).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	5	 ACE has been intensively characterized for its role in the regulation of blood pressure by cleaving angiotensin I to angiotensin II and inactivating bradykinin (14).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This function of ACE is modulated pharmacologically by ACE inhibitors, which bind competitively to the active site zinc to prevent substrate hydrolysis.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This commonly prescribed class of drugs is used for the treatment of hypertension and other disorders.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In addition to regulating vasoactive peptides, ACE shows a broad substrate specificity, including several neuropeptides, and it is able to metabolize substrates using both exopeptidase and endopeptidase activities (15).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Interestingly, despite their homology, the N- and C-domains display differential capacity to degrade some substrates and can be inhibited selectively by certain ACE inhibitors (16, 17).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Recently, ACE was found to participate in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signal transduction pathway, apparently independently of its proteolytic function (18).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	11	A potential relationship between ACE and AD was first suggested by human genetic studies, which reported that an insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism within intron 16 of the ACE gene associates with AD (19).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Specifically, the I allele was associated with an increased risk for AD, whereas the D allele was associated with protection (20, 21).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Of potential mechanistic relevance, inheritance of the D allele has been associated with increased plasma ACE levels (22).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Regarding disease specificity, the I allele has been found to associate positively with AD but not with vascular dementia or vascular pathology (23, 24).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The I/I genotype has also been linked to smaller volumes of the hippocampus and the amygdala (24).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Importantly, post-mortem analyses of AD patients determined that those with the I/I genotype had a trend toward increased brain A42 load compared with the D/D genotype (25).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ACE gene have also been shown to associate with AD, and there is a decrease in the prevalence of the AD-susceptible genotype with increased age, consistent with a modulation of longevity (26).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	18	Post-mortem studies of patients with AD have found elevated levels of ACE in the temporal cortex and specifically within pyramidal cortical neurons (27, 28) as well as significantly increased ACE activity in the medial hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, frontal cortex, and caudate nucleus (29).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A mechanistic link between ACE and AD was suggested when affinity-purified ACE was shown to degrade synthetic A-(1-40) between the Asp7-Ser8 bond in vitro, producing a truncated 33-residue peptide that exhibited decreased aggregation and cytotoxic potential (30).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	20	A plausible interpretation of the above genetic, neuropathological, and biochemical findings is that ACE is implicated in AD via direct proteolysis of the A peptide, modulating A levels within the brain.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This hypothesis suggests that reduced ACE activity, either by genetic mechanisms or chronic pharmacological inhibition, could increase cerebral levels of A40 and/or A42 and thus presumably increase the risk of developing AD and/or contribute to its progression.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	22	 To address this hypothesis in intact, living cells, we cloned and characterized human neural ACE and determined its role in the clearance of secreted A.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	23	We demonstrate that ACE promotes the clearance of naturally produced A40 and A42 and leads to secondary degradation of both A species.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Further, by using site-directed mutagenesis in the context of the full-length enzyme, we show that both the N- and C-domains of ACE are capable of promoting A degradation with similar capacity.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Finally, we demonstrate that treatment of A-secreting cells with a commonly prescribed ACE inhibitor prevents ACE-mediated A clearance and results in accumulation of the A peptide.

0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	136	A CHO cell line stably expressing both human APP751 bearing the AD-causing V717F mutation, and a Flp-In acceptor locus was used to make stable cell lines expressing wild-type ACE (wtACE), E362D, E960D, E362D/E960D, or empty vector.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Thus, each stable cell line contained APP as well as one of the transfected constructs integrated into the same genomic locus by site-directed recombination of the pcDNA5/FRT vector (cell lines are designated as APP + X, where X is the integrated construct).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The resulting ACE stable lines produced identical levels of the wtACE or mutant ACE proteins as well as indistinguishable levels of human APP (Fig.

0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	161	 These differences in A content could not be ascribed to the ACE enzyme altering the levels of the - or -secretase-generated APP C-terminal fragments, since both C99 and C83 were not significantly changed compared with APP + empty vector (Fig.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Thus, using conservative mutations to inactivate the ACE catalytic domains, these experiments demonstrate that both the N- and C-domains are capable of mediating clearance of naturally produced, cell-derived A in intact cells.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	163	A Levels Are Increased by ACE Inhibition To determine whether decreasing ACE activity with a small molecule inhibitor could elevate cell-derived A levels, we preincubated cells for 24 h in the presence of the prototypical ACE inhibitor, captopril, and then conditioned the media for 18 h in the presence of the drug.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Increasing doses of captopril were tested, and the resulting conditioned media were analyzed by ELISA for total A content.

0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	171	It has been reported recently that the N-domain of ACE, but not its C-domain, is responsible for the degradation of synthetic A40 in vitro (40).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	172	 In that study, the ACE catalytic domains were cloned in isolation, producing recombinant truncation proteins bearing one ACE active site.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	173	 In contrast, we find that both the N- and C-domains of ACE are able to degrade naturally produced A in a cellular context.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	174	 In our studies, we used conservative mutations to inactivate each catalytic domain in the same molecule, conserving the overall structure and sequence of the full-length protein.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	175	 It is possible that the C-domain is only able to degrade A in intact cells, not in vitro.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	176	 There is evidence that each catalytic domain of ACE regulates the activity of the other (41), suggesting that the full-length protein is required for normal substrate recognition and degradation.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The C-domain, when expressed outside of the context of the full-length enzyme, may not retain the tertiary structure required to degrade larger substrates such as A, whereas much smaller substrates are still processed (40).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	178	 It is unlikely that incomplete inactivation of the N-domain in our E362D mutant enzyme could account for the observed decrease in A, because when both domains are inactivated in the E362D/E960D ACE construct, we observe no change in A levels compared with the empty vector control.

0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	201	 At this writing, approximately 40 published studies have examined this relationship, with the majority finding a significant association of ACE genotype to AD.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Further, post-mortem analysis of AD brain tissue has shown significant elevation of ACE protein compared with control (28), perhaps representing an up-regulation of an A clearance mechanism.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Interestingly, initiation of ACE-mediated signal transduction by its substrates has been shown to up-regulate the enzyme's own expression via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway (18, 42).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	204	 This feedback system provides a hypothetical mechanism by which ACE could modulate its own expression depending on levels of the A substrate, leading to elevated levels of ACE in AD cortex.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	205	Our observation that ACE inhibition in cells expressing both human APP and ACE promotes accumulation of secreted A may bear clinical relevance.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Given that neurons produce both APP and ACE and neuronal ACE is up-regulated in AD (27), we hypothesize that chronic pharmacological inhibition of ACE could increase levels of brain A by reducing ACE-dependent proteolysis.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	207	 No studies have yet examined the consequence of chronic ACE inhibition on levels of brain or plasma A in humans.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Very few clinical trials of ACE inhibitors have analyzed their effects on cognitive decline in AD subjects, and results to date are inconclusive (43-45).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	209	No studies on the effects of ACE deficiency or overexpression on A metabolism in vivo have been reported.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Such studies may be problematic in interpretation, because endogenous murine A has amino acid differences from the human peptide immediately surrounding the putative site of cleavage by ACE, and these could affect its properties as a substrate.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Future in vivo studies that examine ACE inhibition, deficiency, or overexpression in mice expressing human APP may be most instructive regarding the role of ACE in Alzheimer disease.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	212	In the context of our new findings and the earlier studies reviewed above, we hypothesize that decreased activity of ACE in the aged human brain, originating either from genetic polymorphisms or pharmacological inhibition, may promote A accumulation and thus modulate the likelihood of the development of Alzheimer disease and/or its neuropathological severity.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Our findings suggest the need for further analyses of the biological effects of ACE genetic deficiency and ACE pharmacological inhibition, both in experimental models of AD and in the large human population currently experiencing chronic ACE inhibition.

0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	4	The boundaries between non-pathological brain ageing and the dementias are unclear and contentious.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Neuropathological examination can detect occasional individuals in whom the microscopic features typical of late-onset Alzheimer's disease are present yet a clinical history of dementia is absent.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	6	 On other occasions, the converse seems true: individuals seriously disabled in life by dementia show at death only mild pathological features of Alzheimer's disease.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Observations of this type, although often made by experienced neuropathologists, are not widely discussed by molecular neurobiologists, among whom the assumption has largely prevailed that Alzheimer's disease is a well-validated nosological entity, discontinuous with ageing and with its own discrete molecular pathology.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This reasoning extends to the repeated proposition that understanding the pathogenesis of amyloid deposition will provide a sound and sufficient basis from which to develop novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease (Selkoe, 1999).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	9	Findings from the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (MRC-CFAS) now challenge these assumptions on at least two fronts.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	10	 First, they encourage dementia researchers to re-examine the basis for the belief that there are valid boundaries between non-pathological ( normal ) ageing in the absence of dementia and the dementias.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Second, they suggest that the central role often assigned to amyloid deposition requires review.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Longitudinal follow-up studies such as the MRC-CFAS raise important issues about the nature of the phenomena to be explained.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This editorial considers the early contributions to brain development as influences on cognitive decline in later life.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In turn, this approach requires a deeper understanding than is as yet available of those brain mechanisms and processes most affected by ageing.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	15	Until Margaret Esiri and her colleagues (Esiri et al, 2001) described their large community-based neuropathological study of the distinction between dementia and brain ageing in the absence of dementia, there was a shortage of data.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	16	 It was impossible to accept the validity of contemporary neuropathological criteria for dementia, or the definitions of the boundary, if any, that existed between the dementias and  normal  ageing.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The study showed that in 209 old people weighted to contain 100 people who met clinical criteria for dementia before death, the majority showed mixed Alzheimer and vascular pathologies.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	18	 At postmortem examination the brains of dementia and non-dementia subjects overlapped in neuritic and diffuse plaque density and no single pathological criterion reliably distinguished between groups.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Coexistent vascular lesions did not provide sufficient explanation for the presence of dementia, but did encourage the view that interactions between Alzheimer and vascular pathologies may be critical determinants of progression to clinical dementia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	20	The MRC-CFAS data provide the strongest evidence yet that the relationship between  normal  brain ageing and the dementias is best represented by a continuum.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	21	 They also do much to weaken the pivotal position claimed for amyloid deposition in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Without the inclusion of some other factor or factors, the  amyloid cascade  hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease is no longer tenable.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The MRC-CFAS programme may yet identify such factors.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Not until their sample size has more than doubled and there are improved descriptions and quantifications of vascular lesions will it be possible to begin to disentangle the pathological processes that contribute to clinical presentations of dementia and, critically, to establish their true relationships with age.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	25	RATE OF COGNITIVE CHANGE OR  CASENESS .
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	26	Longitudinal psychological studies of cognitive ageing do not identify a single point of transition between  normal  ageing and dementia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	27	 When several cognitive domains are used to predict later onset of dementia, cognitive decline is typically non-uniform across those domains, with the exception of early memory impairment   largely because of its inclusion among criteria for dementia (Chen et al, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	28	 These presymptomatic patterns of cognitive decline are not reliably distinguished from  normal  variation in cognitive function in late life, almost half of which is attributable to original childhood IQ (Deary, 2000).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	29	Psychologists and psychiatrists alike are familiar with problems of this type and are comfortable with a search for antecedents that may extend into earlier developmental epochs.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Links between increased late-life dementia risk and lower educational attainment suggest the association between dementia and childhood IQ reported by Whalley et al (2000).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Explanations of associations of this type are complex and not mutually exclusive.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Not least are the strong intergenerational and lifelong continuities of material advantage, which award entry to a safer, healthier environment to the mentally more able youngster.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	33	 More usual is the concept that the mature brain possesses sufficient  reserve  (or redundancy) to withstand age-related pathologies as described by Esiri et al (2001) and that this reserve is determined by early life experiences.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The belief that childhood educational attainment or mental ability could determine a threshold which brain ageing or dementia pathology must be sufficient to exceed to cause dementia was supported by the data reported by Whalley et al (2000).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The association between lower childhood IQ and dementia was confined to late-onset cases and was most marked in those presenting after age 72 years.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	36	The MRC-CFAS programme represents the successful application of epidemiological and neuropathological methods to the study of distinctions between clinical cases and non-cases, and the ages at which disease onset does (or does not) occur.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	37	 It is the most usual contemporary approach to age-related disease, where the disease of interest (in this case dementia) is defined as present or absent.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	38	 It contrasts with a second and potentially more powerful research method, which investigates the rate of change in premorbid characteristics over a specified age interval (National Institute of Aging Working Group on Aging and Genetic Epidemiology, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Here, risk factors for dementia are examined not simply as contributing to duration of survival up to becoming a  case  of dementia, but as possible determinants of rate and timing of change in parameters believed to be closely linked to the pathogenesis of dementia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	40	Age-related abnormalities of glucose metabolism are just one of these hypothetical parameters.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for stroke and a possible risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia (Luchsinger et al, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Matureonset (type 2) diabetes is also associated with cardiovascular risk factors that include hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, which may cause or accelerate unrecognised progressive cerebrovascular disease.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	43	 There are at least two plausible biological mechanisms to link enduring age-related abnormalities in glucose metabolism with neuronal death: the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs); and hyperinsulinaemia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Separate strands of evidence link foetal growth, adult hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance at age 64 years (Hales et al, 1991).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Taken together, these observations advocate longitudinal studies on individual differences in glucose metabolism and age-related cognitive variation.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	46	 When studies of this type extend across the life span, they are subsumed under the title  life course approaches  to late-onset dementia and dementia-associated traits.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	47	 They sometimes suggest parallel experimental routes to better understanding of mechanisms of age-related cognitive impairment (Strachan et al, 1997).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	48	Explanations of associations between suboptimal foetal and infant growth and late-onset disease include failure to acquire lasting control of complex central regulatory systems.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	49	 In brain development, foetal nutritional and hormonal environments are also important because of their critical roles in the expression of specific genes (Dauncey et al, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Major differences in the foetal and infant nutritional environment induce large differences in expression of hormonal receptor isoforms and may provide the means whereby dietary micro-nutrients affect cognitive functions across the life span.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Nutritional influences can be as apparently diverse as the contributions of folate and vitamin B12 to neurodevelopment and the greater age-related cognitive impairment linked to dietary and plasma folate concentrations (Miller, 2000; Duthie et al, 2002).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	52	Diversity in timing and nature of single nutritional influences represents an important obstacle when taking a life course approach to understanding dementia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	53	 It can obscure the best route to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which early nutritional experience affects neurodevelopment and later cognitive performance.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	54	 For example, observational studies in late life suggest hyperhomocysteinaemia (attributed to reduced transformation of homocysteine to methionine by folate and vitamin B12) as a possible risk factor for cerebrovascular disease (Miller, 2000) and dementia (Seshadri et al, 2002).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Polymorphisms in the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR, an enzyme essential to folate metabolism) are, therefore, possible susceptibility factors for age-related cognitive decline; however, they possess the potential to influence brain metabolism throughout life.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Similar critiques can be made of studies of interactions between genes and early nutrition.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	57	 These may be as specific as their influences on peripheral insulin sensitivity and neuro-development, when the same factors might influence synaptogenesis in late life.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	58	BRAIN AGEING AND COGNITIVE DECLINE.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	59	The association between brain ageing and age-related cognitive decline is uncertain.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Largely because ageing studies are only just beginning, brain ageing is yet to be linked informatively to what is known about the neurobiological basis of cognitive decline.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Higher brain functions comprise abilities like language, learning, memory, planning, abstract reasoning and self-awareness; most of these are impaired as age-related cognitive decline progresses to dementia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The neural foundations of higher functions are supported by the complex organisation of synaptic connections.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	63	 One current paradigm attaches a central role to modulation of synaptic functions, some of which are enduring but the majority of which (especially in brain areas serving higher functions) require constant remodelling to respond optimally to environmental demands.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	64	Brain areas that provide higher functions appear most susceptible to the effects of ageing and Alzheimer's disease.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	65	 In one disease model, progression of age-related cognitive decline to dementia is best represented by a reversal of corticogenesis (Arendt, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	66	 To develop such models further requires better understanding of ageing processes than is now available.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Biological components of ageing certainly involve complex interplay between intrinsic (mostly genetic) and extrinsic (mostly environmental) factors.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Recent progress encourages some optimism that a small number of highly conserved genes affect life span and do so through a similarly small number of metabolic processes.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	69	 This view contrasts with the previous  degenerative  position that held biological ageing to be haphazard and not amenable to study.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Generation of metabolites of oxygen termed  reactive oxygen species  (ROS) is an important cause of oxidative stress and ROS are intimately involved in the biology of ageing (Finkel  and  Holbrook, 2000).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	71	 There are some parallels between ageing and altered metabolic states induced in lower organisms by adverse circumstances that are surprisingly similar in yeasts, nematodes, fruit flies and mammals (Guarente  and  Kenyon, 2000).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	72	 They permit postponement of reproduction during unfavourable environmental conditions, and control expression of genes that protect against ROS damage and genes involved in insulin signalling (Finch  and  Ruvkun, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Reduced expression of ageing genes involved in insulin-like receptor signalling extends life span, and this may be a specific property of neurons (Boulianne, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	74	Extrinsic contributions to brain ageing are poorly understood and lag some way behind elegant scientific studies of intrinsic components.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Acquired defences against ROS damage are largely derived from dietary antioxidants which oppose ROS production.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	76	 When ROS defences falter, additional burdens are placed on the brain's capacity to maintain structural integrity, most often threatened by increased peroxidation of neuronal lipid membranes, oxidative damage to DNA or large regulatory molecules (Whalley, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Terminally differentiated cells such as neurons cannot dispose of DNA damage by cell division and must rely on their own DNA repair enzymes.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	78	 This type of damage may not only compromise the performance of neuronal sub-populations that provide higher mental functions but also impair the capacity to make good or compensate for performance decrements.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	79	Arendt (2001) has summarised much of the available evidence to support the hypothesis that age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease are best understood as progressive failure of synaptic remodelling.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	80	 In his view, there is much compelling evidence to accept, first, that abnormal dendritic sprouting occurs in Alzheimer's disease, and second, that  morphoregulatory molecules  involved in neurodevelopment re-emerge as part of Alzheimer molecular pathology.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	81	 He suggests, for example, that the conserved functions of amyloid precursor protein (APP), the presenilins and apolipoprotein E (all implicated in Alzheimer's disease) are the key roles of morphoregulatory molecules in synaptic formation, turnover and stabilisation.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	82	 They are preferentially expressed in adult brain in areas that retain most capacity to modify synaptic function.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Morphogenesis of neurons has been of enormous relevance in understanding neurodevelopment and differential survival of cell types.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Arendt (2001) now extends their significance to late life.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	85	 First, he argues that these molecular processes underpin the  functional sculpting  used by the immature brain to  self-organise  the acquisition of higher functions such as language.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Second, he identifies among the detritus of dementia, features that imply reactivation of brain self-organising molecular machinery.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	87	 In Arendt's view, it is this reactivation that triggers the cascade of events which results eventually in the selective loss of cortical neurons.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	88	To this model, Arendt (2001) adds the lifelong accumulation of noxious influences on brain function from sources as diverse as malnutrition, neurotoxins and cerebrovascular disease.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Age-related endogenous oxidative damage to neurons (summarised above) further stresses brain adaptive mechanisms.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The gradual and pervasive result is to jeopardise the high investment made by those neurons that retain a capacity for synaptic remodelling after completion of brain maturation.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Missing from Arendt's model are mechanisms that account for individual and gender differences in rate of change in traits associated with dementia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	92	 This dilemma is familiar to developmental neuroscientists and has a strong likeness to current research problems in the molecular genetics of cognition (Plomin  and  Craig, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Potentially, hormonal and genetic contributions to synaptic remodelling could be relevant.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	94	 For example, there is evidence that oestrogens induce synapse formation in rat hippocampus and that this induction is dependent on apolipoprotein E (Stone et al, 1998).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Diversity in efficiency of self-organisation may contribute to variation in childhood mental ability; these differences may extend into late life, leading to the divergence between brain ageing and dementia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	96	Understanding individual differences in age-related cognitive decline is beset with difficulty.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Neuropathological evidence of the hypothetical discontinuity between  normal  ageing and dementia is lacking; the best available evidence suggests that there is no boundary at all.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Detection of sources of variation in rate of cognitive decline requires considerable investment in longitudinal, population-based studies.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The MRC-CFAS findings are the outcome of a longitudinal study that will continue to be informative for many years.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Quite rightly, the study has focused on dementia outcomes over an age interval when the risk of dementia is high.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	101	The problem of the boundary between brain ageing and dementia remains.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	102	 It will demand detailed attention in the analysis of current longitudinal databases and in future research design.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Some clarification seems certain if the recommendations of the National Institute of Aging Working Group on Aging and Genetic Epidemiology (2001) come to influence brain ageing research goals and practice.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	104	 As the precise tools of molecular biology are applied to the phenomena of ageing, so boundaries may be brought into focus.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	105	 So far, it seems, those boundaries are not where the clinical data suggested they should be.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	106	 If the ultimate research goal is to postpone or perhaps even to prevent dementia, research of this type is certain to inform the timing of successful intervention.

0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	6	The regulatory properties of IDE are a relatively new finding.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	7	 IDE associates with and activates the cytosolic glucocorticoid and androgen receptors (9, 10).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	8	 IDE also complexes with the proteasome and regulates its activity (11).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Substrates that bind to IDE, including insulin and the various growth factors, inhibit proteasome activity when IDE is complexed with multicatalytic proteinase (MCP), but not after separation of the two proteins (12, 13).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Furthermore, insulin inhibits proteasome activity toward an artificial substrate in intact cells (14).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	11	 This has led to the hypothesis that intracellular actions of insulin and other growth factors on cellular protein turnover are due to interactions with IDE and inhibition of proteolysis by the proteasome.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	12	IDE is a metalloenzyme containing Zn2+ and possibly Mn2+ (15), and its degradative activity requires one or more divalent cations (7).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In addition to Zn2+ and Mn2+, Ca2+ has been shown to affect the degradative activity of IDE in vitro and in intact cells (16, 17).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	14	 As Ca2+ and other divalent cations have been implicated in some of the activities of insulin (18), the present study is directed at examination of IDE s binding, regulatory, and degradative functions, with special emphasis on the effect of metals.

0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Figure 2A shows that insulin inhibits LLVY degradation by the untreated IDE-MCP complex.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The addition of Ca2+ slightly increases the activity of untreated complex, but does not alter the effect of insulin.

0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	72	To further explore the regulatory role of IDE in control of MCP, selected inhibitors were examined (Table 1).

0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The preparation was then chromatographed on a Mono-Q HPLC column with all LLVY-degrading activity eluting in a sharp, symmetrical peak (not shown).

0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	90	 To explore this, dose-response curves with SDS were performed on the IDE-MCP complex without and with insulin, and the effects on LLVY, LSTR, and LLE activities were examined (Fig.

0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	103	The stimulatory effects of IDE on proteasomes and the glucocorticoid and androgen receptors are established by the present and previous reports (9, 12), but the mechanism is not.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The reversible nature of the activation argues against proteolytic activation of the complex by IDE.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Other possibilities include conformational changes in the complex, IDE degradation of the ligand, proteolytic products generated by IDE, or some combination of these.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	106	The present study provides evidence that divalent cations are involved in the activity and control of the IDE-MCP complex.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Treatment of the partially purified enzyme with EDTA significantly reduced the activity of IDE, which can be restored by the addition of Ca2+ with as little as 10-6 M.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	108	 This effect is presumably mediated by removal of the Zn2+ found at the active site of IDE, which is required for activity.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	109	 This treatment also reduces the chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activities of the proteasome and eliminates the ability of insulin to inhibit these activities.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The addition of Ca2+ or Co2+ restores the chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activities, but fails to restore the insulin responsiveness.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Zn2+ and Mn2+ show relatively little effect.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	112	We also examined the effect of EGTA on the complex.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	113	 EGTA has a slightly higher affinity (2.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	114	5 times) for Ca2+ than does EDTA, but has 10 to 10,000 times less affinity for other cations (including Zn2+) (21).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Under the conditions of these experiments, EGTA had no effect on IDE activity (data not shown), but did reduce the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome and effectively eliminated the insulin effect.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	116	 A similar reduction was seen with trypsin-like activity, although it did not reach statistical significance.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Insulin s ability to inhibit was restored by some of the cations (Ca2+ and Co2+).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	118	 These data suggest that there are two metals involved in the complex, as we have reported previously (15).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	119	We propose that one metal, zinc, is tightly bound to IDE, and is essential for its activity, and the other, possibly Mn2+ or Ca2+, is more loosely bound and is required for the productive interaction of IDE and the proteasome.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	120	 EDTA can chelate the tightly bound Zn2+ and the more loosely bound metal associated with the complex.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	121	 This inhibits IDE, thereby lessening its stimulatory effect on the proteasome.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Loss of the Zn2+ molecule causes a conformational change in IDE, dissociating it from the proteasome and disrupting the ability of insulin to alter proteasome activity.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Readdition of divalent cation restores IDE activity, but because it is no longer part of the complex, IDE cannot alter proteasome function.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	124	 However, EGTA only has effects on the more loosely bound metal and disrupts IDE s ability to affect chymotrypsin-like activity, but does not cause IDE to dissociate from the complex.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Thus, addition of cations can restore insulin sensitivity.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	126	The fact that IDE must be active and in a complex with the proteasome to mediate its regulatory effects is further supported by the data presented in Tables 1 and 2.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Agents that inhibit IDE lessen proteasome activity and effectively eliminate insulin s inhibitory effect.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	128	Finally, we studied the IDE proteasome interactions using SDS, which has been shown to alter proteasome conformation.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	129	 7, the chymotrypsin and trypsin-like activities of the proteasome are insulin sensitive in the absence of SDS, but lose both sensitivity and considerable activity at 0.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Presumably, this is due to SDS altering the interaction between IDE and the proteasome.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	131	 At higher concentrations, SDS further alters the conformation of the proteasome and stimulates the chymotrypsin-like and peptidyl glutamyl-degrading activities.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	132	 However, at these high concentrations, IDE is still unable to interact with the proteasomes, and insulin does not inhibit.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	133	The data presented here characterize and further support the idea that IDE can serve as a regulator of the proteasome.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Metal ions play important roles in this interaction.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	135	 First, IDE is a metalloproteinase and must be active for insulin s inhibitory effect.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Further, a second, more loosely bound divalent cation is required for IDE to mediate its effects.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Changes in protein conformation are important, as illustrated by the loss of activity when IDE has its active site metal removed, and by changes in activity induced by SDS.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	138	The physiological effect of insulin is to inhibit cellular protein degradation, with greater effects during catabolic states (e.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	139	 starvation, diabetes, and traumatic stress).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	140	 As cell survival requires continued protein turnover, it would not be expected that insulin could totally inhibit MCP activity or completely block protein degradation.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Rather, the IDE-MCP interaction may serve as an activator of basal cellular protein degradation, analogous to activation of the glucocorticoid and androgen receptors by IDE (9), with insulin and other substrates then acting to inhibit the stimulated process.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Thus, selective effects on cellular protein degradation in insulin-sensitive cells are under the control of insulin-IDE interactions.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	143	 MCP comprises a relatively large proportion of the protein in many cells (up to 1%), and IDE, although expressed at high levels in some tissues (33), is not present in sufficient quantities in all tissues to be a universal regulator of all of MCP s activities.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Our results show that insulin substantially inhibits only two of the activities of MCP, the chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The proteasome may have as many as five different proteolytic activities (34).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	146	 It also remains to be determined whether the degradation of ubiquitinylated proteins is inhibited by insulin through IDE.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	147	Although not widely appreciated, many studies have shown biological activity of intracellular insulin (35, 36) and alterations in insulin activity with inhibition of cellular insulin processing (37, 38).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Our recent studies have provided a potential mechanism for these previously unexplained observations.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	149	 In this scheme, the IDE portion of the complex acts as an intracellular receptor for insulin and possibly other growth factors.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	150	 The insulin-IDE interaction then alters activity of the protein complex (i.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	151	 MCP, glucocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor, and perhaps others) and contributes to the biological actions of insulin.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The insulin effect on MCP can be prevented by altering the activity of IDE.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Although speculative, cellular activity regulated by the IDE complexes may be affected by cellular redox state and divalent cation distribution due to changes in IDE.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Alterations in insulin action have been associated with ion flux and redistribution and with redox state.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	155	 These effects could be explained in part by regulatory effects of IDE.

0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	101	1) suggests that diabetes contributes to risk of stroke-associated dementia through additional mechanisms.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	102	 One such mechanism that has been proposed is diabetes-related impairment in cerebral vasoreactivity, with accompanying changes in blood flow (44, 45).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	103	The mechanisms underlying the possible association between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease remain unclear.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	104	 One possibility is the production of glycation end products (19, 20).

0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The mechanisms underlying the weak relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease remain to be clarified.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	108	Three longitudinal studies have reported an increased risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, among persons with diabetes (23 to 26).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Two of these studies used NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (23, 25, 26); one showed that risk of Alzheimer's disease was lower than risk of overall dementia in persons with diabetes (25), and the other showed that risk of Alzheimer's disease in such subjects was decreased by excluding subjects with stroke, although the risk remained significant (26).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The third study used the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised, for the diagnosis of dementia, based on medical record review and autopsy data (24).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	111	 These studies had a limited ability to detect vascular dementia.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	112	 The definition of vascular dementia is controversial; depending on the criteria used, the incidence of vascular dementia can vary severalfold (27).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	113	 If cases of stroke-associated dementia are misclassified as cases of Alzheimer's disease, risk factors for stroke-associated dementia can appear to predict Alzheimer's disease.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	114	 One study that used NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and the criteria of the California state Alzheimer's disease diagnostic and treatment centers for the diagnosis of vascular dementia found a relation of diabetes with vascular dementia but not with Alzheimer's disease (28).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	115	The criteria of the California Alzheimer's disease diagnostic and treatment centers are the most sensitive for the diagnosis of vascular dementia (27) and would therefore classify fewer cases of stroke-associated dementia as cases of Alzheimer's disease.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Thus, it appears that the relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease is sensitive to the criteria used to define vascular dementia.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	117	 We addressed this issue by reclassifying all subjects with Alzheimer's disease who had also had a stroke as subjects with stroke-associated dementia (including cases in which the temporal relation between dementia and stroke was unclear), but the hazard ratios in this analysis remained essentially unchanged.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	118	 The criteria for the diagnosis of stroke-associated dementia used in the last analysis are consistent with those of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) (54).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	119	 The NINDS-AIREN criteria are not as sensitive in the detection of vascular dementia as the California criteria used in the study that found no relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (27).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	120	 However, misclassification of cases of stroke-associated dementia as cases of Alzheimer's disease is an unlikely explanation for our finding of a relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease: The results were unchanged both with exclusion of stroke cases from the analyses and with the reclassification of dementia subtypes described above.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	121	 The finding of a slightly greater risk of Alzheimer's disease among subjects using insulin than among those using oral hypoglycemic agents is consistent with findings from the Rotterdam Study (23, 26) and may reflect the possibility that diabetic subjects who used insulin had more severe or prolonged diabetes.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	122	We performed additional analyses using nondementia cognitive impairment as an outcome; these analyses yielded results similar to those for dementia.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	123	 There are inconsistent reports of an association between diabetes and cognitive impairment (21, 22, 55).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Subjects with cognitive deficits and no functional disability have been determined to be at higher risk of dementia (40).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Thus, the association between diabetes and cognitive impairment would be expected to be similar to that between diabetes and dementia.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	126	 The findings for nondementia cognitive impairment support the results of the main analyses.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	127	One explanation for our finding of a nonsignificant weak association between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease may be that a relation truly exists but this study lacked statistical power to detect it.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Our analysis using the composite outcome of Alzheimer's disease and nondementia cognitive impairment without stroke, showing a statistically significant association with diabetes as compared with the absence of diabetes (hazard ratio = 1.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	129	10), is consistent with this interpretation.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Another possible explanation for this nonsignificant finding is that misclassification error for diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or both may have diluted the relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Self-reported diabetes as used in this study almost certainly underestimated the true prevalence of diabetes; true prevalence has been reported to be twice the prevalence of self-reported disease when subjects with undiagnosed diabetes are considered (3).

0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	133	 It was a longitudinal study of nondemented elderly subjects in three ethnic groups that used standardized procedures for the diagnosis of dementia and its subtypes in a prospective fashion.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	134	 The main limitations of the study were a lack of data on duration of diabetes, severity of diabetes, and the presence of undiagnosed diabetes.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The multivariate models assumed a lifetime duration of exposure, which could have resulted in error in the measurement of exposures such as diabetes, lipid levels, and hypertension.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	136	 However, as we noted above, this did not appreciably affect the hazard ratios for diabetes in relation to Alzheimer's disease and stroke-associated dementia.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	137	The findings of this study support those of previous longitudinal studies that reported a weak association between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease and a strong association between diabetes and stroke-associated dementia, and they extend these observations to minority population groups.

0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	4	More than 100 studies have been carried out on survival with dementia, and most have found an increased risk of dying among persons with dementia compared with those without.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	5	 However, data are often not obtained from community-based studies but from selected groups, that is, institutions or clinical settings, and cannot be applied to the general population.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Indeed, in a review of the literature, van Dijk et al.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	7	 (2) found that survival is conditioned by the reference population, with a lower survival for studies conducted in an institution than in community-based studies.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In addition, even among community-based studies, 2-year survival was found to vary from 37 percent to 86 percent, probably depending on study designs (2).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The majority of the studies conducted on community-based samples (3 to 11) have been based on prevalent cases, in which the onset of the disease is not known.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Onset of dementia is insidious and progressive and thus cannot be determined exactly.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Onset is often considered either as the time of the first symptoms of the disease or as the time of the first consultation.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, the earlier one sees the patient after the onset, the more precise the estimation of the onset will be; thus, onset will be estimated more precisely in incident than in prevalent cases.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	13	Few community-based studies have used incident cases of dementia (12 to 14), and dementia cases were actively screened in only one of them (14).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Active detection of dementia makes it possible to take into account cases undiagnosed by their practitioner, a scenario frequent in France (15).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In such a recent study in Sweden based on the Kungsholmen project (14), the risk of death among Alzheimer's disease cases was estimated to be 2.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	16	0 compared with that of nondemented persons.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	17	 However, in the latter study, the onset of the disease was considered to be the time of diagnosis, and statistical analyses did not take into account the problem of interval censoring in cohort studies, where participants are not followed up continually but receive repeated cross-sectional screenings at time intervals.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This could bias the results, particularly because of a lack of accuracy in the determination of disease onset.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	19	The aim of this paper was to evaluate survival and risk factors of mortality with dementia and to quantify the impact of dementia on total mortality, using statistical models dealing with interval censoring, on a French prospective population-based cohort with active search for incident cases of dementia at each follow-up screening.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	20	Data collection Data were collected by means of a questionnaire administered at home by trained psychologists.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The initial interview included items about sociodemographic characteristics, objective and subjective physical health, functional assessment, depressive symptomatology, and a battery of neuropsychological tests, including an evaluation of global mental status, the Mini-Mental State Examination (17).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Physical health was evaluated by self-reported diseases or symptoms.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Treated diabetes, a history of heart disease, stroke, or hypertension, and dyspnea were considered.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	24	 A variable of comorbidity was created when participants reported history of at least one of these diseases or symptoms.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Functional status was evaluated using the activities of daily living scale excluding the item of maintaining continence (18).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Participants who needed help for at least one of the five activities were classified as "disabled.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	27	After the initial interview, participants were followed up with the same baseline procedure at 1, 3, 5, and 8 years in Gironde and at 3, 5, and 8 years in Dordogne.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	28	Data on vital status were collected throughout the follow-up.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Dates and causes of death were collected from death certificates, by way of the national registry of mortality statistics.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Causes of death were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (19): cancer (codes 140 to 208 and 230 to 239); cardiovascular diseases, excluding cerebrovascular diseases (codes 390 to 427 and 440 to 455); cerebrovascular disease (codes 430 to 438); and respiratory disease (codes 460 to 511).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	31	Diagnosis of dementia At baseline, intellectual functioning was examined through a series of psychometric tests that have been shown to be among the most sensitive for assessing cognitive decline in elderly persons.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Then, the psychologists systematically filled in a standardized questionnaire designed to obtain the A (memory impairment), B (impairment of at least one other cognitive function), and C (interference with social or professional life) criteria for dementia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R) (20).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In a second stage, participants who met these DSM-III-R criteria were seen by a senior neurologist, who confirmed and completed the DSM-III-R criteria for dementia and filled in the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for Alzheimer's disease (21) and the Hachinski score for vascular dementia (22) to document the dementia diagnosis and its etiology: probable or possible Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease with cerebrovascular disease, and other types of dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	34	 An informant was consulted by the neurologist when available.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	35	 All ancillary information was considered, including medical charts and brain imaging, if available.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Finally, a consensus meeting allowed us to definitely classify each case.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Comparable procedures of screening of dementia are usually used in other cohort studies (23).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Diagnosis of incident dementia cases followed the same procedure at each follow-up assessment as for the baseline screening, but in order to increase the screening sensitivity, another criterion was added to qualify for the neurologic examination.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Participants were selected for this stage if they met the A, B, and C DSM-III-R criteria for dementia or if they had lost three points or more on the Mini-Mental State Examination score.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	40	Statistical analysis Mortality with dementia was analyzed according to age, sex, and educational level.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Educational level was divided in two categories: at least primary school level as validated by a diploma (the Certificat d'Etudes Primaires (CEP)) versus no diploma (24).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Analyses were performed for dementia due to all causes and Alzheimer's disease.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	43	First, the impact of mortality with dementia on the general population was considered, comparing mortality among persons with incident dementia and those without and partitioning competing causes of death.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Then, we analyzed the mortality with dementia among persons with incident dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	45	 To quantify the impact of dementia on total mortality, we performed a Cox model with delayed entry, in which the time-scale is the age of the participants (25), taking the occurrence of dementia as a time-dependent variable and considering the age of onset of dementia to be at the middle of the interval between the last follow-up without dementia and the first follow-up with dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Relative risks of death from dementia and Alzheimer's disease were provided with 95 percent confidence intervals.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Relative risks for competing causes of death were provided.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Mortality among persons with incident dementia, from the onset of the clinical stage until death, was analyzed using a multistate approach (semi-Markov model).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	49	 We performed a statistical model dealing with interval censoring, which is a common problem in cohort studies.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Indeed, in the PAQUID study, participants are not followed up continuously but with cross-sectional screenings at discrete times.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Thus, the onset of the disease is not known exactly, and the only information available is that this onset occurred between two follow-up times.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	52	 We therefore used a semi-Markov model that includes two transitions.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The first transition represents the age-specific incidence rates of dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	54	 The second transition represents the mortality rates of persons with dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The model uses information from the incidence data of all people in the cohort.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The fact that the time of onset of dementia is not known is taken into account by a penalized likelihood approach (26).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Distribution of participants interviewed at each follow-up, according to diagnosis of dementia and sociodemographic characteristics, PAQUID* cohort, France, 1988 to 1998.

0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	61	 During the follow-up, 281 participants developed an incident dementia, including 189 with Alzheimer-type dementia, 70 with vascular or mixed dementia, and 22 other types of dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Persons with incident dementia included 183 (65.

0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	70	Impact of dementia on mortality The impact of dementia on total mortality was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model with delayed entry, adjusted for sex, educational level, index of comorbidity, and baseline dependency for the activities of daily living scale, by comparing participants with dementia and those without.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	71	 In the total population, the relative risk of dying after developing dementia was estimated to be 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	72	80 (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	73	 For Alzheimer's disease, this risk was 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	74	 However, there was a significant interaction between dementia and age (relative risk (RR) = 0.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	75	98), with a lower impact of dementia on mortality with increasing age.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The relative risk of dying with dementia was estimated to be 1.

0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Risks were similar for men and women.

0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The tendency was the same for Alzheimer's disease, with an increased risk for respiratory disease (RR = 2.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	85	17), but the risk for cerebrovascular disease did not reach significance (RR = 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	86	Survival with dementia and risk factors The median survival time from the onset of the disease was estimated to be 4.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	87	5 years among persons with incident dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Our model provides results at each age of dementia onset, so we chose to provide results for persons developing dementia at 75 and 85 years.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	89	 The median times of survival according to risk factors are summarized in table 2.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Whatever the age of onset of dementia, the median times of survival were higher among women than among men.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Among persons with Alzheimer's disease, there was a protective effect of female sex for the risk of dying, adjusted for educational level, comorbidity, and activities of daily living scale dependency at the time of diagnosis (RR = 0.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	92	 The tendency was the same for dementia from all causes, although the relative risk did not reach statistical significance (RR = 0.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Median times of survival for persons with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, according to sex and educational level, PAQUID* cohort, France, 1988 to 1998.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	94	  For both dementia and Alzheimer's disease, the median survival time was shorter for participants with the CEP than for those without when dementia began at 75 years, but no difference in survival was observed according to CEP at 85 years (table 2).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Educational level did not significantly influence survival among persons with dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The relative risk of dying for participants without the CEP was estimated to be 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Adjustment for sex, comorbidity, and activities of daily living scale dependency at the time of diagnosis did not modify these relative risks, with 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	98	Although the effect of both sex and educational level seemed to differ according to the age of dementia onset, no significant interaction was found either between age and sex (RR = 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	99	10) or between age and CEP (RR = 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	100	Studying mortality with dementia in the general population raises special difficulties.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	101	 First, one needs to conduct the study in the community, because dementia diagnosed in a hospital or in a nursing home setting is not representative of cases in the general population.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Second, dementia should be actively screened, because it is widely underdiagnosed in the population (15, 27).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Third, it is necessary to use incident cases of dementia, for whom the disease onset is better known.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Finally, incident cases of dementia have to be followed up for a long time to observe death.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Because of these methodological difficulties, few previous studies have investigated mortality with dementia in the community, by using incident cases of dementia (12 to 14).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Even in these few studies, the onset of the disease was difficult to assess.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Indeed, unless participants are screened for dementia continuously, the onset of dementia is always imprecise, clearly because of an insidious onset, but also because of interval censoring between the last time when the participant was considered as dementia free and the first time he was diagnosed as having dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Thus, the onset has to be estimated, even for incident cases of dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	109	 With the PAQUID study, we had the opportunity to analyze actively screened incident cases of dementia who were prospectively followed up for several years.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	110	 In addition, we applied statistical models, taking into account the fact that the disease onset was not known precisely.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	111	Several methodological issues may have influenced our results.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Twenty percent of the participants in our cohort were never reevaluated; among them, a large part (55 percent) had died before the follow-up, and the others refused the follow-up examinations.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Participants who refused the follow-up examinations could be at higher risk of developing dementia; thus, nonresponse could lead to an underestimation of the incidence of dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	114	 However, this could bias the prognosis in the group of persons with dementia only if the mortality among persons with dementia who refused the follow-up differed from the mortality among persons with dementia who were evaluated, which is unlikely.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	115	Participants with a very short survival, for whom the onset of dementia occurred between two follow-ups and who died rapidly after this onset, cannot be diagnosed in our cohort and thus are not included in the survival analysis of persons with incident dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	116	 As in other studies, this could overestimate the survival time with dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	117	 However, only a specific illness-death model dealing with interval censoring and taking into account these cases of dementia with a very short survival could establish to what extent survival is overestimated.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Such a model should be developed.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	119	Another methodological problem is due to difficulties in the diagnosis of dementia in some subgroups of persons, particularly very old people, persons living in an institution, and illiterate, deaf, or depressive persons.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	120	 This can lead to either a false diagnosis of dementia or a delay of diagnosis among these persons, which could bias survival among persons with incident dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	121	To demonstrate the possible bias when the problem of interval censoring is not taken into account, our results (with the three-state approach) were compared with those using standard models, that is, Kaplan-Meier curves to describe survival among incident participants with dementia and Cox models with delayed entry to analyze the effect of sex and educational level on the risk of mortality among them.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	122	 For these standard models, the onset of dementia was considered to be the middle of the interval between the last follow-up without dementia and the first follow-up with it.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Although differences between the two models were slight, the median survival after developing dementia was about 2 months longer with standard models than with the three-state approach.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	124	 The larger the interval between the two follow-up evaluations, the greater this overestimation of survival.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	125	 In addition, using standard models tended to increase the effect of risk factors on the mortality among persons with dementia and also to slightly underestimate confidence intervals.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	126	 This was particularly visible for the effect of sex and led to erroneous significant factors.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	127	Impact of dementia on mortality The three-state approach used to describe mortality among persons with dementia, which takes into account the fact that the time of disease onset is not known, could not be applied to evaluate the impact of dementia on mortality among the general population.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Indeed, it cannot estimate a date of onset for each participant in our cohort.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	129	 However, although the estimation of the onset of dementia is of prime importance to describe survival in dementia because it can affect the time of survival by several years (depending on the number of years between the two follow-up evaluations), this estimation is less important in the evaluation of the impact of dementia on mortality, for which the age of the participant is the time scale of the model.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	130	The relative risks of dying in our study were estimated to be 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	131	7 for Alzheimer's disease, and these decreased with age.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	132	 These results are in agreement with but are slightly lower than those found in previous community-based studies, ranging from 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	133	1 for Alzheimer's disease and from 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	134	0 for dementia (4 to 7, 12 to 14, 28), and even higher (RR up to 9.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	135	6) among younger participants (11, 28).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	136	 This can be explained by inclusion of incident rather than prevalent cases of dementia in our study, and by the fact that we took into account morbidity when evaluating the risk of death.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	137	Two causes of death were particularly increased among persons with dementia: cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The increase in death by cerebrovascular diseases was essentially due to vascular dementia; however, even among persons with Alzheimer's disease, there was a trend to an increased risk of cerebrovascular diseases, which is concordant with the implication of vascular mechanisms in the Alzheimer pathology (29).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Death due to respiratory diseases, which has already been found to be an important cause of death among Alzheimer's persons (30, 31), was also increased in both persons with dementia and those with Alzheimer's disease, compared with those without dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	140	Survival among persons with dementia As in the general population, the median duration of survival among persons with dementia was most dependent on the sex and age of participants.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The median survival times observed in our study were longer than those reported in most previous studies of prevalent cases in the community (3, 5, 7, 10) and even in some studies of incident cases (14).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	142	 If incident cases are considered, this leads automatically to longer survival.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	143	 However, clinical studies or Alzheimer Center studies have reported median survival times as long as or longer than ours (32 to 34), up to 6-year survival.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Several explanations may account for this longer survival.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	145	 First, persons referred to clinical settings for their memory are probably more interested in their health than others and may have less medical comorbidity.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Second, the treatment and management of persons with dementia who present to clinical settings could increase their survival.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Finally, the mean age of patients in clinical settings is often lower than that in community-based studies.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	148	Effect of sex on survival The protective effect of female sex observed in our study, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, is concordant with the results of several studies done with different methodologies (7, 8, 14, 33, 35 to 37).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	149	 As in the general population, women with dementia are at lower risk of mortality than are men.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Although the interaction between age and sex for the risk of dying among persons with dementia was not significant, the effect of sex seemed to decrease with age, with a greater difference between women and men at 75 years than at 85 years.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	151	 These results are concordant with those observed in the Kungsholmen project, in which sex affected survival among persons with dementia but only under 85 years (14).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Factors that explain the longer survival among women in the general population could remain unchanged during the course of the disease.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Trials are currently in progress to test the hypothesis that estrogen replacement therapy could affect the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	154	 However, in the PAQUID study, very few women have taken such a therapy, and this cannot explain the longer survival of women with dementia in our sample.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	155	Effect of education on survival The effect of educational level on survival with dementia was low in our study and was observed only among participants who developed dementia at the youngest age.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Previous results concerning the relation between education and mortality among persons with dementia are controversial; some authors have found an increased risk of mortality associated with a high educational level (9, 38), whereas others have not replicated these findings (10) or even found the opposite (37).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The hypothesis of brain reserve capacity, according to which development of the cerebral lesions of Alzheimer's disease at the time of diagnosis is more advanced among more highly educated people than in others, has been proposed to explain the association between high educational level and increased risk of mortality (9, 39).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	158	 We also observed a tendency, although slight and nonsignificant, to a lower survival in persons with dementia who had the CEP but only among the youngest.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	159	 A possible bias of detecting dementia according to educational level cannot be excluded.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Indeed, participants with a low educational level have low premorbid cognitive performances and thus could be detected earlier than more highly educated participants.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	161	 However, this bias is probably reduced by taking into account not only the DSM-III-R criteria but also a loss on the Mini-Mental State Examination score in the screening procedure.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	162	Conclusion These data provide further evidence of the malignancy of dementia, which is a strong predictor of death, has a short survival time after disease onset, and has a high risk of dying associated with it.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	163	 In the future, data on survival with dementia will make it possible to evaluate whether the development of medical and social therapies for dementia leads to an increased survival in persons with this pathology.

0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	4	[alpha]2-Macroglobulin (A2M) is a proteinase inhibitor found in association with senile plaques (SP) in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	5	 A2M has been implicated biochemically in binding and degradation of the amyloid [beta] (A[beta]) protein which accumulates in SP.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We studied the relationship between Alzheimer's disease and a common A2M polymorphism, Val1000 (GTC)/Ile1000 (ATC), which occurs near the thiolester active site of the molecule.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In an initial exploratory data set (90 controls and 171 Alzheimer's disease) we noted an increased frequency of the G/G genotype from 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We therefore tested the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is over-represented in Alzheimer's disease in an additional independent data set: a group of 359 controls and 566 Alzheimer's disease patients.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In the hypothesis testing cohort, the G/G genotype increased from 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	10	12 in Alzheimer's disease (P  <  0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The odds ratio for Alzheimer's disease associated with the G/G genotype was 1.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	12	01) and in combination with APOE4 was 9.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The presence of the G allele was associated with an increase in A[beta] burden in a small series.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The A2M receptor, A2M-r/LRP, is a multifunctional receptor whose ligands include apolipoprotein E and the amyloid precursor protein.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These four proteins have each been genetically linked to Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that they may participate in a common disease pathway.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	16	[alpha]2-Macroglobulin (A2M) is a proteinase inhibitor which inhibits proteinases of all classes by a steric trapping mechanism.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The tetrameric A2M structure undergoes a conformational change upon cleavage of a peptide bond in the bait region by a proteinase and this conformational change traps the proteinase.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	18	 A2M has been implicated in several pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer's disease.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A2M immunostains senile plaques (SP) (1-3) and binds amyloid [beta] protein (A[beta]) 1-42 with high affinity (apparent Kd  <  1.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Moreover, recent data suggest that a serine proteinase-A2M complex can degrade A[beta] (5) and trypsin-activated A2M efficiently degrades A[beta] in vitro and prevents in vitro formation of thioflavin S-positive A[beta] fibrils as well as A[beta]-induced toxicity of cultured human cortical neuronal cells (6).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	21	After being activated, A2M is cleared by the A2M-r/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (A2M-r/LRP).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	22	 A2M-r/LRP is a multifunctional receptor and interestingly is also the primary neuronal apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptor (7,8).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	23	 LRP also binds and clears the Kunitz proteinase inhibitor containing isoforms of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (9).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Thus A2M potentially impacts both apoE and APP metabolism in the brain.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	25	Because of these biological links to Alzheimer's disease, we studied the possible association of a previously reported polymorphism in the A2M gene with Alzheimer's disease.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	26	 (10) screened 30 normal and 30 pulmonary disease patients for A2M polymorphisms at or near the active site and reported three A2M polymorphisms.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The most common occurred 25 amino acids downstream from the thiolester site, interchanging Val1000 (GTC) and Ile1000 (ATC) (10).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	28	 (Numbering is based on the cDNA sequence which includes a 24 amino acid signal peptide; this corresponds to Val/Ile976 in the mature protein.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	29	) Allele frequencies in their 60 probands were 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	30	 No difference in A2M serum levels was associated with the two alleles.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This polymorphism is especially interesting because it has the potential to be biologically relevant to the function of A2M as a proteinase inhibitor because it occurs near the thiolester active site of the molecule.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	32	Our initial exploratory experiment tested the possibility that the less common form of A2M (the `G' allele) would be associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Because of the potential for error due to multiple hypothesis testing, we planned to use the initial data set as an exploratory data set, with the intent to formulate specific hypotheses which would then be tested formally in a second independent data set.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	34	 We genotyped 90 non-Alzheimer's individuals who had either undergone screening tests with the Blessed dementia scale (11) or whose DNA had been isolated from autopsy material and were demonstrated to not have Alzheimer's disease and 171 individuals who either had a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or neuropathologically proven Alzheimer's disease (Table 1).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Genotypes were determined by PCR amplification of DNA and restriction enzyme digestion (Fig.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In our control series, the G allele frequency was 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	37	28 and six of 90 individuals contained the G/G genotype (0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In the Alzheimer's disease set, the G allele frequency was 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	39	 We noticed that the G/G genotype frequency was increased in the Alzheimer's group at 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	40	 These results suggest a possible influence of this A2M polymorphism as a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.

0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	45	To formally test the hypothesis that the G/G genotype of A2M is over-represented in Alzheimer's disease, we collected and genotyped additional independent groups of patients and controls.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Power analysis showed that >500 Alzheimer's disease and control individuals would be necessary to have an 80% chance of showing a difference between genotype frequencies of 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	47	 We therefore collected cases and controls from several sites in order to approximate this number of samples.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The second data set consisted of individuals who met the same criteria for Alzheimer's disease or control as the hypothesis generating set and were derived from sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients in Massachusetts, from three European centers and from probands of a multicenter US study of sib pairs and small families.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The results from the second data set supported the hypothesis, with G/G genotype frequencies of 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	50	12 in Alzheimer's disease (P  <  0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	51	05, Fisher's exact test) (Table 1).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The G allele was not over-represented in this data set (control = 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	53	 No difference in age of onset between G/G and non-G/G was found in the second data set.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Multivariate analysis showed that site of collection did not influence genotype frequencies.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	55	 We also compared the rate in controls to the subset of 387 clinic-based Alzheimer's disease cases (G/G frequency = 11.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	56	06) and the subset of 179 familial Alzheimer's disease samples (G/G frequency = 12.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	57	056) and found essentially equal over-representation of G/G in each.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	58	 These data support an association of the G/G genotype with Alzheimer's disease.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	59	We then carried out a series of exploratory analyses using pooled data from all individuals (737 Alzheimer's disease patients and 449 controls).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The G/G genotype was present in 11.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	61	9% of the Alzheimer patients and 7.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The genotype frequency in controls was consistent with a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Age of onset was not different between Alzheimer's disease patients with G/G (70.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	64	2, mean  plus or minus  SD) and non-G/G carriers (70.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	65	 A multivariate logistic model that controlled for the presence of the APOE4 allele and gender showed an odds ratio of 1.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	66	01) for the presence of A2M G/G genotype.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The presence of APOE4 in this model was associated with an odds ratio of 4.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The odds ratio of the combination of G/G and APOE4 is 9.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	69	001) relative to those with neither risk factor.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	70	 To explore whether the G/G-mediated risk was influenced by the presence or absence of APOE4, we stratified the sample by the presence or absence of APOE4.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Similar over-representations of the G/G genotype were seen in the strata with or without APOE4, suggesting that the effects of the two risk factors are independent.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Multivariate analysis for interaction between the G/G genotype and either APOE4 or gender demonstrated no interactions (P > 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Analysis based on the Mantel-Haenszel estimator suggested no heterogeneity of odds ratios between strata with and without APOE4 (P > 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	74	5), consistent with the absence of an interaction between A2M and APOE4 in our logistic regression model.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	75	We next turned our attention to possible biological effects of inheritance of the A2M G/G genotype.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Our previous studies of A2M immunohistochemistry in Alzheimer brain suggested that SP in different cases stained with varying intensity (3).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	77	 We explored the possibility that this variability was due to different genotypes by immunostaining eight Alzheimer's disease cases known to be G/G or A/A genotype.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	78	 In all instances, A2M immunoreactivity was present robustly on SP, astrocytes and neurons and no qualitative differences were observed between the genotype groups.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	79	We also explored what effect inheritance of the A2M G/G genotype had on the neuropathological phenotype of Alzheimer's disease (Table 2).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	80	 We have previously used stereological techniques and quantitative image analysis to measure the amount of A[beta] present (amyloid burden) in the neocortical association area surrounding the superior temporal sulcus and the number of neurofibrillary tangles present in the same region (12).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Thirty one of these previously analyzed Alzheimer's disease cases were A2M genotyped and selected for further analysis.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Initial inspection of the data suggested an increase in A[beta] in individuals who were A/G or G/G, with no difference between these two groups.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	83	 A statistically significant increase in A[beta] deposition was seen when comparing the G-containing cases with the non-G-containing cases (8.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The effect appears to be primarily due to the presence of at least one G allele, in that no difference between A/G and G/G genotypes was observed, although our sample size limits the power of this comparison.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	85	 There were no statistically significant differences in neurofibrillary tangle number with G alleles, suggesting a specific effect on A[beta] deposition.

0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	87	Exploratory studies of genetic risk factors run the risk of type I errors because of the large number of hypotheses that are either explicitly or implicitly being tested.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Alternatively, type II errors can occur if sample size is insufficient.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In order to overcome some of the difficulties inherent in exploratory studies of genetic risk factors we used independent data sets to first generate, then test the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Two separate control populations gave identical genotype frequencies; our hypothesis testing data set was itself made up of two groups (sporadic AD and probands from a multicenter study of Alzheimer's disease sib pairs and small families) each of which gave essentially identical genotype frequencies and over-representation of the G/G genotype.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The A2M G/G effect was not dependent on APOE genotype and the effect was additive and substantial: the odds ratio of G/G in the presence of an APOE4 allele showed an almost 10-fold increased risk.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Power analysis using the size of effect observed in our combined data set (using ~500 samples) suggests that a group size of 578 controls and 578 Alzheimer's disease patients would be necessary to have an [alpha] of 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	93	05 and a [beta] of 80% for the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is increased from 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	94	The association of the G/G A2M genotype as a risk factor in Alzheimer's disease leads to several interesting mechanistic interpretations.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Previous data have shown that A2M immunostains SP and have implicated A2M in amyloid precursor protein metabolism (13) as well as possible interactions with binding of A[beta] (4) and mediation of degradation of A[beta] (5,6).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	96	 A2M-A[beta] complexes undergo endocytosis via the A2M-r/LRP receptor (14).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	97	 A2M associates with A[beta] and prevents fibril formation (15).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In addition, A2M can be viewed as a (sub)acute phase reactive molecule and as a potent proteinase inhibitor which might participate in the inflammatory response in Alzheimer brain.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Interestingly, A2M has also been implicated as a trophic factor, possibly as a result of binding and transporting a number of polypeptide growth factors and cytokines (16).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Like apoE, A2M may serve as a binding protein for targeting various bioactive molecules to their site of action or clearing them (3).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Finally, the fact that apoE and APP, two other ligands of the A2M-r/LRP receptor are clearly involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, support the plausibility of the idea that an A2M polymorphism might contribute to risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In fact, a polymorphism in A2M-r/LRP itself has recently been reported in two studies to show a genetic association with Alzheimer's disease (17,18).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	103	Although there is a strong biological rationale for the involvement of an A2M polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease, the possibility remains that the genetic association we observe reflects linkage with another mutation or polymorphism either in the A2M gene itself or in a nearby gene on chromosome 12.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The A2M gene resides ~25 cM distal of the marker D12S1042, which yielded the maximal LOD score in a recent linkage study, suggesting that chromosome 12 contains an Alzheimer risk factor (19).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	105	 However, the likelihood that A2M itself is a risk factor is supported by the results of a recent separate study, in which we observed an association between an intronic (5[prime] splice site of exon 18) pentanucleotide deletion (allele 2) within the A2M gene and Alzheimer's disease in a sibship analysis of Alzheimer's disease sib pairs and small Alzheimer's disease families (20).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Our current results extend this observation by showing linkage of a missense mutation in a case-control sample rather than family-based association.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	107	 We are currently studying how the two A2M polymorphisms relate to one another; our preliminary results are consistent with the hypothesis that they act as independent risk factors.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Initial study of a group evaluated for both polymorphisms suggests that the G allele is inherited with the 1 allele; of 70 G chromosomes examined (35 G/G individuals), 97% were allele 1 and 3% were allele 2, compared with an allele 2 frequency of ~15% (P  <  0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	109	005, [chi]2 analysis with Yate's correction).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	110	Taken together, we believe that polymorphisms in the A2M gene may contribute to risk for Alzheimer's disease.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Moreover, these data focus attention on mechanisms of pathophysiology that impact on A2M-r/LRP or its ligands, including clearance mechanisms mediated by A2M-r/LRP (7,14), and suggest that other A2M-r/LRP ligands may be candidate Alzheimer's disease genes as well.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	112	An initial hypothesis generating data set was established from 171 Alzheimer's disease patients with a clinical history of probable Alzheimer's disease and 90 age-compatible control individuals, who were primarily spouses of the patients.

0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	3	In the amyloidogenic pathway, the amyloid- precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by the aspartic protease -secretase/BACE1 to yield the membrane-anchored C-terminal fragments C99 and C89.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	4	 C99 is then endoproteolyzed by the -secretase proteolytic complex to produce various A peptides.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The major cleavage takes place after Val-40 producing A40.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In an alternative nonamyloidogenic pathway, APP is endoproteolyzed within the A region by -secretase to generate the C-terminal fragment C83 and the soluble N-terminal fragment secreted APP.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Finally, a -secretase-mediated -cleavage of APP allows the intracellular release of the transcriptionally active APP intracellular domain (AID (3) or AICD) (4 to 6).

0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Together with the observation that resveratrol did not affect the levels of APP holoprotein and its C-terminal proteolytic fragments, these data indicate that resveratrol did not target an A-producing activity but rather promoted A clearance.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	132	Based on these observations, we aimed to determine whether resveratrol treatment promotes A degradation.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	133	 A peptides are degraded in vivo by at least four metalloendopeptidases, NEP, endothelin-converting enzyme-1 and -2 (ECE-1 and -2), and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) (17).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Recent evidence indicates that long term treatment with resveratrol promotes NEP activity in SK-N-SH cells (18).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Using thiorphan-sensitive enzymatic assays on intact HEK293 cells, we confirmed that NEP activity was significantly increased upon resveratrol treatment (Fig.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	136	 However, inhibition of NEP with phosphoramidon or thiorphan in APP695-HEK293 cells could not prevent the decrease of A levels triggered by resveratrol (Fig.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Because phosphoramidon also inhibits ECE-1 and -2, we concluded that these enzymatic activities were also not involved in the resveratrol-mediated decrease of A.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Further, pretreatment with insulin, which acts as a competitive inhibitor of IDE, did not rescue A levels during resveratrol treatment (Fig.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Thus, resveratrol did not promote A degradation by NEP, ECE-1 and -2, or IDE in HEK293 cells.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	140	Converging evidence indicates that resveratrol promotes the proteasomal degradation of a specific subset of proteins, including cyclin D1 (19), the estrogen receptor- (20), or the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (21).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Because the proteasome has been shown to modulate A levels (22), we asked whether proteasome inhibition rescues A levels upon resveratrol treatment.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	142	 5B shows that treatments with the selective proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin, Z-GPFL-CHO, or YU101, significantly prevented the resveratrol-induced decrease of A.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	143	 To confirm the involvement of the proteasome in the anti-amyloidogenic effect of resveratrol, we sought to down-regulate proteasome activity by siRNA-directed silencing.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	144	 The proteasome is a multicatalytic protease complex formed by different subunits encoded by several genes (23).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Because YU101 is highly selective for the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome (24) and because the subunit 5 is critical for this proteolytic activity (23), we asked whether siRNA-directed silencing of the proteasome subunit 5 prevents the resveratrol-induced decrease of A.

0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Because resveratrol effectively reduced A levels after 24 h of incubation, we also asked whether resveratrol modifies proteasome subunit transcription.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	160	 We found that resveratrol treatment does not markedly affect the steady-state levels of several proteasome subunits in HEK293 cells (Fig.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Together these results demonstrate that resveratrol promotes a proteasome-dependent intracellular degradation of A via a mechanism that does not increase total proteasome activity.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Consistent with this conclusion, levels of -catenin, a cytosolic protein degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (25), are not affected by resveratrol in HEK293 cells (Fig.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	163	We then investigated the anti-amyloidogenic effect of several resveratrol analogues.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Three analogues were tested: piceatannol (trans-3,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxystilbene), which contains an additional hydroxyl group at C-3, and two methoxy analogues, trimethoxy-resveratrol (trans-3,4',5-trimethoxystilbene) and TMS.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Interestingly, the three analogues were able to decrease A levels (Fig.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	166	 However, compared with resveratrol (Fig.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	167	 2A), piceatannol and trimethoxy-resveratrol were less potent, whereas TMS had a very comparable potency in reducing the amounts of A (Fig.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	168	Additional studies will be needed to fully elucidate the role of the proteasome in this mechanism of intracellular clearance of A.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	169	 A number of possible functions of the proteasome in the regulation of A metabolism have been ascribed to the multicatalytic complex (22).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The proteasome targets for degradation C99 and three core components of the -secretase complex, presenilins, APH-1, and Pen-2 (22), suggesting that proteasome activation may decrease A levels by reducing the amounts of C99 available and by altering -secretase activity.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Our data show no reduction of C99 levels (Fig.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	172	 3A, panel c) or alteration of the -secretase-mediated cleavages of APP or N-cadherin upon resveratrol treatment (Figs.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	173	 3 and 4), thus excluding the possibility that resveratrol lowers A by promoting the proteasomal degradation of C99 or any -secretase components.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Recent evidence also suggests that A can be degraded by a proteasome-dependent endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (26).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Using cell-free reconstitutions of ER-derived brain microsomes, Schmitz et al.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	176	 (26) show that A can translocate from the ER to the cytosol where it is directly degraded by the proteasome.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	177	 It is conceivable that resveratrol promotes such a clearance mechanism.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	178	 However, because ER A represents a small fraction of total A produced and because a small pool of A produced in the ER appears to be controlled by ER-associated degradation, it is unlikely that the severe reduction of A levels observed in the presence of resveratrol is entirely due to an increase of this clearance mechanism.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	179	 We therefore hypothesize that resveratrol may act indirectly by selectively stimulating the proteasomal degradation of yet to be identified critical regulators of A clearance.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	180	It will be also important to determine what the molecular targets of resveratrol are in the pathway of A clearance.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Resveratrol interacts with several proteins, including members of the sirtuin family.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Sirtuins are evolutionarily conserved deacetylases with important functions in longevity (27).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Resveratrol was found to act as a potent activator of the human sirtuin SIRT1 in vitro and of the yeast homologue Sir2 in vivo, a mechanism that may extend life span in yeast (28).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Moreover, resveratrol and SIRT1 activation have recently been linked to neuroprotective pathways in models of axonal degeneration (29) and of neuronal dysfunctions caused by mutant polyglutamines (30).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	185	 It would therefore be of interest to determine whether SIRT1 is involved in the resveratrol-induced decrease of A.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	186	Evidence is compelling that a decrease in proteasome activity occurs in AD brains (31, 32).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	187	 It is unclear, however, whether this decrease in proteasome activity is in parallel with an increase in A levels.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	188	 It has been proposed that A itself may lead to proteasome inhibition (33), suggesting that high levels of A in AD brain may create a vicious cycle by inhibiting the proteasome and blocking the degradation of critical regulators of its own clearance.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	189	 In this context, our data reveal an important mechanism of selective proteasome activation in the anti-amyloidogenic effect of resveratrol and support the therapeutic potential of this natural polyphenol.

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	7	Molecular epidemiologic studies have presented seemingly contradictory results concerning a potential role of CTSD polymorphism in Alzheimer s disease (6 to 19).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	8	 There is also controversy on whether this polymorphism may interact with the apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4), which is the best known genetic determinant for sporadic Alzhei-mer s disease (20).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Single studies may have been underpowered to detect interactions or even overall effects.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Given the amount of accumulated data, we deemed it important to perform a quantitative synthesis of the evidence using rigorous methods.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Thus, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of all available studies relating the CTSD polymorphism to the risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	12	Case-control studies were eligible if they had determined the distribution of CTSD genotypes in Alzheimer s disease cases (regardless of age of onset) and in a concurrent control group of dementia-free subjects using a molecular method for genotyping.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Cases with Alzheimer s disease were eligible regardless of whether they had a family history of Alzhei-mer s disease or not.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	14	 However, we excluded family-based studies of pedigrees with several affected cases per family, because their analysis is based on linkage considerations.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	15	Data extraction Two investigators independently extracted data and reached consensus on all items.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The following information was sought from each report: authors, journal and year of publication, country of origin, selection and characteristics of Alzheimer s disease cases and controls, demographics, ethnic group of the study population, eligible and genotyped cases and controls, and number of cases and controls for each CTSD genotype.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	17	 For studies including subjects of different ethnic groups, data were extracted separately for each ethnicity, whenever possible.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Furthermore, we examined whether matching had been used, whether there was specific mention of blinding of the personnel who performed the genotyping to the clinical status of the subjects, and whether the genotyping method had been validated.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	19	Meta-analysis The primary analysis compared Alzheimer s disease cases with controls for the contrast of T versus C alleles.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This analysis aims to detect overall differences.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	21	 We also examined the contrast of extremes (homozygotes), T/T versus C/C.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Finally, we examined the contrast of T/T versus (C/T + C/C) and the contrast of (C/T + T/T) versus C/C.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These contrasts correspond to the recessive and dominant effects, respectively, of the T allele.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	24	The odds ratio was used as the metric of choice.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	25	 For each genetic contrast, we estimated the between-study heterogeneity across all eligible comparisons using the chi-square-based Q statistic (36).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Heterogeneity was considered significant for p  <  0.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Data were combined using both fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) and random-effects (DerSimonian and Laird) models (37).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Random effects incorporate an estimate of the between-study variance and tend to provide wider confidence intervals, when the results of the constituent studies differ among themselves.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In the absence of between-study heterogeneity, the two methods provide identical results.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Random effects are more appropriate when heterogeneity is present (37).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	31	We also performed cumulative meta-analysis (38) and recursive cumulative meta-analysis (39, 40) to evaluate whether the summary odds ratio for the T versus C contrast changed over time as more data accumulated and whether the strength of the association changed when the first hypothesis-generating study was excluded from the calculations (41).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Inverted funnel plots and the Begg-Mazumdar publication bias diagnostic (nonparametric correlation coefficient) (42) evaluated whether the magnitude of the observed association was related to the variance of each study, that is, whether large studies gave different results compared with smaller ones (43).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Finally, we evaluated whether the summary results were different when the analysis was limited to studies with more intensive efforts to exclude Alzheimer s disease from controls (those that clearly performed neuropsychological testing for all controls).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	34	Previous investigations have alluded to the possibility that the T allele may interact with the APOE*4 allele in conferring susceptibility to Alzheimer s disease (7, 9).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Thus, we also evaluated the effect of T allele carriage on the risk of Alzheimer s disease separately for APOE*4-positive and APOE*4-negative subjects.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Moreover, we evaluated the genetic effect conferred by the presence of APOE*4 separately in subjects carrying the T allele and those not carrying the T allele.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Odds ratios were combined with fixed and random effects models, as described above.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	38	 When these data were not reported, we communicated with the primary investigators to obtain this information, whenever possible.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	39	Analyses were performed with SPSS 11.

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Whenever there were 0 values in a 2 x 2 table, we added 0.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	42	5 to all four cells, so that an odds ratio could be calculated.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Characteristics of studies included in the meta-analysis   Specific matching for age was described in five studies (10, 12 to 15).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	44	 One study also matched for sex (10).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Only one study (7) specifically mentioned blinding of the personnel who performed the genotyping.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Appropriate molecular methods for genotyping were used.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	47	 All studies used polymerase chain reaction, and two studies (14, 18) also used dynamic allele-specific hybridization.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	48	Meta-analysis database The eligible studies summarized in table 2 included a total of 3,175 cases with Alzheimer s disease and 3,334 controls, of whom 3,174 and 3,298, respectively, had genotype data.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The T allele was more highly represented among controls of American descent (overall prevalence of 8.

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Overall, the prevalence of T/T homozygosity was 0.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	59	2 percent in control subjects of American, European, and Asian descent, respectively.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The respective prevalence rates of C/T heterozygosity were 16.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	61	5 percent, and the respective rates for C/C homozygosity were 83.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The distribution of genotypes in control groups was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all studies.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Distribution of CTSD alleles among Alzheimer s disease cases and controls in the included studies   Overall effects There was a trend suggesting that the T allele may confer increased susceptibility to Alzheimer s disease (figure 1).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	64	 As shown in table 3, the summary odds ratio was 1.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	65	14), and there was significant heterogeneity among the 16 study comparisons (p  <  0.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	66	 We found no evidence of an association of the T/T genotype with the risk of Alzheimer s disease relative to the C/C genotype.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	67	 There was no significant between-study heterogeneity.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	68	 No evidence of an association with Alzhei-mer s disease was discerned also when the recessive model was examined for the effect of T, while a trend for an association was seen in the dominant model (by random effects, OR = 1.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	69	 There was no between-study heterogeneity in the recessive model contrast, while significant heterogeneity (p  <  0.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	70	05) was still seen for the dominant model contrast.

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	84	 There was no relation between the effect size and the variance of each study, suggesting that larger studies agreed with the results of smaller studies.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Analyses limited to studies with more intensive efforts to exclude Alzheimer s disease from controls yielded similar results (11 comparisons (10,382 alleles): OR = 1.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	86	Interaction with the APOE genotype Nine studies (7 to 9, 11 to 14, 16, 18) obtained data on both CTSD and APOE genotypes.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	87	 With one study (8) separating male and female subjects, 10 comparisons became available.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	88	These nine comparative studies tended to gave a slightly inflated effect for the T allele, as compared with the full meta-analysis of 14 comparisons (summary OR by random effects = 1.

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Among subjects not carrying the APOE*4 allele, the respective odds ratio was 1.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	93	 There was significant between-study heterogeneity in the APOE*4-positive group (p = 0.

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The two estimates overlapped widely in individual studies and overall, but typically the odds ratios were larger in the group of T allele carriers (figure 2).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	100	The meta-analysis findings may be interpreted against the postulated biologic context of the CTSD polymorphism.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Cathepsin D is an intracellular acid protease with beta-secretase activity in vitro (1, 2) that can cleave amyloid precursor protein and the tau protein to generate fragments with intact microtubule-binding domains (44), which might play a role in the pathogenesis of paired helical filaments.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	102	 One study has shown that the CTSD polymorphism is associated with increased secretion and altered intracellular maturation of procathepsin D (3).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	103	 It should be noted that it is not clear whether the CTSD polymorphism has functional consequences for the mature form of the enzyme.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Although we cannot exclude a biologic effect for the CTSD polymorphism, our findings are in accordance with the results of a recent full genome scan showing no significant linkage of Alzheimer s disease to the short arm of chromosome 11, the region where the CTSD gene is located (45 to 47).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	105	Attention should be given to the design of individual studies.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	106	 The results of meta-analyses may be affected by methodological problems and potential biases in the designs of the constituent studies.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Nondifferential misclassification errors may dilute the strength of an observed association.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Alzheimer s disease cases were generally selected according to appropriate criteria.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	109	 However, some young control subjects may have developed Alzheimer s disease at older ages.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The choice of an appropriate age window for assessing a postulated genetic risk factor for Alzheimer s disease is difficult.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Studies of younger subjects may be more suitable for identifying risk factors that result in early onset Alzhei-mer s disease.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Conversely, selection of younger subjects may be less appropriate, if the influence of the postulated genetic risk factor is more important in late-onset Alzhei-mer s disease.

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	116	 sporadic disease) or complex interactions with other genes may also need to be considered (48).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Our analyses addressed interactions with APOE*4, the major known genetic determinant of Alzhei-mer s disease.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Interactions with other genetic or environmental factors have not been studied.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	119	 The trend for a stronger effect of APOE*4 in the presence of T allele carriage is interesting in the light of data suggesting that T carriage may affect the general intelligence (5).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	120	 However, subgroup and interaction analyses should be interpreted cautiously, since differences between subgroups may occur by chance (49) and their validation would require studies with even larger sample sizes than the several thousand included in this meta-analysis.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Finally, population stratification may theoretically have affected the results of the constituent studies in the meta-analysis (50), since we documented that the frequency of the T allele varied considerably among the different ethnic groups or even among the different ethnic groups of European descent.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	122	 However, most studies were strictly ethnically defined, so the population stratification effect is unlikely to have been of any considerable magnitude.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	123	Because of the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer s disease worldwide, it is crucial to identify genetic risk factors for this neurodegenerative disease.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Thus, the list of identified polymorphisms that may influence the risk of Alzheimer s disease is continuously expanding (23, 29), but most of the reported associations of candidate genes to date remain nonreplicated or at least controversial after subsequent investigation.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Early and small genetic association studies may come up with spurious findings (41, 51, 52).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Even when genetic associations are replicated, usually they do not have a major public health impact that would lead to screening recommendations (53).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Nevertheless, such knowledge could improve our understanding about the pathogenesis of complex diseases such as Alzheimer s disease.

0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	10	Even though investigations using prospective designs should reveal a more defined picture of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer s disease, results obtained so far are not consistent.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The European Community Concerted Action on Epidemiology and Prevention of Dementia (EURODEM) group associated smoking with a higher risk of Alzheimer s disease (3), whereas other studies did not observe any significant relation between smoking and the onset of Alzheimer s disease (4 to 6).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The EURODEM group also found that female sex and low educational level were associated with increased risks of Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Conversely, sex and education were not reported as risk factors for incident Alzheimer s disease in other studies (7, 8).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Methodological differences, such as duration of follow-up, and selection and number of study participants may account for these discrepancies.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	15	The Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) is a large, national, multicenter, longitudinal study of dementia in elderly people focusing on its prevalence (1), incidence (9), and risk factors (10 to 12).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	16	 As part of the first phase (CSHA-1), a case-control study was conducted.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Age, family history of dementia, educational level, arthritis, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were significantly related to Alzheimer s disease (10).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	18	 We report here the results of a prospective analysis of risk factors for incident cases of late-onset Alzheimer s disease, which were based on risk factor data collected at CSHA-1 from those who were cognitively normal and on diagnosis of incident Alzheimer s disease 5 years later at CSHA-2.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	19	Initial assessment (CSHA-1) In 1991 to 1992, representative samples of men and women aged 65 years or older were drawn from 36 urban and surrounding rural areas; all 10 Canadian provinces were covered.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Of the 10,263 participants, 9,008 lived in the community while 1,255 resided in institutions and were excluded from this analysis.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Those in the community were interviewed about their health, presence of specific disorders, and limitations in performing basic and instrumental activities of daily living based on the Older Americans Resources and Services Activities of Daily Living scale (13).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	22	 All participants were screened for dementia by using the Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) Examination (14, 15).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Those who screened positive (a 3MS Examination score of below 78/100) and a random sample of those who screened negative (a score of 78 or above) were invited to participate in an extensive clinical evaluation, which followed a three-stage protocol.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	24	 A nurse first readministered the 3MS Examination and collected information on the participant s medical and family history.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Next, a physician conducted a standardized physical and neurologic examination.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Finally, for those participants deemed testable (a 3MS Examination score of 50 or above), a psychometrist administered a series of neuropsychological tests (16), which were interpreted later by a neuropsychologist.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	27	Independent preliminary diagnoses were made by the physician and neuropsychologist, which was followed by a case conference in which a consensus diagnosis was reached according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised, criteria for dementia (17); the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for Alzheimer s disease (18); and other specific criteria for cognitive impairment (19) and vascular dementia (20).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Diagnoses comprised the following categories: no cognitive impairment; cognitive impairment, no dementia; probable and possible Alzheimer s disease; vascular dementia; other specific dementia; and unclassifiable dementia.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	29	Detailed information about risk factors was gathered from a self-administered questionnaire completed at CSHA-1 by those participants found to be cognitively normal on the basis of either the screening test or clinical examination.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The risk factor questionnaire covered sociodemographic characteristics, occupational and environmental exposures, lifestyle (smoking, alcohol consumption, intake of selected food items, and regular exercise), and family and medical history (prior head injury with and without loss of consciousness, chronic diseases, and medication use).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Participants were asked whether they engaged in regular exercise (yes/no), but "regular" was not explicitly defined.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Regular consumption of beer, wine, and spirits was defined as at least once a week.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Regular consumption of tea and coffee was defined as nearly every day.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	34	Follow-up study (CSHA-2) In 1996 to 1997, all subjects who could be contacted and who agreed to participate in the second wave of the study were interviewed to measure changes in their health status and functioning an average of 5 years after CSHA-1.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Participants took part in the same diagnostic process as the one used at CSHA-1, including the screening test, the nurse evaluation, and the clinical evaluation.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Two diagnoses of dementia were made at a consensus conference, one according to the same criteria used at CSHA-1 and the other according to the more recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria (21) for Alzheimer s disease and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria for vascular dementia (22).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The more recent criteria were used to define cases for the current analysis.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Blood samples were collected, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) allele status was determined in a subsample of subjects examined clinically (23).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	39	For participants who died before the follow-up study was conducted, the date and cause of death were obtained from the relevant provincial Registrar of Vital Statistics, and a relative or other informant was interviewed to assess the subject s physical and cognitive status 3 months prior to death.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	40	 For subjects who died during follow-up, the probability of dementia was estimated from three different sources (9): 1) mention of dementia on death certificates; 2) information from proxies about a diagnosis of memory problems, Alzheimer s disease, or senile dementia prior to death; and 3) a logistic regression model, based on an analysis of 71 people who died within 2 to 5 months of a complete diagnostic evaluation, estimating the probability that the deceased person was demented prior to death.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	41	 These estimates were available for 1,022 decedents (87.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Because this procedure did not permit diagnosis of the type of dementia, decedents were omitted from the main analysis.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	43	 A secondary analysis was then conducted to assess the potential impact of omitting decedents; all deaths classified as due to dementia were included as Alzheimer s disease cases, and deaths not due to dementia were considered controls.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	44	Both phases of the CSHA were approved by the ethics review committees in all 18 participating study centers as well as at the coordinating center.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Participants or their proxies provided informed consent for each component of the study.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	46	 However, residents of the province of Newfoundland had to be omitted from the prospective analysis because a 1996 legal interpretation of the province s advance directives legislation prohibited the use of proxy consent for persons unable to give full, informed consent to participate in research studies.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	47	 This interpretation meant that people with dementia could not provide consent for the clinical examination (i.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	48	, the outcome measure could not be obtained).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Therefore, all Newfoundland participants were excluded.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	50	Analysis This analysis included only those participants living in the community as of CSHA-1.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	51	 A case-control analysis was conducted, with incident cases and controls selected at CSHA-2.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	52	 To be included, participants  initial screening results had to be negative or, at CSHA-1, participants had to be clinically diagnosed without 1) cognitive impairment, no dementia or 2) dementia.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Cases were diagnosed with probable or possible Alzheimer s disease at CSHA-2.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Comparisons were made with controls who, at CSHA-2, remained without cognitive impairment, no dementia or dementia according to the clinical evaluation or screening test at follow-up.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	55	Differences between cases and controls regarding means and proportions were compared by using the t test and the chi-square test, respectively.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios for the various risk factors.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Under the rare disease assumption, the odds ratio can be considered a valid estimate of the relative risk.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Age, sex, and education (age and education both as continuous variables with 1-year increments) were introduced into all multivariate models as potential confounders.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Modification of risk by age, sex, and APOE 4 allele (APOE4) status was examined by using interaction terms.

0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	64	 That is, the new criteria identified 116 incident cases of probable Alzheimer s disease compared with 107 cases when the old criteria were used and 78 cases of possible Alzheimer s disease compared with 74.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Results of analyses conducted by including only cases of probable Alzheimer s disease were consistent with the results presented here.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	66	Demographic characteristics of the subjects are summarized in table 2.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The distributions of age, sex, and education across cases and controls were significantly different.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The cases were older than the controls (median age and range at CSHA-2 screening: 87 years; range, 69 to 105 vs.

0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	71	 As expected, advanced age was strongly associated with higher risk of Alzheimer s disease after we controlled for sex and education.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	72	 When age was treated as a continuous variable, the risk of Alzheimer s disease increased by 23 percent (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 1.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The age- and sex-adjusted risk of Alzheimer s disease for those with the lowest level of education was almost twice that for more educated participants.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	74	 No association was observed between sex and risk of Alzheimer s disease.

0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Family history of Alzheimer s disease or senile dementia was not associated with late-onset Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Those participants who had at least one APOE4 allele had 3.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	78	28 times the risk of Alzheimer s disease compared with those who had two 3 alleles.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Of the antecedent or coexisting chronic conditions included in the risk factor questionnaire, only arthritis was significantly related to a reduced risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	80	 No statistically significant relation was observed between Alzheimer s disease risk and high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease, depression, head trauma, diabetes, thyroid condition, cancer (any type), or stomach ulcer.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Use of NSAIDs reduced the risk of Alzheimer s disease by 35 percent.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	82	 This effect was due mostly to nonsalicylates.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Inclusion of both NSAID use and arthritis along with age, sex, and education in the same model yielded similar odds ratio estimates; both factors remained protective for Alzheimer s disease, while testing of the interaction between NSAIDs and arthritis was not significant (p = 0.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	84	 No association of Alzheimer s disease with antihypertensive agents, antacids, corticosteroids, or estrogen therapy was found.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Association of selected risk factors with Alzheimer s disease, Canadian Study of Health and Aging, 1996 to 1997   Table 4 shows the age-, sex-, and education-adjusted risk estimates for Alzheimer s disease for some lifestyle-related variables.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Over the 5-year follow-up, smoking was not significantly associated with Alzheimer s disease risk.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Regular alcohol consumption was associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer s disease; more particularly, wine consumption reduced the risk by 50 percent.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Other variables observed to be significantly associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer s disease were daily coffee consumption and regular physical activity (31 percent reductions for both).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	89	 No association with tea drinking, antiperspirant use, or depression was noted.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	90	 For all reported risk factors, no evidence was found of modification of risk by age, sex, or APOE4 status.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Furthermore, no relation with the risk of Alzheimer s disease was observed for marital status; parental age at subject s birth; birth order; occupational history; exposure to inks, paints, solvents, rubbers, glues, pesticides, fumigants, radiation, or anesthetics; or family history of Down s syndrome, mental retardation, Parkinson s disease, or thyroid disease (data not shown).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Association of specific lifestyle variables with risk of Alzheimer s disease, Canadian Study of Health and Aging, 1996 to 1997   Table 5 presents estimates of the odds ratios for selected risk factors.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Decedents were excluded; in addition, all deaths classified as due to dementia were included as Alzheimer s disease cases, and deaths not due to dementia were included as controls.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The beneficial effect of regular physical activity remained strong and highly significant, whereas the associations with arthritis, NSAID use, wine consumption, and coffee consumption remained below 1.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	95	0 but were no longer statistically significant.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	96	We found that increasing age, low educational level, and the APOE4 allele were associated with increased risks of incident Alzheimer s disease, while arthritis, regular use of NSAIDs, wine consumption, coffee consumption, and regular physical activity were associated with reduced risks.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Of note, family history of dementia and smoking were not related to the risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In addition, estrogen was not shown to be protective.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	99	However, our results are subject to potential limitations.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	100	 First, of all eligible community subjects at baseline for whom a risk factor questionnaire was available, 1,172 (18.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	101	2 percent) died during the 5-year follow-up period and were not included in the main analyses.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	102	 This group of decedents included proportionately more men, was generally older, was less educated, and suffered more frequently from chronic diseases than did subjects who completed follow-up.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Exclusion of these participants may have distorted the results if, for example, these subjects were both more frequently exposed to a particular risk factor and at higher risk of developing Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Results from the simulation that included those subjects who died suggest that, although arthritis, NSAID use, wine consumption, and coffee consumption might be potentially valid protective factors for Alzheimer s disease, some bias due to exclusion of decedents during follow-up might also partially explain these associations.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	105	Another limitation of our analysis is the possibility of bias in assessing risk factor exposures.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	106	 In spite of the prospective nature of the study, our results could be explained, at least in part, by some preclinical cognitive decline (not yet detectable by screening and clinical evaluations at CSHA-1) among subjects who had developed Alzheimer s disease by CSHA-2.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Although it cannot be ruled out, this explanation seems improbable in view of the extensive screening and clinical evaluation process that was used at CSHA-1 to diagnose cognitive impairment, no dementia as well as dementia, along with the relatively long follow-up period.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Nevertheless, to test this possibility, results were reanalyzed by excluding cases whose symptoms of Alzheimer s disease were reported by their proxies to have started within 2 years after CSHA-1 (up to the end of 1993).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	109	 The persistence of a protective effect on Alzheimer s disease of NSAIDs (odds ratio (OR) = 0.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	110	99), and physical activity (OR = 0.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	111	94) does not support the hypothesis that a preclinical decline explains our results.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	112	Since multiple comparisons were performed, it is possible that some statistically significant associations may have occurred because of chance.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	113	 For new associations that were found, for example, the protective effect of coffee drinking, replication in other studies will be needed to determine the validity of the association.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Our results are generalizable to populations of largely European descent.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Inclusion of different ethnic groups living in Canada was determined by their ability to speak either English or French.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	116	Family history of dementia, similar to advancing age and the APOE4 allele, frequently has been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer s disease and is generally considered a definite risk factor (24).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The CSHA-1 case-control study found an increased risk of Alzheimer s disease that increased significantly by two- to threefold for family history of dementia (10).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	118	 However, as in the EURODEM pooled data set (3), the prospective analysis of CSHA data did not find this association.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	119	 These contradictory findings might reflect misclassification of the information because of recall bias and/or the uncertainty of information collected with the help of informants in retrospective investigations compared with longitudinal studies.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	120	 In a case-control study, Mayeux et al.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	121	 (25) observed that relatives of patients whose onset of Alzheimer s disease began at age 70 years or older did not have an increased risk of Alzheimer s disease, whereas there was an increased risk for first-degree relatives of patients whose onset occurred prior to age 70 years.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Thus, it would seem reasonable that we did not observe this association in our older cohort.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	123	 It may be surprising that family history of dementia was not associated with Alzheimer s disease while an increased risk of Alzheimer s disease was observed for subjects who had the APOE4 allele, since family history of dementia is believed to be a potential indicator of this genetic factor.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	124	 However, it has been suggested that the APOE4 allele does not explain a large part of family history of dementia (26).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	125	 In this study, 13 percent of those who had at least one APOE4 allele reported a parent with dementia compared with 10 percent of those who had no 4 allele.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	126	The association between low educational level and the risk of Alzheimer s disease is consistent with findings from several retrospective and prospective studies (3, 10, 27 to 29).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	127	 As in other large-scale population-based studies, CSHA cases were ascertained by means of a two-phase diagnostic procedure (screening and clinical examination).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	128	 The cutpoint for screening with the 3MS Examination was chosen to achieve high sensitivity, even though this cutpoint could have missed mild cases of Alzheimer s disease in people with higher levels of education who could still perform well on cognitive screening tests.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Whether the risk of Alzheimer s disease associated with less education corresponds to an artifact or represents a true risk factor is still unclear.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Explanations for the education effect include increased brain reserve (30), selection bias resulting from selective attrition or use of a two-phase diagnostic procedure (27, 31), and confounding by indicators of socioeconomic status linked to education, such as diet, lifestyle, and occupational history (32, 33).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	131	The present analysis supports the hypothesis of a negative association between NSAIDs and the risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	132	 This protective relation was also found in several population-based case-control studies, including the CSHA-1 analysis (34).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	133	 At least one longitudinal study supports the protective effect of anti-inflammatory drugs against Alzheimer s disease and dementia (35), while some studies remain inconclusive (36, 37).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	134	Regular wine consumption was also associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Results from the PAQUID Study, a longitudinal study of community residents, showed a similar negative relation between wine consumption and Alzheimer s disease (38).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	136	 This protective effect remained significant after more in-depth statistical analyses were conducted (39).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	137	 It has been suggested that specific substances in wine, but not in other alcoholic beverages, could be responsible for this positive effect on nerve cells in dementia (40).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	138	In our analysis, regular consumption of coffee seemed to be protective for Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Low coffee intake was reported to be related to mental disability after a 25-year follow-up of 716 Finnish men (41).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Without confirmation from other prospective studies of Alzheimer s disease, this finding may have been due to chance.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	141	The potential protective effect of regular physical activity on the risk of Alzheimer s disease is important because it represents a modifiable lifestyle habit.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Few epidemiologic studies have evaluated the possible protective role of regular physical activity on the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in the elderly, and results have been inconsistent (7, 42).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	143	 However, in clinical trials, exercise has been shown to benefit cognitive function (43, 44).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	144	 More recently, regular physical activity has been found to be protective against cognitive impairment as well as all types of dementia, including Alzheimer s disease, and an interaction with sex has been reported, suggesting greater protection in women than in men (45).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	145	In conclusion, this large-scale prospective study of older-age onset of Alzheimer s disease confirmed some of the most frequently suggested etiologic hypotheses about the disease, but not all.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Intriguing protective associations observed in our study warrant further research.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Few preventive strategies for Alzheimer s disease have been explored.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Regular physical activity could represent a novel and safe preventive strategy against Alzheimer s disease and many other conditions, and it should be examined further.

0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	2	Arshad et al (2001) raise important concerns that UK guidelines for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), 2001) may be counterproductive for patients with learning disabilities.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Potential for discrimination does not by any means stop here.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	4	 A particular difficulty they highlight is the central role of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) instrument in determining treatment  eligibility  and response.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Scores on the MMSE are strongly influenced by previous education and cross-cultural validity is poor.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The guidelines are, therefore, unhelpful for people with lower educational attainment or for growing numbers of older people from minority ethnic groups in the UK.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Comorbid cerebrovascular disease will also be more frequent in people from more disadvantaged backgrounds and, in particular, minority ethnic groups such as African Caribbean populations (Stewart et al, 1999).
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This reduces the likelihood of a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (and therefore eligibility for anti-cholinesterase treatment) according to standard diagnostic criteria (McKhann et al, 1984), despite growing evidence for overlapping pathological processes in dementia (Holmes et al, 1999).
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	9	For sub-populations who are under-represented in clinical trial samples (minority ethnic groups, people with lower educational attainment, people with learning disability, people with comorbid cerebrovascular disease), the best that can be hoped for is that a considerably weaker evidence base might emerge some years in the future.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	10	 By this time large numbers of people may have failed to receive potentially beneficial treatment.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The problem does not lie with treatment guidelines themselves but with how they are applied at the level of individuals and services   in particular regarding groups with Alzheimer's disease for whom a 26-year-old cognitive screen and/or 17-year-old diagnostic criteria are unhelpful.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Evidence-based medicine is a noble ideal.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, clinical practice that is restricted to the evidence base may amount to institutionalised discrimination.

0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	8	A mounting body of evidence supports the role of physical activity as a means to maintain cognitive performance.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Physical activity may preserve neuronal plasticity, increase synapses and dendritic receptors following injury, and release hormonal factors that may assist in neuronal creation and function (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, epinephrine) (4).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In addition, physical activity lowers cardiovascular risk, decreases blood pressure, and increases high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and glucose tolerance (5), each of which may be related to neuronal integrity and cognitive function (6, 7).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Finally, engaging in physical activity may indicate a more enriched social environment, which may decrease dementia risk (8).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	12	Several randomized trials have reported enhanced neurocognitive function following exercise training (9).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In addition, observational studies (10 to 13) have shown an inverse association between physical activity and cognitive decline among older adults.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	14	 However, an inverse association between physical activity and Alzheimer's disease has been found in some (10, 14 to 19), but not all (20 to 23), studies.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Diminished physical activity may also have different roles in the various forms of dementia.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	16	In this study, we examined the relation of physical activity to incident dementia and its subtypes, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, by using data from a large, community-based cohort of older adults.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	17	 We also assessed the possibility that the association of physical activity with dementia may be different for APOE 4 carriers versus noncarriers.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	18	The Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study (CHCS) (25 to 27), an ancillary study of the CHS, was started in 1992 when all CHS participants were invited to undergo cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to participate in cognitive testing.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The CHCS cohort consisted of 3,660 (66.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	20	8 percent participation rate (28)) persons for whom brain MRIs were available; 3,608 of these persons had both MRI and measures of cognition assessed at this time.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Compared with nonparticipants, CHCS participants were younger, more educated, and less likely to have cardiovascular disease (29).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The institutional review boards at each participating institution approved the research protocols for both the CHS and CHCS.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	23	 All participants provided written informed consent.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	24	Data collection Physical activity.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Information on physical activity was collected by trained interviewers at CHS baseline (1989 to 1990) and at CHCS baseline (1992 to 1994).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	26	 A modified Minnesota Leisure Time Activity Questionnaire (30, 31) asked participants about the frequency and duration of 15 different types of activities over the previous 2 weeks.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These activities were selected because they were previously shown to be the most common among older adults (32).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Included were walking, household chores, mowing, raking, gardening, hiking, jogging, biking, exercise cycling, dancing, aerobics, bowling, golfing, general exercise, and swimming.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	29	Activities were assigned metabolic equivalents (ml O2/minute: METs) according to intensity (30), and leisure-time energy expenditure (kilocalories/week) was estimated for each person.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Kilocalorie expenditure at CHS baseline and CHCS baseline were averaged to obtain an estimate of habitual physical activity levels in older adulthood used for the current analysis.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Only a single measure of physical activity was used for participants for whom values were missing at one of the testing periods (n = 416).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	32	To express the diversity of physical activity, an activity index was calculated as the number of different activities each subject participated in over the previous 2 weeks.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Raking and mowing were collapsed into a single category to represent "yard work," resulting in a potential range for the index of 0 to 14 activities.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The activity indices from CHS baseline and CHCS baseline were averaged to represent the activity index used in the present study.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Similar aggregate scores for physical activity have been used in previous studies of dementia risk (16 to 19).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Methods for APOE genotyping in CHS have been described elsewhere (29).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from whole-blood samples and was amplified by using polymerase chain reaction.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	38	 After cleaving and electrophoresis on agarose gels, restriction patterns were determined according to the methods of Hixson and Vernier (33).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	39	 APOE genotypes were grouped as APOE 4 carriers (2/4, 3/4, 4/4 genotypes) and noncarriers (2/2, 2/3, 3/3 genotypes).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Other measurements obtained during the CHCS baseline examination were also considered.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Sociodemographic variables included age, gender, educational level, and ethnicity.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Information on smoking, alcohol intake, and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy use was self-reported.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Prevalent cases of myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and congestive heart failure at baseline were ascertained by participant self-report of a physician's diagnosis.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Functional impairment was measured by using a modified version of the instrument for assessing basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living from the National Health Interview Survey (34).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Social network was assessed by using the Lubben Social Network Scale (35), and a series of questions asking participants about life satisfaction and personal relationships was summed to represent a measure of social support.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (36) was administered at CHCS baseline, and a more sensitive version of the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) Examination (37), was administered annually.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The 3MS assesses several domains of cognition in greater detail than the Mini-Mental State Examination does, with scores ranging from 0 to 100; higher scores reflect better performance.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	48	 If a person did not receive a clinical evaluation, attempts were made to evaluate cognition by using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (38).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	49	 For participants who died between examinations, further information was obtained by using the Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (39) and data concerning circumstances of death.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	50	Self-reported weight and height were also recorded at CHCS baseline.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Body mass index was calculated as weight (kilograms) per height (meters) squared.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Blood pressure was measured in a standardized manner by trained personnel after the participant had been seated for 5 minutes.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The average of two readings was calculated for analysis.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Hypertension was defined as a previous diagnosis of hypertension, taking hypertensive medication, or having a current systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were determined in fasting samples by using standard methods, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol was estimated by the Friedewald formula (40).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Persons were considered diabetic if they had a validated medical diagnosis of diabetes or a fasting glucose level of 126 mg/dl or higher.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	57	Cerebral MRIs conducted at CHCS baseline were scored for overall severity of white-matter lesions according to the scale developed by CHS researchers (41).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	58	 A white-matter-lesion severity score of  < 3 was considered within normal limits for this group of older adults, whereas a score of 3 was considered indicative of neurodegenerative changes.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	59	Diagnosis of dementia Dementia status and type in CHCS were classified in 1999 to 2000 by using a multistage process (25 to 27).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Initially, participants were classified at their local study site into a dementia risk stratum (high or low).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Persons were deemed high risk if they 1) had a 3MS score of  < 80 within the last two study visits, 2) had a decline of 5 points on the 3MS within their follow-up period, 3) had a Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status score of  < 28 or an Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly score of  > 3.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	62	6, 4) had an incident stroke, 5) had a diagnosis of dementia that was documented in medical records, or 6) resided in a nursing home during the study period.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	63	At the Pittsburgh site, all participants who were alive and could be traced were invited to the center in 1999 to 2000 for a full neuropsychiatric examination, regardless of dementia risk.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	64	 At the three remaining sites, high-risk participants (as described above), all minority participants, and participants for whom cognitive data were incomplete were invited for a comprehensive evaluation.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	65	 For those who did not attend the clinic visit, medical records and proxy or previous telephone interviews were used for diagnosis.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	66	 The diagnosis was based on a deficit in performance in two or more cognitive domains sufficiently severe to affect the subjects' activities of daily living for those with a history of normal intellectual function.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The dementia criteria were designed to identify subjects with syndromes that could include relatively preserved memory functions (e.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	68	, frontotemporal dementia), and thus memory deficit was not required for the diagnosis of dementia (26).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	69	All participants identified as having dementia were reviewed by the Adjudication Committee, made up of neurology and psychiatry experts.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was based on National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) (42) criteria, and the diagnosis of vascular dementia was based on Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centers criteria (43).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Time of dementia onset was established by the first diagnosis if recorded in medical records and otherwise as the midpoint between two annual CHS follow-up interviews with a marked change in cognition leading to the final dementia diagnosis.

0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	125	 The Religious Orders Study (23) and the Bronx Aging Study (21) also failed to identify a relation between activities that were physical per se and the risk of dementia but did report an association between cognitive activity and reduced dementia incidence.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Neither of these studies accounted for APOE genotype in the analysis, however.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Although we did not measure cognitive activities directly, physical activities often occur in conjunction with social and cognitive stimulation.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	128	Physical activity may protect against dementia risk through several mechanisms.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Experimental studies have demonstrated that physical exercise activity facilitates learning, increasing the expression of genes promoting neurogenesis and neural plasticity (4, 46).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Although several neural substrates may mediate exercise-induced effects on neuronal structure and integrity, research suggests a central role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (4, 46), and levels of this factor in the hippocampi are diminished in patients with Alzheimer's disease (47).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Nonneural vascular adaptations are also enhanced with exercise, including increased cerebral blood flow and substrate exchange (48), increased cerebral capillary density (49), and decreased accumulation of radical oxidative proteins (50).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	132	In addition, physical activity may be a surrogate for overall "life engagement" and greater social activity.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Persons with more developed social networks have a lower risk of all-cause mortality than persons who are socially isolated, and social supports attenuate the rate of cognitive decline in older adults (51).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Social networks may also promote overall health, particularly cardiovascular risk factors, and thereby may impact dementia risk.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Similarly, involvement in physical activities is associated with mastery and self-efficacy (52).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	136	 In turn, these attributes may motivate persons to be more attentive to health needs and health behaviors.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	137	 We adjusted for social network and social support in multivariate models, however, and the activity index continued to be associated with dementia risk.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	138	 If physical activity is operating through social mechanisms, it appears to be at a level not captured by these two measures of social functioning.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	139	Involvement in a number of different activities likely requires the organization and memory skills necessary to flexibly schedule, attend, and shift among activities.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Both organizational, or executive, and memory processes are regulated by neuroanatomical regions adversely affected by aging and dementing illnesses.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Exercising may help buffer or preserve cognitive reserves in the face of cognitive decline via continued use and corresponding cortical and synaptic stimulation of intact neurons (53).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In cross-sectional studies, variety of lifestyle activities has been positively associated with indices of cognition among nondemented older women, particularly in the domain of memory (M.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Carlson, The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, unpublished manuscript).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	144	Alternatively, physical activity may be an index of a healthier lifestyle resulting in less exposure to factors that affect cognitive function and precipitate dementia.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	145	 In the current study, engaging in a larger number of different activities was generally associated with a more favorable health profile and health behaviors.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	146	In previous studies (54 to 56), APOE 4 carriers did not attain the same benefit as noncarriers from physical activity in terms of blood pressure and lipid patterns.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Similarly, our findings suggest differing risk patterns between dementia and physical activity by APOE genotype, and they imply that any potential protective effect associated with physical activity is not enough to overcome the effect of APOE 4 alleles, or that physical activity and dementia are simply unrelated in persons with APOE 4 genotypes.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	148	 However, our findings contrast with a previous study in which an inverse association between physical activity and cognitive decline was observed predominantly in APOE 4 carriers (13).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	149	 It is difficult to know whether these findings extend to dementia; not all elderly persons who experience cognitive decline progress to clinical dementia.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	150	 We note, however, that the interaction between physical activity and APOE 4 in this study was based on only 28 cases of cognitive decline and was thus subject to considerable variability.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Replication of these findings in larger studies will be required to resolve this apparent discrepancy.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	152	The CHCS is one of the largest prospective studies of older adults with comprehensive information on subclinical and clinical cognitive functioning, dementia status, and cardiovascular factors.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	153	 In addition, physical activity was collected by using standardized methods (29), and the prospective design of CHCS enabled us to collect information on physical activity in advance of dementia diagnosis, therefore minimizing selection and recall biases.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	154	We did not update the information on physical activity over follow-up because preclinical symptoms may reduce activity levels, compromising the ability to establish temporality.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Although misclassification of exposure is possible, all participants in the present analysis were cognitively stable (3MS score  > 80) at the time that physical activity information was collected.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Furthermore, we were able to adjust for baseline 3MS cognitive scores in our analyses.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	157	 On the basis of these considerations, it is reasonable to suggest that misclassification of exposure would have been nondifferential and would have biased our results toward the null.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	158	Our findings are not without limitations.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	159	 We were able to assess physical activity levels during older adult life only, but it is unclear during what period of life physical activity is most relevant to preserving cognition and impacting dementia risk.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Our finding that number of activities has a stronger association with dementia risk than does kilocalorie expenditure may be an artifact of measurement.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Reliability of the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity Questionnaire may be lower at low-to-moderate levels of activity (57), levels at which most older adults participate.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	162	 It is therefore possible that number of activities may be a more sensitive indicator at these levels.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Furthermore, persons with established physical activity habits may be more precise in their recall than persons who exercise sporadically.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Similarly, recall of number of activities may be more reliable than specifics about exercise frequency and duration, both factors heavily weighted in calculating total energy expenditure.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	165	 In this sample, number of activities was significantly and positively correlated with total physical activity energy expenditure.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Understanding which components of physical activity reduce dementia risk deserves further attention.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	167	We must also consider the possibility that a reduction in the number of different physical activities is an early symptom of dementia.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	168	 We addressed this possibility by using several different approaches.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	169	 First, we excluded all persons with a 3MS score of less than 80 or with prevalent dementia at baseline.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	170	 However, it is possible that the 3MS is not sensitive enough to detect persons with subclinical dementing illness and that some of these persons were included in our study.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Second, we adjusted our analyses for baseline cognitive function, and the inverse association of number of physical activities with dementia risk persisted.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Third, we reran the analysis by excluding persons who developed incident dementia within the first year of the follow-up, and the results were essentially unchanged.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Furthermore, we used information on physical activity from two time points approximately 5 years apart to obtain a more stable estimate of regular physical activity in older adulthood prior to dementia onset.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Finally, we also evaluated the association of physical activity with dementia risk after excluding persons who had one or more difficulties in activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living; again, the results were similar.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	175	In summary, this study provides support for the hypothesis that engaging in a number of different physical activities protects against subsequent risk of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia over an average 5.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	176	4-year follow-up, although the potential benefits of exercise may be limited to APOE 4 noncarriers.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Physical activity is already recommended to enhance cardiovascular health and help maintain independence and quality of life in older adults (52).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Confirmation of these findings and substantiation of the biologic mechanism by which activity reduces dementia risk may provide an additional impetus for persons to remain or become active in a number of activities in later life.

0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We recorded study design, characteristics of exposure, definitions of cases and controls, prevalent or incident case ascertainment, total number of cases in the exposed group and total number of cases in the unexposed group, the measure of association (odds ratio, relative risk, or hazard ratio), the magnitude of the association with its corresponding 95 percent confidence interval, and the variables adjusted for in the analysis.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	9	 When separate results were reported within one study for both Alzheimer s disease and dementia, the results for dementia were recorded.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	10	 When varying levels of NSAID use were reported, we took the results for the largest group of NSAID users.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	11	Statistical analysis Results of cohort studies were typically expressed as relative risk or hazard ratio, while results of case-control studies were usually expressed as odds ratio.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	12	 A hazard ratio is the ratio of instantaneous probability of the outcome event (Alzheimer s disease, dementia, or cognitive decline) in the exposed group compared with that in the nonexposed group and can be considered a relative risk.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Because dementia is a rare event ( < 5 percent), odds ratios from case-control studies are also good estimates for the relative risk.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	14	 For simplicity, we refer to relative risk for all three types of measures of association.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The logarithm of the relative risk with its corresponding standard error, taken directly from the studies or calculated from the reported 95 percent confidence interval, provided the data points for the meta-analysis.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	16	 We used the DerSimonian and Laird (36) random effects model to compute pooled relative risks and to assess statistical heterogeneity.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	17	 We did not exclude outliers simply on the basis of the statistical test, because heterogeneity is expected in a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies, but we searched for the sources (i.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were carried out when appropriate.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	19	 We evaluated publication bias by means of visual inspection of funnel plots and formal statistical testing (37).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In a funnel plot, the relative risk of the study is displayed against the weight of the study, which is the inverse of the square of the standard error.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Funnel plots generally show a peak.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This is the point where the studies with smaller standard errors are found and usually represents the point of the approximate true effect.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Formal statistical assessment of funnel plot asymmetry was done with linear regression analysis, where the log odds ratio divided by its standard error was regressed against the inverse of the standard error (37).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Reported p values are from the intercept of the regression analysis, which provides a measure of asymmetry.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Case-control studies with incident dementia cases and cohort studies were classified as studies with incident cases.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Studies where cognition was the main outcome of interest among users and nonusers of NSAIDs were classified as studies with cognitive decline cases.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Description of studies on the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and risk of dementia   Table 2 presents the individual relative risks of all 25 retrieved studies.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We divided the reports into studies with prevalent cases, studies with incident cases, and studies with cognitive decline as the endpoint.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The funnel plot (figure 1) shows the relative risks of the 25 studies plotted against their weights.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	30	 A relative risk smaller than one indicates that use of NSAIDs is beneficial.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The pooled relative risks of these three groups of studies were 0.

0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Within these subgroups, heterogeneity was present in the studies with prevalent cases (p = 0.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	37	001) but not in the studies with incident cases (p = 0.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Statistical testing for heterogeneity of studies where cognitive decline was used as the endpoint gave a p value of 0.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Within the three subgroups, there was an indication for the presence of publication bias in the studies with prevalent cases (p = 0.

0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	44	  Furthermore, we analyzed the case-control studies with incident dementia cases and cohort studies separately.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The case-control studies with incident dementia cases gave a pooled relative risk of 0.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	46	96), while the cohort studies gave a pooled relative risk estimate of 0.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	47	Finally, the results of the randomized clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of an NSAID against placebo are presented in table 3.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	48	 All trials included patients with Alzheimer s disease or patients with probable Alzheimer s disease.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	49	 None of the trials showed a statistically significant reduction in cognitive decline.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	50	There are at least three forms of bias that could explain why the benefit from NSAIDs was larger in studies with prevalent cases than in studies with incident cases: recall bias, prescription bias, and publication bias.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	51	 First, subjects from studies with prevalent cases have impaired memory at the time of study, which makes data collection between cases and controls likely to be different, resulting in recall bias.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Second, prescription bias occurs more frequently in studies with prevalent cases because demented patients have a reduced perception of pain (38, 39), possibly leading to a reduced use of NSAIDs.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Moreover, because of the adverse effects of NSAIDs, physicians might be less inclined to prescribe NSAIDs to demented subjects.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Hence, in the studies with prevalent cases, the reduced intake of NSAIDs might be more the consequence of the dementia than the cause.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Third, it is apparent from the funnel plot that the studies with prevalent cases are more heterogeneous and more skewed to the left than the follow-up studies, resulting in larger pooled estimates of benefit of NSAID use in these studies.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	56	We found no difference in relative risk between the case-control studies with incident dementia cases and cohort studies, although the potential for recall bias in case-control studies is theoretically higher.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	57	 However, a total number of 10 studies to investigate the presence of recall bias is rather small.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Therefore, the interpretation of the absence of a significant difference between the two types of design with incident dementia cases should be interpreted with caution.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	59	There were 10 studies with incident cases of dementia.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Within these 10 studies, there were four case-control studies with incident dementia cases and six cohort studies.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Both types of study gave a similar pooled estimate of relative risk.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	62	 If recall bias was a major form of bias, the relative risk of the case-control studies should have been smaller.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	63	 However, because of the wide confidence intervals around both estimates (because of the small number of studies), it is difficult to ascertain whether the studies truly had equal estimates.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	64	There was a significant association between NSAID use and studies with incident cases of dementia, while there was no significant association in studies where cognitive decline was used as the outcome.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Prescription bias might also be the cause of this difference.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Incident subjects with cognitive decline will be relatively free from cognitive dysfunction at baseline, while incident cases with dementia are in a relatively later stage of the disease.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	67	 In the earlier stages of the disease, prescription bias might not be present.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	68	 To explore whether prescription bias is the cause of the observed association between NSAID use and Alzheimer s disease or whether there is a true beneficial effect, we decided upon randomized clinical trials whose patients were without early signs of Alzheimer s disease (40).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	69	If the period between NSAID use and disease onset is relatively short, then it is difficult to differentiate between cause and effect.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	70	 With a short period between exposure and outcome, reduced intake of NSAIDs among subjects with dementia could also be the consequence of the disease.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Four studies (14, 16, 20, 26) tried to avoid this bias by evaluating the use of acetaminophen, to control for differing patterns of drug use between demented and nondemented subjects.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Many authors argued that, because the demented and nondemented subjects did not differ in their acetaminophen use but did vary in their NSAID use, NSAIDs must be associated with better cognitive function.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	73	 We think, however, that, in demented patients who might report less pain than nondemented subjects, NSAIDs are the first drugs to be prescribed less frequently.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	74	 This means that studies with prevalent cases are more likely to suffer from prescription bias than studies with incident cases.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	75	Because Alzheimer s disease, the most common dementia, has an insidious onset, it is also important to know what the different studies used as the index date.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	76	 All studies with prevalent cases took the date of diagnosis of dementia, while three studies with incident dementia cases took the date of first symptoms of disease (17, 21, 24), and seven studies with incident dementia cases used the date of diagnosis of dementia.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The three studies where the date of onset of symptoms was used had similar relative risk estimates as the seven studies where the date of diagnosis was used.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	78	Some publications used in this meta-analysis originate from one cohort.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	79	 For example, the Canadian Study of Health and Aging and the Rotterdam Study both contributed two publications.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	80	 However, in both cases, one publication addressed the association in the prevalent dementia cases and the other publication addressed the association in the incident dementia cases.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Hence, we decided to include both articles in our analyses.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Moreover, the study named Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly consists of four cohorts.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	83	 In our analyses, we used estimates reported from the separate cohorts.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The study reported by Saag et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	85	 (27) uses data from the Iowa cohort, while Hanlon et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	86	 (28) use data from the Duke cohort.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The study reported by Rozzini et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	88	 (5) uses data from the East Boston, Massachusetts, New Haven, Connecticut, and Iowa cohorts.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In discussing their results, Rozzini et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	90	 indicate that the study by Saag et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	91	 is "substantially different in measure of cognitive functioning and analytical approach, .
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	92	 making comparability between that study and our study problematic" (5, p.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Including the study by Rozzini et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	94	 in our analyses would have overweighted the data of the Iowa cohort in the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	95	 We could have chosen to include the study reported by Rozzini et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	96	 in our analyses instead of the study by Saag et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	97	 This would have resulted in a lower pooled relative risk.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	98	 However, including the study reported by Rozzini et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	99	 instead of the study by Saag et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	100	 does not affect our interpretation of the data.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	101	The five studies that used cognitive decline as the endpoint all used different cognitive measures.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Hence, we cannot exclude that NSAIDs might have a beneficial effect on a specific cognitive domain.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	103	 However, on average, the effect of use of NSAIDs on cognitive decline is null, which is consistent with the finding that most randomized trials so far have shown: no beneficial effect on the course of dementia as measured with the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer s Disease Assessment Scale.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Moreover, the two studies that were excluded from our meta-analysis (2, 3) because a relative risk could not be extracted both showed no association between use of NSAID and cognitive decline.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	105	A recent meta-analysis of NSAIDs and risk of dementia concluded, "NSAIDs offer some protection against the development of Alzheimer s disease" (41, p.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	106	 This conclusion was based mainly on the observation that short-term users ( < 1 month) had far less risk reduction than long-term users ( > 24 months) (relative risk = 0.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	107	 These authors did not address possible confounding factors (42), nor did they explain the discrepancy between the studies with prevalent cases and the studies with incident cases.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Again, the discrepancy in risk reduction between short-term and long-term users can well be explained by recall bias and prescription bias.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	109	 By including studies with cognitive decline as the endpoint and thereby creating more distance between exposure and effect, we now demonstrate that bias and confounding are more likely explanations for the observed association.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	110	Traditional teaching holds Alzheimer s disease and vascular dementia as two separate clinical entities that can be differentiated by careful clinical and necropsy evaluation.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Several recent observations, however, suggest that the situation might be different.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Vascular risk factors also contribute to Alzheimer s disease (43) and, conversely, ss-amyloid depositions are also frequently found in subjects with vascular dementia (44).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Hence, it is likely that Alzheimer s disease and vascular dementia are two extreme expressions of one disease entity, dementia (45).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	114	 A prominent feature of both disease entities is progressive cognitive decline.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Hence, combining and comparing the various endpoints in one analysis gives a good indication for the possible benefits of NSAIDs in the various stages of the disease.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	116	Until now, most randomized clinical trials have found no beneficial effect of NSAIDs in preventing cognitive decline (31 to 33).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	117	 There might be three explanations for these negative studies.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	118	 First, there is no protective effect of NSAIDs.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Second, most of these studies were carried out in subjects with early signs of cognitive impairment.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Administration of antiinflammatory drugs at that point in the disease process might simply be too late.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Third, it has recently been demonstrated that various NSAIDs have differential propensities on the inflammatory response and deposition of ss-amyloid (46).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	122	 This finding calls for identification of the critical pathways in the inflammatory response and the corresponding drugs that are capable of interfering in that pathway.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	123	In conclusion, the benefit of NSAIDs in preventing dementia or cognitive impairment was 50 percent in studies with prevalent dementia cases, declined to 20 percent in studies with incident dementia cases, and was absent in studies where cognitive decline was used as the endpoint.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	124	 This indicates that most of the beneficial effects of NSAIDs from observational studies are likely to be the result of recall bias, prescription bias, and publication bias.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Before further large and costly trials are designed to assess the potential protective effects of NSAIDS, the specific critical pathways in the inflammatory process in dementia amendable to drug intervention should be identified.

0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	4	Received October 30, 2002; Accepted December 16, 2002.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	5	The basis of the more common, late-onset form of AD is less well understood.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The genetic risk factor with the highest attributable risk for AD is the 4 allele of the APOE gene on chromosome 19q (1).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Among Caucasians, the odds of AD for 4 homozygotes and for 3/4 heterozygotes are 14.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	8	2, respectively, greater than that associated with 3 homozygotes (2).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Many other genes have been studied because of the possible role of their gene products in the disease, or because of their proximity to known AD loci.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The evidence implicating other susceptibility genes is much less compelling.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Associations have been reported for no fewer than 40 genes (3,4), yet none has been clearly established as an AD risk factor.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Linkage studies have implicated regions on chromosomes 9 (5), 10 (6 to 8), and 12 (9 to 11).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Candidate genes in these regions include insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) on chromosome 10 and 2-macroglobulin (A2M) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related gene (LRP1) on chromosome 12 (8,12,13), although none has been proven to be an AD gene (14 to 17).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	14	In this report, we examined the genetic basis of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) in a unique community.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In a population based study, we screened all residents ages 60 years and older (n=821) of Wadi Ara, an Arab community near Tel-Aviv in northern Israel and observed a prevalence higher than that found in Israel, China, Europe or the USA, even after adjustment for age, education and gender (18,19).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This unusually high prevalence is apparently not due to an increased frequency of the APOE 4 allele, which is actually reduced in this community (0.

0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Whereas no association was evident among markers within 5 cM of LRP1, six markers between 5 and 20 cM distal to LRP1 were associated with DAT in this population (Fig.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Allele 216 at D12S1686 was present in 44% of DAT cases but in only 27% of controls (P=0.

0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	54	Arguably, our strategy for the genome scan has a high false-negative rate because it failed to detect the DAT locus on chromosome 12.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Motivated by linkage findings from previous studies of outbred populations, we genotyped many closely spaced markers in the region adjacent and distal to LRP1 and observed significant association with DAT.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Careful inspection of the results from the genome scan revealed that two of the markers flanking the linked region (D12S83 at 76.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	57	7 cM) failed to show association in the genome scan or the follow up (Fig.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Unfortunately, the genotyping assay for the one marker in this interval (D12S326 at 81.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	59	6 cM) which yielded a very significant result in the follow-up analysis failed in the genome scan, thus accounting for the false-negative result for this locus.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The large number of alleles per locus (Table 3) may have further increased the false-negative rate.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	61	 These observations illustrate a potentially serious limitation of a 10 cM genome scan using few subjects.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Nonetheless, this strategy successfully detected the loci on chromosomes 2, 9 and 10.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Polymorphism characteristics among markers in the regions showing linkage   Results of this study attest to the utility of genetic isolates, including those from this region of the Middle East (23 to 25), for mapping genes responsible for disease susceptibility in outbred Caucasian populations.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Our strategy, evaluating linkage disequilibrium between microsatellite marker alleles and DAT, differs from traditional linkage approaches in genetic isolates in several respects.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	65	 First, we focused our efforts on regions identified by a genome scan including only 10 individuals.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Second, the DAT patients in the current cohort, all purportedly descendants from 14 founder matings, are members of distinct pedigrees.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Gene mapping designs which rely on linkage or family-based association approaches (23 to 25) are thus not suitable for our situation in which relationships between individuals in the sample are distant or unclear.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Third, although the efficacy of linkage disequilibrium mapping in isolated founder populations for recessive traits was demonstrated by Hastbacka and colleagues (26), the efficacy of this approach has not been proven for complex traits.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Notably, the allele-frequency-dependent homozygosity mapping method, which enabled the localization of a gene for recessive deafness in Bali using only 13 affected individuals (27), does not require evaluation of DNA from parents and is thus perhaps well suited to the Wadi Ara population, however, it is effectively limited to recessive traits.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	70	All four chromosomal regions implicated in this study have been reported previously suggesting that they may be authentic loci rather than chance findings.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The marker on chromosome 2 showing the most significant association with DAT (D2S305) is located about 6 to 10 cM from two markers showing linkage disequilibrium in the case to control sample from Finland (28).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The chromosome 9 location overlaps with peaks observed in two other studies with overlapping data sets (5,29) and the chromosome 10 location with several other studies (7,8,29,30).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	73	 While we detected evidence of association to chromosome 12 in this population, the precise region is 20 to 35 cM distal to the linkage peaks observed by others (9 to 11,22,31).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Thus, it is unclear if the region we identified on chromosome 12 is the same as that reported in other studies.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	75	Because multiple markers were tested on chromosomes 2, 9, 10 and 12, these findings were reconsidered after transforming the P-values for the most significant result at each location to LOD scores, Z.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	76	 According to guidelines for interpreting linkage results (32), the locations on chromosomes 9 and 12 are highly significant (Z=5.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	77	8, respectively) and the chromosome 10 locus is certainly suggestive for linkage (Z=2.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The most significant result on chromosome 2 (Z=1.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	79	5) falls just below the cutoff of 1.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	80	7 proposed for  suggestive linkage ; however, our finding would still be considered significant because it replicates a prior linkage finding (28).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	81	The identification of multiple loci in a genetic isolate was unexpected.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	82	 One or more of the loci might represent a false-positive result, although as discussed above all four loci correspond to approximate locations identified in studies of other populations.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	83	 A more likely explanation is the unfortunate aggregation of multiple susceptibility loci in a single community.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Such heterogeneity is consistent with the remarkably high prevalence of DAT in Wadi Ara (18).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Alternatively, the high prevalence of DAT can be explained by an oligogenic mode of transmission requiring coincident inheritance of susceptibility alleles at multiple loci.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Discrimination among these hypotheses will require simultaneous examination of marker haplotypes or, preferably, the actual susceptibility alleles from each locus in groups of affected and non-demented individuals.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	87	While Wadi Ara has one of the highest prevalence rates of DAT in the world (18), the very low frequency of the APOE 4 allele in both non-demented individuals (2.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	88	6%) indicates that the genetic basis of the disorder in this population is due entirely to other loci (20).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	89	 A low impact of APOE on AD risk has been reported in Yoruba living in Nigeria, but the baseline frequency of 4 is more than 20% and the incidence of AD is low (33,34).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In contrast, Pericak-Vance and colleagues observed only the APOE 3/3 genotype among AD cases in the Amish, an inbred religious sect (35).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	91	 However, the Amish have a lower prevalence of dementia than Wadi Ara and even most outbred Caucasian populations of European origin.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Non-genetic factors including diet, low levels of education and physical activity may also be partly responsible for the high prevalence of the disease in Wadi Ara (36).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	93	We were surprised by the high degree of marker polymorphism suggesting that there might be a greater degree of admixture with other populations than predicted (see Table 3).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Alternatively, the large number of alleles may be due to the relative instability of microsatellilte markers from generation to generation.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Interestingly, substantial marker polymorphism was also observed in a study of AD in 98 members from a genetic isolate in Finland (28).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	96	 In the Finnish study, global tests for allelic association were significant at the 0.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	97	05 level for 21 out of 366 markers tested genome-wide, but two-thirds of these regions were not confirmed by follow-up analysis with additional linked markers.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The very high proportion of marker heterozygosity, while perhaps enabling the detection of individual marker association, hindered meaningful haplotype analysis because without parental data to establish linkage phase the power for estimating haplotypes in this sample is poor, even with the assistance of maximum likelihood approaches (37).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	99	 A more efficacious strategy for assessing linkage disequilibrium over small intervals defined by haplotypes and, ultimately, for identifying candidate genes, is the evaluation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	100	The results of our study implicate several potential AD genes.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	101	 APOB and ADAM17 are located in the candidate region on chromosome 2.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	102	 APOB is the main apolipoprotein of chylomicrons and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and is important for lipid and cholesterol metabolism.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	103	 ADAM17 is a disintegrin-metalloprotease that is responsible for S2 cleavage of NOTCH1.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	104	 This cleavage makes NOTCH1 susceptible to cleavage by a gamma-secretase-like protease, leading to activation of the notch pathway (38).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	105	 This is analogous to the action of presenilins that also act through the notch pathway.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	106	 The peak on chromosome 10 between D10S1686 and D10S583 includes several genes previously associated with AD including cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) which encodes a membrane protein that synthesizes oxysterol regulators of lipid metabolism (39), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a neutral metalloproteinase and has been shown to degrade beta-amyloid (40), an important protein found in the plaques seen in AD, and urinary plasminogen activator (PLAU), a protease that converts plasminogen to plasmin and is elevated in AD patients (41).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	107	The observation of excess chromosome 9 marker homozygosity among DAT patients is consistent with recessive inheritance.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	108	 All of the known genes for familial early-onset AD (i.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	109	 APP, PS1 and PS2) are expressed in an autosomal dominant fashion, and the effect of APOE 4 the one bona fide gene for late-onset AD on AD risk is additive (2,42).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Although most genetic modeling studies based on data from outbred families have not found evidence for recessive inheritance (43 to 45), a recessive model was not rejected in an analysis of families lacking the APOE 4 allele (46).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Consanguineous populations provide a unique opportunity to discern recessively behaving genes for diseases manifesting in late life.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	112	A potential caveat of this study is the lack of neuropathological evidence for AD in any patient from this community.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Unfortunately, brain autopsy could not be performed because it violates religious customs.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	114	 It is therefore possible that subjects with other dementing illnesses, especially vascular dementia, may have been misclassified as DAT.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	115	 However, this concern is lessened by corroborating evidence from brain MRI scans performed on a portion of DAT patients (see Methods).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Diagnostic validity is also supported by the finding of linkage to three regions previously implicated as harboring AD loci.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	117	The identification of chromosomal segments showing association or linkage is only the first step toward discovery of genetic defects that increase susceptibility to AD.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Together with the large amount of gene information available, it is now feasible to systematically identify SNPs in each of the potential candidate genes and evaluate their association with AD.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Given the SNP map is considerably more dense than the microsatellite marker map, it is likely the candidate regions can be reduced significantly by haplotype analysis using small blocks of SNPs.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	120	DNA analysis DNA was extracted from whole blood according to procedures described previously (18).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Fluorescently labeled primers for the microsatellite markers used in this study were purchased from Applied Biosytem (ABI) and used in a 10  microl PCR reaction with 5 ng of genomic DNA.

0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	123	 The genotyper program (ABI) was used to determine allele sizes.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Laboratory technicians were blinded to subject identifying information associated with any sample ID number.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Each plate contained multiple control samples to ensure quality genotyping and allele determination.

0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Because the number of alleles and genotypes for these microsatellite markers far exceeded that expected for genetic isolate (as many as 19 alleles and 60 genotypes), the frequency distributions for all global tests were inspected visually to suggest one or two single-allele and collapsed-genotype group tests.

0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	2	For the past 40 years, research into Parkinson's disease (PD) has been predominantly the province of epidemiologists interested in pursuing the connection between the disease and environmental factors such as viral infection or neurotoxins.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Hereditary influences were actually discounted because of a high monozygotic twin discordance rate found in studies that were later shown to be inadequate and inconclusive.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	4	 There has recently been a resurgence of interest in investigating hereditary factors in PD when it became more and more apparent that a positive family history was a major risk factor for the disease.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Meanwhile, it also became increasingly apparent from neuropathological studies that the common, idiopathic form of Parkinson's disease had, in fact, a pathological correlate, i.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	6	, the existence of Lewy bodies, an eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion body, distributed diffusely throughout the substnatia nigra, hypothalamus, hippocampus, autonomic ganglia and olfactory tracts.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Although candidate gene approaches to linkage in PD families have not been rewarding, a genome wide scan mapped PD to 4q21-23 in one large family with PD with diffuse Lewy bodies, where a candidate gene, [alpha]-synuclein, resides.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This gene encodes a presynaptic protein of which a peptide fragment is known to be a constituent of Alzheimer's disease plaques.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The identification of a missense mutation in the [alpha]-synuclein gene in four independent PD families suggests that at least some fraction of familial PD with diffuse Lewy bodies is the result of an abnormal protein that interferes with normal protein degradation leading to the development of inclusions and ultimately neuronal cell death.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	10	 There may be common pathogenetic mechanisms involved in [alpha]-synuclein mutations in PD and [beta]-amyloid and presenilin gene mutations in Alzheimer's disease.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	11	Parkinson's disease (PD) was first described by James Parkinson in 1817 (1 ) and for 180 years the diagnosis has remained a primarily clinical one.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The disease is common with a prevalence of between 500 000-1 000 000 in the United States (2 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Life-time risk is 1 in 40, making PD the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease (AD) (2 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	14	 For well over 100 years, neurologists have been aware of a significant role for heredity in the development of PD but a number of factors have, until quite recently, hampered genetic research in PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	15	The first factor was a lack of agreement on precisely what constitutes `typical' PD and whether familial forms of the disease are the `real' PD or not.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This attitude is typified by one medical school professor who, during hospital rounds with a colleague of ours, asserted that a lack of family history was a diagnostic criterion for PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	17	 As a result, research into PD that emphasized familial forms of the disease was seen to be off the mark and not directed at real PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The idea that there was little or no genetic contribution to the etiology of PD was strengthened by a series of twin studies (3 -6 ) during the 1980s that failed to demonstrate increased concordance rates for PD in monozygotic versus dizygotic twins.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	19	A second reason that research efforts may have not emphasized the role of heredity in PD was the striking results of epidemiological studies linking PD to environmental agents such as viruses or neurotoxins.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Much of the research community's energies and efforts became focused on identifying the nature and effects of environmental agents thought to be responsible for causing the disease.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The 1918 influenza pandemic associated with encephalitis lethargica and, as a late sequela, post-encephalitic PD, pointed to viral infection as a major cause for PD (7 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The significance of this association seemed so strong at one point that one investigator suggested that PD would disappear by 1980 as a clinical entity as the survivors of the pandemic grew old and died (7 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Other strong support for an environmental cause for PD was the occurrence of irreversible symptoms and signs of PD occurring after the injection of illicit drug preparations contaminated with N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (8 ,9 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	24	 MPTP metabolites interfere with complex I of the electron transport chain, thus depleting cells of the products of oxidative phosphorylation and exposing the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra to irreversible damage from energy depletion and oxidative stress from free radicals (2 ,10 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	25	Although viral encephalitis or an environmental toxin such as MPTP is clearly capable of damaging the substantia nigra, the 1990s has seen a re-emergence of interest in the genetic causes for idiopathic PD, primarily through the efforts of neurologists such as R.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	26	 As a result, there is currently much more research investigating the role of heredity and gene-environment interactions in causing PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Rather than choosing between the false dichotomy of an exclusive environmental or genetic etiology, geneticists are attempting a synthesis of the epidemiological and genetic data by focusing on three areas of inquiry: (i) inherited and somatic mitochondrial genome abnormalities causing defects in energy metabolism; (ii) candidate gene linkage and association studies of genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes; (iii) whole genome scans to locate and identify the genes involved in families with highly penetrant, autosomal dominant PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Two excellent, relatively recent, reviews of the genetic aspects of Parkinson's disease have been published (11 ,12 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	29	As in many areas of genetics, definition of the phenotype is one of the most difficult and contentious obstacles facing the geneticist.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	30	 An accurate clinical diagnosis is crucial when trying to categorize patients and families for genetic studies in what is certainly a heterogeneous disorder with multiple etiologies.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	31	 It is generally accepted that the motor symptoms of PD, or parkinsonism, result from a deficiency or dysfunction of dopamine, or of the neurons producing dopamine, in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, regardless of etiology.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	32	 However, idiopathic PD, the most common form of the disease, has been difficult to approach for genetic study because the name can mean different things to different researchers.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	33	For the clinician, the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is based on finding at least two of the four primary motor signs of the disease: tremor, bradykinesia, muscular rigidity and postural instability.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Also frequently seen, but not considered primary diagnostic criteria, are dementia, defects in gastrointestinal motility, dysautonomia and responsiveness to l-DOPA therapy.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The disease is progressive and usually has an insidious onset in mid to late adulthood.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In one study (13 ) of 100 patients, only three-quarters of patients carrying a diagnosis of PD as determined by qualified neurologists actually had the disease confirmed by autopsy.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In this study, if clinical diagnostic criteria were made more stringent retrospectively, specificity rose to 93% but at the expense of a drop in sensitivity to 68%.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	38	For the neuropathologist, autopsy demonstration of diffuse Lewy body disease has come to be the hallmark of PD (14 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	39	 In diffuse Lewy body disease, the Lewy body, a characteristic intracellular cytoplasmic inclusion named at the beginning of the 20th century after its discoverer, is found in many regions of the brain, particularly in the neurons of the substantia nigra, in other nuclei in the brain stem, in the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, in the autonomic neurons of the esophagus and gastrointestinal tract and occasionally in the cortex (12 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Lewy bodies are very frequently found in the brains of patients dying with PD even though there can be extreme variation in the age of onset, severity and clinical manifestations of the PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	41	 In 100 patients carrying a diagnosis of PD who came to autopsy, the 24 patients who did not have Lewy bodies were found not to have PD and instead to have other causes for their clinical signs (15 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	42	 However, the presence of Lewy bodies per se is not uniquely pathognomic of PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	43	 A form of Alzheimer's disease, known as Lewy body variant AD, has been described in which a few Lewy bodies are found in brain cortex along with the pathognomic amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of AD (16 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Conversely, it is possible to have the motor dysfunction characteristic of PD, even on a familial basis, without the pathological process whose characteristic marker is the Lewy body (reviewed in 12 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Examples of hereditary parkinsonism syndromes without diffuse Lewy body disease include juvenile autosomal recessive parkinsonism mapping to chromosome 6q25-27 (17 ), the rapidly progressive autosomal dominant parkinsonism associated with dementia, dystonia and disinhibition, located on chromosome 17q21, and X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (18 -20 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	46	 These are well-defined but rare familial disorders that have the motor signs of parkinsonism in common with diffuse Lewy body PD but are certainly different diseases.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	47	 In the case of acquired parkinsonism due to MPTP toxicity, the typical Lewy body pathology of PD is not seen after acute MPTP exposure in humans nor in monkeys undergoing chronic MPTP administration although some atypical inclusions have been reported in the brains of these animals (21 -23 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Thus, over the past 10 years, neurologists have come to accept that the highly prevalent disorder, idiopathic PD, is a distinctive disorder usually occurring in middle to late adulthood with characteristic pathology of diffuse Lewy body disease and the classical motor and central nervous system manifestations of parkinsonism (14 ,24 ,25 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	49	 For the purposes of this review, we will concentrate on the genetics of this common form of the disease.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	50	Familial clustering of PD was observed a century ago (11 ,25 ) when 10-15% of PD patients were reported to have a positive family history.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Accurate measurement of the frequency of PD among relatives of affected patients is made very difficult by the inaccuracy of making a diagnosis of PD from history, the relative insensitivity and lack of specificity of the clinical exam, the variability in age of onset, and the rarity of autopsy data required for making the diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease in relatives reported to have PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	52	 During the 1980s, a genetic contribution to PD was thought highly unlikely when a series of twin studies failed to demonstrate an increased concordance for PD in monozygotic versus dizygotic twins (3 -6 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	53	 As has been pointed out, however, (26 ) these studies are not interpretable because the number of twins studied and the duration of observation to either support or reject a genetic contribution to PD are inadequate.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	54	 As nearly 80% of the function of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra must be lost before symptoms occur (27 ), reliance on clinical diagnosis alone and a lack of follow-up makes a determination of concordance extremely insensitive.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Further evidence that clinical evaluation to determine concordance in twin studies is far too insensitive comes from the use of positron emission tomography to measure 18fluorodopa uptake into basal ganglia (28 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Concordance rate among monozygotic twins increased when 18fluorodopa uptake into basal ganglia was used to diagnosis preclinical dysfunction of the substantia nigra (29 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	57	 As a result, the lack of increased concordance in twin studies can be essentially discounted as the result of inconclusive and insensitive methodology.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	58	More recently, a number of epidemiological studies (30 -36 ) with differing methodological approaches and study populations have been published and found to support a familial contribution to PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	59	 In case control studies, positive family history was found to be the single greatest risk factor for PD (25 ,30 -36 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	60	 In family studies, a family history positive for PD was found in 10-24% of patients, and the relative risk for PD in first degree relatives of PD patients ranged from 4 to 10.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	61	 In the largest of such studies, the frequency of PD was 2% in 1458 first degree relatives of 233 PD patients, a significantly higher frequency than the 1% seen in the 7834 first degree relatives of 1172 age-matched controls (30 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	62	In an attempt to integrate our current knowledge of the familial nature of PD, the possible role of defects in energy metabolism in causing the disease, and the toxicity of MPTP, research has proceeded on two parallel tracks: looking for mitochondrial genome abnormalities in PD and applying linkage and association methods to affected individuals using polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Modest deficiencies of complex I of the electron transport chain (reviewed in 2 ) have been reported in the substantia nigra (21 ), muscle (37 -39 ) and peripheral blood cells (39 ,40 ) of PD patients but whether these abnormalities are primary or secondary to the disease process is unknown.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The mitochondrial genome in aging brain can demonstrate striking departures from normal (41 ,42 ), but an analysis of the mitochondrial genome in the blood and brain of PD patients has failed to reveal a consistent hereditary or somatic deletion in PD patients as compared with age-matched control blood and brain samples (reviewed in 2 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	65	 A few small studies have suggested a significant association of certain mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms with PD but the sample sizes were small and replication is ongoing (42 ,43 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Thus, there appears to be some consistent abnormalities in oxidative phosphorylation, particularly of complex I, in PD but a direct causative role for inherited or acquired mutation of the mitochondrial genome remains unproved.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	67	In view of the possible involvement of neurotoxins in PD, research has also been directed towards identifying variation in certain drug metabolizing enzymes that might predispose certain individuals to greater toxicity from environmental agents.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Association studies in PD have focused on polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450IA1 (encoded by the CYPIA1 gene) and the debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase cytochrome P450 (encoded by the CYP2D6 gene), as well as the monoamine oxidase A and B enzymes (encoded by MAOA and MAOB).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Such association studies are always fraught with difficulties arising from unrecognized ascertainment bias and stratification.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Unfortunately, the nature of a late onset disease means that parental genotypes required to permit the use of the more dependable transmission disequilibrium test for association are usually not available (44 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Nonetheless, a number of studies have suggested significant association between PD and loci encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes and monoamine oxidase.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	72	 In Japan, an MspI restriction fragment length polymorphism in CYPI1A was found to be associated with a 2-fold higher risk for PD in heterozygotes and 6.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	73	5-fold higher in homozygotes (45 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Association studies with the CYP2D6 gene revealed a highly significant 4-fold increased risk among patients with disease onset before age 50 in a Spanish population although no such association was seen in United States and British samples (46 ,47 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	75	 A particular haplotype at the MAOA locus was found to be 3-fold more common among PD patients as compared to controls while another haplotype was 3-fold less common among the affected patients (48 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	76	 No such associations were found at the MAOB locus (48 ,49 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Thus, preliminary data support a modest association for certain alleles at these loci with PD but, as has been the history with many association studies, replication of these findings is difficult and requires larger, carefully controlled studies before they can be accepted as definite.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	78	In view of the association of the apolipoprotein E allele 4 with late-onset AD (50 ), it was clearly of interest to investigate whether a similar association exists between PD, either with or without dementia, and the apolipoprotein E4 allele.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	79	 At least two such studies have failed to show any such association (51 ,52 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Of note, one study did find a significant association between apoE4 and the Lewy body variant of AD, but not PD, further supporting the idea that the Lewy body variant of AD and PD are distinct disorders (16 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	81	A genetic contribution to PD has received substantial support from the identification of a number of families in which PD with diffuse Lewy body disease was inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (32 ,34 ,53 -58 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Penetrance appeared to be age-dependent, rising from 43% early in adulthood to 85% after age 70.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	83	 In one such family, from the town of Contursi near Salerno in Italy (56 ), linkage analysis has allowed the gene for PD with autopsy-proven diffuse Lewy body disease to be mapped to the long arm of chromosome 4 at 4q21-q23 (59 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	84	 No other positive mapping studies have been published to date, although essentially negative linkage studies have been reported with a variety of candidate genes in some pedigrees with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance of Lewy body positive PD (60 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Of note, anticipation was seen in some families with multiple generations affected with PD (57 ,58 ) but was ascribed primarily to ascertainment bias in other families (55 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The repeat expansion detection method failed to show evidence for an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Contursi PD kindred (61 ).

0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Arrows indicate a transition mutation A - >  G resulting in a missense mutation Ala - >  Thr at position 53 of the protein.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	90	In a particularly prescient paper published in 1996, Sommer and Rocca suggested that autosomal dominant PD might be caused by a missense mutation in a cellular protein that changes its physical-chemical properties leading to accumulation of the abnormal protein and neuronal death (62 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Their hypothesis has now received substantial support.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Linkage mapping of PD to 4q21-q23 in the Contursi pedigree suggested a number of candidate genes for PD that mapped to this region.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	93	 One of them, [alpha]-synuclein, was a particularly good candidate.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The protein is a neuron-specific presynaptic membrane protein (63 ) that was originally identified because it encodes a peptide named NACP, for non-A[beta] component of AD amyloid, isolated from plaques in AD (64 ,65 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Sequencing of the [alpha]-synuclein gene in affected individuals from the Contursi kindred (Fig.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	96	 1 ) revealed that affected members of the kindred were heterozygous for a missense mutation, alanine - >  threonine at position 53 of the protein, that segregated with PD in the family (66 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	97	 The same missense mutation was found in three additional unrelated PD families of Greek origin but was absent in 314 chromosomes from control European populations, including nearly 200 chromosomes obtained from random controls from the area near Contursi itself.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The evidence that this mutation causes PD is based entirely on finding the mutation in four unrelated families and finding it absent in a large set of controls.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Definitive proof requires elucidation of the mechanism by which this mutation causes the disease.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	100	Of note, nearly 30 different proteins have been identified immunologically in Lewy bodies in PD and Lewy body variant AD (67 ) including ubiquitin and the [beta]-amyloid precursor protein implicated in AD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	101	 To date, however, there is no published data indicating whether or not Lewy bodies contain peptides derived from [alpha]-synuclein.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	102	 It is interesting to note that NACP, a peptide fragment of [alpha]-synuclein, is an unusual protein in that it adopts an extended, non-globular conformation known as a `natively unfolded' random coil, in vitro.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Such random coil domains promote protein-protein interactions and make the protein amyloidogenic in vitro (68 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The discovery that [alpha]-synuclein, when mutated, predisposes with high probability to the development of PD in families with autosomal dominant disease suggests that a structural abnormality in this protein, either by changing conformation or altering normal proteolytic processing, may be the inciting event for protein aggregation leading to PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	105	 A similar pathogenic mechanism has been hypothesized for mutant cellular proteins, such as the presenilins and beta amyloid, in causing AD (69 ).

0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Under an additive model, borderline associations were found for rs1887922 with levels of FPG (P = 0.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	39	 We found no significant associations with rs2209972 in the family set, as might be expected due to weaker associations observed in the unrelated sample.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	40	To evaluate whether the particular polymorphisms in IDE accounted for the linkage previously reported (1 to 3), we adjusted the linkage model for the rs1887922 polymorphism.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	41	 No change in either peak height or peak position was found (results not shown), suggesting that another gene present in this region accounts for the linkage signal.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	42	We tested whether any of these common polymorphisms were associated with type 2 diabetes.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	43	 When all unrelated subjects were considered, the rs1887922 SNP revealed borderline association with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	44	 When sex-specific analyses of men were conducted (Table 5), a significant association with type 2 diabetes was seen (P = 0.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	45	We also analyzed traits using haplotypes based on SNPs rs2209972 (minor allele T) and rs1887922 (minor allele C) within the sample of unrelated men.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The statistical significance and directionality of association between traits and haplotypes is indicated by the Z-scores presented in Fig.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The TT haplotype is associated with lower trait levels while the CC haplotype is associated with higher levels.

0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	52	 A: Haplotypes were constructed using rs2207992 and rs1887922 and the association with traits (FPG, n = 822; mFPG, n = 876; HbA1c, n =626) determined empirically by permutation using Haplo.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Global and haplotype-specific P values are given for each test.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	54	 B: Regression coefficient estimates (ss for quantitative traits) and odds ratio estimates (for qualitative traits) measure the association of a particular haplotype with a trait (10).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Values were derived using inferred haplotype probabilities for each individual as predictors.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	56	 C: Haplotypes based on a four-locus model for HbA1c values (global P = 0.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The lower associations, observed when SNPs rs967878 and rs884526 were analyzed individually, can be explained by the presence of the major allele on haplotypes with both high and low trait values, thus diminishing the contrast with minor allele trait values.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	58	  Adding SNPs rs967878 (minor allele A) and rs884526 (minor allele T) did not improve the model, but revealed that the haplotype TATT (f30%) was associated with lowest trait values, while the haplotype CCGC (f16%) was associated with highest trait values (Fig.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	59	 2C), consistent with the two-locus analysis.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The lower associations observed when SNPs rs967878 and rs884526 were analyzed individually may be explained by the presence of the major allele on haplotypes that had both high and low trait values, thus diminishing contrasts with minor allele trait values (Fig.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Haplotype analysis was not performed in families due to the problems in obtaining estimated haplotypes in the presence of LD (11).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	62	We also tested the association of the two-locus haplotypes with type 2 diabetes.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The global model was not significant when the whole sample was tested.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	64	 In contrast, global models for sex-specific analyses of men were significant and indicated that the CC haplotype was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (P = 0.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	65	001, global-simulated P value for model = 0.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	66	 The odds ratio for type 2 diabetes of the CC haplotype relative to the TT haplotype was 1.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	67	To evaluate whether subjects with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes accounted for the sex-specific associations observed, men that met the criterion for impaired plasma glucose (IPG) were excluded from analysis.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Significant global associations with the rs1887922 SNP and glycemic trait levels were still seen in the subsidiary male dataset for FPG (P  <  0.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Similarly, the haplotype TT was associated with low trait values for HbA1c (P = 0.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	70	023) and the CC haplotype with high trait values of HbA1c (P = 0.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	71	 These results indicate a role for the IDE locus in normal glucose homeostasis.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	72	We thus present evidence for the association between polymorphic markers in the IDE gene on 10q23-q25 with levels of FPG, mFPG, HbA1c and type 2 diabetes.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The effect of rs1887922 and rs2209972 on trait levels of the individual SNPs is most pronounced in men.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	74	 This may be partly due to an increased number of men with IPG in the unrelated set as compared with women.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	75	 However, associations were still statistically significant following the exclusion of men with IPG from the analysis of men, suggesting that this is not the only explanation.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Male-specific susceptibility has been reported in two murine models of type 2 diabetes associated with obesity (12,13).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	77	 In one model, based on crosses of NON/lt and obese NZO/HI mice, a number of susceptibility genes that determine the threshold for type 2 diabetes have been mapped, none of which lie on the Y chromosome (12).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Android obesity has been previously described as a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes (14), although the associations reported here persist after adjustment for BMI.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	79	The TT haplotype, representing the minor allele of rs2209972 and the major allele of rs1887992, was associated with lowered trait values, suggesting that it encodes an IDE variant with reduced activity that increases the efficiency of insulin signaling.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Less insulin would therefore be needed to reduce blood glucose levels.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	81	 In contrast, the CC haplotype IDE variant may diminish insulin action, leading to higher trait values and type 2 diabetes.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	82	The associations with HbA1c and FPG map to the 3' region of IDE and are unlikely to involve the protease domain of the enzyme, which lies at the 5' end of the gene (5).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Similarly, mutations to IDE in the GK rat model of type 2 diabetes do not affect protease activity (4).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	84	 A number of alternative molecular mechanisms provide plausible explanations for delayed or diminished action of IDE.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	85	 For example, a change in the 3' untranslated region of IDE may affect the stability or the translation of the message, altering levels of IDE protein produced.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Alternatively, coding polymorphisms in the carboxyl terminal region of the protein may modify cellular localization, homodimerization (15), or interaction with protein partners.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	87	Other genes on 10q23-q25 appear to contribute to linkage of this region reported previously by others and us with glycemic traits (1 to 3), as the signal for FPG was not diminished by adjustment for the rs1887922 SNP.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Association studies may be more efficient than linkage studies in identifying genetic determinants of complex traits when allele frequency is relatively high and the effect small (16).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	89	 This finding is consistent with the associations we see here with the IDE CC haplotype (f16%), which is about twice as likely to be associated with type 2 diabetes as the TT haplotype.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Typing of additional SNPs will be necessary to identify other gene variants on 10q23 to 25 that affect glucose homeostasis.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	91	It has been proposed that typing one SNP per haplotype block will be sufficient for genome-wide association studies (17,18).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Here, we show that two SNPs rs1887922 and rs884526 on the same haplotype block vary in association with trait values due to the different haplotypes on which their minor allele is found.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Typing only one SNP per haplotype block may not be sufficient in all cases to reliably detect or exclude associations of candidate loci with complex diseases.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Trait measurements have been previously described (1).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	95	 For the sample of unrelated subjects, FPG, measured at exam cycle 5, was available for 1,640 Offspring participants.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The mFPG was the average FPG value for the 1,739 offspring who had three or more measures of FPG in the five exams that spanned 20 years.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	97	 HbA1c was determined for 1,311 individuals at exam 5.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In the family set, FPG was available for 837 individuals, mFPG for 951 individuals, and HbA1c for 528 individuals.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Diabetes status (type 2 diabetes) was defined as either on hypoglycemic medication or two FPG levels 7 mmol/l ( > 125 mg/dl) at any time during exams 1 to 6.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	100	8% of men in the unrelated sample and 11% of women were classified as diabetic subjects (Tables 1 and 2).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	101	 A less stringent criterion for IPG was defined as FPG 6.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	102	1 mmol/l ( > 110 mg/dl) or 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose 7.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	103	8 mmol/l ( > 140 mg/dl) or anyone being treated for type 2 diabetes.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	104	 A questionnaire was used to collect information on alcohol and cigarette consumption, hormone therapy, and physical activity index, which is calculated as a weighted average of hours spent at various activity levels (19).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	105	 SNPs were scored with a Sequenom MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (20).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Standardized residuals were calculated using linear regression models that incorporated age, age-squared, age-cubed, sex, smoking, physical activity, BMI, and alcohol consumption as covariates.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Separate regression models were used for men and women.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The residuals from the models were then ranked and normalized (1).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	109	 This transformation diminished slightly the significance of the results reported.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	110	 For the sample of unrelated subjects, associations between traits and genotypes for each SNP were evaluated using regression models.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Additionally, association with haplotypes was tested using Haplo.

0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Haplotype effects were estimated in a two-stage procedure.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	114	 First, individual haplotypes were inferred by the EM algorithm using snphap (D.

0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The global significance of the haplotype-phenotype associations were determined using empirical P values (1,000 permutations) obtained from Haplo.

0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Disease modification is now the goal.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	6	Aims To review current and developmental drugs for Alzheimer's disease, their usage, and the clinical context of known facts and proposed specific models.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	7	Method A brief evidence-based review was made, using literature where available, or evidence from consensus groups where it was absent.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	8	Results There is good evidence to support the use of cholinesterase inhibitors, and perhaps vitamin E.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Oestrogen and anti-inflammatory agents show possibility, but there is not enough evidence to support routine use.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	10	Conclusions Symptomatic treatments exist for Alzheimer's disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Observational studies and increasing knowledge of brain biology are leading towards further treatment options.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Old age psychiatrists have valuable treatments they now have to learn to use.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	13	The cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (Davies  and  Maloney, 1976) has led to the development of a number of strategies to enhance the failing cholinergic neurons and thus the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The most consistent therapeutic effect has been seen using inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which cleaves the transmitter in the cholinergic synapse.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Three such compounds have now been licensed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These have increased awareness of Alzheimer's disease, but unfortunately cost pressures have hindered their development in the UK, even though experienced users of donepezil and rivastigmine have found consistent results (Cameron et al, 2000; Evans et al, 2000; Matthews et al, 2000).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) were considered to be a stepping-stone to better disease-modifying compounds (Bullock, 1998).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Although they undoubtedly are, no other class of drug has yet reached the clinic, and AChEIs will remain the main treatment option for some time.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A variety of protocols for treatment (Harvey, 1999) have been superseded in the UK by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (2001) guidelines on the use of these three drugs.

0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	21	The AChEI class of drugs all affect the measured domains of dementia in much the same way.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The consistency of effect is evident from Fig.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	23	 1, which shows the cognition scores averaged from the pivotal trials of the three licensed compounds.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This is a symptomatic response lasting approximately 8 months, followed by a decline that remains significantly above that of the placebo group for longer periods.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	25	 This supports the preclinical cholinergic hypotheses (Davies  and  Maloney, 1976).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Exciting as this is, it is only symptomatic treatment at the end of a complex disease process   analogous to the use of levodopa in Parkinson's disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The AChEI class continues to present practical and scientific challenges that clinicians need to have resolved; meanwhile, different treatments continue in development.

0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This compares favourably with most drugs for chronic illness, and all AChEIs have low  numbers needed to treat  (NNTs) (Livingston  and  Katona, 2000).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Using the scores from published data, donepezil has an NNT of 4, rivastigmine 7 and galantamine 3.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The high placebo response is often questioned, but this is common in mental health studies, where it masks a large non-drug treatment effect.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Responders and non-responders are identified   but our criteria may be too harsh and the nature of a  response  needs more research and definition.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Currently no hard predictor of response or non-response has been identified (Schneider  and  Farlow, 1995).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The APOE4 allele was once suggested as a marker of poor response, but subsequent studies suggested no correlation.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	39	In the absence of valid biological markers for Alzheimer's disease, measuring the effect intervention may have on the disease itself requires all patients to be treated for a reasonable length of time   perhaps up to 6 months.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In reality, this depends on economics; so UK prescribers tend to work in subsets of mild to moderate dementia, excluding institutional patients with more advanced disease, and only prescribing to community-based patients who can have their medication supervised   as now ratified in the NICE guidelines.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	41	How? Various models of prescribing exist, all involving titration of the dose to minimise side-effects   particularly gastrointestinal ones.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Donepezil has the advantage of having only two dose steps, while rivastigmine and galantamine offer a wider range, making tailoring to individual patients perhaps more precise.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Whichever drug is chosen, the dose should be taken to the maximum tolerated (within the licence), after which at least 3 months of treatment should be given before considering whether there has been inadequate response.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Rigidity may mean that late responders miss out on potential benefit   but within a limited budget, it will allow more patients exposure to treatment.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	45	If one drug does not work or has intolerable side-effects, then another should be tried; although the three drugs belong to the same class, they are all different.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	46	 There is no published information on switching the drugs.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Convention when switching drugs is to leave an interval of five times the half-life of the first drug before commencing the second (that is, 60 hours for rivastigmine and 15 days for donepezil).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Consensus suggests that 3 days should be left after treatment with rivastigmine or galantamine, while a week should be left following donepezil treatment.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	49	 This is based on clinical practice   no controlled trial has been published.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	50	Which? The three drugs are similar yet have different individual characteristics (Table 1).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	51	 How clinically relevant the differences are is unproven but interesting hypotheses are arising out of them.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	52	View this table:    Table 1 Attributes of the three licensed acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  .
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	53	Donepezil Donepezil is very selective for acetylcholinesterase (AChE).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	54	 This selectivity is claimed to reduce its side-effect profile, but published clinical data have not shown increased tolerability.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Paradoxically, in Alzheimer's disease the level of AChE falls as the disease progresses (Arendt, 1992), matched by a rise in butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)   the function of which is unknown, but it forms part of the plaques and appears to come from the activated glial cells.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	56	 What BuChE inhibition means is unclear, but rivastigmine and galantamine inhibit it, donepezil does not   they may work differently in later disease, although no published evidence has supported this.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	57	Rivastigmine Rivastigmine preferentially inhibits one of the four AChE subtypes   G1, found particularly in the hypothalamus and cortex.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	58	 This subtype is implicated in plaque maturation, but whether there is any added clinical benefit to this specificity is again unproven.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	59	Galantamine Galantamine produces an effect on presynaptic nicotinic receptors called allosteric modulation (as does physostigmine and codeine).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This produces increased amounts of acetylcholine in the synapse by a direct effect on presynaptic release, but again, the clinical impact is unknown and published evidence as to its significance and desirability is required.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	61	 It may be that modulation, rather than agonism, protects against downregulation of post-synaptic receptors.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	62	 This may allow the drug to work longer, but further studies are needed to confirm this.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Modulation also improves attention, and this has been demonstrated with galantamine but not with donepezil or rivastigmine in Alzheimer's disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	64	When? The drugs are licensed for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Patients with mild disease already have significant illness and should receive treatment, even with minimal symptoms.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Treating mildly affected patients will mean smaller responses, and protocols should reflect this   long-term follow-up being needed to show any continuing effect beyond that expected from clinical trials.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Moderate disease covers a wide range of morbidity: in trials down to a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al, 1975) score of 10, but in NICE guidelines down to 12.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Patients scoring at the lower end of the range have a host of symptoms, and AChEIs here may be as valuable for their symptomatic effects on behaviour as for their effect on the underlying disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Trial data with metrifonate (another AChEI, which was withdrawn because of side-effects) showed improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease   especially in apathy, hallucinations and agitation (Cummings et al, 1998).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	70	 This effect is more noticeable in dementia with Lewy bodies where improvements in both MMSE scores and neuropsychiatric symptoms have been demonstrated with rivastigmine (McKeith et al, 2000).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	71	 This suggests that dementia should be treated at any time, with symptomatic delay and retention of qualify of life being the aim early in the disease, moving towards symptomatic relief as progression occurs.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	72	 No published results are available for severe dementia, though open-label follow-up from trials suggests that these drugs continue working as the cholinergic deficit increases.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	73	What? What about AChEIs in other dementias, plus other cholinergic therapies? Clinical trials are ongoing with AChEIs in vascular dementia and mixed dementia.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	74	 No result is available as yet, but as the cholinergic system is implicated in these disorders it is hoped that findings will be positive.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	75	 A study of rivastigmine in dementia with Lewy bodies has produced positive results (McKeith et al, 2000).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Acetylcholinesterases are being studied as a potential treatment in mild cognitive impairment   a rational assumption as 55% of patients with this problem go on to develop Alzheimer's disease, and intervention here may have a profound effect on the burden of disease overall.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	77	 No study of anticholinergic therapy in frontotemporal dementia is under way at present.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	78	Muscarinic agonists have been tried in Alzheimer's disease, but these drugs have a narrow therapeutic window before side-effects become intolerable, and to date no clinical trial has shown significant effects on cognition.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Nicotinic drugs are also still in early trial stages, with similar tolerability problems to overcome, but more promising efficacy data.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	80	Research into Alzheimer's disease has led to understanding of some of the pathological mechanisms involved.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Inflammation occurs, as evidenced by the inflammatory markers found   for example, complement attack complex at levels similar to those found in ischaemic heart disease (McGeer  and  McGeer, 1998).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Basic science coupled with the observation that sufferers from rheumatoid arthritis have a lower rate of Alzheimer's disease (Stewart et al, 1997) has led to trials of anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Trials with prednisolone have not been successful, but ongoing work with the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (especially Cox-2) in animal and now in human clinical trials may show benefit.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	84	 These drugs are not without long-term side-effects, so current practice is not to recommend their use routinely.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	85	Another observational study has shown that women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have a reduced rate of Alzheimer's disease (Robinson et al, 1994).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The protective effect of oestrogen on the nervous system and its vasculature is well-documented (Birge, 1997), so clinical trials are now in progress to test the efficacy of oestrogen therapy (17-oestradiol particularly).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Early treatment study results are not encouraging (Mulnard et al, 2000), so again, in the absence of published positive studies, HRT cannot be recommended for use as a treatment in Alzheimer's disease   although it does seem that its use is increasing in Alzheimer's disease prophylaxis, particularly in the USA.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	88	Antioxidants have shown benefit in several areas of chronic ill health, including Alzheimer's disease, after a study of selegiline and vitamin E and their effect on disease progression (Sano et al, 1997).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	89	 This showed a positive effect on the rate of increasing dependency and delayed institutionalisation.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	90	 However, this has yet to be replicated.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Vitamin E is inexpensive and relatively safe   the trial was high dosage (2000 IU).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Institutionalisation is expensive, so the return on this treatment is potentially high   but not rigorously proven.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Many clinics are now routinely suggesting the use of vitamin E to patients with Alzheimer's disease   usually at about 1000 IU.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	94	 It is possible that this may benefit other dementias and neurodegenerative disease as well.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	95	Nootropic drugs are available for prescription in Germany   the best-known being Gingko biloba extract, nicergoline and piracetam.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Precise modes of action are unclear, yet they do seem to produce an effect in some well-controlled studies.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	97	Glutamate is increasingly implicated in dementia pathogenesis, with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) blockade a putative therapy.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Memantine, an NMDA blocker, has had positive results reported in severe Alzheimer's disease (e.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Winblad  and  Poritis, 1999), leading to application for regulatory approval for its use in dementia.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	100	Nerve cell destruction seems secondary to activation of glial cells, so stabilisation of these glial cells may reduce the rate of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Several compounds such as propentofylline purportedly have this effect, especially in vitro, but to date have shown no therapeutic effect clinically.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	102	 It remains a potential area of research.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	103	The cortical cholinergic system is diffusely spread and a long way from its cell bodies.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	104	 It is therefore dependent on nerve growth factor (NGF) to sustain it, and a reduction in NGF may be associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Studies injecting NGF by cannulae into the cerebrospinal fluid showed some effect, but this is not a practical solution.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Attempts to formulate the active portion of NGF into an oral preparation that crosses the blood brain barrier are ongoing; meanwhile a xanthine derivative (leteprinim potassium) that seems to have a stimulating effect on NGF is about to start clinical trial.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	107	The pathological basis of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Most work has focused on the amyloid cascade that produces the plaques, and various drugs are in development to modify amyloid metabolism.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	109	 The most imminent clinical trial is the injection of beta-amyloid protein to  vaccinate  the individual and produce an antibody response that might remove amyloid from the nervous tissue.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	110	 In mice this procedure relieved symptoms in genetic Alzheimer's disease animal models (Schenk et al, 1999) and prevented plaque formation in younger mice.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	111	 This method is being tried in humans in both the UK and the USA, and represents the first true attempt at disease modification.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	112	The other classical pathological change is the development of tangles, made up of abnormal tau protein.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Tau pathology is known to exist in other neurodegenerative conditions and is an important area of research in treating other dementing diseases such as frontotemporal dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	114	 The hyperphosphorylation that occurs in Alzheimer's disease may be amenable to therapeutic intervention, and while there are some experimental models now to support this, no drugs are in clinical trials as yet.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	115	Basic science research is gradually unlocking some of the pathological sequences in dementia (especially in Alzheimer's disease) to provide theoretical treatment opportunities.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	116	 This began with the AChEIs and is now at the stage of amyloid modification.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	117	 For the first time therapeutic options exist in Alzheimer's disease and will soon be available in other dementias.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	118	 These may be as simple as using vitamin E, through to combinations of therapy to maximise benefit (Table 2).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Although these treatments are still predominantly symptomatic, they offer relief to patients and have increased clinicians' awareness of the condition.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	120	 This has taken old age psychiatry from its roots in social psychiatry to a point at which psychopharmacology has an important role.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	121	 The challenge now is to learn how to use these treatments most effectively.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	122	 This means that everyone in the speciality who uses these treatments has the opportunity to contribute to the debate, and the prospects of development over the next 10 years make this one of the most exciting and dynamic areas of medicine in which to work.

0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	125	CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Anticholinesterase therapy is a major contribution to the therapeutic treatment regimen in Alzheimer's disease   as now endorsed by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Psychopharmacology of Alzheimer's disease is now an important addition to the old age psychiatrist's skills   and professional development requirements.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Services will need to move towards the diagnosis of early, mild dementia rather than intervene at the moderate to severe stages.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	128	LIMITATIONS Funding of these new drugs may be hard to obtain, especially in areas where basic service needs are unmet and require attention first.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	129	 These are only symptomatic treatments   we now need drugs that change the course of the illness.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	130	 No single therapy is likely to be the solution to Alzheimer's disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	131	 We need to learn how best to use cholinesterase inhibitors, and then how to combine them with new drugs as they arrive.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	132	 It will be a while before this can be initiated at the level of primary care.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	133	The author thanks colleagues who have used these drugs to date for their participation in various consensus groups in order to fill in the gaps in this review where evidence remains weak.

0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	2	Background Patients with Alzheimer's disease show a wide variation in clinical phenotype.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Genetic research has been largely concerned with the role of mutations or common variants as risk factors for the disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Do genetic factors also influence clinical phenotype?.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	5	Aims To examine the evidence that genetic factors influence the clinical expression of the disease in addition to influencing risk.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	6	Method A selective review was made of the key literature.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	7	Results Mutations in three genes, coding for amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, and a common variation (4) in another gene, APOE, have been shown to lead to an earlier development of the disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	8	 More recently, genetic association and twin studies have suggested a role for genetic factors in the development of other aspects of clinical phenotype, notably the appearance of non-cognitive symptoms.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	9	Conclusions In Alzheimer's disease genetic variation influences a number of aspects of clinical phenotype.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	10	Early family and twin studies have indicated that a number of genes have an important part to play in the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Variation in these genes, including both rare mutations and common polymorphisms, appears to confer increased risk for the development of the disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, apparent increased risk may be largely explained by the effects that genetic variation has on the clinical phenotype of Alzheimer's disease, particularly the age at which the disease presents.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	13	 More recently, it has been proposed that genetic variation may also explain some of the other features of clinical phenotype, including the development of non-cognitive symptoms.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	14	The clearest evidence for a genetic contribution to the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease is the existence of families in whom the disease is transmitted in a clear autosomal dominant pattern.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Study of one of these large pedigrees revealed the transmission, from generation to generation, of a single point mutation in the gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP), found on chromosome 21 in family members developing early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Further studies of these families led to the discovery of other point mutations in the same gene and later the presence of mutations in two other genes, encoding presenilin-1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2 (PS-2), found on chromosomes 14 and 1, respectively.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	17	 To date, 12 Alzheimer's disease-related mutations have been discovered in the APP gene, 69 mutations in the PS-1 gene and 5 mutations in the PS-2 gene.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Significantly, research suggests that the different mutations in these three genes lead to a common result, an increase in ss-A4 peptide fragment of APP which forms the core of the neuritic plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	19	While these findings are of immense importance in terms of elucidating the biological pathogenesis of Alzheimer's diease, it is important to recognise that these three causal genes may only account for 30-50% of all autosomal dominant early-onset cases, or around 10% of familial early-onset cases (Cruts et al, 1998).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Thus, given that in the majority of cases ( >  95%) Alzheimer's disease occurs after the age of 60 years, it is clear that these genetic mutations make only a small contribution to the risk of developing the disease in general.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	21	The inheritance of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is more complex than that of the early-onset form.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In cross-sectional studies the presence of a positive family history of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is a consistent risk factor for subjects with the late-onset form, but a clear autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance is rare.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Both twin and family studies suggest a polygenic multifactorial mode of inheritance and as a consequence the elucidation of genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease requires different methods from those used in the early-onset disease, with its simple Mendelian patterns of inheritance.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Association studies have so far dominated the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Such studies look for variation in the frequency of an allele in samples of unrelated patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease compared with unrelated control subjects.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These studies have resulted in a number of candidate genes being proposed as having importance as risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and include associations with variation in genes encoding the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, PS-1 (an intronic mutation not associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease), butyrylcholinesterase, angiotensin-1 converting enzyme, 1-antichymotrypsin, the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex, 2-macroglobulin, the low-density lipoprotein-like receptor, the serotonin transporter and interleukin-1.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Typically, interest in these candidates has diminished as independent replication has not been forthcoming, and little evidence now remains for an important role for genetic variation in the VLDL receptor, PS-1 or 1-antichymotrypsin genes in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The other candidate genes still have their advocates and remain hotly disputed.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	29	More recently, the results of a number of linkage studies have become available.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The methods used for linkage studies in complex non-Mendelian diseases such as late-onset Alzheimer's disease are less powerful than those used for the early-onset form.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	31	 However, such studies can reveal areas of interest in the genome that might later be explored by association studies.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	32	 A complete genomic screen in a series of multiplex families affected with late-onset Alzheimer's disease has revealed five regions of interest on chromosomes 4, 6, 12, 19 and 20.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Excluding the effects of the APOE4 locus, the maximum log likelihood ratio (lod) score in this study occurred in a region located on the short arm of chromosome 12 (Pericak-Vance et al, 1997).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	34	 However, two subsequent studies following similar methods (Blacker et al, 1998; Wu et al, 1998) were unable to confirm linkage to this area.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A large sibpair study (Kehoe et al, 1999) has revealed many possible loci showing linkage to late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These include loci on chromosomes 1, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 19 (close to APOE) and 21 (close to the APP gene).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Currently, the main focus of attention is chromosome 10, with two independent studies showing evidence of a susceptibility locus in the same region (Ertekin-Taner et al, 2000; Myers et al, 2000).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, it is clear that a large number of loci are implicated and that there is some disagreement between studies in the predicted areas of interest.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	39	 These findings demonstrate some of the limitations of this approach, but also serve to emphasise the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Further exploration of these areas by association studies   the positional candidate approach   is likely to dominate the genetics of Alzheimer's disease in the future.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	41	Of the genetic risk factors that have been advocated as having a role in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, the least controversial remains the increased risk associated with possession of one or more copies of the APOE4 allele, coding for the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) variant 4.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Significantly, the importance of APOE4 was determined using a positional candidate gene approach.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Since this finding, other studies (Artiga et al, 1998; Bullido et al, 1998; Lambert et al, 1998) have also suggested an association between a number of polymorphisms within the transcriptional regulatory region of the APOE gene and late-onset Alzheimer's disease that is independent of ApoE 4 status.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Based on these data, it was suggested that there are two independent mechanisms by which risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease can be modified by the APOE gene: first, by variations in the coding regions, which alter the functional properties of APOE; and second, by the presence of promoter variants which result in quantitative differences in APOE expression (Artiga et al, 1998).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	45	 However, this hypothesis is controversial, and more recent studies (Helisalmi et al, 1999; Zurutuza et al, 2000) have failed to support the independence of APOE promoter variants in the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	46	GENETIC INFLUENCES ON CLINICAL PHENOTYPE.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	47	Age of onset Families carrying mutations in the APP gene have ages of onset largely within the range 40-65 years.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	48	 To date, no APP mutation carrier has been reported to be unaffected beyond the age of 67 years.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Families carrying mutations in the PS-1 gene have the earliest ages of onset, which fall largely within the range 35-55 years, although one such family member has recently been recorded with onset at 24 years (Wisniewski et al, 1998).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	50	 These mutations are largely associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, but at least two of these mutations (Ala79Val and His163Tyr) have been observed with late-onset Alzheimer's disease and may be non-penetrant (Cruts et al, 1998).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Families carrying mutations in the PS-2 gene have ages of onset largely within the range 40-70 years and thus show some overlap with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Penetrance is high but may not be 100%, with at least two reported cases of non-penetrance over the age of 80 years (Bird et al, 1996).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	53	The familial influence on age of onset in late-onset Alzheimer's disease may be substantial.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Thus, one study of affected sib pairs suggests that shared familial effects may account for 40% of the variance (Tunstall et al, 2000).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Indeed, studies have shown that in the late-onset disease the age of onset is approximately 6 years earlier in individuals who carry two copies of the APOE4 allele compared with non-carriers.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	56	 This has led to the suggestion that the APOE4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease mainly because in old age Alzheimer's disease and death are competing risks.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Any factor leading to an earlier age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in the elderly (and hence the development of the disease prior to death) will be associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Evidence confirming this hypothesis has come from a large study of approximately 5000 individuals (Meyer et al, 1998).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	59	 This study showed a clear decline in relative risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease in all subjects with increasing age but with a clear plateau beyond which no further new cases of the disease were reported.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The age at which this plateau was reached was earlier in carriers of the APOE4 allele.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Thus, it appears clear that the APOE4 allele has its predominant effect by determining when, but not if, an individual develops late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Meyer et al, 1998).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	62	Non-cognitive features If genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease are associated with non-cognitive symptoms, then one might anticipate that subjects with a family history of the disease have an increased frequency of these symptoms.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Likewise, one would expect an association between known genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, including the genes for APP, PS-1, PS-2 and the ApoE 4 allele, and these symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	64	In fact, there appears to be little consistent evidence of an association between either a positive family history of Alzheimer's disease or variation in known candidate genes and an increase in the frequency of non-cognitive symptoms occurring for the first time within the disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	65	 It thus seems unlikely that major genetic risk factors for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease have a substantial role to play in the development of non-cognitive symptoms within the late-onset disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	66	 However, this does not mean that these symptoms have no genetic basis, since genes may influence the phenotypic expression of the disease without being involved directly in its aetiology.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Indeed, early studies have shown evidence of an association between a positive family history of depressive illness and an increase in the frequency of depressive symptoms occurring for the first time within Alzheimer's disease (Pearlson et al, 1990).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	68	 These early findings are supported by a sib-pair study (Tunstall et al, 2000) showing that familial factors have a role in the development of depressive illness in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In addition, this small study also suggests a role for familial factors in a wide variety of non-cognitive symptoms, including agitation, aggression and psychosis.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	70	A more direct approach has also been adopted whereby common genetic polymorphisms previously showing associations with other neuropsychiatric conditions have been found to be associated with non-cognitive symptoms in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	71	 For example, one study (Holmes et al, 1998) of people with late-onset Alzheimer's disease found an association between common polymorphic variations in the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C serotonin receptor genes (102-T/C and Cys23Ser polymorphisms, respectively), previously implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder, with psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Associations were found between the presence of the C102 allele and the presence of visual and auditory hallucinations and between the presence of the Ser23 allele and visual hallucinations.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Another study (Sweet et al, 1998) has found evidence to suggest an association of psychosis and aggression in patients with Alzheimer's disease who carry common polymorphisms in the dopamine receptor genes DRD1 and DRD3.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	74	 These studies need to be replicated but they suggest that common receptor polymorphisms may have a role in the genesis of psychotic or other non-cognitive symptoms that are not implicated as genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	75	Cognitive decline No study to date has looked at rates of decline in carriers of APP, PS-1 and PS-2 mutations, but patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease who have a positive family history of Alzheimer's disease show no evidence of increased rates of decline.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The majority of studies have also failed to show any relationships between possession of the APOE4 allele and increased rates of decline.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This lack of association is interesting since it implies that genetic factors may determine only when the disease starts, not the rate of degeneration.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Clearly, caution is required when interpreting a negative finding and it may be that associations will always be difficult to establish because of the large number of confounding factors which may influence cognitive deterioration as well as difficulties with the use of psychometric scales over short periods.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Indeed, a study by Craft et al (1998) has suggested that there is an increased rate of cognitive decline in APOE4 carriers, which may be detectable by using a long follow-up period.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	80	Duration The mean duration of illness in families with PS-1 mutations is significantly shorter (range 5.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	81	8 years) than in families with both PS-2 (range 4.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	82	8 years) and APP mutations (range 9.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	83	0-16 years), reflecting the severity of PS-1-associated Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Studies of late-onset Alzheimer's disease suggest that the duration of illness tends to be longer in people who have a positive family history or in carriers of the APOE4 allele.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	85	 However, it has since been shown that this relationship no longer holds true once the confounding effects of age of onset have been taken into account.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Thus, in late-onset Alzheimer's disease, increased survival is more directly related to an earlier age of onset, which is influenced by a number of factors that are not exclusively genetic.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	87	Clinical Implications and Limitations.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	88	CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS A number of genes have been implicated as risk factors for the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Variation in some of these genes appears to have a major effect in determining when   not if   the disease will develop.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Other aspects of clinical phenotype, notably non-cognitive symptoms, are also influenced by genetic variation.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	91	LIMITATIONS A number of other risk genes have yet to be identified.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	92	 The influence of these unknown genes on clinical phenotype is as yet undetermined.

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	11	Linkage disequilibrium analysis within candidate genes represents the final common pathway for the identification of diabetes-susceptibility genes.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Candidate selection is typically based on positional information from linkage studies in humans and rodent models and/or a perceived match between the gene s function and the pathophysiology of the condition.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	13	Several independent lines of evidence suggest a role for the gene encoding the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE: LOCUSLINK reference 3416; EC reference 3.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	14	56) in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis, making this a promising candidate for analysis.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	15	 First, IDE maps to a region, on chromosome 10q, showing evidence for linkage to type 2 diabetes in several populations.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	16	 type 2 diabetic pedigrees, evidence for linkage (multipoint logarithm of odds [LOD] = 1.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	17	99) peaked near to D10S1765, only 4 Mb from IDE, and conditional analyses have suggested epistatic interaction with the well-replicated susceptibility locus on chromosome 1q (1).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Linkage to 10q has also been reported in Finns (2), North American Europeans (3), Mexican Americans (4), and French (5), though the latter two map 40 to 50 cM telomeric and may reflect a distinct locus.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	19	Second, the rat homolog of IDE is directly implicated in type 2 diabetes susceptibility.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In the GK rat model (6,7), a locus for poststimulation glycemia was mapped to a region of rat chromosome 1 syntenic with human 10q23-26 (8,9) and subsequently localized to a 1-cM region around Ide (10).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Two amino-acid substitutions in Ide were found in susceptible congenic strains, which, together, conferred postprandial hyperglycemia and reduced insulin degradation in isolated muscle cells, and other diabetes-related phenotypes (10).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	22	Third, the known and presumed functions of IDE are consistent with a role in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	23	 IDE, a 110 kDa Zn2+-regulated metalloproteinase, displays a wide expression profile including all insulin-responsive tissues.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Strong species conservation attests to important biological functions, and diverse cellular and metabolic roles have been proposed (11,12).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Although some of these remain controversial (13), IDE seems to play a major role in the breakdown of insulin in insulin-responsive tissues (14), thereby influencing the extent of the cellular response to insulin (11).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	26	 This association between IDE activity and insulin clearance and resistance is supported by in vitro and clinical studies (14 to 16).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Furthermore, the substrate specificity of IDE coincides with peptides capable of amyloid formation (including both amylin and insulin), indicating that IDE may prevent accumulation of amyloidogenic peptides (12).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Disruption of this scavenging function might thereby promote aggregation of the islet amyloid characteristic of type 2 diabetes and contribute to deficient ss-cell capacity.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	29	This congruence of positional and biological candicacy led us to evaluate the role of IDE variation in diabetes susceptibility in humans.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Mutation screening of all exons, adjacent intronic sequence, and 600 bp of 5' sequence in probands from 10q-linked pedigrees identified six confirmed variants (Table 1 and Fig.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	31	 For convenience, these are termed IDE single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9 in accordance with previous nomenclature (17).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	32	 We did not detect the uncommon IDE6 and IDE7 variants previously reported (17), and IDE1 and IDE10 mapped outside the sequence surveyed.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	33	 None of the variants appeared to have strong functional credentials based on sequence context.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	34	 A putative nonsynonymous exon 15 coding polymorphism reported in dbSNP (rs2229708) was not validated on sequencing or direct genotyping.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Analysis of 348 European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC) control samples confirmed extensive linkage disequilibrium across the gene (all pairwise D' values  > 0.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Six common haplotypes (HAP1 to HAP6) were identified, accounting for  > 97% of all chromosomes (Fig.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	37	 On the basis of allele frequencies (IDE5, IDE6, and IDE7: each  < 5%) and intermarker linkage disequilibrium patterns (IDE3 concordant with IDE1), SNPs 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, and 10 were selected for further genotyping.

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	45	  All SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all data sets, except for IDE4 (P = 0.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	46	04), in the Diabetes in Families Study (DIF) control sample only.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	47	 These samples were retyped with 100% concordance, and haplotype patterns provided no indication of mistyping (no novel haplotypes were generated).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	48	 These modest departures from equilibrium are likely, therefore, to reflect stochastic variation and are not exceptional given the number of tests performed.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	49	Allele and genotype frequencies for the Warren 2 proband (W2P) cases (n = 628) and control group (CON1) subjects (n = 604) are shown in Table 2 (see RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS for group characteristics).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The only nominally significant association detected was between W2P and CON1 samples at IDE2 (genotypes P = 0.

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	52	 There was no global difference in haplotype frequency distribution (Fig.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	53	 However, since HAP2 is defined by the C allele at IDE2, this haplotype was also more frequent in probands than CON1 control subjects (P = 0.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Males and females did not differ in SNP or haplotype frequencies, and no additional associations were uncovered by sex-stratified analyses.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	55	View this table:    TABLE 2 Genotype and allele frequencies at IDE haplotype-tag (ht) SNPs.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	56	  To determine whether associations might be more evident in families with apparent 10q linkage, we subdivided the W2P sample according to the family nonparametric linkage (NPL) score at the 10q locus.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Such linkage partitioning methods have been applied in several recent type 2 diabetes studies (18 to 21).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Here, we used linkage partitioning in a purely exploratory capacity, given uncertainties over the statistical properties of these methods when the evidence for linkage is not confirmed, as well as the possible consequences of partitioning bias when stratifying on proband genotype alone.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	59	 No difference was evident between "linked" and "unlinked" probands in IDE haplotype frequencies (P = 0.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The association previously seen at IDE2, between W2P and CON1, was attenuated when only linked probands were considered (genotypes P = 0.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	61	 There was no difference in IDE10 genotype frequencies between 10q-linked probands and CON1 control subjects (P = 0.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	62	 However, the complementary analysis, testing whether IDE genotype partitioned the evidence for 10q linkage, was more encouraging.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	63	 In families in which the proband carried the weakly associated IDE2 genotypes, CT and CC, the LOD score at D10S1765 increased from 1.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The same analysis based on IDE10 genotype (grouping GA and GG), yielded a LOD of 2.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	65	Clarification of the role of IDE2 and IDE10 variants was sought by further genotyping in early-onset type 2 diabetic cases (YT2D, Warren 2 trios [W2T]) and a large control resource (CON2).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Both young-onset case groups had similar clinical characteristics (Table 3), and genotypes were combined after appropriate tests of homogeneity.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	67	 These replication cohorts have an average age-at-diagnosis some 15 years earlier than the sibpair probands; however, both rigorous exclusion of non-type 2 diabetes and the high parental prevalence of typical late-onset type 2 diabetes in both cohorts (22,23) argue against appreciable qualitative differences in the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes susceptibility between the initial and replication cohorts.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Typing IDE2 and IDE10 effectively reduces IDE haplotypic diversity to three common haplotypes (Fig.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Genotype and allele counts are shown in Table 2.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	70	 All data were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	71	 In these replication cohorts, we found no significant association of either SNP (IDE2: genotypes P = 0.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	72	80) or the 2-10 haplotype (P = 0.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	73	41), regardless of whether the data were stratified for sex.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	74	 In the full Exeter Family Study (EFS) cohort (n = 841), there was no association between either SNP and fasting plasma glucose on combined or sex-stratified analyses.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	75	View this table:    TABLE 3 Clinical characteristics of the populations studied.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	76	  Having selected IDE on the basis of its positional and biological candidacy as a type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene, and undertaken a detailed survey of variation within the gene, we have been unable to compile any clear evidence for association between IDE variation and type 2 diabetes.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This, despite the fact that our analyses utilized several large and well-characterized populations, and selection of the diabetic individuals for early onset and positive family history was designed to enhance detection of type 2 diabetes susceptibility alleles.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The only SNP showing association in the initial case-control analysis (IDE2) was not associated in our replication set.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	79	 However, it is worth noting that the combined OR for IDE2 across both initial and replication sets does achieve nominal significance (combined OR for allele C, 1.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	80	 This result demands cautious interpretation, given allowance for the low (though unquantifiable) prior odds that even strong biological candidates, such as IDE, will harbor substantial susceptibility effects and for the lack of support from any of the other analyses performed.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The only other variant emerging from the initial analyses, IDE10, showed some ability to partition the evidence for linkage, but showed no evidence of association with type 2 diabetes (combined OR for allele A, 1.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	82	Our survey of IDE variation covered all exons, adjacent intronic sequence, and the promoter.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	83	 None of the variants identified in this, or an earlier screen of U.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	84	 subjects (17), has strong credentials for an impact on IDE structure and/or function.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Clearly, our findings do not support the hypothesis that variation within IDE is exclusively responsible for the linkage signal detected on chromosome 10q.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	86	 However, as with any association study, we cannot exclude the possibility that the variants typed (especially IDE2) have a lesser susceptibility role.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The present study has, we estimate,  > 95% power to detect an association between IDE2 and type 2 diabetes under a multiplicative model with a genotypic relative risk of 1.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	88	 This falls to 60% under a more stringent significance threshold (P = 0.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	89	001) designed to reflect modest prior odds that the candidate selected plays a biologically significant susceptibility role.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Furthermore, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that IDE variants other than those studied have a more marked contribution to type 2 diabetes susceptibility.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	91	 If so, such variants must lie outside the regions surveyed and display limited linkage disequilibrium with any of the typed variants.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Current understanding of linkage disequilibrium patterns within human populations indicates that analyses, such as ours, which seek associations using SNPs capturing haplotypic diversity within the gene of interest, will have good power to detect associations with other, as yet unidentified, common variants within the same gene (24).

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The genomic structure of IDE was determined through BLAST alignment of human mRNA sequence (M21188) with the finished genomic sequence of BAC clone AL356128.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	95	 This confirmed IDE as having 25 exons distributed between positions 93.

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Because such probands, assuming 10q linkage, are enriched for 10q susceptibility variants, we estimate  > 90% power to detect disease-associated variants (assuming multiplicative models and genotype relative risk of 1.

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	115	 To assess the evidence for linkage partitioning (18 to 21), two complementary approaches were adopted.

0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	3	The gene encoding insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is located on chromosome 10q23-q24, within a region linked to type 2 diabetes and related quantitative traits (1 to 4 ).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	4	 IDE is the major enzyme responsible for insulin proteolysis in vitro (5) and shares structural and functional homology with bacterial protease III, which may function in the termination of the insulin response (6,7).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In mice, IDE hypofunction induced by IDE gene disruption leads to hyperinsulinemia (8).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Furthermore, IDE activity in the diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat is reduced by 30%, where polymorphism in IDE is likely to be the main contributing factor (9).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Congruence of positional and functional data indicates that sequence variation in IDE may play a role in modifying insulin metabolism in human populations.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Two recent genetic association studies investigated the IDE region in relation to type 2 diabetes.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	9	 One produced significant evidence for effects on both type 2 diabetes and plasma glucose levels (10), whereas the other explored only case-control models and obtained no evidence of association (11).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Neither of these studies, however, attempted to directly relate IDE variants to measures of insulin metabolism.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	11	To evaluate the potential influence of genetic variation in IDE on insulin levels and correlated quantitative traits, a haplotype-tagging strategy was used (12) in a Swedish sample consisting of 321 impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 403 nondiabetic control subjects (Table 1).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This study follows a recent report (13) in which we examined 26 polymorphic markers extending across IDE in relation to Alzheimer s disease in a large Swedish population.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These were used to define regional linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure, which highlighted a LD block spanning 276 kb around IDE.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Three single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were identified as capable of delineating common haplotypes ( > 5%) in Swedes and were subsequently used in tests of association.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	15	View this table:    TABLE 1 Clinical characteristics of the IGT and nondiabetic control subjects.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	16	  For the present study, 14 SNP markers extending locally across IDE were examined (Fig.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	17	 1), including previously identified tag markers.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	18	 We began by genotyping these in the entire male sample to define LD structure and to identify common haplotypes.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	19	 All 14 markers were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Pairwise marker correlations suggested strong LD in the region, in agreement with earlier data (13).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Common haplotypes (those  > 5% frequency), inferred with HAPLOTYPER using all 14 markers, were similar to those obtained based on a slightly modified marker set (13).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	22	 LD estimates and inferred haplotypes for the entire sample are shown in Figs.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	23	8) was used to confirm that the studied region does represent an LD block.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	24	 We also confirmed that a selection of three tag markers equivalent to those previously used (13) would be able to delineate common haplotypes and opted not to explore the use of alternative equally valid marker sets.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	25	 We note that a variety of different approaches exist for defining optimal SNP sets (15), but we have not explored their use here.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These and other issues may have relevance for attempts at replicating or refuting the present data, as LD structures can differ markedly between divergent populations (K.

0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	33	  For initial analyses, our intention was to reduce the number of exploratory tests by examining a critical set of phenotypes against a limited number of haplotypic genotypes (also referable to as diplotypes for brevity, we have opted to use the latter term throughout this report).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The principal criterion for diplotype construction is that they can be inferred with high probability and thus reflect with fidelity combinations of common haplotypes for each individual.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In the presence of limited allelic heterogeneity, this can be advantageous over single marker tests, which can fail to detect effects due to insufficient or complex patterns of LD with pathogenic variants.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In addition, testing many single markers requires a substantial degree of multiple testing.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Our selection of quantitative phenotypes for analyses included six traits typically examined in relation to diabetes (16 to 18), and these are listed in Table 1.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	38	 We note that studies (19,20) that have investigated IDE in relation to diabetes did not report efforts to relate genotypes to either insulin levels or obesity.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Trait distributions were highly skewed or partially skewed for all six studied phenotypes, and thus only log-transformed data were modeled.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Correlations between traits were extremely high, as was expected (data not shown).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	41	Diplotypes were inferred using the three selected haplotype-tagging markers (Fig.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	42	 3) and tested against all six traits highlighted in Table 1 in men and women separately.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Six of eight possible haplotypes are predicted using these markers, the sequences for which are H1-TCG, H2-TCA, H3-CCA, H4-TTA, H5-TTG, and H6-CCG.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Posterior probability estimates were in excess of 0.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	45	80 for all phase calls that represent the various combinations of these haplotypes (a threshold that was set for retaining individuals for analyses).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Significant and consistent effects upon traits were evident, with the notable exception of fasting glucose and 2-h glucose levels.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Importantly, effects were evident exclusively in men, which are in agreement with results obtained by Karamohamed et al.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The results of these analyses are shown in Fig.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	49	 4, where data for the male sample are presented.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	50	 For all analyses, we combined IGT individuals and nondiabetic control subjects and adjusted for any uniform phenotypic differences between them by including their group identity as a factor in ANOVA models.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Diplotype by group interaction terms in second-order factorial ANOVA models were not significant.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	52	 As the above analyses are based on probabilistically inferred data, we considered it important to also explore models that only entail the use of phase-known data.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	53	 This can be accomplished by excluding individuals that are heterozygous at two or more sites (all individuals with only one heterozygote site are by definition phase known).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	54	 To demonstrate this, an additional analysis was performed in men on the four associated traits shown in Fig.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	55	 4 (insulin, 2-h insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR], and BMI).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Results revealed association with all four of these, but significance was highest for BMI (F7,220 = 3.

0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	65	  In an attempt to refine the possible position of pathogenic variant(s) in the region, single marker tests were conducted on the phenotypes that provided evidence of association in diplotype models.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	66	 In considering multiple testing issues, we noted that the strongest individual finding in HOMA-IR (P = 0.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	67	0001) affords 500 individual tests before strict multiple testing correction renders this finding insignificant (given = 0.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	68	 These tests, using all 14 markers, were performed only in the male sample because diplotype analyses gave us no a priori reason to suspect that latent associations for single markers would be present in the female set.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	69	 These results are shown in Fig.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	70	 5, where consistent effects of rs2251101 and rs2249960 can be seen upon traits.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The common allele at rs2251101 and the rare allele of rs2249960 were associated with lower trait levels.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Marker rs2251101 and rs1887922 were tested against fasting glucose levels because the latter was specifically reported on by Karamohamed et al.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	73	 (10), and these two markers are in extremely high LD (r2  >  0.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Neither marker showed evidence of association, but we acknowledge that the present study has less power than the aforementioned one.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The result for rs2251101 upon multiple phenotypes nonetheless supports the likely presence of a primary trait-modifying sequence in the 3' region of IDE, as has been speculated (10).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The effect of rs1887922 on 2-h insulin levels was significant, however, albeit considerably attenuated in comparison with rs2251101.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	77	 To further explore the effects of rs2251101, a final model was fitted in which rare-allele homozygotes and heterozygotes were combined and compared with common allele homozygotes.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The results of this were as follows: F1,366 = 9.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	79	0008; for fasting insulin, 2-h insulin, HOMA-IR, and BMI, respectively.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Although throughout this study tests were conducted on the combined IGT and normal samples (and a correction applied for possible differences between them), it was considered important to confirm that an effect exists in both populations in at least one analysis.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Using the above model and focusing on the rs2251101 marker and the 2-h insulin trait, significant effects were observed for both the IGT (F1,155 = 13.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	82	011) groups; in both cases the common allele homozygote group had the lowest trait levels.

0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	85	  In summary, we provide strong evidence that sequence variation within or near IDE contributes to variability in measures of insulin metabolism.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	86	 There are several compelling features to these results.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	87	 First, both our study and the study by Karamohamed et al.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	88	 (10) suggest that a primary functional variant occurs in the 3' region of IDE.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In addition, the marker that previously exhibited maximum evidence of association, rs1887922 (10), is in very strong LD with the marker (rs2251101) with the greatest effect in the present study.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	90	 A true pathogenic variant is likely to be in high LD with both of these (and indeed could be one of these markers).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Second, both of these studies suggest effects either exclusively or predominantly in male subjects.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Numerous studies have detected genetic effects exclusively in men (20,21), and sex specificity may be a major confounding factor in genetic analyses (22).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Third, the marker that was in strongest association with quantitative traits related to Alzheimer s disease in our recent study (13) was rs2251101 (from among 26 markers).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Importantly, however, the present analyses suggest that there may be more than one functionally relevant polymorphic site in or near IDE.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	95	 This is evident in diplotype models, where no single haplotype appears responsible for either elevating or reducing trait levels and where a number of possible interactions are also apparent.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Evidence of allelic heterogeneity and interaction will in general make fine mapping of the responsible variants a daunting task (23), and this will need to be considered in future studies investigating the IDE region.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	97	We have not directly addressed the question of whether variation in IDE influences the risk for type 2 diabetes.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The two studies that have tested this relationship have produced either no or modest evidence of association, despite examining very large clinical samples.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Our study provides no evidence of association with fasting glucose levels (the primary phenotype used to distinguish diabetic patients).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Rather, the present data likely capture the fundamental influence of IDE upon circulating insulin levels, whereby a genetically determined deficit in enzyme activity may lead to hyperinsulinemia.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	101	 This could manifest itself as a modulator role in type 2 diabetes, but might be more relevant to other phenotypes, such as coronary heart disease (24) and primary hypertension (25).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	102	 We believe that continued replication efforts in both normal and morbid populations, as well as functional studies, are now highly merited and will be needed to elucidate the molecular basis and clinical relevance of these observed phenotypic effects.

0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	105	 The HOMA-IR was then calculated in the present study by using the formula of fasting plasma glucose (in millimoles per liter) x fasting plasma insulin (in milliunits per milliliter)/22.

0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	3	The islet of Langerhans in type 2 diabetes is characterized by ss-cell loss (1,2) and islet amyloid derived from islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) (3 to 5), a protein coexpressed and secreted with insulin by ss-cells.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Brain dysfunction in Alzheimer disease is characterized by loss of neocortical neurons (6) and focal amyloid deposits, which consist of the locally expressed amyloid ss protein (AssP) (7 to 13).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The prevalence of both Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes increases with age, and both have genetic components (14 to 19).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	6	AssP and IAPP both spontaneously form into amyloid aggregates in an aqueous environment (7,8,20,21).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The role of these aggregates of IAPP and AssP in ss-cell and cortical neuronal death in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease is controversial.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Small amyloid aggregates of either of these proteins are cytotoxic (22 to 25).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The mechanism of the cytotoxicity mediated by small protein aggregates has been hypothesized to be by induction of membrane damage (25 to 27).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In the case of IAPP, evidence exists to suggest that abnormal aggregation occurs initially intracellularly, and after cell death, IAPP-derived fibrils accumulate extracellularly (24,28,29).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Similar mechanisms are also possible in Alzheimer disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In vivo, even though IAPP and AssP are present in an aqueous environment, in health neither protein forms fibrils, suggesting that mechanisms exist to prevent this otherwise spontaneous process.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These mechanisms likely include the chaperone protein pathway, a system for protein trafficking via intracellular binding proteins (chaperone proteins), which bind nascent proteins and facilitate their transport within the cell (30).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	14	We have previously hypothesized that IAPP amyloid formation in type 2 diabetes may occur under circumstances of genetic variance, which results in a relative decreased affinity of the chaperone protein pathway for trafficking of IAPP (31).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	15	 It is plausible that a low affinity for binding by one or more chaperone proteins to IAPP may be shared with a similar low affinity for binding to AssP.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In support of this hypothesis, Schwartz (32) suggested that there might be a relationship between amyloid deposits in the brain and pancreatic islets.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	17	We used both clinical studies (in living patients and community-based control subjects) and pathological studies to examine the existence of a shared risk for Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In the clinical studies, we took advantage of a unique community-based (Olmsted County, MN) cohort of well-characterized patients with Alzheimer disease and control subjects without Alzheimer disease (33) to address the question, "Is type 2 diabetes more common in Alzheimer disease?" In the pathology studies, we studied brain and pancreas in autopsy cases from the same community to address the hypotheses 1) that islet amyloid is more frequent in patients with Alzheimer disease than in control subjects without Alzheimer disease and 2) that amyloid deposits are more common in the brain in patients with type 2 diabetes than in nondiabetic humans.

0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In protocol 1, these cases and control subjects were classified according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association into one of three groups: nondiabetic ( <  110 mg/dl), impaired fasting glucose (IFG; 110 to 125 mg/dl), and type 2 diabetes ( > 126 mg/dl) based on the most recent glucose concentration measurements.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Individuals who were taking blood glucose-lowering treatment for diabetes were classified as type 2 diabetes regardless of their most recent fasting glucose concentration.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	23	Protocol 2: is the increase in fasting plasma glucose with age greater in Alzheimer disease? We also examined the changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) with aging in this cohort of patients.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	24	 For each subject, we regressed the annual median FPG value against age.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	25	 This was used to obtain a predicted FPG value for each subject at each decade and also to compare the slopes of the regression lines between groups (Alzheimer disease versus control subjects), using a two-sided rank sum test.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	26	 To be included in this analysis, patients were required to have FPG values recorded that spanned at least 10 consecutive years from age 50 or greater and at least one value available for each calendar year.

0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	102	The studies were initially undertaken to test the hypothesis that there may be a shared predisposition for development of islet amyloid and brain amyloid in patients with Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes, respectively.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	103	 This postulate arose from the close resemblance in pathology in the brain in Alzheimer disease and islets in type 2 diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	104	 In both diseases, a locally expressed protein (AssP in Alzheimer disease and IAPP in type 2 diabetes) is deposited in amyloid deposits with a gradual decline in the number of cells of the respective proteins.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Amyloid deposits of both AssP and IAPP (or more likely their oligomeric precursors) are cytotoxic (22,23,35 to 40) by a mechanism that may relate to membrane disruption (25 to 27).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	106	 However, as yet, there is still no clear explanation for why these amyloidogenic proteins form amyloid fibrils in those who develop type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Because both of these proteins spontaneously form amyloid fibrils in vitro in the aqueous environment present in the cell, mechanisms must exist in health to prevent this aggregation, which presumably include the chaperone protein pathway (30).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	108	 All newly synthesized proteins are bound by a chaperone protein that has the function of preventing insoluble proteins (e.

0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Chaperon proteins have been described as promiscuous because each chaperone protein binds and traffics numerous different proteins with structurally similar properties (30).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	111	 As individual chaperone proteins traffic structurally similar peptides, it is possible that IAPP and AssP share one or more chaperone proteins.

0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	120	  If the chaperone protein pathway for trafficking AssP or IAPP is shared, then any decreased capacity for trafficking of either might also be shared.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Under these circumstances, aggregation of either or both proteins might occur, resulting in the development of the relevant phenotype for Alzheimer disease and/or type 2 diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	122	 In addition, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease increase in prevalence with aging, and cell chaperone protein capacity declines with aging (43), which would be expected to reveal any partial deficiency in chaperone capacity with aging.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Therefore, one potential explanation for the reported shared risk for Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes and similar pathology is that IAPP and AssP share one or more chaperone proteins and that a functional defect in this shared pathway (decreased chaperone protein binding, decreased chaperone protein availability) results in a shared vulnerability for AssP to aggregate in ss-pleated sheets in cortical cells and IAPP to aggregate in ss-cells.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	124	An alternative hypothesis to account for the reported overlap between islet amyloid and brain amyloid is that subtle hyperglycemia causes Alzheimer disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	125	 This possibility has been reviewed by Finch and Cohen (44).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Finch and Cohen proposed that the progressive increase in plasma glucose concentration that occurs with aging in the general population may be important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	127	 They proposed that this may be mediated by induction of oxidative stress or by glycosylation of key regulatory proteins (45,46).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	128	 The current study was at least partly supportive of this interesting hypothesis.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	129	 When present, the density of diffuse and neuritic plaques in brain increased with the duration of diabetes but not with age.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia thus might trigger brain plaque formation in those at risk.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	131	 However, against this hypothesis, there was not an overall increase in the pathological features of Alzheimer disease in cases of type 2 diabetes compared with control subjects, consistent with a previous pathological report (47).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	132	The high risk of underlying vascular disease in diabetes has been reported to increase rates of vascular dementia in diabetes (48,49).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Furthermore, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both strongly associated with diabetes (50), both are risk factors for vascular dementia (51 to 54).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Another potential mechanism for decreased cognitive function in long-standing diabetes is recurrent hypoglycemia (55 to 57).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	135	 However, in the present studies, we included only cases with type 2 diabetes in which recurrent hypoglycemia is rare in comparison with type 1 diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	136	These multiple factors that might influence a relationship between dementia and type 2 diabetes as well as differences in populations and inclusion criteria likely contribute to the conflicting epidemiological data in this field.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Some studies suggest that the prevalence of Alzheimer disease is increased in type 2 diabetes (58 to 60), whereas in others, it has been reported as decreased (61 to 66) or comparable (48,49,67 to 71).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	138	 A confounding factor in these studies (including the current one) is that Alzheimer disease is often accompanied by a decreased BMI presumed to be a result of decreased food intake.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Because the most potent risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes is an increased BMI, it is possible that an association between these conditions has been obscured by the relative protective effect of a decreased BMI in Alzheimer disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Alternatively, it is possible that people with Alzheimer disease exercise less and therefore have decreased insulin sensitivity and increased risk for type 2 diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	141	 As type 2 diabetes tends to develop at a younger age than Alzheimer disease and is associated with a decreased life expectancy, early death from complications of diabetes might obscure subsequent development of Alzheimer disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	142	 The current pathology studies are unique inasmuch as the Alzheimer disease and non-Alzheimer disease groups were fully characterized both in life and by autopsy, and so although the numbers are small, it is provocative that there is a distinct increase in risk of islet amyloid in patients with Alzheimer disease despite a lower BMI.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The clinical data (protocols 1 and 2) are also community-based cases that have been defined extensively with respect to the presence or absence of dementia and followed over a relatively long term (33).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	144	 It is of interest that a population-based study from the same region showed an association between type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease (59).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Whereas the former study examined records of all known cases of type 2 diabetes in the Rochester area at the time of the study for a diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer disease (1,455 cases), the present study was focused on a much smaller cohort of patients with Alzheimer disease (100 cases) and control subjects (138 cases) enrolled in the ADPR (33), wherein the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease was rigorously established, and then the same patients were followed annually in the study thereafter and when deceased were included in the autopsy studies.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	146	 One other factor that might have caused discrepancies between reported studies is the changing definition of diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The present study uses the criteria adopted for FPG concentrations in 1997 by an expert committee convened by the American Diabetes Association (72).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	148	 As a consequence of this report, the plasma glucose concentration required to establish the diagnosis of diabetes was decreased from 140 mg/dl to 126 mg/dl.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Furthermore, a high-risk group was established for the subsequent development of diabetes with an FPG concentration of 110 to 125 mg/dl.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Studies that used the higher values for diagnosis of diabetes would report lower prevalence rates in both Alzheimer disease and control subjects and possibly not observe differences between groups that might be evident with the criteria used here.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	151	Another potential confounding factor in previous as well as the present studies is recruitment bias.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	152	 All studies performed at major tertiary referral centers such as the Mayo Clinic are subject to such bias.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Efforts were made to minimize this in the present clinical studies by recruitment of patients from the local community from the community clinics of the Mayo Medical Center.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Patients were therefore attending the Mayo Clinic community clinics for primary care when they were recruited for either the Alzheimer disease or control groups of the clinical studies.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Nonetheless, other recruitment bias may be introduced in a study such as ours by the failure of affected patients to seek medical care and therefore be unavailable for consideration.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	156	 In the present study, there is a greater proportion of women than men in the clinical studies, which might be in part a reflection of recruitment bias but also potentially be due to the shorter life span of men than women once Alzheimer disease is diagnosed.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Autopsy studies of Alzheimer disease cases and control subjects (for islet amyloid) would be subject to the same ascertainment bias as the ADPR since the cases were in the ADPR until death.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	158	 In autopsy studies of type 2 diabetes cases versus control subjects for brain amyloid, we sought to minimize deliberate bias by including most recent autopsies in reverse sequence from cases that were appropriate for inclusion for these criteria.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	159	 People who have an autopsy are of course in themselves a subgroup of the general population, so bias has to be considered.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Notwithstanding these limitations, we do have the opportunity of presenting autopsy data from cases that were well characterized in life compared with most autopsy studies.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	161	In conclusion, we report that there is an increased prevalence of both type 2 diabetes and IFG in a community cohort of patients with Alzheimer disease followed in Olmsted County, Rochester, Minnesota.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	162	 We also report increased islet amyloid in patients with Alzheimer disease compared with control subjects.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	163	 However, we did not observe an increased frequency of brain amyloid in cases of type 2 diabetes, although in cases of type 2 diabetes that did have brain amyloid, the extent of this amyloid increased with longer duration of diabetes, a correlate that did not extend to the age of patients with type 2 diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Taken together, these clinical and pathological studies support a possible link between the neurodegenerative processes that lead to loss of cortical brain cells in Alzheimer disease and the loss of ss-cells in type 2 diabetes.

0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received January 2, 2004; Revised February 3, 2004; Accepted February 9, 2004.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	3	These findings are well established and have driven therapeutics research, especially because they have allowed the development of animal models of these diseases as well as defined therapeutic targets (7).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In each of these examples, the precise  pathologic species  of protein is obscure, if there is one, and it is debated whether the deposits themselves, or some intermediate species such as an oligomer, are responsible.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	5	 This has been extensively investigated, with the balance of recent data favoring smaller intermediate species as the toxic entities (8); however, the generality of the fact that the mutated protein in each example can be deposited suggests that the process of pathogenicity is related to, although perhaps separable from, the process of deposition.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	6	By studying the autosomal dominant forms of these and other diseases, researchers hope to gain insight into the more common, sporadic forms, and from a mechanistic perspective, this has certainly been the case.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, perhaps more surprisingly, over this last 4 years, it has become clear that, in the case of many of these diseases at least, the haplotype of the Mendelian pathogenic locus influences the disease risk for sporadic disease.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	8	In this review, we briefly summarise these data, and then make predictions concerning the etiology and pathogenesis of these and other neurodegenerative diseases.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	9	 First, though, it is worth noting what a  haplotypic association  means from a mechanistic perspective: in the absence of coding changes, a haplotypic association implies there is genetic variability either in the amount of expression of the protein, or in the alternate splicing of the protein, and that this contributes to disease risk.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	10	Alzheimer's disease Extensive sequencing of the APP gene in late-onset Alzheimer's disease has failed to identify mutations (13).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	11	 However, analysis of data from sibpairs affected with late-onset Alzheimer's disease has consistently suggested that APP is a locus for this form of disease (14,15).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This suggests that genetic variability at the APP locus contributes to disease risk, although the precise variability has not been identified.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Such a finding is consistent with the longstanding observation that individuals with trisomy 21 inevitably develop Alzheimer pathology by their fifth decade (16); however, those few cases of Down syndrome caused by triplication of chromosome 21 distal to the APP gene do not develop Alzheimer's disease (17).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Thus, having three copies of the APP gene leads to Alzheimer pathology in the fifth decade and as yet unidentified genetic variability at the APP locus appears to contribute to disease risk.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	15	Frontal temporal dementia: tangle diseases Mutations in the tau gene cause many cases of autosomal dominant frontal temporal dementia in which there is tau pathology.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	16	 There are many sporadic diseases in which tau pathology occurs, usually as tangles, but also as Pick bodies or Argyrophilic grains (18).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	17	 There are two genetic haplotype clades in Caucasian populations, designated H1 and H2, which differ in intron sizes, promoter sequence and wobble bases (19).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The H1 haplotype has a frequency of 75% in Caucasians, and thus the H1 homozygotes constitute 60% of such populations.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, individuals with one of the three sporadic tau diseases, progressive supranuclear palsy (19), corticobasal degeneration (20) and argyrophilic grain disease (21), although not Pick's disease (22) or Guam disease (23), show a robust association with H1 homozygosity, with a frequency of H1 homozygotes being 95%.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	20	 These data show clearly that variability in either tau expression or tau splicing variability (or both) contribute to disease risk.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In this case, it is difficult to determine whether it is control of splicing or control of expression which is the key variable because it is indeed clear that many mutations which lead to Mendelian disease do so through altering alternate splicing (2,24).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	22	Parkinson's disease/Lewy body dementia Mutations in the -synuclein gene cause autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease, and -synuclein is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the pathognomic feature of Parkinson's disease (25).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Genetic variability in the -synuclein promoter contributes to the risk of sporadic Parkinson's disease (26,27) with the  associated  promoter allele being a stronger promoter (28).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Perhaps most convincingly, triplication of the whole -synuclein locus causes autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease/Lewy body dementia with an onset age in the fourth decade (29) and duplication of the locus leads to disease in the fifth decade (30).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Thus, with Parkinson's disease, there is a clear dose relationship between synuclein expression and disease occurrence, with normal genetic variability in the promoter contributing to the risk of typical idiopathic disease and with multiplications of the locus causing Mendelian disease with an onset age determined by the precise  dose .
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Protein studies in cell lines from affected individuals in these kindreds reveal that the amount of -synuclein produced correlates with disease (A.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	27	While these findings were unexpected, perhaps they should not have been.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	28	 All chemists know the power of the law of mass action, and perhaps it should not have surprised us that it may have profound implications in determining our risks of neurodegenerative disease (36).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Of course, one therapeutic approach in all cases, therefore, would be to aim to reduce the concentrations of the toxic proteins in the relevant tissue compartment either through decreased production, increased breakdown, or both.

0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received January 13, 2004; Accepted January 26, 2004.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Overview of concordant linkage/association regions observed in full genome screens published until 2003   These disease-specific characteristics, together with the advent of relatively inexpensive and powerful high-throughput genotyping technologies, and the near completion of the human genome sequence have led to a steep increase in the number of laboratories studying the genetics of AD worldwide.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	4	 To date, no less than 12 full-genome screens using linkage- or association-based methodologies have been published for AD, some using overlapping or identical samples, but each employing different sets of genetic markers and/or analytic strategies (8 to 19) (Table 1).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	5	 On the other hand, the number of locus-specific, candidate gene-based AD association studies has now become nearly intractable.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Over the course of 2003, more than 10 genes were reported to show either positive or negative evidence of association with different AD phenotypes per month in peer-reviewed journals as listed on NCBI's  PubMed .
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Despite these vast efforts, no single gene has yet emerged to attain nearly the degree of replication and consistency that has been observed by literally hundreds of laboratories studying the association of APOE-4 and AD.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In this review, we present and discuss the findings of all genetic AD association studies published in 2003 (excluding those explicitly searching for the causes of early-onset familial AD cases, i.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Using these data as an example, we then attempt to pinpoint the methodological difficulties that are likely to underlie the remarkable failure to replicate genetic findings using current approaches.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	10	Candidate gene studies Searching  PubMed  (www.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	11	gov/PubMed/) with keywords  alzheimer* AND (association OR associated)  for all papers published between January 1 and December 31, 2003, retrieved a total of 1037 studies (on December 28, 2003), of which 90 directly deal with genetic association between candidate polymorphisms and AD.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	12	 As can be seen in Table 2, these studies examined a total of 55 genetic loci ( locus  being a set of markers within the same 5 Mb genomic interval) on 20 different chromosomes.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	13	 A total of 55 analyzed genes within these loci were found to be  positive  (as judged by the authors), while 68 tested  negative .
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Interestingly, even 10 years after its discovery, the largest number (n=18) of reports focusing on a single gene dealt with the association between APOE and AD, using new polymorphisms, new samples/ethnic groups or new phenotypes.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	15	 When these studies were not considered, a total of 38 positive and 67 negative papers remained.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Overview of chromosomal loci tested for genetic association with AD in 2003   If 2003 represents one of the most prolific vintages for late-onset AD genetic studies, the next most pressing question is: did the large quantity of studies also dilute the quality of the product, perhaps even making for an unpalatable quaff? The answer, in our opinion, is yes, at least in the majority of cases.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	17	 There is growing consensus that the success rate and reliability of genetic association studies in complex diseases depend on the fulfillment of several criteria (20,21), three of which are discussed in more detail below.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	18	 These are in addition to the  classic  requirements of at least plausible biological and/or positional candidacy for any investigated locus, as well as direct proof of pathophysiological consequences of any positive disease association.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	19	 While the former criterion is fulfilled for the vast majority of AD candidate genes investigated thus far, the latter condition has been more elusive.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This is due to several factors that generally bedevil the study of genetic association in complex diseases, such as linkage disequilibrium with the actual (and functionally relevant) disease-modifying variant, small effect sizes (which impede the detection of significant effects using basic molecular and biochemical assays), and possibly the involvement of as yet unknown pathophysiological mechanisms.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The situation of APOE-4 in AD serves as a good example: while the genetic association per se has been extremely well established over the past decade, there is still no consensus as to how this association translates pathophysiologically (22,23).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	22	Thus, before attempting to uncover the  functional consequences  of any putative new disease association, we propose that more emphasis must be placed on criteria that allow for a better distinction between false-positive as well as false-negative findings prior to initial publication.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	23	Power: does the sample size and structure enable the investigators to detect effect sizes of only moderate or small extent? While this is an obvious concern in reports with a negative outcome, the power of a study also governs the rate of false positive findings, i.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	24	 the probability that an observed significant association is indeed genuine and not only observed by chance (24 to 26).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Other factors influencing the ability to detect meaningful effects include the attributable risk of the polymorphism to the overall genetic variance, degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the associated allele and the actual disease predisposing variant, mode of inheritance and, to a lesser extent, disease prevalence.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	26	 While these variables are, of course, difficult to estimate when the true disease gene is unknown, power for any given sample size can fairly easily be calculated for a variety of possible and plausible scenarios.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In practice, however, this still remains the exception.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	28	 A recent study estimated that the minimal number of cases and controls sufficient to achieve 80% power at =0.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	29	05 is usually far greater than 200 when the actual disease allele is not tested directly, even under the most favorable of circumstances (26).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	30	 It is interesting that, regardless of these estimates, 20% of all studies published in 2003 have still used smaller sample sizes and thus are probably not suitable for use in reaching any reliable conclusion.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	31	Replicability: has the result been validated/replicated in an independent sample of sufficient size? While there have been reports of  significant  associations between putative candidate genes and AD on every chromosome in the human genome over the past 10 years (27), none of these findings with the exception of APOE-4 has yet been replicated consistently.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Many a seemingly  positive  result could (and should) have been validated in an independent dataset prior to its first publication, as several authors have long been suggesting in guidelines for the proper  quality control  of genetic association findings (20,21,25,28,29).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The current inflation of probable false-positive reports may have been avoided if independent replication had been sought earlier.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	34	 If an independent sample cannot be found in-house, the establishment of at least temporary  consortia  between collaborative laboratories to test each other's positive signals prior to publication would represent an easy and effective means to restore credibility.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Upon our review of the 2003 AD genetics literature, less than 20% of all studies either referred to findings in two or more independent samples at once, or were published in tandem with independent reports investigating the same candidate genes and/or genetic variants.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	36	Haplotype structure: have the authors made attempts to elucidate the structure of the underlying haplotype architecture? The more current and systematic assessment of haplotype structures at various regions throughout the genome in the past 3 to 4 years has emphasized the importance of performing haplotype- or systematic LD-analyses when searching for novel complex disease genes (30,31), especially when effect sizes are expected to be lower than those conferred by APOE-4.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In addition to increasing the power of the analyses, this approach also reduces the number of statistical tests that need to be performed, which should lead to a further decrease of false-positive findings.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Several very recently published complex disease associations would have been impossible to observe, without thorough assessment of the underlying haplotype architecture (32 to 34).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Along these lines, recent studies on APOE have shown that this locus would have been easily identified by means of haplotype analysis alone, even without the prior knowledge of the 4 polymorphism (35,36).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Yet, in 2003 only about one-third of all studies investigated more than one polymorphism per locus.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Only half of these carried out a more or less  thorough  assessment of haplotype structure (i.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	42	 four or more polymorphisms per gene).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	43	Out of all 90 papers published in 2003 on the topic of genetic association between candidate genes and the different AD phenotypes, only 21 (23%) fulfilled at least two of the above criteria.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Most likely, many of the observed discrepancies across studies could be explained by a lack of methodological thoroughness.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Nonetheless, there were three loci, in addition to APOE, that tested positive across at least three studies (on chromosomes 6p21, 10q24, and 11q23; Table 2).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	46	 These loci are covered in the remainder of this review.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	47	Chromosome 6p21 This chromosomal region was implicated as harboring a putative AD gene as early as 1980, based on an association finding between variants in the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex region (HLA-A, at 30 Mb) and AD in a small case to control study (37).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Two other potential AD candidates map within this 5 Mb interval, the genes encoding the hereditary haemochromatosis protein (HFE, at 26 Mb) and the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA, at 31 Mb).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	49	 While in 2003 two studies reported significant evidence of association with the latter two genes (38,39), two other studies did not confirm these findings (40,41).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Another candidate gene located in this region, HAPA1B, has been found to be associated with certain neuropsychological variables (42), but not disease risk itself (43).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Finally, one study investigated variation in onset age as a function of the HLA A2-allele in a small sample of AD patients, but did not find any significant effects (44).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	52	 A literature search for association studies with any of these genes including the years before 2003 yielded at least 15 positive studies, while 10 reports found no evidence of a genetic involvement of these factors.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	53	 While there has been some evidence for a direct involvement of TNFA in Ass-production and toxicity (45), direct proof for a pathogenetic relevance for any of the other genes/proteins remains to be seen.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Furthermore, the full-genome screens for AD genes have consistently yielded signals on 6p21 residing between 39 and 42 Mb, whereas the associated genes map 10 Mb further proximal.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Thus, while there is increasing evidence supporting the existence of a putative AD locus on 6p21 in general, the possibility that the actual disease gene has not yet been identified cannot be excluded, despite the overlapping positive results from this year and past studies.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	56	Chromosome 10q24 Of the six candidate loci analyzed in the region between 10q21 and 10q25 in 2003, three were reported to be associated with AD phenotypes across multiple samples (i.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	57	 CDC2/VR22, TNFRSF6/IDE and GSTO1/2).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The only locus found to be associated by more than one group of investigators is located between 90 and 94 Mb and encompasses the genes TNFRSF6 (90 Mb) and IDE/KIFF11/HHEX (46 to 48).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Probably the best candidate on biological grounds is IDE, encoding the insulin degrading enzyme (protein: IDE).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This metalloprotease has been shown to degrade monomeric Ass before it can aggregate into oligomeric forms and, ultimately, into ss-amyloid plaques (49).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	61	 While several issues of the proposed mode of action still remain controversial (e.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	62	 the precise cellular location of Ass cleavage, relevance of IDE function/dysfunction on the development of AD), there are now a number of animal models available showing the predicted effects in vivo (50 to 52).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Before 2003, there were two papers published showing allelic association with microsatellite markers in this region (53,54), while two reports did not find association with IDE variants or nearby markers and AD (55,56).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Note that the data on one of the negative studies (55) actually largely overlaps with the positive paper by Edland et al.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	65	 (46), with the important exception that the authors of the first paper did not account for potential interactions between IDE and APOE 4-status.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	66	 This may be crucial, since the latter study only found a significant effect of IDE on AD risk in individuals lacking the APOE 4-allele.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Clearly, more studies on independent samples of sufficient size are necessary to further elucidate the potential role of IDE variants on the development of AD in the more general population.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	68	In addition to the IDE locus, a total of four other genes on the long arm of chromosome 10 were found to be associated with AD.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Two of these (CDC2 and VR22) map 30 Mb proximal of IDE, while the other two (GSTO1/2 and PRSS11) map 10 to 30 Mb distal.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	70	 While none of these associations has yet been confirmed in independent AD samples, it is noteworthy that two of these genes were also found to be associated in other neurodegenerative illnesses, frontotemporal dementia (CDC2) (57) and Parkinson's disease (GSTO1/2) (58), potentially suggesting a more common pathway leading to neuronal cell death across these syndromes.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	71	 CDC2 encodes for the cell division cycle 2 protein which is involved in the phosphorylation of both tau and APP, and is found in neurons bearing neurofibrillary tangles.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	72	 GSTO1 and 2 encode for glutathione S-transferase omega-1 and -2, which are involved in the physiological response to oxidative stress, and may in particular be responsible for regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines like IL1-ss.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Thus, while these are all plausible AD candidate genes on positional as well as biological/biochemical grounds, further studies are still necessary to elucidate their proposed roles in influencing the risk and/or age-at-onset for AD in the general population.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	74	Chromosome 11q23 The region near the tip of the long arm of chromosome 11 has been implicated in only one of the full genome screens published to date (8) (and therefore does not appear in Table 1).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Yet, there were a total of three studies showing significant association with an AD candidate gene in 2003: BACE, encoding the ss-site APP cleaving enzyme (ss-secretase) (59 to 61).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	76	 This protein is an excellent AD candidate on biochemical grounds as it is only after the ss-secretase cleavage of APP that Ass can be liberated from its precursor via -secretase cleavage.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Most interestingly and in contrast to all other putative AD associations discussed above there appears to be a high degree of consistency with respect to the site and allelic nature underlying these findings: all positive studies, including the initial report by Nowotny and colleagues published in 2001 (62), observe over-representations of the G-allele of a synonymous SNP located at codon 262 (in exon 5) in AD cases as compared with healthy controls.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Furthermore, in all of these studies the observed effect was most pronounced in carriers of the APOE 4-allele, yielding significantly elevated odds ratios ranging from 2 to 7.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	79	In contrast to these four positive associations, there is an equal number of studies in the literature showing no apparent effects of this BACE polymorphism and AD.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	80	 However, it must be pointed out that one of these only studied early-onset familial AD cases (63), and the remaining studies did not account for the potential interaction with the APOE 4-allele (64 to 66).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Unless this is done, similar to the situation encountered for the variants tested in IDE (see above), no firm conclusions can be reached as to whether or not the exon 5 polymorphism in BACE is a genetic risk factor for AD in these samples.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Thus, of the three known APP-cleaving enzymes and associated proteins [- (ADAM9,10 and 17), ss- (BACE, BACE2) and -secretase (PSEN1, APH1A, NCSTN, PEN2)], most of which have already been tested for genetic association with AD phenotypes, BACE currently shows the most promise of being a genuine and relevant risk factor for late-onset AD.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	83	 As is the case for all other putative AD genes, more studies using sufficiently sized samples and appropriate analytic strategies need to be performed before more general conclusions can be reached.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Note, that the first study examining the putative genetic role of BACE in late-onset AD in 2004 also reports a significant effect of the exon 5 polymorphism in a case-control sample of Chinese origin (67).

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	3	Current evidence strongly implicates that aggregation and deposition of amyloid -peptide (A)1 in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients is an invariant pathological feature (1).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	4	 A is generated from the -amyloid precursor protein (APP) by endoproteolytic processing.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Two sequential cleavages, first by -secretase and then followed by -secretase, are required to liberate A (for review, see Refs.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The intramembranous -secretase cleavage is dependent on biologically active presenilins (PS) that may be unusual aspartyl proteases (4, 5), which probably constitute the active site of -secretase (for review, see Refs.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	7	 PSs are not only involved in proteolytic processing of APP but also in a similar intramembraneous cut of Notch (6).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Notch, like APP, is a type I transmembrane protein that undergoes very similar endoproteolytic processing pathways (for review, see Refs.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	9	 After ectodomain shedding, Notch is cleaved within or close to its transmembrane domain by the -secretase-like S3 protease activity.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The S3 cut finally liberates the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), a key molecule in developmental signal transduction (7).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Cleavage of Notch at S3 is PS-dependent and can be blocked by -secretase inhibitors (6).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Consistent with a role of PSs in Notch signaling, the PS1/PS2 double knockout in mice has a phenotype similar to that of Notch1/ mice (8), and Notch cleavage is completely inhibited in PS-deficient cells (9, 10).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The requirement of PSs in both NICD formation and -secretase cleavage of APP provided the basis for the hypothesis that the -secretase-generated cytoplasmic domain of APP may also carry out an important function in nuclear signaling.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Recently, several reports (11-15) described the -secretase-generated cytoplasmic fragment of APP, which we termed AICD (APP intracellular domain) (13) in analogy to NICD.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	15	 AICD is generated by a PS-dependent mechanism, since a PS1 gene knockout as well as a "dominant negative" PS1 mutation (D385N) inhibited AICD generation (13).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Moreover, -secretase inhibitors, including ones that are known to bind to PSs, also blocked AICD generation in vivo and in vitro (12, 13, 15).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Interestingly, the N terminus of AICD is predominantly generated by a cut between amino acids 49 and 50 of the -amyloid domain and not by the expected -secretase cut after amino acids 40 or 42 (13-15).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This cleavage releases in vivo a 50-amino acid-long AICD fragment into the cytoplasm but not the predicted 57- or 59-amino acid fragment.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Sequence comparison revealed that this cleavage occurs at a very similar position as the S3 cleavage of Notch (13-15).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Taken together, these analogies between APP and Notch processing may favor the idea that AICD, like NICD, has a physiological function in nuclear signal transduction.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Indeed, recent findings with highly sensitive reporter gene assays supported the hypothesis that AICD may be involved in gene transcription (16).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	22	 However, AICD alone was not sufficient to allow the detection of a significant transcriptional activity in the reporter gene assays.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Only upon co-transfection of Fe65, a nuclear adaptor protein that has been shown to bind to the APP cytoplasmic tail (17-19), a significant transcriptional activity was observed (16).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This may be related to the observation that the recombinant 59-amino acid AICD-like molecules are stabilized by the co-expression of Fe65 (20), although the latter has not been confirmed by others (21).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	25	Cell Lines and Cell Culture-- Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 200  microg/ml G418 (to select for APP expression), and 200  microg/ml zeocin (to select for IDE expression).

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	57	AICD Is Rapidly Degraded by a Metalloprotease Activity-- We and others have previously demonstrated that AICD can efficiently be generated in vitro in a -secretase- and PS-dependent manner from crude membrane fractions prepared by centrifugation at 10,000-16,000  x  g (11-14).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	58	 However, the in vitro generated AICD is extremely rapidly degraded, and the addition of a protease inhibitor mix containing EDTA is necessary to stabilize AICD (11, 12).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	59	 To identify the protease involved in this extremely rapid degradation pathway, the in vitro assay was carried out in the presence of a variety of protease inhibitors (Fig.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	60	 In the absence of any inhibitor, no AICD could be detected, demonstrating that at 37  degrees C AICD degradation is even faster than de novo synthesis.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Consistent with previous results a general protease inhibitor mix including EDTA inhibited AICD degradation.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The additional presence of the -secretase inhibitor DAPT inhibited AICD generation as expected (13).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Interestingly, the protease inhibitor mix without EDTA did not block AICD degradation, suggesting the involvement of a divalent metal ion-dependent proteolytic activity in AICD generation.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Indeed, the metal-chelators EDTA and PNT allowed robust accumulation of AICD when used either alone or in combination.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	65	 However, the more specific metalloprotease inhibitors phosphoramidon and bestatin, an inhibitor of aminopeptidases, did not inhibit degradation of AICD.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	66	 AICD degradation was not affected by inhibitors of cysteine proteases (E64, leupeptin), serine proteases (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and aspartyl proteases (pepstatin) (data not shown).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Interestingly, the potent proteasome inhibitors clasto-lactacystin -lactone and MG132 also did not block AICD degradation (Fig.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	68	 This is in contrast to NICD that has been shown to be rapidly degraded by a ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway (6, 22, 23).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Thus, although AICD and NICD are both generated by a PS-dependent protease, they are degraded by different proteolytic activities.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Taken together, we conclude that most likely a metalloprotease is involved in AICD degradation.

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	76	AICD Is Degraded by a Cytoplasmic Protease-- We next investigated whether the metalloprotease activity involved in AICD degradation is cytosolic or membrane-bound.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	77	 We first assayed crude membranes for AICD degradation after alkaline extraction with Na2CO3 that separates peripheral from integral membrane proteins (30).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	78	 2A, AICD could be recovered in the absence of PNT/EDTA from Na2CO3-extracted membranes, suggesting that the AICD degrading activity is either peripherally attached to the membrane or soluble.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	79	 In addition, these data confirm previous findings that -secretase is integrally membrane-bound (11).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	80	 We next separated crude membranes from residual cytosol by additional centrifugation.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	81	 As shown above, when crude membranes were used in the in vitro assay, AICD could not be recovered in the absence of PNT/EDTA (Fig.

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Thus, these data suggest that the AICD degrading activity is a soluble protease that is primarily located within the cytoplasm.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	85	 To further prove the cytoplasmic localization of the AICD degrading activity, the in vitro degradation assay was performed with washed cytosol-free membranes, which allowed robust accumulation of AICD in the absence of PNT/EDTA.

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	102	Identification of Candidate Enzymes Responsible for AICD Degradation-- Based on the inhibition profile and the cytoplasmic localization of the AICD degrading activity, we searched the MEROPS protease data base (www.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	103	uk) for candidate AICD-degrading enzymes.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	104	 This search revealed that three cytoplasmic candidate proteases from two metalloprotease families (M3A and M16A families) could be responsible for the degradation of AICD: thimet oligopeptidase (TOP, M3A family), neurolysin (M3A family), and IDE (insulysin, M16A family).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Consistent with these candidate proteases being thiol group-dependent (31, 32), the SH-alkylating agents NEM strongly inhibited AICD degradation (Fig.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Next, to discriminate which of these proteases could be involved in AICD degradation, the in vitro assay was carried out in the presence or absence of dynorphin A-(1-13), a known inhibitor of TOP and neurolysin (31) and potentially also of IDE.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The dipeptide Pro-Ile, a highly specific neurolysin inhibitor (31), cFP-AAY-pAB (cFP), a potent TOP and less potent neurolysin inhibitor (33), and insulin, a well characterized substrate of IDE, that functions as competitive inhibitor, were investigated as well (24).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	108	 3B, weak inhibition of AICD degradation by dynorphin A-(1-13) suggests either TOP or neurolysin as a candidate protease without excluding IDE.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	109	 However, Pro-Ile did not block AICD degradation ruling out neurolysin as a candidate protease (Fig.

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Indeed, insulin competed for the AICD degrading activity present in cytosol derived from N2a cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Finally, cytosol of HEK293 cells was immunodepleted of endogenous IDE by immunoprecipitation with excess amounts of an anti-IDE antibody (Fig.

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Thus, these data strongly suggest that IDE is a major AICD-degrading enzyme.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	133	PSs may function in facilitating nuclear signaling.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Such a function is well proven for the role of PS in NICD generation.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Very recently the corresponding cytoplasmic fragment of APP, AICD, has been identified (13-15).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	136	 AICD is generated by a remarkably similar molecular mechanism like NICD (Fig.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	137	 If AICD functions in nuclear signaling as proposed by Cao and Sudhof (16), one may expect a rapid clearance of this fragment, since constitutive uncontrolled signaling must be avoided.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Indeed this is the case for NICD, which is rapidly removed by an ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway (6, 22, 23).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Here we show that AICD is not degraded by the proteasome but by a completely different protease, namely IDE (Fig.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The biochemical properties of IDE make it an ideal candidate for AICD degradation.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	141	 It is highly expressed in the same cellular compartment as AICD; it is a common enzyme in brain tissue, where abundant APP expression is observed, and it preferentially degrades small cytoplasmic peptides of about 20-50 amino acids in length (for review, see Ref.

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	144	 AICD and NICD are generated by PS-dependent -secretase and S3 protease cleavages at similar sites within the membrane.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Following liberation from the membrane, NICD, and probably also AICD, translocate to the nucleus.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In the nucleus NICD activates the transcription of Notch target genes.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Proteasomal degradation of NICD prevents its accumulation and constitutive signaling.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	148	 In contrast to NICD, AICD is degraded by IDE that, like neprilysin, is also involved in the extracellular degradation of secreted A.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	149	We found an extremely rapid turnover of AICD, which even exceeds the kinetics of de novo production in vitro.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	150	 This is consistent with the high levels of IDE in the cytoplasm of many cells and tissues.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Although we have identified IDE as a major AICD-degrading enzyme in non-neuronal and neuronal cell lysates, we cannot exclude the possibility that other enzymes may degrade AICD in cells where IDE activity or expression is low (24).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	152	Interestingly, overexpressed artificial 59-amino acid AICD variants have been localized to the nucleus to some extent (20, 21).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	153	 However, this is in contrast to endogenous AICD with the correct N terminus that has so far not been detected within the nucleus.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Due to the rather rapid turnover of endogenous AICD and the apparent lack of its nuclear localization, one may question a function of this small peptide in nuclear signaling.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	155	 However, one needs to point out that NICD could not be detected in the nucleus for a long time, because sensitive techniques have been lacking.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Indeed using hypersensitive reporter gene assays Cao and Sudhof (16) could provide indirect evidence that a cytoplasmic fragment of APP (which was not identical to the in vivo existing AICD) complexed with Fe65, and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 could mediate gene transcription.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	157	 However, nuclear transport of authentic AICD and the formation of a nuclear Tip60 Fe65 AICD complex remains to be shown.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The identification of IDE as an AICD-degrading enzyme may facilitate research on the putative role of AICD in nuclear signaling, since this function could be strongly enhanced by the inhibition of AICD degradation.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	3	The Ste23p and Axl1p proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have significant sequence homology to IDE (36 and 19% identity, respectively) (8).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Genetic and mutational studies indicate that Ste23p and Axl1p are required for the proteolytic maturation of the yeast a-factor mating pheromone, a lipid-modified peptide that is produced by a multistep process (9, 10).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	5	 This pheromone is produced by MATa haploid cells and is required for yeast mating, the fusion of MATa and MAT haploid cells to form a diploid cell.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Although Ste23p and Axl1p can independently promote a-factor maturation, the enzymes are not fully redundant.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Ste23p is significantly less efficient than Axl1p at producing biologically active pheromone (9).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	8	Axl1p has several cellular roles.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In addition to its role in pheromone production, Axl1p is required for the efficient post-conjugation fusion of haploid mating partners (11).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This role may be indirectly related to the ability of Axl1p to produce a-factor, because limiting levels of pheromone similarly lead to fusion defects (12).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Axl1p is also required for maintenance of the axial budding pattern that is characteristic of haploid yeast (8, 9).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In the absence of Axl1p, haploid yeasts exhibit a bipolar budding pattern that is typical of diploid cells.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The function of Axl1p in this process does not require its proteolytic activity, suggesting that Axl1p is a bi-functional enzyme (9).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Axl1p also represses the invasive growth of haploid yeast (13, 14).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Whether the proteolytic, bud site selection, or another activity of Axl1p is required for this process has not been reported.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	16	 By contrast to Axl1p, the only reported cellular role for Ste23p is in a-factor production.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Additional functions for this enzyme are likely because Ste23p is expressed in both the MAT and diploid cell types that do not produce a-factor.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	18	IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p are members of the M16A protease subfamily.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	19	 M16A proteases are characterized by a core inverted zinc metalloprotease motif that is typically located within the first 200 residues of these enzymes and a pair of glutamic acid residues that are 70 and 77 amino acids distal to the core motif (i.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The spacing between the core motif and the distal glutamates is invariant for all 46 M16A enzymes identified so far, except in the case of Axl1p where the spacing is 76 residues.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The histidine residues and most distal glutamate residue are putative zinc ligands, and mutational alteration of these residues inactivates IDE and Axl1p (9, 15, 16).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Some members of the M16A subfamily, including IDE, are sensitive to thiol modifiers, suggesting that a cysteine residue(s) is critical for proper structure of the active site or the overall tertiary or quaternary structure of these proteins (1, 15).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Sequence alignment of IDE and its yeast orthologs reveals two conserved cysteine residues.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	24	 One is within the core metalloprotease motif, and this residue can reportedly be altered without affecting enzymatic activity (15).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The other conserved cysteine is exactly 67 amino acids distal to the extended motif (HXXEHX69EX6EX67C).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	26	 This distal cysteine is not conserved in Escherichia coli Protease III, a bacterial M16A enzyme that is insensitive to thiol modifiers (17).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	27	The sequence similarity between IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p has prompted us to investigate the hypothesis that these proteins have conserved enzymatic properties and substrate specificity.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	28	 To this end, we present evidence indicating that rat IDE can substitute for Axl1p and Ste23p in a-factor production but not for the other known functions of Axl1p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	29	 More importantly, these findings establish yeast as a genetically tractable system for future studies of IDE function.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	30	 We have made practical use of this system to create and characterize novel mutations that alter the enzymatic properties of IDE.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The trace amount of YEPD added to the minimal media allows for limited survival of the auxotrophic haploid cells, which is necessary for the mating process.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Decreasing the YEPD amount shortens the survival window of the haploid cells and thus results in decreased mating efficiency.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	92	 The diploid cells that result from mating events are prototrophic, and thus the growth of diploids in this test is indicative of mating and a functional M16A enzyme.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Bud scars on 100 cells were evaluated and categorized into three patterns: axial, bipolar, and random.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	120	 The axial pattern was defined as bud scars located solely at one pole of the cell; the bipolar pattern had scars at both poles, and the random pattern displayed at least one bud scar in the region between both poles (8, 9).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	121	Evaluation of protein extracts from strains expressing the tagged proteases revealed that each tagged protein could be detected as a protein of the expected size by immunoblot (Fig.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	123	 The constitutive phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter was used to drive IDE expression, so the abundant expression of IDE was not unexpected.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Native promoters were used to drive Ste23p and Axl1p expression, and the relative abundance of Ste23p over Axl1p was somewhat unexpected, especially because Ste23p does not promote a-factor production as efficiently as Axl1p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Thus, the reason for the decreased ability of Ste23p to promote mating cannot be simply attributed to reduced protein expression by comparison to Axl1p.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	127	 To ascertain the effect of heterologous expression on the subcellular distribution of IDE, we subjected a total yeast lysate to differential fractionation.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	128	 By comparison of equal amounts of loaded protein by immunoblot, we observed that IDE and the yeast M16A enzymes were highly enriched in the particulate fraction associated with 16,000 x g centrifugation of the lysate (P16), although a significant amount of Ste23p was found in the supernatant fraction (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	129	 In this particular experiment, Axl1p was encoded on a multicopy plasmid to facilitate its detection, hence its stronger signal relative to that observed in total extracts (see Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	130	Although the localization of Ste23p has not been reported previously, Axl1p is known to transiently associate with components that form a sub-plasma membrane complex that is required for establishing bud sites.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	132	 To better understand the nature of association that IDE, Axl1p, and Ste23p have with the P16 yeast fraction, we performed extractions of the particulate fraction with various chaotropic agents (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Our analysis revealed that high pH and detergent treatments significantly disrupted the association of these proteins with the P16 fraction, whereas salt and buffer alone had a minor impact.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	134	 This profile is consistent with IDE, Ste23p, and Ax1p being peripheral membrane proteins and/or components of a large macromolecular complex that sediments under our experimental conditions.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Because of the high degree of enrichment for M16A enzymes in yeast particulate fractions, these samples were used exclusively as the source of activity for these in vitro assays.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Our analysis of enzymatic activity indicated that the IDE-containing samples had insulin cleaving activity, whereas samples containing Axl1p or Ste23p had no more activity than a sample prepared from yeast lacking these enzymes (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The source of the residual activity in these preparations is unknown but is likely due to a nonspecific enzymatic activity rather than that of an additional IDE homolog because 1,10-phenanthroline, a well documented IDE inhibitor, does not inhibit the residual activity (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Whether the Axl1p and Ste23p proteases in these preparations are incapable of cleaving insulin because of altered substrate specificity, sub-optimal reaction conditions, or other reasons has not yet been determined.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	148	 The inhibitor profile observed for insulin degrading activity in yeast was identical to that reported for IDE, which further establishes that yeast can synthesize IDE possessing all the enzymatic properties described for that of IDE found in metazoans (35).

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	158	 In similar fashion, we have now determined that IDE expression can rescue the mating defect of a yeast strain lacking both AXL1 and STE23 (MATa axl1 ste23) (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The mating defect in this strain is due to an inability to produce yeast a-factor, but whether Axl1p and Ste23p, and by extension IDE, participate directly or indirectly in pheromone production has not been rigorously established (9).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Nevertheless, this result establishes that IDE and the yeast enzymes Axl1p and Ste23p can similarly promote yeast a-factor production and thus have an evolutionarily conserved activity.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The simplest explanation for our findings is that these enzymes directly participate in pheromone production and that these enzymes have shared substrate specificity with respect to cleavage of the a-factor precursor.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	162	Yeast mating is sensitive to a number of variables, including available nutrients.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	164	 We have taken advantage of this property of yeast mating to evaluate the effectiveness of IDE in rescuing the mating defect of yeast lacking both Ste23p and Axl1p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	165	 As expected, we observed that decreasing nutrient conditions correlated with decreased mating for all strains.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Ste23p and IDE-expressing strains showed significant reductions in mating relative to the Axl1p-expressing strain (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Epitope-tagged versions of these enzymes had a similar activity profile in this assay (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The relatively poor ability of Ste23p to promote mating, with respect to Axl1p, is consistent with previous reports on the properties of this enzyme and may be attributable to a number of factors, including altered substrate specificity and/or an altered subcellular localization pattern that prevents interaction with substrates (9).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Likewise, the reduced mating observed for IDE may be attributable to similar factors.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The reduced mating observed for IDE and Ste23p-expressing cells is not simply due to low expression of these enzymes because both are expressed at significantly higher levels than Axl1p (see Fig.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	173	 A, the mating competence of MATa ste23 axl1 cells transformed with the indicated M16A enzyme encoded on a plasmid was evaluated using a patch mating test.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	174	 The selective growth of diploid cells on the minimal media is indicative of mating.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Patch mating tests were conducted using MAT lys1 lawns containing various amounts of nutrients (100, 10, and 1% YEPD; top to bottom).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Lowering the amount of YEPD in the lawn increases the stringency of the mating test and allows for discrimination of differences in mating efficiency not otherwise observable under permissive mating conditions (100% YEPD).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	177	 B, patch mating tests were conducted as in A but using MATa strains expressing HA-epitope tagged M16A proteases under mildly stringent mating conditions (10% YEPD).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	178	 C, the a-factor produced by each of the strains described in B was recovered from the walls of culture tubes using an organic solvent, and concentrated samples were analyzed by a spot halo test.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Each strain was grown to saturation in the same volume of media.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The formation of a spot in the lawn of MAT (RC757) cells is indicative of the presence of pheromone in the sample, and the relative pheromone potency can be determined by serial dilution of the sample.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	181	 The highest dilution having activity is referred to as the end point and is equivalent to a concentration of 12 pg/ microl of a-factor (28).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	182	 D, 2-fold serial dilutions of the IDE sample prepared in YEPD were spotted onto a lawn of RC631 (MATa sst2-1 his6 met1 can1 cyh2 rme ade2-1 ura1) serving as a control for the possibility that a toxic product was being produced by the IDE-expressing strain (27).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The strains used were IH1783 transformed with pRS316 (wild type (WT)), and Y272 transformed with pRS316 (vector), p80 (AXL1), p137 (STE23), pWS491 (IDE), pWS371 (AXL1-2HA), pWS482 (STE23-2HA), or pWS496 (IDE-2HA).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	184	  The most straightforward explanation for the reduced mating observed with Ste23p and IDE-expressing strains is that these strains have reduced a-factor production by comparison with the Axl1p-expressing strains.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Thus, we compared the relative amounts of a-factor produced by these strains over the lifetime of a culture.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	186	 We used a bioassay that relies on the natural growth-arrest response of MAT cells to the a-factor pheromone to detect and quantifiably measure a-factor activity in our samples.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Our analysis revealed that both IDE and Ste23p-expressing strains produce significantly less a-factor than an Axl1p-expressing strain, despite the fact that IDE and Ste23p are significantly overexpressed relative to Axl1p (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The IDE-derived sample was also bioassayed using MATa cells.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	189	 These cells fail to undergo growth arrest in response to the a-factor pheromone and thus served as a control for the unlikely scenario that IDE-expressing strains were producing a toxic secreted product.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	190	 No growth inhibition of MATa cells was observed with the IDE-derived sample (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	191	The a-factor mating pheromone is an isoprenylated and carboxymethylated dodecapeptide (YIIKGVFWDPAC[farnesyl]methyl).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Alterations to the chemical form of a-factor (e.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	193	 lipid removal or primary sequence alterations) can impact the function of this pheromone (37).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	194	 For example, a-factor lacking a tyrosine residue has 25% of the biological activity of full-length pheromone as judged by yeast mating tests (37).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Thus, the reduced production of a-factor pheromone by IDE and Ste23p-expressing yeast could be attributable to cleavage of the a-factor precursor at a site other than the Asn-Tyr cleavage site recognized by Axl1p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	196	 To determine whether the pheromone products produced by IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p were identical, we determined the mass of the a-factor species generated by these enzymes using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectroscopy.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Several major species were detected in these samples, including a 1629-Da peak that corresponds exactly to the mass of bona fide a-factor (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	198	 4, A to C; IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p samples, respectively).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	199	 This species was not in the negative control (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The 1629-Da species was still observed in the samples after the data were de-isotoped (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	201	 4, E to G) and remained absent in the negative control (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Based on these observations, we reasoned that the 1629-Da species is indeed a-factor, which implies that IDE, Ste23p and Axl1p have similar cleavage specificities.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	203	Although no other species were apparent in the de-isotoped data for the IDE and Ste23p-derived samples in the indicated mass range, additional species were evident in the other samples.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	204	 In the Axl1p-derived sample, three additional species were observed (1480, 1526, and 1718 Da) (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	205	 One distinct species was observed in the negative control (1587 Da).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	206	 These additional species were not reproducibly detected between experiments.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	207	2 The mass range shown in all panels is inclusive of the masses of the theoretical MFA1-derived a-factor species either lacking an N-terminal tyrosine (1467 Da) or extended by an N-terminal asparagine (1744 Da), but none of the four unidentified species can be matched to these alternative a-factor cleavage products.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The nature of these other species is therefore unknown.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	209	Genetic Evaluation of IDE Mutants The ability of yeast-expressed IDE to promote a-factor production suggests that yeast mating can be used as a phenotype to evaluate the function of IDE mutant alleles.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	210	 To test this hypothesis, we created site-directed and deletion mutations of IDE and tested the ability of these mutants to promote mating.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Using our genetic system, we confirmed that residues comprising the core metalloprotease motif (HXXEH) of IDE were essential for promoting mating (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	212	 These residues were required for the activity of Ste23p and Axl1p as well (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	213	 The most distal glutamate of the extended motif (HXXEHX69EX6E) was also determined to be essential for the activity of all three enzymes, whereas the penultimate glutamate was dispensable for Axl1p activity.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The penultimate glutamate is required for the activity of mitochondrial processing peptidase, an M16B protease, and has been proposed to aid in metal coordination of this enzyme (38).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	215	In addition to addressing the importance of established active site residues, we investigated the functional importance of cysteine residues in the function of IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	216	 We initially investigated the role of two cysteine residues that are invariably conserved between IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p (HXCEHX69EX6EX67C), suspecting that one of these residues is the likely target of sulfhydryl-modifying agents that inactivate certain M16A enzymes.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Independent mutations at these residues did not alter the abilities of IDE, Ste23p, or Axl1p to promote mating (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Mutation of the proximal cysteine of IDE (C110A) reportedly does not alter the thiol sensitivity profile of IDE (15), and similarly, we found that mutation of the distal cysteine of IDE (C257A) had no effect on the thiol sensitivity of IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	219	2 We also determined that combining the mutations in one molecule (C110A/C257A) did not alter mating function (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Moreover, the sensitivity of IDE to thiol modifiers was unaffected.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	221	2 Similar results were observed when other cysteine residues that are conserved between IDE and Ste23p or Axl1p (C819A and C414A, respectively) were mutated (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	222	M16A enzymes are large proteins, typically having a molecular mass in excess of 100,000 Da.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	223	 The metalloprotease motif of M16A enzymes is localized near the N-terminal end of these enzymes.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	224	 In the absence of structural data for these enzymes, we sought to determine whether the catalytic domain of IDE was self-contained within the N-terminal portion of the enzyme.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	225	 C-terminally truncated forms of IDE were created and evaluated for the ability to promote pheromone production.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	226	 These truncations were created as fusions to GFP, which in and of itself did not alter the ability of IDE to function (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Systematic deletions of the C terminus of the IDE revealed that relatively short truncations inactivated IDE as judged by yeast mating tests.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Deletion analysis of Axl1p revealed a similar requirement for an intact C terminus, although the deletion required for Axl1p inactivation was considerably larger (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Site-directed mutation of a residue conserved between IDE and Axl1p that was at the functional/nonfunctional truncation boundary of Axl1p (i.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Ser-965 in IDE and Ser-1081 in Axl1p) did not reveal an essential requirement for this residue in either enzyme (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	231	For the site-directed and truncation mutants created for this study, we evaluated protein expression.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	232	 By using immunoblots, the site-directed mutants were judged to be expressed as well as the relevant wild type control, except for Ste23p E192A that was expressed at a level approximately one-quarter that of wild type.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	233	2 With the exception of this mutant, our results rule out the trivial possibility that inactive IDE, Axl1p, and Ste23p mutants are nonfunctional because of poor expression.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	234	 We cannot exclude the possibility that these mutants are nonfunctional because of malfolding or other unknown reasons.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Evaluation of the Axl1p truncation mutants revealed that these were expressed at levels similar to that of the full-length Axl1p-GFP fusion protein.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	236	 By contrast, the IDE truncation mutants were not similarly expressed (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	237	 We observed decreased expression for certain truncations, suggesting that the C terminus of IDE, for reasons unknown, is required for normal steady state expression.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Decreased expression alone cannot account for the loss of activity for IDE, because one nonfunctional truncation (IDE-(1 to 973)) was expressed comparably to the full-length IDE-GFP fusion.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	239	 More importantly, the expression levels observed for all the nonfunctional truncations of Axl1p and IDE, which were encoded on multicopy plasmids, were significantly more than that of the respective full-length fusion encoded on a low copy plasmid, as judged by immunoblot analysis, suggesting that lowered expression alone cannot account for the absence of function in these mutants.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	247	  Yeast-expressed IDE Cannot Substitute for Other Known Functions of Axl1p Axl1p is involved in regulating several cellular processes besides pheromone production.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	248	 For example, Axl1p is required for repressing haploid invasive growth (14).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Haploid invasion occurs more readily upon the deletion of AXL1, and this phenotype can be fully reversed by the introduction of a plasmid-borne copy of AXL1.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	250	 In order to address the ability of IDE to substitute for this other function of Axl1p, the invasive phenotype of an Axl1p-deficient strain (axl1) that expressed IDE was examined.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	251	 We also investigated the ability of a protease active site mutant of Axl1p to suppress invasive growth.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	252	 We found that IDE expression could not repress invasive growth, whereas the Axl1p active site mutant suppressed invasive growth (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	253	Axl1p also has a well described role in the maintenance of the axial budding pattern of haploid yeast (9).

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Strains used are Sy3687 transformed with pRS316 (wild type (WT)), and Sy3721 (axl1::HIS3) transformed with pRS316 (vector), pWS371 (AXL1-2HA), pWS388 (axl1-2HA H68A), or pWS496 (IDE-2HA).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	283	  In this study, we have developed yeast as a tractable genetic model system for studying the functional properties of IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	284	 We have determined that yeast can be used to express a functional form of IDE and, more importantly, that IDE can promote a-factor production, an activity normally associated with the yeast enzymes Axl1p and Ste23p that have homology to IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	285	 These results imply that members of the M16A metalloprotease family, to which these enzymes belong, may have shared substrate specificity.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	286	 The fact that all three enzymes can promote a-factor production supports this hypothesis.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	287	 However, our inability to demonstrate insulin cleavage by the yeast enzymes implies that the substrate specificity of Ste23p and Axl1p may be more restricted.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Whether the yeast enzymes cleave other established IDE substrates is currently under investigation.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	289	 We are also investigating the ability of other M16A enzymes to cleave a-factor, because the studies of these enzymes may benefit from the development of a tractable genetic system.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	290	An additional finding from our study is that IDE is enriched but does not exclusively partition into a yeast particulate fraction.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	291	 We suspect that heterologously expressed IDE is either being incorporated into membranes as a loosely associated peripheral membrane protein or it is assembling into a macromolecular complex that partially sediments under the conditions used for isolation of the particulate fraction.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Although IDE reportedly associates with peroxisomes, this localization is unlikely under our experimental conditions because we did not impose an induction that is required for the formation of yeast peroxisomes (42).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Moreover, the putative C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal found in IDE, although potentially functional in yeast, is blocked by an epitope tag in our yeast-expressed enzyme.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Alternatively, IDE may be associating with other undefined membrane sites.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Axl1p has been reported to associate transiently with components that form a sub-plasma membrane complex that is required for budding (43).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Thus, it is also conceivable that IDE is assembling into this complex, but as a nonfunctional component.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Ultimately, defining the subcellular localization Ste23p may provide insight into the subcellular targeting of IDE because these two enzymes appear more conserved in sequence and enzymatic properties than IDE and Axl1p.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	311	 For the purposes of this figure, a conserved motif was defined as a block of amino acids (10) having 50% identical or highly conserved residues (i.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	312	 The second motif listed for domain I is found within the X69 sequence of the extended metalloprotease motif, whereas the third is found within the X57 sequence.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	313	 The residues in boldface were mutated in this study.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Neither Cys-257, which is found near the end of domain I, nor Cys-414, which is found at the beginning of domain IV, are within conserved motifs.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	315	  The genetic model system that we have developed should have far reaching utility for the characterization of mutant IDE alleles.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	316	 We have provided a practical example of this utility by detailing the functional importance of residues that compose the extended metalloprotease motif (HXXEHX69EX6E).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	317	 In addition, our mutational study allows us to make certain conclusions about the cysteine residue(s) that imparts the sensitivity of IDE to thiol modifiers.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Provided that a single cysteine residue is the target of thiol modification in IDE, our study excludes as targets the two cysteine residues that are invariably conserved between all three enzymes (Cys-110 and Cys-257 in IDE) and two cysteines that are semi-conserved between IDE and the yeast M16A enzymes (Cys-414 and Cys-819 in IDE).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	319	 The double C110A/C257A mutant also remains sensitive to thiol modifiers.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	320	 We are currently developing an in vitro assay for monitoring the activities of Ste23p and Axl1p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	321	 We expect a determination of whether these enzymes are sensitive to thiol modifiers to aid in the final identification of cysteine residues that are targeted by thiol modifiers in this enzyme family.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	322	 As a second practical example of the utility of our genetic system, we demonstrate for the first time that a C-terminal region is required for the activity of IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	323	 In the absence of structural information for IDE, we suspect that its C-terminal region may be required for stabilizing the overall tertiary or possibly quaternary structure of IDE or its active site.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	324	Our genetic system will also be useful for investigating the role of other residues in the function of IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	325	 For example, several conserved sequence motifs can be identified by multiple sequence alignment of M16A enzymes (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Our future studies will be aimed at determining whether these motifs are important for the function of M16A enzymes.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	327	 In addition, we will investigate whether E.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	328	 coli Protease III can support a-factor production in yeast.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	329	 If so, our system could conceivably be used to investigate the structure/function relationships for this enigmatic protease, which also lacks a defined cellular role (44).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	330	Another potential utility of our genetic model system is the theoretical ability to rapidly identify IDE mutants having altered substrate specificity.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	331	 We have already demonstrated that our system is amenable to screening specific mutant IDE alleles for the ability to promote mating.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	332	 The same approach could be used to identify IDE mutants having altered specificity toward the a-factor.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	333	 We envision a positive genetic selection that takes advantage of the observations that IDE-dependent mating is essentially nonexistent at reduced nutrient levels (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Under these highly stringent mating conditions, yeast harboring IDE mutants could be screened with the expectation that those having enhanced a-factor production would now be mating-competent.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	335	 These IDE mutants would represent candidates having improved a-factor recognition (i.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	336	 altered substrate specificity).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	337	 Conceivably, these mutants might also have altered specificity for insulin and/or A.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	338	 IDE mutants having enhanced activity toward these substrates could potentially be used as therapeutic agents for diabetes or Alzheimer disease.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	339	Our data clearly demonstrate that the Axl1p/Ste23p-dependent step in a-factor production can be supported by IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	340	 This result, in and of itself, is not surprising given the high degree of similarity between these enzymes.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Of greater curiosity is the observation that all the yeast enzymes required for a-factor production can be functionally replaced by their mammalian counterparts.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	342	 The first three steps associated with a-factor production (i.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	343	 isoprenylation, CaaX proteolysis, and carboxymethylation) are part of the biosynthetic pathway of isoprenylated proteins, such as Ras and RhoB.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	344	 The subsequent two proteolytic steps associated with a-factor production have no analogous counterparts in mammals.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	345	 Thus, the ability of mammalian enzymes to promote these latter steps is entirely serendipitous, or it reflects the existence of an orphan biosynthetic pathway that integrates all the steps associated with a-factor biosynthesis.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	346	 If the latter, by analogy, we suspect that the molecule produced by this pathway would serve as a secreted signaling molecule, possibly functioning to regulate cell-cell fusion events such as those that occur during the development of certain tissues.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	347	 Curiously, the morphological and biochemical differentiation of L6 myoblasts into myotubes has been reported to involve IDE (45, 46).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Thus, by analogy to a-factor production, we hypothesize that a role of IDE in these cells might be to produce a signaling molecule derived from a precursor having an aliphatic amino acid motif and an N-terminal extension that is readily cleaved by IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	349	 Whether such a molecule exists in mammalian systems remains to be determined.

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, February 18, 2005.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	4	Clearance of A is currently receiving considerable attention as a key regulatory mechanism of brain A levels.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	5	 There appear to be two paths for A clearance in the brain.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	6	 One pathway involves the equilibration of A between the central nervous system and plasma mediated through cerebral spinal fluid (9 to 11).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The other pathway involves clearance of A through proteolysis (12 to 15).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	8	 There are a number of peptidases that have been implicated in A clearance.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Those that have received the most attention and are supported by in vivo studies in peptidase-deficient mice include neprilysin (16, 17), insulysin (IDE) (18, 19), and endothelin-converting enzyme (20, 21).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Genetic studies have further suggested a linkage between late onset AD and IDE.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	11	 A linkage of a region of chromosome 10q to late onset Alzheimer disease has been reported by several groups (22 to 25).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This region of the chromosome is within 195 kilobases of the IDE gene.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, to date this analysis has not been refined to the point where the linkage to IDE can be unequivocally established.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	14	56 [EC] ) is an 110-kDa zinc metallopeptidase containing an inverted form of the signature active site sequence (HXXEH) and is thus known as an inverzincin.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The enzyme is primarily cytosolic, although a fraction of the enzyme is peroxisomal due to the presence of a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence (26).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	16	 IDE has also been reported as being located on the cell surface and secreted (27 to 29).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	17	 (30) have shown that naturally occurring IDE missense mutations in the rat result in decreased insulin and A degradation.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Primary neuronal cultures derived from these rats secrete increased levels of A peptides; however, the steady-state level of brain A in these animals is unaffected, suggesting compensatory mechanisms.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	19	The specificity of IDE is complex.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The enzyme cleaves a variety of peptides primarily, but not exclusively, at basic or bulky hydrophobic residues (31, 32).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Kurochkin (33) has suggested that IDE cleaves peptides that have a propensity to form -pleated sheet structures.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Cleavage of A by IDE results in the loss of the neurotoxic effects of the peptide and prevents the deposition of A onto a synthetic amyloid deposit (34).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	23	 We have recently shown that IDE exhibits allosteric properties being activated by peptide substrates.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Interestingly, peptides activated IDE toward A peptide cleavage but not toward insulin cleavage (35).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	25	 We further established that IDE exists as a mixture of monomers, dimers, and tetramers.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	26	 During the course of our studies on the allosteric properties of IDE, we generated a number of active site mutants as control enzymes.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	27	 We noted that although the activity of these mutants was significantly reduced, the residual catalytic properties were altered.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We report here the results of these studies.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	29	Activity Assays IDE activity was routinely measured with the fluorogenic peptide Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The increase in fluorescence that occurred upon cleavage of the peptide between residues R and K (36) was followed on a SpectraMax Gemini XS fluorescence plate reader using an excitation wavelength of 318 nm and an emission wavelength of 419 nm.

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	35	Preparation and Purification of IDE Mutants The various His112 and Glu111 rat IDE mutants were prepared in pFast Bac HTb using the site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene.

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	41	  Based on the secondary structure predicting programs PHD (38) and PHDsec (39), IDE is predicted to have a helical region from residues 107 to 116, which encompasses the mutated residues.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	42	 None of the mutations were predicted to affect the ability of this region to form a helix.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	43	Recombinant IDE and the various mutants were expressed in Sf-9 cells as a fusion protein containing an N-terminal hexahistidine affinity tag followed by a linker containing a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site (35).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Wild type and IDE mutants were purified on a His-Select HC nickel affinity gel column (Sigma).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	45	 In most experiments, the enzyme was used as the His6-IDE; however, to verify the lack of an effect of the N-terminal hexahistidine and linker, tobacco etch virus protease was used to remove this region as previously described (35).

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The approach to equilibrium was considered to be complete when scans made 6 h apart were indistinguishable.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Typically, equilibration times equal to or greater than 20 h met this criterion.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Five scans were averaged for each sample at each rotor speed.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Previous results (3) indicated that IDE self-associates in a monomer-dimer-tetramer pattern.

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The His112 mutant transiently expressed in COS cells appeared to be inactive as measured in crude extracts with insulin as substrate.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	162	 However, this mutant retained the ability to bind insulin as determined by cross-linking studies (37).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	163	 It should be noted that insulin cross-linking was actually increased with the mutant relative to the wild type enzyme and was attributed to a "relaxation of a rigid conformation stabilized by zinc.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	164	" Evidence for this increased flexibility at the active site came from the demonstration that treatment of the native enzyme with o-phenanthroline increased the extent of cross-linking; however, o-phenanthroline did not increase cross-linking with the H112Q mutant.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	165	Using radioactive zinc, it was concluded that the H112Q mutant did not bind zinc.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Our finding that the residual activity of the two His112 mutants, but not the Glu111 mutants, can be further reduced by treatment with metal chelators indicates that these mutants do contain zinc but that the zinc is bound considerably more weakly than with the native protein.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Thus, our results with both the His112 and Glu111 mutants support and extend the general conclusions of Perlman and Rosner (37) that mutation of the active site histidine causes a change in the conformation about the active site of IDE.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The results presented here suggest that this is not due to the loss of zinc binding but probably due to local conformational changes that occur within the active site.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	169	A rather surprising finding is that mutation of either the catalytic glutamate or the zinc coordinating histidine converts the substrate-velocity curves from sigmoidal to hyperbolic.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Thus, the homotropic allosteric activation previously reported by us (35) is absent in the mutants.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Since it has been established that IDE can exist in an oligomeric state (32, 35, 50, 51), one possible explanation is that the active site of IDE is at the interface of two subunits and that mutation of the active site residues produces a local conformational change that affects subunit interaction.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	172	 This does not appear to be the case, since both we (35) and Perlman et al.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	173	 (42) have shown that formation of oligomers containing active and inactive subunits does not abrogate activity.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	174	 However, such a mixed oligomer does eliminate allosteric activation (35).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Thus, the data is probably explained by the proposal that the active site mutations produce a local conformational change that is transmitted to the adjacent subunit.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Although the end result is the same, it appears that there are differences in the local conformational changes produced by mutating the catalytic glutamate and mutating the zinc-coordinating histidine.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	177	 This is most evident from the observation that the cleavage profile for -endorphin is altered in the glutamate mutants but not the histidine mutants.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	178	In addition to the active site mutations affecting the kinetics of substrate binding, these mutations also desensitized the enzyme to activation by triphosphates in the form of ATP or triphosphate itself.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The large increase in activity seen with the native enzyme was significantly reduced to either no effect or less than a 3-fold increase in activity with the glutamate mutants.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Even more amazing was the effect seen with the active site histidine mutants, particularly H112Q.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	181	 In this case, triphosphate changed from an activator to a rather potent inhibitor.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	182	 This clearly indicates that the active site of these mutants is conformationally different from the wild type enzyme and is further modulated by additional conformational changes produced by the binding of the triphosphate moiety.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	183	The sedimentation equilibrium data show that, with the exception of the H112D mutant, both the native enzyme and the mutants are predominantly monomeric.

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Such aggregation may reflect a conformational change due to triphosphate binding.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Thus, there is no obvious correlation between oligomeric state and activity, and the finding of a monomeric native enzyme is not consistent with its allosteric properties.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	187	 On the other hand, gel filtration shows the native enzyme existing as dimers and tetramers, and at higher protein concentrations dynamic light scattering shows exclusively tetramers.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Thus, it is clear that IDE can exist in a number of different oligomerization states.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	189	 We would suggest that the allosteric kinetics observed can result from substrate induced oligomerization.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	190	 In the case of mutant IDE, perhaps an altered local conformational change at the active site is transmitted through the protein such that it prevents the formation of oligomers.

0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	3	Type 2 diabetes is characterized by the loss of pancreatic ss-cell mass, accompanied by the presence of islet amyloid deposits in the pancreas (1).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The major component of islet amyloid is amylin (also known as islet amyloid polypeptide), a polypeptide copackaged and cosecreted with insulin by pancreatic ss-cells (2).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	5	 It is presently unclear whether islet amyloid merely is a consequence of diabetes or actually contributes to the progression of the disease.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, there is evidence that intermediate precursors of amylin fibrils are cytotoxic to ss-cells, whereas mature amyloid fibrils are not toxic, suggesting that ss-cell toxicity may precede deposition of islet amyloid (3,4).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Because amylin is continually produced in individuals without type 2 diabetes, the mere presence of amylin is insufficient to induce amylin-induced ss-cell toxicity and islet amyloid.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Transgenic animals producing human (amyloidogenic) amylin fail to develop islet amyloid (5 to 7), but when additional diabetic traits are introduced, islet amyloid is detected (8 to 10).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Therefore, there is a protective mechanism that prevents amyloid deposition under normal conditions, but is impaired under diabetic conditions.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Because proteolysis is a major pathway in the regulation of protein levels, degradation of amylin may contribute to the prevention of islet amyloid aggregation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	11	 ss-cell toxicity and islet amyloid may therefore result from an imbalance in amylin levels because of impaired degradation of amylin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	12	 At present, our understanding of the proteolytic pathways that contribute to the degradation of amylin is incomplete.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	13	The enzyme responsible for the cellular proteolysis of insulin is insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) (11).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The substrate specificity of IDE is for amyloidogenic polypeptides, including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), glucagon, and the ss-amyloid peptide found in Alzheimer s disease, and therefore may act as a scavenger that clears amyloidogenic peptides to prevent amyloid deposition (11,12).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Recently, we showed that amylin was also an IDE substrate (13).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Therefore, IDE may be involved in controlling the levels of amylin by degradation, similar to its role in regulating the levels of the Alzheimer s-related ss-amyloid peptide (14).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Both the GK rat model of type 2 diabetes, in which IDE has been identified as a diabetes susceptibility gene, and the recently described IDE-null mice show impaired glucose metabolism.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In both models, cellular insulin-degrading activity has been found to be impaired.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Therefore, it is possible that in diabetes, IDE dysfunction also results in impaired amylin degradation, increased amylin aggregation, and, eventually, islet amyloid deposition.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The present study was performed to address the following questions: 1) Are amylin and insulin degraded in ss-cells by a common pathway? 2) Does inhibition of IDE alter amylin degradation and islet amyloid formation? and 3) Does IDE inhibition affect the cytotoxic properties of amylin toward ss-cells? To answer these questions, a pancreatic ss-cell to derived cell line was used to characterize amylin degradation.

0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	83	 At all concentrations, unlabeled insulin was a more effective inhibitor than amylin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Similarly, the degradation of 125I-insulin was inhibited by both amylin and insulin (Fig.

0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	86	 These observations were consistent with previously determined enzymatic properties of IDE, in which insulin had a three- to sixfold higher affinity for purified IDE than amylin (13).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Two possible complications of the cell culture system are the potential for direct interaction between human amylin and insulin (20) and membrane perturbations that may impede receptor-mediated uptake of substrates (3).

0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Therefore, an IDE inhibitor increased the ability of amylin to reduce RIN-m5F cell viability.

0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Bacitracin increases amylin-induced cytotoxicity.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	122	 RIN-m5F cells were treated with 0, 10, 100, or 1,000 nmol/l human amylin or 1,000 nmol/l rat amylin, as indicated.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Cells were cultured in the absence () or presence () of the IDE inhibitor bacitracin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Cell toxicity was assessed by the degree of MTT reduction by the cells (n = 6).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	125	The factors that prevent amylin fibril formation, ss-cell death, and islet amyloid deposition in the nondisease state are not understood.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Because amylin is continually produced in nondiabetic humans with no amyloid formation, the mere presence of amylin is insufficient to cause fibril formation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Indeed, transgenic animals overexpressing human amylin do not form amyloid deposits (5 to 7,25), confirming that elevated amylin levels alone are insufficient for amyloid formation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	128	 However, when diabetic conditions are introduced, such as the ob mutation, growth hormone/steroid treatment, or a high-fat diet, these animals develop islet amyloid, islet dysfunction, reduced insulin secretion, and hyperglycemia (8 to 10).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Therefore, in type 2 diabetes, the balance shifts from amylin clearance to deposition, either by increased amounts of a factor that promotes amylin aggregation or decreased amounts of a factor that clears amylin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Although there have been numerous studies regarding amylin synthesis and secretion, at present there have been few studies of amylin degradation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	131	The enzyme responsible for the intracellular degradation of insulin is IDE, a cytosolic metallothioprotease also known as insulysin (11,26).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The primary function of IDE in mammalian tissues has traditionally been thought to be the degradation of insulin, but a number of other proteins have been identified as IDE substrates, including proteins structurally related to insulin, such as proinsulin, IGF-II, and relaxin, and seemingly unrelated peptides, such as ANP and glucagon (11).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	133	 However, insulin, ANP, and glucagon all contain regions that can form ss-pleated sheets and are potentially amyloid forming (27).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	134	 It has been proposed that rather than targeting a primary sequence motif, IDE is specific toward amyloidogenic peptides (28), a concept supported by findings that IDE also degrades amylin and ss-amyloid peptide (13,29,30).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Recent studies have supported a role for IDE in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer s disease, two conditions characterized by amyloid.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Possible genetic linkages to type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer s disease have been mapped to the chromosomal region of the IDE gene (31 to 34).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	137	 In the GK rat, a model of type 2 diabetes, IDE has been identified as a diabetes susceptibility gene; the mutations associated with this model result in lower cellular insulin degradation, hyperglycemia, reduced lipogenesis in fat cells, and reduced glucose uptake in vivo (35).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The recently described IDE-null mouse model displays impaired insulin and ss-amyloid degradation, as well as hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, and cerebral accumulation of ss-amyloid, hallmarks of both type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer s disease (36).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Thus, the evidence is mounting that IDE plays a major role in diseases characterized by amyloid formation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	140	In a previous study using cell-free extracts (13), IDE readily degraded amylin, but with a lower affinity than for insulin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Radiolabeled amylin covalently cross-linked to IDE, and a monoclonal antibody directed against IDE immunoprecipitated both insulin- and amylin-degrading activities, confirming that IDE was the amylin-degrading protease.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	142	 We have extended those findings to a rat ss-cell to derived line.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Both amylin and insulin were degraded by RIN-m5F cells, but insulin was degraded much more slowly.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Possible reasons for this observation include differences in binding and internalization through the different receptors or differences in receptor availability (e.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	145	, by desensitization or cell toxicity).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	146	 The differences may also be attributed to the nature of the assay.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Unlike amylin, multiple cleavages are required to produce TCA-soluble fragments of insulin, and therefore, this assay tends to underestimate the level of insulin degradation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Amylin degradation began quickly, then leveled off with time.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	149	 The probable explanation for this observation is based on insulin secretion by the cells.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	150	 The cells were changed into fresh media containing labeled substrates, so initially there was no endogenously produced insulin in the media.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	151	 RIN cells rapidly secreted insulin (reaching 5 to 10 nmol/l in 1 h), which would act as a competitive inhibitor of amylin degradation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Because the amylin was present in tracer amounts, sufficient insulin to competitively inhibit amylin degradation may well have been produced within 30 min.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Both insulin and amylin were capable of competitive inhibition of either substrate, with insulin in general a better competitive inhibitor than amylin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	154	 As discussed above, this is likely attributable to the greater affinity of insulin for IDE and possibly also to the different internalization properties for insulin and amylin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The efficiency of unlabeled insulin inhibition of insulin degradation was consistent with that in previous reports showing a 50% inhibition of 50 to 100 nmol/l insulin using RIN-m5F cells (37).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Taken together, the data suggest that insulin and amylin share a common pathway of degradation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	157	The specificity of amylin- and insulin-degrading activity was investigated using the IDE inhibitor bacitracin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Although bacitracin is not a specific inhibitor of IDE, other IDE inhibitors (e.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	159	, N-ethylmaleimide and 1,10-phenanthroline) were highly toxic to RIN-m5F cells (R.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	160	, unpublished observations), whereas bacitracin was well tolerated by the cells.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Amylin and insulin degradation by RIN-m5F cells was markedly inhibited by bacitracin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Bacitracin also accelerated islet amyloid formation at all amylin concentrations, suggesting that inhibition of amylin degradation accelerates amylin aggregation and amyloid deposition.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Because amylin has been implicated in ss-cell death, cell viability was examined under the same conditions.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Cytotoxicity induced by human amylin was markedly increased with bacitracin treatment, whereas rat amylin had no effect, suggesting that amylin degradation is responsible for reducing cell toxicity caused by amylin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Amylin-induced cytotoxicity in ss-cells has been shown to be caused by intermediate amylin precursors rather than mature amyloid (3).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	166	 If IDE degrades amylin monomers, then the formation of both intermediate precursors and amyloid fibrils would be prevented.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The experiments performed here (48-h treatment of freshly prepared amylin) cannot determine which amylin species caused toxicity in RIN cells.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	168	 However, the degree of cell death seen with bacitracin treatment was increased to the maximum attained, even at the lowest amylin concentration, which could mean that the toxicity preceded amyloid deposition.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Although the amylin concentration required for detection of amyloid and cell toxicity (10 to 100 nmol/l) is high relative to circulating levels, the local amylin concentration around ss-cells is unknown, but may well be higher, especially under conditions that stimulate insulin and amylin secretion.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	170	In summary, RIN-m5F cells clear amylin through a bacitracin-sensitive mechanism with properties consistent with those of IDE.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Inhibition of this mechanism increased amyloid formation and cell toxicity.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	172	 These data are consistent with the emerging concept of a role for IDE in diseases characterized by amyloid.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	173	 In this regard, it is interesting to note again that transgenic animals expressing human amylin in general do not develop islet amyloid unless diabetic conditions are introduced.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	174	 One of these conditions is a high-fat diet (9).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Interestingly, it has been shown that increased lipid levels result in impaired insulin degradation (38) and free fatty acids directly inhibit IDE activity (39).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The combination of increased expression of amyloidogenic amylin and impaired insulin-degrading activity may result in the formation of islet amyloid in these models.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Therefore, it is possible that conditions leading to impaired IDE activity (e.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	178	, elevated free fatty acids) contribute to amylin accumulation and aggregation, ss-cell toxicity, islet amyloid formation, and the progression of type 2 diabetes.
