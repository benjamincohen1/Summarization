The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) encodes a transmembrane protein (CFTR) which functions in part as a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated chloride channel. CFTR expression is controlled temporally and cell specifically by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Insight into CFTR regulation could be facilitated by the successful introduction of the entire 230 kb human CFTR and adjacent sequences into mammalian cells. To this end, we have introduced two different CFTR-containing yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) (320 and 620 kb) into Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO) cells. Clonal cell lines containing human CFTR were identified by PCR, and the genetic and functional analyses of one clone containing each YAC are described. Integration of the human CFTR-containing YACs into the CHO genome at a unique site in each cell line was demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Southern blot analysis suggested that on the order of one copy of human CFTR was integrated per CHO cell genome. Fiber-FISH and restriction analysis suggested that CFTR remained grossly intact. Northern analysis showed full-length, human CFTR mRNA. Immunoprecipitation followed by phosphorylation with protein kinase demonstrated mature, glycosylated CFTR. Finally, chloride secretion in response to cAMP indicated the functional nature of the human CFTR. This study provides several novel results including: (i) functional human CFTRcan be expressed from these YACs; (ii) CHO cells are a permissive environment for expression of human CFTR; (iii) the level of human CFTR expression in CHO cells is unexpectedly high given the lack of endogenous CFTR production; and (iv) the suggestion by Fiber-FISH of CFTR integrity correlates with functional gene expression. These YACs and the cell lines derived from them should be useful tools for the study of CFTR expression. INTRODUCTION
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population (1 ). It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) leading to the loss of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-stimulated chloride efflux from epithelial cells (2 -4 ). CFTR is a 230 kb gene encoding a 1480 amino acid transmembrane protein which functions as a chloride channel with several other regulatory properties (5 ,6 ). More than 600 mutations in CFTR have been identified in individuals with CF (7 ). The most common mutation, a deletion of 3 bp leading to the loss of a phenylalanine residue at position 508, is found in nearly 70% of CF alleles (8 ).
CFTR is expressed primarily in exocrine epithelia from the lung, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and sweat glands (9 -11 ). The expression is generally low in these tissues, although a few specific epithelial cell types, such as the serous cells in the submucosal glands of the lung, have relatively high level expression (12 ). The mechanisms that govern the level and the cell specific regulation of CFTR expression have been explored but remain poorly understood. The putative promoter region lies within 3800 bp of the start site of CFTR transcription and supports low level expression of reporter genes in vitro (13 -16 ). CFTR expression can be induced by cAMP (17 ) and suppressed by phorbol ester (18 ,19 ). McDonald et al. (20 ) demonstrated that the induction of CFTR expression by protein kinase A is mediated by an 8 bp cAMP responsive element upstream from CFTR. Pittman et al. (21 ) analyzed the function of an inverted CCAAT element at -132 to -119 upstream from CFTR in detail. They showed that transcription factor binding to this element confers both basal and cAMP-induced CFTR expression. The level of CFTR expression also appears to be related to the state of cellular differentiation (22 ). Additional regulatory elements have been shown to lie within this 5'-flanking region as well as within the first CFTR intron (23 ). DNase I hypersensitivity sites have been demonstrated within the 120 kb upstream of CFTR, but no correlation with cell type specific CFTR expression was observed (24 ). Taken together, these studies provide little insight into the exact mechanisms that determine the level and specificity of CFTR expression.
One novel approach to study CFTR expression is to introduce the entire 230 kb gene and flanking sequences into mammalian cells. Obstacles to this approach include: (i) obtaining an appropriate vector containing a full-length, human CFTR without deletions, mutations or rearrangements; (ii) maintaining the integrity of CFTR during vector propagation; and (iii) transferring CFTR intact into appropriate mammalian cells. Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) provide potential vectors for such a study. YACs containing human CFTR were generated soon after the gene was identified (25 ,26 ). Although the genetic structure of these YACs has been studied, the functionality of CFTR contained within them has not been established.
The goal of the present study was to determine if two different YACs containing full-length, human CFTR and ~45 or 335 kb of adjacent upstream sequence can produce functional human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) in mammalian cells. The analyses that follow demonstrate the functionality of the human CFTR contained within each YAC. RESULTS Human CFTR-containing YACs are used to generate stable Chinese hamster ovary cell lines
Each YAC used in this study contains full-length, human CFTR (Fig. 1 ). The neomycin resistance gene (neor) was introduced into the right arm of each YAC and the extent of human sequence surrounding CFTR was determined by restriction analysis. The smaller YAC, yCFTR325-Neo, is ~320 kb and contains 45 kb of flanking sequence upstream from the CFTR transcriptional unit and 30 kb of 3'-flanking DNA. The larger YAC, yCFTR8-Neo, is ~620 kb and contains 335 kb of 5'-flanking and 40 kb of 3'-flanking DNA.

Map of the two YACs used in this study. yCFTR325-Neo is ~320 kb and contains 45 kb of 5'-flanking and 30 kb of 3'-flanking DNA. yCFTR8-Neo is ~620 kb and contains 335 kb of 5'-flanking and 40 kb of 3'-flanking DNA. CFTR transcription start site is indicated by the arrow. The NruI sites in the human DNA as well as the two sites in the right YAC arm are indicated by `N'.
In separate experiments, Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO) cells were fused with yeast spheroplasts containing one of the two YACs. CHO cells that incorporated neor were identified by their clonal growth in the presence of G418. Approximately 50 colonies of CHO cells from each YAC transfer were present after 2 weeks of G418 selection. Twenty clones derived using the smaller YAC and 27 clones derived using the larger YAC were randomly selected and sub-cultured. Fourteen clones containing the smaller YAC and seven containing the larger YAC were randomly selected and analyzed to determine if they contained human CFTR, as described below.
Screening of CHO cell clones for human CFTR was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of genomic DNA using two sets of intron primers, one spanning exon 2 and the other, exon 6a. These primers were chosen toward the 5'-end of the gene since neor was located beyond the 3'-end of CFTR. Seven out of 14 clones derived using the smaller YAC and the six out of seven clones derived from the larger YAC were positive for CFTR exons 2 and 6a. Control CHO cell DNA was negative under identical reaction conditions. Clones positive for both exons were analyzed for CFTR mRNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using primers spanning exon 7 to exon 9. Three out of seven clones derived using the smaller YAC and four out of six clones derived using the larger YAC were positive. Control CHO cell RNA was negative under identical reaction conditions (data not shown). Based on this screening, candidates were chosen for further study. The detailed genetic and functional analyses of the two clones with the highest level of CFTR mRNA are described below. The cell line designated CS2/C5 was derived using yCFTR325-Neo, and CS1/F2 was derived using yCFTR8-Neo. A single site of integration is identified in each cell line
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on metaphase nuclei from CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 to determine the site of CFTR integration (Fig. 2 ). Using a YAC derived from y37AB12 (25 ) containing the entire CFTR as a probe, the human CFTR was localized to a single locus in each clone. The human CFTR was integrated at CHO chromosome band 4p21-23 in the CS2/C5 cell line and at CHO chromosome band 5q27 in the CS1/F2 cell line.

(A) yCFTR325-Neo integrated into CHO chromosome band 4p21-23 in the cell line CS2/C5. (B) yCFTR8-Neo integrated into CHO chromosome band 5q27 in the cell line CS1/F2. No hybridization was seen in control CHO cells (data not shown).
Southern analysis was performed to determine the copy number of human CFTR incorporated into each CHO cell clone (Fig. 3 ). Genomic DNA from CS2/C5, CS1/F2, control CHO cells and HT-1080 (a pseudodiploid human fibrosarcoma cell line; ATCC CCL 121) was digested with EcoRI and hybridized to a cDNA fragment containing part of the CFTR 3'-untranslated region within exon 24. The expected 2.2 kb single band was seen in CS2/C5, CS1/F2 and HT-1080, but not in control CHO. CFTR copy number was assessed by comparing the clones with HT-1080. The intensity of the bands from 10 [mu]g of CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 DNA was similar to that obtained from 5 [mu]g of HT-1080 DNA. These data suggest that on the order of one copy of CFTR was integrated into the CHO genome in each cell line. Similar results are shown for CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 compared with CFPAC-1 cells [a hyperdiploid human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line (ATCC CRL 1918)].

The integrity of the human CFTR present in the CHO cell clones was assessed by Fiber-FISH (Fig. 4 ). DNA strands from both CFTR-containing clones, CHO cells and normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were analyzed. The probes used to delineate human CFTR included the human CFTR-containing YAC used for FISH (Fig. 2 ) and cosmids cW44 (27 ) containing exon 1 and cf24 (a gift from Jeff Touchman and Eric Green, NIH, Bethesda, MD) containing exons 20 to 24. The rhodamine labeled cosmids delineate the ends of the CFTR coding region and the fluorescein-labeled YAC probe extends 45 kb upstream and 30 kb downstream from the 230 kb gene. The expected hybridization pattern was seen in PBL as well as in DNA fibers obtained from CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 cells. DNA fibers from control CHO cells did not hybridize with any of the CFTR probes. These data not only confirm the presence of human CFTR in both clones, but suggest that the gene is grossly intact.

Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA from CS2/C5, CS1/F2, control CHO and human HT-1080 cells was performed to assess the integrity of the integrated CFTR (Fig. 5 ). The DNA was digested with EcoRI, separated on a 0.8% agarose gel and hybridized to a probe comprising the full-length, human CFTR cDNA which should hybridize to any EcoRI fragments which contain CFTR exons. The data shows that the two clones have very similar hybridization patterns, and that the bands are nearly identical to the pattern seen in the control human DNA. The genomic DNAs from the yeast containing each YAC also have a similar hybridization pattern to the clones and to the human genomic DNA, although the faintest bands in the yeast are difficult to visualize in the mammalian cells. This data suggests a high degree of integrity of the majority of the integrated human CFTR in the CHO cell lines over the 230 kb of coding sequence and is consistent with our observation of full-length CFTR mRNA and functional protein. Human CFTR mRNA and protein are expressed in both CHO cell lines
The presence of the human CFTR mRNA was determined by Northern analysis (Fig. 6 ). A 6.5 kb mRNA transcript was observed in both CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 cells. This transcript was similar in size to the CFTR mRNA produced by T84 cells which served as a positive control for CFTR expression (13 ). No corresponding transcript was detected in control CHO cells or normal human airway epithelial cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that both CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 produce a sufficient amount of full-length, human CFTR mRNA to be detected not only by RT-PCR but by Northern analysis.
The presence of human CFTR was determined by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with an antibody to the C-terminus of CFTR, phosphorylation with [[gamma]-32P]adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 7 ). Both clones produced mature, glycosylated CFTR which could be phosphorylated in vitro. A similar CFTR profile was seen in T84 cells. No corresponding band was observed in the control CHO cell lysate. The appearance of mature, human CFTR in CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 cells demonstrates that CHO cells possess the cellular machinery to not only transcribe CFTR from the introduced YAC but to translate and appropriately process the protein.

Human CFTR is functional in both CHO cell lines
The function of the human CFTR produced by the CHO cell lines CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 was assessed by cAMP-stimulated 36Cl- efflux (Fig. 8 ). cAMP stimulation was provided by the addition of forskolin and non-hydrolyzable analogues of cAMP after a period of equilibration. A significant rise in 36Cl- efflux was observed 30-60 s after cAMP stimulation in both clones (p  < 0.05). The level of 36Cl- efflux in response to cAMP in early passage CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 cells was similar to that observed in T84 cells (p  < 0.01). There was no analogous cAMP-stimulated 36Cl- efflux in control CHO cells or in another clonal CHO cell line (S1) derived using a 140 kb YAC containing neor and human DNA unrelated to CFTR. In the absence of endogenous CFTR activity in CHO cells, the release of 36Cl- from the cell layer of the clones in response to cAMP indicates the presence of functional human CFTR produced from the introduced YACs.

This study describes the generation of two clonal CHO cell lines, CS2/C5 and CS1/F2, containing full-length, human CFTR. These cell lines were derived from the fusion of CHO cells with yeast spheroplasts containing two different YACs which include human CFTR and ~75 or 375 kb of adjacent sequences. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on metaphase nuclei to indicate the site of YAC integration. A single site of integration on a different CHO chromosome was found in each cell line. Southern analysis suggested that each clone most likely contains on the order of one copy of human CFTR per CHO cell genome. Fiber-FISH suggested the gross structural integrity of the transferred CFTR in both cell lines. The integrity of the integrated CFTR was indicated further by restriction analysis of genomic DNA. These results suggested that the majority of human CFTR was grossly intact and correlated with functionalCFTR production, potentially extending the application of Fiber-FISH beyond its current status as a genetic mapping tool (28 ,29 ). The Fiber-FISH also suggested that the flanking sequences common to both YACs were present in both cell lines. Finally, the sequence-tagged site, sL12, located at the extreme 5'-end of yCFTR8-Neo (26 ) was detected in DNA from CS1/F2 cells suggesting that this larger YAC is incorporated in its entirety into the CHO genome (data not shown).
The parental YACs used in these experiments were constructed several years ago (25 ,26 ). Although the human CFTR contained in these YACs has been shown to be grossly intact, even after transfer into Chinese hamster fibroblasts (30 ), the functionality of the CFTR has not been established until now. The present study demonstrates the production of full-length CFTR mRNA and functional protein by both CS2/C5 and CS1/F2. Human CFTR production in these cell lines implies that the regulatory elements needed for gene expression are contained within these YACs. The ability of these cells to produce mature and functional protein at the cell surface for more than 15 passages is demonstrated by cAMP-stimulated 36Cl- efflux. CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 are distinctive from the other clonal lines generated in this study because their CFTR mRNA can be detected by both RT-PCR and Northern analysis. None of the other cell lines created in this study and analyzed by Northern analysis have comparable mRNA transcripts.
The rate of 36Cl- efflux observed in both CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 at early passages is similar to that seen in T84 cells, despite the fact that they have lower CFTR mRNA and protein levels than T84 cells. This data supports previous studies in which cAMP-mediated chloride efflux was a sensitive indicator of functional protein without direct correlation with the level of CFTR expression (31 ).
Ordinarily, YAC gene transfer is carried out in a mammalian cell line in which the gene of interest is endogenously expressed, placing the YAC into an environment likely to be permissive for the human promoter (32 -35 ). In contrast, the present study demonstrates YAC-mediated gene transfer into cells lacking endogenous CFTR production (36 ,37 ). It is unclear why only human CFTR appears to be functionally expressed when both the endogenous and transferred genes could potentially interact with the same basal transcription factors. Several aspects of YAC integration may support expression of the transferred human CFTR in these CHO cell clones. For example, it has been suggested that transferred YACs may retain a chromatin structure that favors expression (38 ). CFTR expression from these YACs may be favored by the requirement that the nearby neor has to be expressed in order for the cells to survive, forcing the adjacent chromatin to remain open. In addition, the human and hamster genes could have different affinities for DNA binding proteins. An alternative explanation is that the hamster CFTR is mutated and cannot produce functional CFTR. To better understand the differential expression of the hamster and human genes, it would be useful to directly compare the structure of the two genes. However, this work remains to be done because hamster CFTR has not yet been extensively characterized. In the present studies, full length human CFTR probes did not clearly cross hybridize with control CHO cells, suggesting there is very little homology between the hamster and human CFTR, or perhaps that the gene is absent in the control CHO line.
The etiology of the unexpectedly high level of human CFTR expression in these CHO cell lines is also unclear. Each clonal cell line produces mRNA and protein at easily detectable levels. The FISH and Southern analysis suggest that this level of expression is likely a consequence of CFTR integrated at a unique locus in each cell line at a copy number on the order of one per CHO genome. In contrast, when the techniques employed in the present study are applied to evaluate CFTR expression in normal diploid human epithelial cells, it is difficult to detect CFTR mRNA (10 ) or protein (S. Cheng, Genzyme, Framingham, MA, pers. comm.). The level of CFTR expression could be related to a number of factors including the regulatory sequences within the YAC vector, the distance the gene lies from the YAC ends and the integration site in the host genome (32 ,38 ). Another potential positive influence on CFTR promoter function is the SV40 enhancer that supports neor expression. The SV40 enhancer has been shown to augment CFTR promoter function in reporter gene constructs (15 ). In addition to these factors, the liberation of the gene from a negative regulatory element, possibly downstream, in a region not included in either YAC, could result in higher than expected expression. Other CFTR-containing YACs with additional flanking sequences are available (26 ) and could be used to address this issue.
The similar levels of human CFTR expression in CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 cells suggest that the expression is independent of the site of integration. Such position independent expression is not necessarily expected in cell lines created by YAC transfer. It has been postulated that a buffer of DNA sequence might insulate the gene of interest from positional effects at the site of integration (32 ). The extensive amount of sequence upstream from CFTR in these YACs could potentially act as a buffer and might account for the similar level of expression seen in the two different clones. The detailed analysis of more clones derived from each YAC would be necessary to determine how any of these factors contribute to the level of human CFTR expression.
This study demonstrates that the CFTR contained within the YACs used in this study are free of gross rearrangements and are functional. Furthermore, the expression of the introduced gene indicates that sufficient sequence is present to promote human CFTR expression. Although this is the first study investigating the function of the full-length, human CFTR contained within YACs, a limited number of studies have documented functional protein production from other human genes transferred to mammalian cells by YAC vectors (34 ,38 -42 ). These cell lines often have appropriate regulation of the transferred genes and have been used to study various aspects of gene expression (38 ,39 ).
The CFTR-containing YACs and cell lines described in this paper offer several advantages over other model systems for the study of CFTR expression. Analysis of the role of the intron sequences and the flanking sequences contained within these CFTR-containing YACs may help to elucidate the regulation of CFTR expression in ways not possible when cell lines are created with cDNA constructs (36 ,43 ). In addition, the cells in this study do not have a growth disadvantage when compared to the parental CHO cells. Finally, these YACs can be manipulated in yeast to generate mutations in CFTR or modified to include reporter genes in place of human sequences. Thus, these YACs and the cell lines derived from them should be useful tools for the study of CFTR gene expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture
Chinese hamster ovary K-1 cells (originally from Roger Tilley, Houston, TX) and human T84, CFPAC-1 and HT-1080 cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, Rockville, MD) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biofluids), 100 U/ml penicillin (Gibco/BRL, Gaithersburg, MD), 100 [mu]g/ml streptomycin (Gibco/BRL) and 0.25 [mu]g/ml amphotericin B (Gibco/BRL) [DMEM] in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37oC. Yeast artificial chromosome modification and gene transfer
Two YACs previously shown to carry CFTR, y37AB12 (310 kb) (25 ) and yCF-1/8/7-R (610 kb) (26 ), were kar-crossed to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YPH925 as previously described (44 ). Resultant clones were retrofitted using the plasmid pRAN4 (ATCC) which carries the ADE2 gene for selection in yeast and neor expressed from the SV40 promoter for selection in mammalian cells (45 ). PFGE and Southern blot analysis were used to verify that the retrofitted YAC clones contained neor and were the appropriate sizes. The resulting YACs were 320 and 620 kb in size and were designated yCFTR325-Neo and yCFTR8- Neo, respectively. Restriction enzyme digestion of these YACs was used to map the human genomic DNA flanking the 230 kb CFTR.
Spheroplast fusion was carried out according to Huxley et al. (40 ) with minor modifications. Spheroplasts were fused with rapidly dividing CHO cellsby the dropwise addition of 0.5 ml polyethylene glycol 1500 (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) containing 50 [mu]l dimethyl sulfoxide and 5 mM CaCl2. The mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1-2 min after which time 5 ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added. The resulting cell suspension was mixed by inversion and centrifuged at 700 * g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM and divided into four 10 cm tissue culture plates. Forty-eight hours later the medium was removed and replaced with DMEM supplemented with 400 [mu]g activity/ml G418 (Gibco/BRL). The medium was then changed three times weekly. After ~2 weeks, individual colonies were observed, isolated using cloning cylinders, trypsinized and placed into 48 well plates containing DMEM supplemented with 400 [mu]g activity/ml G418. When these cells reached confluence they were passed sequentially into 3 cm and 10 cm plates. The S1 cell line was derived in a similar fashion using a 140 kb YAC containing neor and human DNA which was unrelated to CFTR. Genomic DNA analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from CS2/C5, CS1/F2, HT-1080 and control CHO cells using standard techniques. The genomic DNA was screened by PCR using intron primers surrounding exons 2 and 6a as described by Zielenski et al. (46 ).
Southern analysis was performed on genomic DNA digested with EcoRI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 3 h at 37oC. The digested DNA was run on a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel, blotted onto Nytran Plus (S and S, Keene, NH). For copy number experiments the DNA was hybridized with a 685 bp cDNA fragment containing part of the CFTR 3'-untranslated region within exon 24; for integrity experiments the DNA was hybridized with a full length CFTR cDNA probe derived from pTG5955 (47 ). These probes were labeled with [[alpha]-32P]dCTP (sp. act. ~3000 mCi/mmole, Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) using the Rediprime system (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's specifications.
Yeast genomic DNA was prepared using a Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Research Triangle Park, NC) according to the manufacturer's specifications. RNA analysis
Total RNA was extracted from CS2/C5, CS1/F2, control CHO and T84 cell lines using TRIzol (Gibco/BRL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Screening of the RNA was performed by RT-PCR. The RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) for 45 min at 37oC and incubated with Superscript II (Gibco/BRL) for 1 h at 42oC using random primers (Promega). An aliquot of the resulting cDNA underwent 40 cycles of PCR using the following conditions: 94oC for 30 s, 55oC for 60 s, 72oC for 60 s. The following primers spanning exons 7-9 were used: 5'-TGTGCTTCCCTATGCACTAAT-3' (forward) and 5'-TTAATATCTTTCAGGACAGGAG-3'(reverse).
Northern analysis was performed on 20 [mu]g of total RNA derived from CS2/C5, CS1/F2, control CHO cells and 2 [mu]g of total RNA derived from T84 cells. The RNA was separated using a 1.2% agarose (w/v), 1% formaldehyde (v/v) denaturing gel, transferred to Nytran (S and S) and hybridized to a CFTR cDNA probe derived from pTG5955 (47 ) labeled with [[alpha]-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime system according to the manufacturer's specifications. Fluorescence in situ hybridization
A CFTR-containing YAC probe derived from y37AB12 (25 ) was prepared by degenerate oligonucleotide priming of PFGE purified YAC DNA for use in both FISH and Fiber-FISH analyses. When used for metaphase FISH, the probe was labeled with SpectrumOrange-conjugated dUTP. When used for Fiber-FISH, the probe was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) and detected with a fluorescein conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD). Cosmid probes for Fiber-FISH were labeled by random priming with biotin-dUTP using a Bio-Prime kit and visualized with rhodamine-conjugated avidin.
Metaphase FISH was carried out according to Pinkel et al. (48 ) with minor modifications. Metaphase spreadswere prepared from cells which were 70-80% confluent. Each 10 cm plate of cells was incubated sequentially with 200 [mu]g ethidium bromide (Gibco/BRL) at 37oC for 1 h and 1 [mu]g colcemid (Gibco/BRL) for an additional 40 min at 37oC. The cells were harvested with a cell scraper, washed three times with PBS, and incubated in 75 mM KCl for 30 min at 37oC. One ml methanol/acetic acid (3:1, v/v) was added and the cells were centrifuged at 200 * g for 5 min at room temperature. The pellet was washed at least four times with 5 ml methanol/acetic acid (3:1, v/v). After the final wash, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml methanol/acetic acid (3:1, v/v), dropped onto a glass slide and air-dried for 3 days prior to use.
The slides containing metaphase nuclei were incubated at 37oC in 2* SSC for at least 1 h, dehydrated in an ethanol series (70-100%) and air dried, then denatured at 70oC for 2 min, dehydrated in an ice-cold ethanol series and air dried. The CFTR-containing YAC probe described above was added to the hybridization buffer [0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM Tris-HCl, 50% formamide (v/v), 10% dextran sulfate (v/v)], denatured at 70oC for 5 min. Twenty [mu]l of the denatured probe were added to each slide which was then covered with a glass cover slip and sealed with rubber cement. These slides were placed in a humidified chamber and incubated overnight at 37oC. The coverslip was removed and the slides were washed successively with 50% formamide (v/v), 2* SSC for 20 min at 45oC, 1* SSC for 10 min at 45oC and 0.1* SSC for 10 min at 45oC. The slides were then placed in 1* phosphate-buffered detergent (PBD, Oncor) for at least 10 min at room temperature and dried between 2 sheets of 3 MM Whatman filter paper. Fifteen [mu]l anti-fade mounting medium containing 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Oncor) were added and each slide was covered with a glass cover slip. Fluorescence signals were detected using a Zeiss axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) and captured with a Photometrics CH230 camera equipped with a Metachrome II extended UV CCD array and IP Lab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). Images were transferred to a Power Macintosh 8100/100, and the composite images were generated using Adobe Photoshop.
DNA fibers were prepared for Fiber-FISH using the method of Heiskanen et al. (49 ) with minor modifications. Mechanical stretching of the fibers was carried out by first melting a small slice of a DNA containing agarose plug (~10-20 [mu]l). The plug was placed in 20 [mu]l of water on a slide and allowed to melt for 2 min on a thermal block maintained at 85oC. Water was added to compensate for evaporation during this period. Stretching was accomplished by pulling the edge of a second microscope slide across the DNA. When no moisture was evident after air drying, the slide was immersed in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 at 70oC for 2 min to remove residual agar and non-adherent DNA. The slide was allowed to air dry and cool for 1 min. It was then dehydrated through an ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%) to retain fibers through subsequent processing and further reduce non-specific binding. Probe hybridization, washing and detection were carried out as described by Heiskanen et al. (49 ). Protein analysis
Immunoprecipitation and phosphorylation of CFTR in vitro with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase was performed as described by Cheng et al. (50 ) with minor modifications. In brief, CFTR was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using a mouse monoclonal antibody to the C-terminus (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) and incubated with 50 ng protein kinase catalytic subunit (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 10 [mu]Ci [[gamma]-32P]ATP (sp. act. >5000 mCi/mmole, Amersham) in 50 [mu]l 50mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 10 mM MgCl2 and 100 [mu]g/ml bovine serum albumin (Pentax fraction V, Miles, Kankakee, IL) at 30oC for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 M NaCl, 1% Triton x-100 (v/v), 1% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), and 0.1% SDS (w/v)]. Samples were washed twice with RIPA buffer, and run on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Chloride efflux assay
Control CHO, T84, S1 and both early passage (8th  and  9th) and later passage (14th  and  15th) CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 cells were assayed for 36Cl- efflux in response to cAMP at 37oC (51 ).Confluent cells were assayed in 6-well plates. The media was removed, the cell layers were washed three times with Dulbecco's PBS without calcium or magnesium (Gibco\BRL), then 1.5 ml Ringer's saline containing 2.5 [mu]Ci Na36Cl (sp. act. >3 mCi/g, Amersham) were placed on the cells. Following a 2-3 h incubation, the cells were washed four times with 0.75 ml Ringer's saline to remove the excess radioactivity. During a control period of 1 min the cell layer was washed with 0.75 ml Ringer's saline at 15 s intervals to determine the cells' baseline level of 36Cl-efflux. Chloride efflux was stimulated by the addition of 0.75 ml Ringer's saline containing a cAMP cocktail [2.5 [mu]M forskolin (Sigma), 250 mM 8-bromo-adenosine 3':5' cyclic monophosphate (Sigma) and 250 mM 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3':5' cyclic monophosphate (Sigma)] at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 min after the baseline 36Cl-efflux had been determined. The cells were then lysed with 0.5 N NaOH to determine the amount of 36Cl- remaining in the cell layer. The samples were mixed with 5 ml CytoScint (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and counted in a Beckman model LS-1801 liquid scintillation counter. The data was normalized on a per min basis. The increase in 36Cl- efflux associated with cAMP stimulation was compared to the baseline efflux at 1 min by paired t-test. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
