RESEARCH IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) remains at the leading edge of investigations employing human genetics and molecular and cellular biology. In the 12 years since the discovery of the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl channel (14), translation of such efforts clinically has been remarkable and includes 1) identification of almost 1,000 different mutations (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr), including 70% with a phenylalanine deletion (F508) that has led to successful clinical detection of individuals with a family history (even before the completion of the human genome project) and 2) ~20 trials of human CF gene therapy involving dosing to the nose or airways (2, 22). Such rapid progress, however, belies the complexity of the CFTR gene and the pathophysiology of CF.
CFTR is a unique member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter gene family in that it 1) conducts Cl, 2) transports substrates across membranes in a nonconductive fashion (e.g., facilitates ATP release), 3) regulates other ion channel proteins (e.g., positive regulation of outwardly rectifying Cl channels or negative regulation of Na+ channels), and 4) regulates intracellular compartment acidification and protein processing (18). Such complexity has led these authors to categorize defects in CF respiratory epithelium as primary (dehydration associated with dysfunctional Cl transport), secondary (hyperabsorption of Na+), or tertiary (enhanced binding of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; proinflammatory environment). Fundamental to such diversity is the awareness that very minor mutations (e.g., F508, a single-amino acid deletion within a 1,480-amino acid protein) result in the profound pathological phenotype of CF (23). In the case of F508, the missense mutation results in a mutant CFTR that is believed to fold improperly, and such defects in its biosynthesis and trafficking result in little or no surface CFTR. Other mutations in CFTR lead to genotypic or phenotypic changes that span the range from no CFTR in the membrane to CFTR that reaches the membrane but does not respond to appropriate stimuli or conduct Cl (6). Adding to this complexity is a recent report describing tissue-specific changes in the impairment of F508 processing (10). Some mutations overlap with PDZ-interacting domains on the COOH terminus of CFTR that are required for polarization of CFTR to the apical membrane of respiratory epithelium (13) and may underscore CFTR regulation of other ion channels by affecting the relationship between accessory proteins, linker proteins, and regulatory cofactors.
Accordingly, research into the biosynthesis and trafficking of wild-type and mutated CFTR is at the forefront of CF investigations. Although the defect in Cl conductance is critical to the pathology of CF respiratory epithelia, contributions of alterations in vesicle trafficking, protein processing, and immune function clearly contribute to the pathogenesis and maintenance of CF (18). These efforts underlie the disparities between genotype and phenotype in CF and suggest that in addition to nucleotide repair (gene therapy, aminoglycoside-dependent restoration of readthrough of full-length CFTR), pharmacotherapy targeted toward improved biosynthesis of mutated CFTR may be a useful adjunct approach to the treatment of CF (24).

The importance of providing mechanistic support for pharmacologically affecting the maturation of CF is placed in the context of our current molecular physiological understanding of the roles of various chaperones for CFTR by Brodsky (4) in this issue of the American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology. The steps in proper folding of CFTR, quality control mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum trafficking, and requisite association with various chaperones are outlined by Brodsky and reference is made to three original articles in the Special Topic. The mechanisms by which sodium 4-phenylbutyrate may be a modulator of such chaperones are presented by Rubenstein and Lyons (17) and Choo-Kang and Zeitlin (5), and the in vivo efficacy of a chemical chaperone, trimethylamine oxide, in the restoration of defective Cl conductance in the critical target tissue (intestinal epithelium) of CFTR null mutant mice is presented by Fischer et al. (7). This collective work strongly supports the concept that small molecules are useful alternative or adjunct therapies for disorders of protein folding (23, 24).

A critical aspect of CF is chronic airway inflammation, and several groups have provided support that dysregulation of the inflammatory response is an intrinsic component of such a phenotype. An editorial by Blackwell et al. (1) accompanies the manuscript by Weber et al. (21) and highlights the central role of unregulated nuclear factor (NF)-B in the proinflammatory cytokine profile of cells expressing mutated CFTR. In this regard, blocking the production of NF-B may be an alternative rational therapeutic approach in CF therapy. In addition to enhanced cytokine (interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-) production, oxidative stress appears to be a component of CF epithelia. Previous in vitro work (9, 11) showed that CFTR is associated with the transport of glutathione (GSH). In the current Special Topic, Gao et al. (8) show that the Cl channel-forming peptide N-K4-M2GlyR increased Cl secretion and GSH efflux in a human CF airway epithelial cell line, suggesting that apical Cl conductance (but not necessarily CFTR function per se) is coupled to GSH efflux. Velsor et al. (20) report in this issue that GSH was decreased in the epithelial lining fluid of CFTR-deficient mice and that an imbalance in antioxidant defense in CFTR-deficient mice was evident. These data extend previous observations that GSH was decreased in the airway fluid of humans with CFTR (16) and that aerosol delivery of GSH may be a useful therapy for CF (15). GSH and other cellular defense mechanisms may indeed represent a rational therapeutic strategy in CF.

As noted above, Na+ hyperabsorption is a critical secondary-like phenomenon in CF epithelia. Although the mechanism coupling such hyperabsorption to CFTR mutations remains unknown, an extracellular serine protease-mediated signaling pathway has been identified (19) that activates an amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel. In the Special Topic in this issue, Bridges et al. (3) show that human bronchial epithelial cells are sensitive to aprotinin. Using the Kunitz domain of aprotinin as a pharmacophore, they show that BAY 39-9437, a recombinant Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, decreased Na+ absorption in non-CF and CF human bronchial epithelia.

This is the first of a series of special topics that will appear routinely in the American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology. The purpose of these special calls is to highlight areas of significant interest in respiratory biology by soliciting input from a broad research community, fast tracking the submitted manuscripts through the review process, and publishing them under their own separate heading. In this case, a call for papers in "CFTR Trafficking and Signaling in Respiratory Epithelium" initially appeared in July 2000 (12). This led to the seven manuscripts and two accompanying editorials that appear in the current issue. This remarkable and timely turnaround in peer review is a testimony to the importance of the topic and the enthusiasm of the authors and reviewers to bring this information to our readership.
