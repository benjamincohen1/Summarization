In order to gain a better insight into the structure and function of the regulatory domain (RD) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, 19 RD missense mutations that had been identified in patients were functionally characterized. Nine of these (I601F, L610S, A613T, D614G, I618T, L619S, H620P, G628R and L633P) resulted in aberrant processing. No or a very small number of functional CFTR proteins will therefore appear at the cell membrane in cells expressing these mutants. These mutations were clustered in the N-terminal part of the RD, suggesting that this subdomain has a folding pattern that is very sensitive to amino acid changes. Mutations that caused no aberrant processing were further characterized at the electrophysiological level. First, they were studied at the whole cell level in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Mutants that induced a whole cell current that was significantly different from wild-type CFTR were subsequently analysed at the single channel level in COS1 cells transiently expressing the different mutant and wild-type proteins. Three mutant chloride channels, G622D, R792G and E822K CFTR, were characterized by significantly lower intrinsic chloride channel activities compared with wild-type CFTR. Two mutations, H620Q and A800G, resulted in increased intrinsic chloride transport activities. Finally, T665S and E826K CFTR had single channel properties not significantly different from wild-type CFTR.
INTRODUCTION
Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population. The disease is characterized by abnormal salt transport across the apical border of epithelial cells (1). The CFTR protein (2-4) is a transmembrane protein consisting of two repeated motifs, each composed of a transmembrane domain and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), separated by a highly charged regulatory domain (RD). The RD consists of alternating clusters of positively and negatively charged amino acids and harbours multiple consensus sequences for phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) (3).
Reconstitution of the CFTR protein into proteoliposomes proved that it forms a linear low conductance chloride channel (5). Activation of CFTR is complex and occurs in different steps. First, the RD is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent PKA. This step is enhanced through pre-stimulation with PKC (6). In a second step, ATP binds to and is hydrolysed at the first NBD, thereby opening the channel and allowing chloride ions to flow down the electrochemical gradient. In a third step, ATP hydrolysis at NBD2 closes the channel (7). As long as the RD is phosphorylated, ATP can re-open the channel. Dephosphorylation of the RD by phosphatases (8) results in final closure of the channel.
The precise mechanisms by which the RD regulates anion flow is far from understood. Although the RD contains nine consensus sites for PKA, they all are redundant and phosphorylation at a single site is sufficient for channel activation (9). Given the fact that activation of CFTR can only occur through PKA phosphorylation, this degeneration of phosphorylation sites is very puzzling. On the other hand, the channel can be locked in the activated state through mutagenesis of Ser to Asp moieties at the PKA consensus sites (10). This observation indicates that negative charges introduced by PKA phosphorylation are important for channel activation. Deleting part of the RD (amino acids 708-835) will also yield a CFTR channel that escapes PKA regulation and that is constitutively active (11). It was therefore hypothesized that the RD closes the chloride channel pore and that it will be repulsed from the pore when negative charges are introduced. Although these [Delta]R-CFTR proteins are constitutively active, their open probability (Po) is only one third of that found for wild-type CFTR. Moreover, addition of an unphosphorylated RD to [Delta]R-CFTR has no effect on this channel activity, while addition of a phosphorylated RD doubles the Po. This increase in activity apparently results from a higher rate of channel opening because of a higher sensitivity of NBD1 for ATP. Based on these findings it was hypothesized that phosphorylation of the RD changes the sensitivity of NBD1 for ATP (12,13).
Given the crucial role of the RD in the regulation of channel activities, a thorough knowledge of its structure and function is warranted. In this regard, the known RD missense mutations found in patients could provide important information about the metabolism and the function of the RD. Our investigations of 19 missense mutations will show that some mutations affect protein maturation, others lead to decreased function or gain of function, while still others appear to have no effect in the assay systems used.
RESULTS Cross-species analysis of the RD
When exon 13 sequences of CFTR from nine different organisms were aligned (Fig. 1), a high conservation of the N-terminal part (RD1, up to amino acid 650) was observed. In the C-terminal two- thirds (RD2), only the PKA phosphorylation sites were conserved and they were all located in this subdomain. The RD is highly charged, in part due to the presence of PKA consensus sequences which are highly basic. Two acidic amino acid stretches were found. The first one (amino acids 725-730) is located in the first half of RD2 and, although this region is poorly conserved, its negative charge was found in all species studied. The second acid region (amino acids 822-828) was located at the end of the RD and was completely conserved.
Figure 1. Alignment of exon 13 sequences derived from different species. Exon 13 derived from spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias, GenBank accession no. 116141), African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis, GenBank accession nos 64623 and 1617482), cow (Bos Taurus, GenBank accession no. 461719), sheep (Ovis aries, GenBank accession no. 862652), human (Homo sapiens, GenBank accession no. 625338), European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculuc, GenBank accession no. 1100985), Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus, GenBank accession no. 382755) and house mouse (Mus musculus, GenBank accession no. 192567) were aligned using the GENALIGN multiple sequence alignment program of the Intelligenetics software. Mutations detected in patients (I601F, L610S, A613T, D614G, I618T, L619S, H620P, H620Q, D622G, G628R, L633P, T665S, F693L, K698R, V754M, R766M, R792G, A800G, I807M, E822K and E826K) are indicated in bold and underlined, the PKA phosphorylation sites by an arrow and the two acidic domains are boxed.
Of the 21 RD missense mutations, three (K698R, R766M and R792G) were located in PKA recognition consensus sites. Only R766M and R792G disrupted a PKA recognition site and might therefore interfere with CFTR regulation. The different RD mutations affected almost all, except D648V, V754M and A800G, amino acid moieties that were absolutely or highly conserved. The high conservation of these mutated amino acids highlights their importance for structure and function. Six of the 21 disease mutations affected the charge of the amino acid residue and two even resulted in an amino acid of opposite charge. The latter two were located in the highly conserved C-terminal acidic domain.
Effect of RD mutations on CFTR processing
At the beginning of this study, 19 different RD mutations (Table 1) had been described in patients. Since then, it was found that the F693L mutation is a polymorphism (14,15) and that the I807M polymorphism is associated with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) (our unpublished data). Two additional disease mutations, which were not characterized at the functional level in this study, were identified [K698R and V754M (15)]. The nature by which all the RD mutations cause CFTR dysfunction is, however, unknown. It is known that some CFTR mutations, like F508, cause misfolding of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in retention and degradation by the quality control system that operates in this cell compartment (16). Therefore, we first determined the maturation pattern of the different mutant CFTR proteins listed in Table 1. The different mutations were introduced into wild-type CFTR cDNA, inserted in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 and the mutant constructs were transfected into COS1 cells. The corresponding proteins were analysed by means of pulse chase experiments. When CFTR translation products enter the ER, they become glycosylated through addition of two high-mannose glycosyl groups on the fourth extracellular loop. This event gives rise to the appearance of a 150 kDa protein, the most prominent form of wild-type CFTR after 30 min chase (Fig. 2, lane 1). As the protein leaves the ER and enters the Golgi apparatus, the glycosyl groups become modified to complex sugar groups and this gives rise to a protein with lower mobility (190 kDa), as can be seen in lanes 2 and 3 of Figure 2. Only the 190 kDa protein will move further to the plasma membrane and will contribute to chloride channel activity. This maturation pattern was found not only for wild-type CFTR but also for some of the mutants (Table 2), such as I807M CFTR (Fig. 2). Some of the mutants, however, presented an abnormal maturation pattern, as can be seen for L610S and D614G CFTR (Fig. 2). These mutant proteins only yielded the 150 kDa form, even after 210 min chase, indicating that they gave rise to misfolded proteins that were retained and degraded in the ER. In order to confirm that the 150 kDa form was indeed the ER form and the 190 kDa form was the complex glycosylated one, two enzymatic digestions were performed (results not shown). When the immunopurified proteins were incubated with endoglycosidase H, an enzyme that only recognizes and cleaves off high-mannose residues, only the 150 kDa forms of the maturing and non-maturing mutants were digested. N-glycosidase F, an enzyme that recognizes and degrades high-mannose and complex glycosyl groups, degraded the 150 kDa as well as the 190 kDa form. The mutations that gave rise to a protein that was not able to proceed to the 190 kDa form (I601F, L610S, A613T, D614G, I618T, L619S, H620P, G628R and L633P; Table 2) are therefore class two mutations (17), where the disease phenotype is caused by the absence of sufficient CFTR protein at the cell surface.

Whole cell currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type and mutant CFTR
Since all studied mutations were identified in patients, they were expected to interfere with normal CFTR chloride channel function. Mutations that caused no arrest in protein maturation were therefore analysed at the electrophysiological level. To this end, CFTR RNA of the maturing mutants was prepared by in vitro transcription and injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes. The basal and cAMP-induced whole cell chloride currents were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The results are shown in Figure 3. Four mutations (T665S, R792G, E822K and E826K) caused a significant reduction in the cAMP-induced chloride current. Interestingly, two mutations (H620Q and A800G) gave rise to chloride channels with significantly higher chloride transport activities. The remainder (G622D, D648V, F693L, R766M and I807M) did not significantly affect chloride transport ability when compared with wild-type CFTR channels.

Single channel measurements of wild-type and mutant CFTR chloride channels

Proteins were labelled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, chased for the indicated time periods and CFTR proteins were immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against the C-terminal part of CFTR. The immunopurified proteins were separated on a 4-12% SDS gel and visualized by autoradiography. The core glycosylated 150 kDa and the mature 190 kDa forms are indicated.
Figure 3. Whole cell chloride currents measured in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing wild-type and mutant CFTR proteins. Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with in vitro transcribed wild-type and mutant CFTR RNA and the basal (black bar) and cAMP-induced (white bar) chloride currents were measured by the two-electrode voltage clamp technique 72 h later. Mutants that showed a significantly different cAMP-dependent chloride current (P  <  0.05), compared with wild-type CFTR, are marked with an asterisk and the number of cells analysed is indicated.
Altered chloride transport activities can either be caused by a difference in the number of functional CFTR proteins incorporated into the apical cell membrane and/or by differences in the conductive and/or gating properties of these channels. Mutants that affected whole cell currents were therefore studied at the single channel level. The different wild-type and mutant CFTR cDNAs were incorporated into a bicistronic vector such that, after transfection into COS1 cells, a bicistronic transcript of CFTR and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was formed. COS1 cells expressing GFP, and therefore also CFTR, were used for single channel measurements. The current was measured before and after addition of forskolin and IBMX to the extracellular side of the cell. Examples of tracings for the wild-type and H620Q CFTR proteins are shown in Figure 4A. Wild-type (Fig. 4B) and mutant CFTR chloride channels showed linear I-V relationships with single channel conductances not different from wild-type (Fig. 4C). The Po of the different CFTR variants were determined (Fig. 5). Single channel activities correlated well with the whole cell currents measured in oocytes for the majority of the CFTR proteins studied. G622D, R792G and E822K gave rise to a CFTR chloride channel with a significantly lower Po than wild-type CFTR; H620Q and A800G CFTR resulted in channels with significantly higher Po.

DISCUSSION
Since the discovery of the CFTR gene, 21 RD missense mutations have been identified in patients. We studied the effect of 19 of these mutations (Table 1) on the maturation and electrophysiological properties of CFTR. Nine mutations caused aberrant processing: I601F, L610S, A613T, D614G, I618T, L619S, H620P, G628R and L633P. A very striking observation was that all mutations that caused a processing defect were clustered in the N-terminal part (amino acids 601-619) of the RD, while those that showed a normal maturation pattern were clustered in the C-terminal end (amino acids 648-826). These effects were not caused by the different types of mutations that had been introduced, since similar amino acid changes were found in both subdomains. In the region linking these two parts the effect of a mutation depends on the amino acid change introduced. This is illustrated for amino acid 620, where two different mutations were detected in CF patients. When His620 was changed to Gln, no effect on maturation was observed. When His620 was changed to Pro, an amino acid that dramatically affects the secondary structure of the protein and therefore possibly its correct folding, a non-maturing protein was obtained. It should be noted, however, that the effects of mutations involving Pro are not that dramatic when they are located in the second subdomain of CFTR, since a recombinant protein in which three wild-type Pro residues were mutated still formed the mature 190 kDa form (18).
The RD has initially been assigned to that portion of the CFTR protein that is encoded by exon 13. Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that the RD can be divided into two subdomains. Cross-species analysis revealed that the N-terminal part of this domain has been highly conserved at the amino acid level during evolution, from shark to human, while in the C-terminal two-thirds only the phosphorylation sites are conserved (19). Moreover, all the RD phosphorylation sites are exclusively located in this second part. A new model for NBD1 was recently obtained by computational modelling, based on the X-ray structure of bovine mitochondrial F1 ATPase. According to this model, amino acids 453-650, which have so far been attributed to the exon 13 RD, are in fact predicted to be part of NBD1 (20). Here we found that missense mutations located in this part of the RD fail to mature, a characteristic of the majority of NBD1 mutations (21).
Mutations that did not affect maturation (H620Q, G622D, D648V, T665S, F693L, R766M, R792G, A800G, I807M, E822K and E826K) were subsequently analysed at the electrophysiological level.
Three of these (G622D, R792G and E822K) gave rise to chloride channels with significantly lower Po than the wild-type channel. One of these mutations, R792G, disrupts a consensus recognition site for PKA. Since it was shown that this site is phosphorylated in vivo by PKA (9) and that it is one of the strongest stimulatory sites for CFTR activation (22), elimination of this PKA recognition sequence might result in a chloride channel with aberrant regulation and, as a consequence, lower activity. Strikingly, two mutations (H620Q and A800G) showed a significantly increased Po, when compared with wild-type CFTR. So far, only the P574H mutation, located in NBD1, has been shown to give rise to a protein with higher intrinsic chloride transport properties. This mutant, however, does not mature (23,24). The `hyperactive' disease-causing mutations described here, H620Q and A800G, do mature.
The remaining mutations (D648V, T665S, F693L, R766M, I807M and E826K) caused no significant alterations in intrinsic chloride channel activity. F693L turned out to be a polymorphism (15), thereby explaining its normal function.
Apart from being a chloride channel, CFTR is also a regulator of other channels. It was found that CFTR is a negative regulator of amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (25-28) and a positive regulator of outwardly rectifying chloride channels (29,30), of potassium channels (31) and of an ATP channel associated with CFTR (32). Therefore, mutant proteins that have a wild-type or an increased channel activity may cause a CF phenotype due to abnormal regulatory properties. In view of the fact that the RD is quite unique for CFTR, compared with other ATP-binding cassette proteins, and that an interaction between the RD and the ATP channel has been shown, this domain becomes the prime candidate to play a crucial role in the regulatory activities of CFTR.
We have recently shown that polymorphic alleles, like those found at the M470V locus, can also affect CFTR properties, both at the maturational and the electrophysiological levels (33). The `normal' or `hyperfunctional' mutations could therefore cause CFTR malfunctioning when present on a particular haplotype background. Since the haplotypes were not known for most of the mutations studied, their functional effect might have been masked. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that these patients carried an as yet undetected second mutation on the same CFTR allele. As a result, the studied exon 13 mutation would then be a polymorphism.
In conclusion, based on the maturation studies, the CFTR RD can be subdivided into two subdomains: the N-terminal one-third of exon 13, which is very sensitive to missense mutations, and the C-terminal part of exon 13, which shows less stringent structural requirements. For some mutations, however, no defect in maturation could be detected. Moreover, they gave rise to chloride channels with intrinsic activities that were similar to or even higher than wild-type CFTR. Further experiments are required to clarify the mechanism by which the latter mutations cause disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction of RD mutants
An XhoI-KpnI fragment containing the CFTR coding region was isolated from the prokaryotic vector pTG5960 (Transgene SA, Strasbourg, France) and inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands). In order to remove a potential ATG start codon derived from the multiple cloning site of pTG5960, the construct was digested with KpnI and EcoRV and the resulting linear plasmid was blunt-end ligated after T4 DNA polymerase treatment. The CFTR coding region present in the resulting construct was characterized by dideoxy sequencing and one polymorphism, V470, was identified. The sequence also contained three neutral amino acid changes (t930c, a933g and t936c) that had been introduced in order to inactivate a cryptic prokaryotic promoter (36). All RD missense mutations that had been reported before May 23, 1996, to the Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Analysis Consortium (Table 1) were introduced using the Transformer Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The primers used for mutagenesis are listed in Table 1. The complete CFTR coding region of the 20 mutants was sequenced; no other mutations than the desired ones were found.
For single channel measurements, the different mutant and wild-type CFTR cDNAs were transferred to the bicistronic GFP expression vector pCINeo/IRES-GFP (37). For this purpose, wild-type CFTR cDNA derived from pcDNA3-CFTR was ligated as a T4 DNA polymerase-treated XhoI-SacI fragment in pCINeo/IRES-GFP. The latter had first been linearized with NheI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and dephosphorylated with bovine alkaline phosphatase. The RD and its flanking sequences were subsequently removed from pCINeo/wtCFTR-IRES-GFP by complete digestion with XbaI and partial digestion with BstXI and was replaced by the corresponding mutant CFTR fragments that had been obtained by complete digestion of the different mutant pcDNA3-CFTR constructs with XbaI and BstXI.
Expression, pulse chase and immunoprecipitation of CFTR
Twenty micrograms of plasmid DNA were electroporated (BioRad Gene Pulser; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) into 1.5-3  x  107 COS1 cells. The transfected cells were cultured for 48-72 h at 37 degrees C in DMEM F12 (Life Technologies, Inchinnan, UK) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and subsequently selected with 480 mg/l G418 disulphate (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands). After 2 weeks selection, the cells were starved for 30 min in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inchinnan, UK) without methionine and cysteine, labelled during a 30 min pulse in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100  microCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) and finally chased for different time periods in DMEM F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were scraped and subsequently lysed by sonication in ice-cold IPPA buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Na desoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (20  microg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1  microg/ml leupeptin, 1  microg/ml antipain, 1  microg/ml pepstatin, 1  microg/ml chymostatin and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was precleared with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and CFTR proteins were affinity purified by incubation for 1 h with an anti-CFTR monoclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal part of CFTR (Genzyme Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA). The immunocomplexes were purified on protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads and, after addition of loading buffer (1% [beta]-mercaptoethanol, 16 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, bromophenol blue and 10% glycerol), loaded on a 4-12% SDS gel (Novex, San Diego, CA). After drying, the gel was exposed at -70 degrees C to a light-sensitive film for 3-4 h.
Digestion with glycosidases
All digestions with glycosidases were carried out on CFTR proteins that had been immunoprecipitated and purified on protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads. Endoglycosidase H digestion was performed overnight at 37 degrees C with 2.5 mU endoglycosidase H (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) in 0.05 M citrate buffer containing 0.1% SDS, pH 6.0. In order to obtain complete deglycosylation, CFTR proteins were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in 0.3% SDS, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C with 0.25 U N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) in N-glycosidase F buffer (50 mM Tris, 25 mM EDTA and 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0).
In vitro transcription
The different CFTR constructs were in vitro transcribed using the T7 RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The quality of the RNA was determined by means of formaldehyde-agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis.

Female toads (Xenopus laevis) were anaesthetized in ice-cold water containing 2 g/l 3-aminobenzoic acid ethylester (Sigma-Aldrich, Bornem, Belgium) and oocytes were subsequently collected via abdominal excision. The oocytes were incubated in a calcium-free solution containing 2 mg/ml collagenase A (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h. The oocytes were injected with 50 nl in vitro transcribed RNA (5  microg/ microl).
Two-electrode voltage clamp assays
Three days after RNA injection, oocytes were mounted in a perfusion chamber, impaled with two electrodes and voltage clamped. In order to block endogenous Ca2+-activated chloride currents, the perfusion solution (96 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) contained 100  microM niflumic acid. CFTR currents were activated by addition of 10  microM forskolin and 1 mM IBMX. All data were analysed by Student's t-test. A value of P  <  0.05 was considered significant. Data are reported as means  plus or minus  SEM. Chloride currents were not activated in non-infected oocytes, water-injected oocytes or oocytes injected with RNA derived from in vitro transcribed pcDNA3.
Single channel recordings
COS1 cells were transfected with the different pcINeo/GFP-CFTR constructs (37) and, 36 h later, seeded on glass coverslips. The coverslips were mounted in a patch clamp set-up (EPC-7 amplifier; List, Darmstadt, Germany) containing a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope, a Xenon light source and epifluorescence optics (Zeiss, XBO 75 and Zeiss-EPI unit fluorescence condenser) 48-72 h after transfection. A band-pass filter (Zeiss BP 450-490) was used for excitation of GFP. Excitation was via a dichroic mirror (Zeiss FT 510). Light emitted by GFP-expressing cells passed through a 520 nm long-pass filter (Zeiss LP 520) and was visually detected. Only cells emitting green fluorescent light after excitation and, consequently, expressing GFP and CFTR proteins were used for single channel measurements. All electrophysiological measurements were performed at room temperature in the cell-attached configuration with a pipette resistance of ~10 M[Omega] and the currents were digitized at 1 kHz and filtered at 500 Hz. The data were collected continuously by the AXO Tape v.2.02 software package (Axon Instruments, Forster City, CA) and analysed with the ASCD software program (38). Only one patch per cell was studied; therefore, the number of patches is equal to the number of cells studied. The pipette and bath solutions contained 140 mM N-methyl-D-glucamine chloride, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CsCl, 1 mM Mg-ATP, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4. The channels were activated through addition of 1  microM IBMX and 0.1  microM forskolin to the bath (external) solution. The open probability Po was calculated from Po = I/i&middot;n, where I is the averaged current during the whole stimulation period, i is the single channel current obtained from amplitude histograms and n is the number of channels estimated from overlapping events. All data were analysed by Student's t-test. A value of P  <  0.05 was considered significant. Data are reported as means  plus or minus  SEM.
