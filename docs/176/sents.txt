0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	9	Export from the ER now appears to involve specific exit codes that couple cargo to a common cytosolic budding machinery (Barlowe, 2003).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	10	 A conserved di-acidic exit code found in the cytosolic tail of many type I transmembrane proteins was first identified in mammalian cells (Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Nishimura et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	11	, 2000) and subsequently in yeast (Votsmeier and Gallwitz, 2001; Malkus et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The di-acidic code directs selective (Balch et al.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	14	, 1999) ER export by promoting interaction of cargo with the coat complex II (COPII) budding machinery.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	15	 COPII (for review see Antonny and Schekman, 2001) consists of the Sar1 GTPase, the cargo selection protein complex Sec23/24 that is a Sar1-specific guanine nucleotide activating protein (GAP; Aridor et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	16	, 2002), and a coat polymer assembly factor, Sec13/31 (Pryer et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The Sar1 GTPase is recruited and activated by the ER-localized transmembrane protein Sec12, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor specific for Sar1 (Barlowe and Schekman, 1993; Weissman et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Sar1 activation is essential for recruitment of the Sec23/24 complex to the ER membrane to select cargo and to initiate COPII coat assembly.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	19	Assembly and disassembly of the COPII coat can be rigorously controlled in vivo and in vitro by use of biochemically characterized Sar1 mutants.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Sar1[T39N] (referred to as Sar1-GDP) is restricted to the GDP-bound state and biochemically functions as a competitive inhibitor of wild-type Sar1 recruitment, thereby preventing Sec23/24 attachment to the ER membrane and coat assembly (Kuge et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Sar1[H79G] (referred to as Sar1-GTP) has a reduced rate of GAP-stimulated hydrolysis, remaining in the GTP-bound state after activation.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Although efficiently recruited to the ER membrane where it promotes cargo recruitment and the assembly of coat polymers, its inability to undergo hydrolysis interferes with subsequent COPII coat disassembly, resulting in inhibition of ER to Golgi transport (Kuge et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In addition, we have demonstrated that the protein kinase inhibitor H89 blocks recruitment of COPII coat components and prevents vesicle formation from the ER (Aridor and Balch, 2000).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	24	 These probes provide powerful approaches to dissect the role of COPII function in transport of cargo through the secretory pathway.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	25	To develop a therapeutic means to stimulate F508-CFTR trafficking from the ER to the cell surface, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms and pathways that regulate its export from the ER.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We have previously shown that CFTR exits the ER in a COPII-dependent fashion (Yoo et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	27	 A recent paper (Fu and Sztul, 2003) proposed that COPII also regulates the delivery of wild-type CFTR to the ERAD pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Xiong et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We have now examined in detail the contribution of COPII to the export of CFTR to the Golgi and its potential contribution to the ERAD pathway in mammalian cells.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Our results demonstrate that although COPII is essential for export of wild-type CFTR from the ER, we found no evidence that COPII contributes to the targeting of either wild-type CFTR or the F508-CFTR mutant to ERAD pathway.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Intriguingly, we report that export of CFTR is highly sensitive to mutation of a highly conserved, consensus di-acidic exit code (Nishimura and Balch, 1997) found in the NBD1 domain of CFTR.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We find that coupling to the Sec23/24 cargo selection complex through the di-acidic code is critical for diverting CFTR from the ERAD pathway.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	32	 We propose that the di-acidic exit code plays a key role in linking CFTR to the COPII coat machinery and is the primary defect leading to disease in F508-expressing patients.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	38	 After a 30-min pulse with [35S]Met, CFTR was immunoprecipitated at the indicated chase time and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphoImager as described previously (Yoo et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Expression levels of Sar1 mutants (5 to 10-fold endogenous) were monitored by immunoblotting with specific antibody as described previously (Yoo et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	40	 (A and B, top panels) Quantitation of CFTR in band B (ER form) reported as a percentage of total B plus C at the 0 time point.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Insets in A and B show representative autoradiographs containing band B and C (arrows).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In A (top right panel), a significant increase in amount of band B remaining in six independent experiments for cells transfected with Sar1-GTP compared with Sar1-GDP at 3 h is shown (P  <  0.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The dashed horizontal line indicates the level of band B remaining in the wild-type (mock) control.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	45	 In A (bottom right panel), the C/B ratios are shown for the 3-h time point.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Results in A and B are typical of at least three independent experiments.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	47	  We have previously reported (Yoo et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	48	, 2002) that Golgi processing of band B to band C is inhibited by cotransfection with the Sar1-GTP mutant when overexpressed 5 to 10-fold, demonstrating that CFTR exits the ER by a COPII-dependent pathway (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Inhibition is clearly evident in the ratio of band C to band B (C/B ratio).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	50	 When compared with the mock control C/B value of 1.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	51	8 at the 3-h time point, the C/B ratio in the presence of Sar1-GTP was  < 0.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	52	 To pursue the possibility that COPII is required for ER export but not ERAD, we examined the effect of the Sar1-GDP mutant that is restricted to the GDP-bound form on CFTR glycosylation or proteolysis.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	53	 As Sar1-GDP is a competitive inhibitor of recruitment of wild-type Sar1 to the Sec12 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Weissman et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	54	, 2001) and Sar1 activation is essential for the recruitment of the cargo selection Sec23/24 complex to the ER membrane (Kuge et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	55	, 2001), Sar1-GDP competes with wild-type Sar1 to competitively reduce the efficiency of both COPII recruitment and coat assembly.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Although cotransfection of wild-type CFTR with Sar1-GDP (5 to 10-fold overexpression; Kuge et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	57	, 2002) strongly inhibited export as measured by processing of band B to band C (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	58	 1 A, inset and bottom panels, C/B ratio is  < 0.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	59	7), wild-type CFTR continued to be degraded efficiently in the presence of the mutant (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Identical results were observed at both early and late time points of transfection (unpublished data), indicating that the potential accumulation of other cargo in the ER in the presence of Sar1-GDP is unlikely to influence the effect of the Sar1-GDP on CFTR trafficking and degradation.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	61	 In contrast to Sar1-GDP, Sar1-GTP is a dominant-negative mutant that promotes cargo collection into stable COPII-coated intermediates.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	62	 As a consequence, targeting and fusion of these intermediates to the Golgi is blocked (Kuge et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Interestingly, cotransfection of wild-type CFTR with Sar1-GTP significantly (P  <  0.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	64	05) protected immature (band B) wild-type CFTR from degradation by the ERAD pathway when compared with degradation rate observed in the presence of the Sar1-GDP mutant (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	65	 This result raises the possibility that recruitment of CFTR to the assembling COPII polymer at ER exit sites prevents access to ERAD.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	66	We also examined the effects of both Sar1-GDP to  and Sar1-GTP to restricted mutants on F508-CFTR stability given that this protein is not exported from the ER and therefore completely degraded by ERAD (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Cotransfection of F508-CFTR with the Sar1-GTP to restricted mutant did not promote processing of band B to C (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	68	 1 B, inset and bottom panel), nor did it affect the kinetics of degradation by ERAD (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	69	 An identical result was observed with the Sar1-GDP to restricted mutants (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	70	 These results are consistent with the idea that failure to export from the ER reflects the inability of F508 to link to COPII.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	71	To provide additional evidence for the role of Sar1 in selection of wild-type CFTR for export, we took advantage of the protein kinase inhibitor H89 that we have previously shown to inhibit Sar1 recruitment and COPII coat assembly (Aridor and Balch, 2000).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Addition of H89 to cells stably expressing CFTR strongly reduced export (90%; Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	73	 ERAD continues efficiently, suggesting that COPII recruitment is not required for targeting for degradation as H89, like Sar1-GDP, uncouples cargo from the COPII coat machinery (Aridor and Balch, 2000).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	74	View larger version (21K):    Figure 2.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Export of CFTR from the ER but not degradation is inhibited by the kinase inhibitor H89.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	76	 BHK cells stably expressing either wild-type CFTR or F508-CFTR were labeled with [35S]Met for 30 min as described previously (Yoo et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	77	 After labeling, cells were chased for the indicated time in the absence or presence of 50  microM H89, and processing of CFTR from the band B ER form to mature band C was quantitated as described previously (Yoo et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Results are typical of two independent experiments.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	79	  We conclude that conditions that enhance COPII assembly on the ER membrane stabilize wild-type CFTR from ERAD.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	80	 In contrast, conditions that interfere with COPII recruitment prevent the export of wild-type CFTR, but have little effect on delivery of either wild-type CFTR or F508-CFTR to the ERAD pathway.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Thus, the ERAD pathway functions largely independently of the COPII machinery.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	82	Export, but not ERAD, is reversibly sensitive to a novel Sar1 temperature-sensitive (Sar1ts) mutant To ensure that the aforementioned results with the Sar1 mutants were not a consequence of targeting of either wild-type or mutant CFTR to a nonphysiological pathway, or reflect indirect effects of other cargo in the ER on CFTR export or stability, we developed a temperature-sensitive variant of Sar1.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	83	 This mutant is dominant-negative at the permissive temperature (32 degrees C), where it is folded properly.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	84	 It loses this dominant-negative activity when transferred to the restrictive temperature (40 degrees C), where it misfolds.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	85	 When cotransfected with the type 1 transmembrane protein vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) at 32 degrees C, Sar1ts shows strong inhibition of processing of VSV-G from the endoglycosidase H (endo H) to sensitive ER form to the endo H to resistant Golgi form (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	86	 3 A), indicative of an ER to Golgi transport block.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	87	 In contrast, at 40 degrees C, a condition that promotes destabilization of the mutant protein, inhibition of export is lost (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Thus, Sar1ts shows a thermoreversible temperature-sensitive ER export block.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The transport and processing of CFTR from band B to C was followed at the indicated temperature as described in Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	97	 The C/B ratios for the Sar1ts mutant at 32 and 40 degrees C are shown for the 3-h time point.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The asterisk in the top panel of B indicates that CFTR is exported very inefficiently from the ER as band C is only weakly processed to early Golgi oligosaccharide forms.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	99	 White lines indicate that intervening lanes have been spliced out.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Results are typical of three independent experiments.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	101	  Transient coexpression of Sar1ts and wild-type CFTR at 32 degrees C significantly inhibited the export of wild-type CFTR when compared with the mock control as measured by processing from the band B to the band C forms (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	102	 3 B, bottom right panel, C/B ratio is 0.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Sar1ts had no apparent effect on stabilizing wild-type CFTR from degradation at 32 degrees C (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	104	 3 B, top panel), which is consistent with the interpretation that Sar1ts interferes with COPII coat assembly but does not affect ERAD pathways.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Moreover, cotransfection of F508-CFTR with Sar1ts had no effect on either F508-CFTR export or degradation when compared with the controls expressing F508 alone at either 32 or 40 degrees C temperatures (unpublished data).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Importantly, we used a two-stage incubation protocol to examine the ability of CFTR to be exported from the ER after accumulation in the presence of the Sar1ts mutant at 32 degrees C.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Cells transfected for 14 h at 32 degrees C to prevent CFTR export were labeled for 30 min at 32 degrees C (stage 1).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Subsequently, cells were transferred to 40 degrees C (stage 2) to inactivate Sar1ts.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	109	 In contrast to incubation at 32 degrees C (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	110	 3 B, bottom right panel, C/B ratio is 0.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	111	5 at 3 h), upon transfer to 40 degrees C we observed normal processing of wild-type CFTR from band B to C (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	112	 3 B, bottom right panel, C/B ratio is >4 at 3 h).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Thus, reversible inhibition of processing of wild-type CFTR to band C imposed by incubation at 32 degrees C in the presence of Sar1ts interferes with the normal physiological pathway required for COPII-dependent export but not degradation.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	114	CFTR uses a di-acidic exit code for export from the ER To understand the requirement for COPII in the export of CFTR from the ER, we examined the CFTR sequence for the presence of the evolutionarily conserved tyrosine-based di-acidic code required for export of VSV-G (Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Nishimura et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	115	, 2000) and other transmembrane proteins from the ER in mammalian cells (Bannykh and Balch, 1998; Bannykh et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	116	, 1998) and yeast (Votsmeier and Gallwitz, 2001; Malkus et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Notably, CFTR contained a YKDAD motif (residues 563 to 567) in the first nucleotide binding motif (NBD1) that is evolutionarily conserved and similar to that found in VSV-G (YxDxE; Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Sevier et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	118	 The structure of the NBD1 domain of CFTR (1ROZ.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	119	pdb) reveals that the YKDAD motif is located in a surface-exposed loop linking the NH2-terminal helical domain containing Phe508 to the COOH-terminal sheet domain (Lewis et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Strikingly, transient expression of CFTR mutants in which either one (DAA-CFTR; Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	121	 4 B, inset and bottom panel) or both (AAA-CFTR; unpublished data) conserved Asp residues were mutated to Ala resulted in complete inhibition of export from the ER as measured by the inability of band B to be processed to band C and a morphological distribution consistent with localization to the ER (Bannykh et al.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	144	 In contrast to its potent effect on coat complex I function in the Golgi, BFA has no effect on COPII function during ER export.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	145	 As a consequence, in BFA-treated cells ER-associated cargo is collected in export intermediates that accumulate in the absence of functional Golgi compartments (Lippincott-Schwartz et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	146	 As expected, addition of BFA prevented processing of wild-type CFTR from band B to C and partially stabilized wild-type CFTR from ERAD, likely reflecting recruitment to COPII intermediates (Fig.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	151	 For this purpose, we first examined the ability of CFTR to bind the Sec23/Sec24 cargo selection complex in immunoprecipitates recovered from detergent lysates of HEK293 cell lines stably expressing either wild-type CFTR or F508-CFTR.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Sec24 was not recovered from HEK293 cells that do not express CFTR (unpublished data).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Because immunoprecipitations were performed on ice, it is likely that the temperature-sensitive phenotype of F508-CFTR resulted in partial folding after transfer to ice, accounting for the observed level of recovery of Sec24.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	175	 These results support the conclusion that the marked inefficiency of DAA-CFTR to exit the ER is a consequence of its inability to couple to the cargo selection complex Sec23/Sec24.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	176	To correlate the effects of the di-acidic code DAA-CFTR mutant on COPII binding with the effects of Phe508 on the ability of the F508-CFTR to exit the ER after transfer to 30 degrees C, we performed a temperature-shift experiment.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	177	 5 D, with increasing incubation time at 30 degrees C, F508 showed a strong increase in its interaction with Sec24, approaching the value observed for wild-type CFTR at 37 degrees C at steady-state.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	178	 These results suggest that reduced temperature promotes maturation of CFTR and presentation of the exit code for interaction with the COPII coat machinery for export from the ER.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	179	COPII does not participate in ERAD A recent paper (Fu and Sztul, 2003) suggested that targeting of CFTR to the ERAD pathway in S.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	180	 cerevisiae requires COPII because in the absence of COPII function CFTR accumulates in an ER-like subcompartment rather than being degraded (Kiser et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	181	, 2001; Fu and Sztul, 2003; Sullivan et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In contrast, we found that COPII does not participate in ERAD of either wild-type CFTR or F508-CFTR in mammalian cells.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The reasons for this discrepancy are now apparent.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	184	 First, CFTR will not exit the ER in yeast under any condition, limiting interpretation of the results (Kiser et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	185	, 2001; Fu and Sztul, 2003; Sullivan et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Second, all experiments used overexpression of a GFP-tagged variant of CFTR (GFP-CFTR).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	187	 A similar GFP-CFTR construct, when expressed in mammalian cells, has a markedly reduced rate of export and accumulates in ER tubular elements at 30 degrees C (comparable to experiments in yeast where cells are incubated at 24 degrees C) that significantly overlaps with calnexin (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	188	 This overlap is consistent with the fact that folding of nascent CFTR in the ER is likely to involve calnexin (Pind et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	189	 However, upon transfer to 37 degrees C, GFP-CFTR is efficiently exported to the cell surface of mammalian cells (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Thus, in mammalian cells, GFP-CFTR can accumulate transiently in a bona fide ER-like tubular network at reduced temperature that is unlikely to be a specialized COPII-regulated degradative subcompartment as suggested for yeast where export is blocked at all temperatures (Fu and Sztul, 2003; Sullivan et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	191	A third concern is that all experiments relied on temperature-sensitive COPII mutants to prevent degradation, leading to the interpretation that COPII is required for ERAD.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	192	 These experiments required prolonged incubation of yeast at the restrictive temperature (40 degrees C) to assess the effect of the mutant COPII component on ERAD.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	193	 It is well-established that elevated temperature (40 degrees ) in mammalian cells markedly stabilizes (approximately twofold) both wild-type CFTR and F508-CFTR from ERAD in response to induction of heat shock folding chaperones (Strickland et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	194	, 1999; Choo-Kang and Zeitlin, 2001; Farinha et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Thus, the twofold effect of the temperature-sensitive Sec12 variant on preventing CFTR degradation in yeast can be largely explained by the twofold difference in stability observed upon shift from the permissive to the restrictive temperature in control incubations in the absence of the Sec12ts (Fu and Sztul, 2003).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	196	Fourth, unlike the Sar1-GDP and -GTP mutants, the biochemical properties of the Sec13 and Sec23 temperature-sensitive mutants have not been characterized.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	197	 For example, both Sec13 and Sec23 temperature-sensitive variants may not be inactivated by shifting to the restrictive temperature as suggested (Fu and Sztul, 2003).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Rather they may promote stable coat assembly leading to partial segregation of CFTR from ERAD as we have observed during COPII coat polymer assembly promoted by the Sar1-GTP mutant.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	199	 We conclude that role of COPII is to direct CFTR selection into COPII vesicles, removing the protein from the ERAD COPII-independent targeted pool.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	200	A di-acidic code mediates CFTR export An important finding that provides new insight into the role of COPII in export of CFTR from the ER was that processing of band B to C was sensitive to mutation of the conserved di-acidic code exit motif originally detected in the cytoplasmic tail of VSV-G (Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Nishimura et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Consistent with this finding, a natural variant in the cystic fibrosis mutation database (http://www.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	202	ca/cftr/) has a substitution of G for D at position 565 (565DAD to 565GAD) that results in a severe deficiency phenotype, although this allele is complex (Tzetis et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	203	 The requirement for a di-acidic code in CFTR export is consistent with a similar requirement for a di-acidic motif for export of the multi-membrane-spanning K+ channel (Ma et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	204	, 2001; Ma and Jan, 2002) and yeast GAP permease (Malkus et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Given that transfer of the di-acidic code to an ER-retained protein is sufficient to promote efficient export (Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Nishimura et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	206	, 1999) and the fact that the di-acidic code recognizes the Sec24 subunit of the Sec23/24 complex (Miller et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	207	, 2002), it is now evident that the di-acidic motif may be used by CFTR to engage the Sec24.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Our CFTR coimmunoprecipitation results provide direct evidence that the DAD motif in NBD1 of CFTR serves as a functional ER exit code as loss of the code results in impaired binding to Sec23/24.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	209	 In the case of the GAP permease, it has been suggested that the di-acidic code, although necessary for export, is not sufficient ((Miller et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	210	 A similar constraint may apply to CFTR as the protein has a complicated cytosolic folding pathway involving numerous chaperones and cochaperones (Pind et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	211	, 1998; Brodsky, 2001; Zhang et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	212	, 2002) that may facilitate recognition of the Sec23/Sec24 complex (unpublished data).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	213	NBD1 domains of a large variety of ABC transporters have a similar structural organization (Schmitt and Tampe, 2002).

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	215	, 2004) with the NBD1 domain of the ABC transporter BtuCD reveals that the di-acidic code is found in a solvent-exposed loop connecting the NH2-terminal helical domain containing Phe508 with the more COOH-terminal sheet domain (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Given that the structure of Sar1 and the Sec23/24 complex containing a bound di-acidic peptide are available (Huang et al.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	218	 This new structure (BtuCD-NBD1CFTR) was then combined with the structure of the Sec23/24 -Sar1 complex to illustrate the ability of the di-acidic code loop in NBD1CFTR to insert directly into the Sec23/24 di-acidic code binding pocket (Fig.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	242	 6, blue residue), deletion of Phe508 in the F508-CFTR mutant may alter the orientation of the di-acidic motif-containing loop, thereby compromising its interaction with Sec24.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	243	 This notion was directly tested by the CFTR coimmunoprecipitation experiments where we found that binding of band B of F508 to Sec24 was much lower than that of wild-type CFTR.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Consistent with this interpretation, F508-CFTR-Sec24 interaction and transport to cell surface can be rescued by promoting folding at 30 degrees C.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Moreover, export of F508-CFTR from the ER can also be rescued in cis by additional point mutations in NBD1 that stabilize the structural fold (DeCarvalho et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Given that over 1,000 mutants have been reported to affect CFTR export and function leading to varying degrees of disease, it is not surprising that residues flanking the di-acidic code have also been reported in the mutation database.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Structural considerations strongly suggest that many of these flanking mutations, unlike the di-acidic code that is found in the solvent-exposed loop, are likely to affect the fold of the -helical and ss-strands that contribute to the structural organization of NBD1 and indirectly compromise presentation of the code (unpublished data).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	248	 We propose that the inability of the F508-CFTR mutant to engage the COPII machinery through Sec24 is the primary basis for the most common form of CF.

0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	4	IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED that the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide (NO) is produced by endothelial cells and, when released, relaxes vascular smooth muscle (10, 14, 19).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Physiologically, an alteration in shear applied to the endothelium of blood vessels has been suggested to be a major stimulus for NO release (3, 22).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, in the pulmonary circulation, a reappraisal of this viewpoint was required when it was reported that, in isolated rabbit (31) and rat (36, 38) lungs perfused with a physiological salt solution (PSS), alterations in shear stress alone did not evoke release of NO.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In contrast, when lungs of these species were perfused with either blood (36) or PSS containing washed erythrocytes (30, 38), inhibition of endogenous NO synthesis produced a shift in the slope of the pressure-flow relationship consistent with a decrease in vascular caliber, i.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	8	, NO was a determinant of vascular resistance.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The ability of the erythrocyte to stimulate NO synthesis in the pulmonary circulation of the rabbit and rat was reported to be independent of effects on viscosity or pressure (31, 36).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The property of the erythrocyte that was associated with the stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis was shown to be the release of ATP (26, 28, 30).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In support of the hypothesis that erythrocyte-derived ATP is a stimulus for endogenous NO synthesis in the lung, the addition of ATP to the perfusate of isolated rabbit lungs produces vasodilation that is, in large part, dependent on the stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis (30).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Importantly, in addition to rabbit erythrocytes, human erythrocytes were reported both to release ATP in response to physiological stimuli, such as mechanical deformation, and to stimulate endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated perfused rabbit lung (26).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	13	Recently, a signal transduction pathway that relates mechanical deformation to ATP release from human and rabbit erythrocytes has been described (17, 18, 27, 29).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This pathway includes the heterotrimeric G proteins Gs (17) and Gi (18), adenylyl cyclase (29), PKA (29), and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (27).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The activity of CFTR was shown to be required for deformation-induced ATP release from erythrocytes of both rabbits and humans (27).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Thus erythrocytes of humans with cystic fibrosis, a condition in which CFTR activity is absent or markedly reduced, and rabbit erythrocytes incubated with inhibitors of CFTR activity failed to release ATP in response to mechanical deformation (27).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Here, we demonstrate that CFTR is expressed in the membrane of both rabbit and human erythrocytes and that, in contrast to those of healthy humans, erythrocytes from humans with cystic fibrosis fail to stimulate endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated rabbit pulmonary circulation.

0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	117	Recently, a signal transduction pathway that relates mechanical deformation to ATP release from erythrocytes of rabbits and humans has been described.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Components of this pathway include the heterotrimeric G proteins Gs (17) and Gi (18), adenylyl cyclase (29), PKA (29) and CFTR (27).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	119	 A role for CFTR in this pathway was suggested by reports that this member of the ATP binding cassette could facilitate the movement of ATP out of cells either by acting as an ATP conduit (21, 22) or by regulating another channel for ATP release (20, 23).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	120	 The finding that CFTR activity is lost or markedly diminished in humans with cystic fibrosis (5, 6) provided a unique opportunity for investigation of the role of CFTR in the release of ATP from erythrocytes in response to the physiological stimulus of mechanical deformation.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	121	 It was reported previously that erythrocytes of patients with cystic fibrosis as well as rabbit erythrocytes incubated with two chemically dissimilar inhibitors of CFTR, namely, glibenclamide (24, 25) and niflumic acid (7), failed to release ATP in response to mechanical deformation (27).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	122	A necessary step in establishing that CFTR is a component of a signal transduction pathway for ATP release from erythrocytes is the demonstration of its presence in erythrocyte membranes.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Recently, it was shown that CFTR protein is present in erythrocyte membranes of both healthy humans and humans with cystic fibrosis (1, 32).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	124	 In addition, it was reported that human erythroblasts contain CFTR mRNA (37).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	125	 However, it must be noted that neither CFTR protein in human erythrocytes nor mRNA in human erythroid progenitor cells were detected in another study (13).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	126	 In the present work, we confirm the finding that CFTR protein is a component of human erythrocyte membranes (Fig.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	127	 In addition, we show that the membranes of rabbit erythrocytes also possess CFTR (Fig.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Thus CFTR, a necessary component of a proposed signal transduction pathway for ATP release from erythrocytes, is present in the membranes of both rabbit and human erythrocytes, cells that release ATP in response to mechanical deformation (26, 27, 29).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	129	Although CFTR activity is required for deformation-induced ATP release from erythrocytes of humans (27), the loss of CFTR activity may have a different effect on basal ATP release from these cells.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	130	 It was reported that the concentration of ATP was increased in the blood of CFTR knockout mice as well as humans with cystic fibrosis compared with either wild-type controls or healthy humans, respectively (1).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	131	 It is important to note that, in these studies, ATP release was studied under quiescent conditions, i.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	132	, erythrocytes were not subjected to mechanical deformation.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Thus it is possible that, although CFTR is required for deformation-induced ATP release from erythrocytes, another member of the ATP binding cassette, such as the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1, is involved in basal ATP release from these cells (1).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	134	The hypothesis that ATP, released from erythrocytes of healthy humans in response to deformation, stimulates endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated rabbit lung is supported by previous studies.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Erythrocytes of healthy humans release ATP in response to mechanical deformation as would be encountered as they pass through the pulmonary circulation.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	136	 The amount of ATP released in response to deformation was shown to be stimulus dependent (26, 27, 29).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	137	 In addition, the inclusion of human erythrocytes in the perfusate of isolated rabbit lungs resulted in the stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis (26).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Finally, the addition of ATP to the perfusate of isolated rabbit lungs resulted in concentration-dependent decreases in total pulmonary vascular resistance that were inhibited by pretreatment with the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME (30).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	139	In view of the findings that CFTR is expressed in human erythrocyte membranes, that it is a component of a signal transduction pathway that relates erythrocyte deformation to ATP release (27), and that ATP release from erythrocytes is a stimulus for endogenous NO synthesis in the rabbit pulmonary circulation (30), we hypothesized that erythrocytes of humans with cystic fibrosis, a condition in which the activity of CFTR is defective, would fail to stimulate NO synthesis in the isolated perfused rabbit lung.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	140	 In the presence of washed erythrocytes from healthy humans, the administration of the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME to the perfusate of isolated lungs resulted in a shift in the pressure-flow relationship in a manner consistent with an increase in Ohmic resistance (Fig.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	141	 This increase in vascular resistance was confined to the upstream vascular segment (PPA  to  PMV as a function of flow rate; Fig.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In contrast, in the presence of erythrocytes of patients with cystic fibrosis, L-NAME was without effect on the pressure-flow relationship, i.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	143	, NO was not a determinant of pulmonary vascular resistance (Fig.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	144	Several studies suggest that endogenous NO synthesis in the lung may be decreased in humans with cystic fibrosis.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	145	 It was reported that amounts of NO detected in exhaled gas are decreased in humans with cystic fibrosis compared with healthy humans (2, 15, 35).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	146	 It must be recognized that the source of NO that is measured in exhaled gas is unknown and could derive from the endothelium of blood vessels, the airways, or other resident cells.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	147	 However, it was reported that exhaled NO is reduced in neonates with cystic fibrosis before the development of detectable respiratory symptoms, suggesting that the decrease in exhaled NO is not the result of increased mucus accumulation and/or inflammation (9).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Thus the decrease in measurable NO in exhaled gas in cystic fibrosis patients compared with healthy controls could reflect, in part, the failure of erythrocyte-derived ATP to stimulate endogenous NO synthesis.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	149	Importantly, it was reported that isolated blood vessels obtained from lungs of humans with cystic fibrosis, when precontracted with phenylephrine, relaxed in response to the application of ADP, the first degradation product of ATP (8).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	150	 This response was shown to be endothelium dependent, although the nature of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor was not determined.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that if erythrocyte-derived ATP were released into the pulmonary circulation of humans with cystic fibrosis, endogenous NO synthesis could be stimulated.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	152	Failure of deformation-induced ATP release from erythrocytes and, thereby, the loss of a physiological stimulus for endogenous NO synthesis could be expected to lead, ultimately, to the development of pulmonary hypertension.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Pulmonary hypertension is seen in humans with cystic fibrosis; however, this condition has most often been attributed to the destructive lung disease and the subsequent loss of pulmonary capillaries and/or hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (11, 34).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	154	 The results presented here suggest that a defect in ATP release from erythrocytes of cystic fibrosis patients as they traverse the pulmonary circulation could be an additional factor leading to the development of pulmonary hypertension in these individuals.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	155	In summary, we demonstrate that CFTR is a component of the erythrocyte membrane of rabbits and humans.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Erythrocytes from humans in whom this protein is functional stimulate endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated rabbit lung.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	157	 In contrast, erythrocytes of humans with cystic fibrosis, a condition in which CFTR activity is impaired, do not stimulate NO synthesis in this model.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	158	 These findings provide support for the hypothesis that erythrocyte-derived ATP, released in response to a physiological stimulus, such as mechanical deformation, could serve to aid in the maintenance of normal pulmonary vascular resistance via the stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Work from many laboratories suggests that multiple phosphatases, including PP2A, PP2B, PP2C, and alkaline phosphatase, are involved in the deactivation of CFTR (13-17).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In vitro, PP2A and PP2C are most effective in dephosphorylating purified CFTR and recombinant R domain.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Furthermore, exogenous PP2A and PP2C inactivate CFTR in excised membrane patches (13, 18).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In human sweat ducts, cardiac myocytes, 3T3 fibroblasts, and Hi-5 insect cells, inhibitors of PP2A increase CFTR channel activity (14, 16, 18, 19).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Likewise, PP2B inhibitors stimulate CFTR in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (17).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, the contribution of PP2A and PP2B to CFTR deactivation may vary in different cell types (15, 20).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In baby hamster kidney cells, PP2C co-immunoprecipitates with exogenously expressed CFTR (20).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Additionally, PP2C overexpression in Fischer rat thyroid cells decreases CFTR chloride conductance (15).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, the ability of endogenous PP2C to regulate CFTR in native epithelial tissues is unclear, since no PP2C inhibitors have been identified.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	14	 To date, no single phosphatase has been demonstrated to be both necessary and sufficient to completely down-regulate CFTR channel activity, suggesting that CFTR is dephosphorylated by multiple phosphatases.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Here, we present evidence for a direct interaction between CFTR and the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This interaction involves the COOH terminus of CFTR and the PP2A B' regulatory subunit.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	17	 PP2A localizes to the apical cell surface, where it negatively regulates CFTR channel activity in Calu-3 cells and intact mouse jejunum.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Furthermore, inhibition of PP2A increases the airway surface liquid in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells by a mechanism requiring CFTR channel activity.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	19	 We conclude that PP2A is indeed a relevant CFTR phosphatase in epithelial tissues.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	20	Affinity Purification of CFTR-interacting Proteins Peptides corresponding to residues 1375-1401, 1411-1441, 1451-1476, and 1471-1480 of human CFTR synthesized with an N-terminal biotin tag (Genemed Synthesis) were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Small scale experiments analyzed by Western blot were performed using lysates from two 100-mm dishes of Calu-3 cells and 2 nmol of CFTR peptide.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	45	Co-immunoprecipitation and Phosphatase Assays Calu-3 cells were scraped into a hypotonic lysis buffer (150 mM Tris-Cl, 10 mM NaCl, and protease inhibitors) and physically disrupted by Dounce homogenization on ice.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The lysates were centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	57	CFTR Currents in Mouse Jejunum Details of this approach have been described previously (25, 26).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Briefly, sections of the midportion of mouse jejunum were studied under short circuit current (Isc) conditions during a 90-min recording.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The CFTR-specific inhibitor CFTRinh172 was also included where noted at a concentration of 10-5 M.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	66	 To measure the average height of the PCL, five predetermined points (one central and four 2 mm from the edge of the culture) were XZ-scanned as previously described (27).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	67	 For all studies, perfluorocarbon was added mucosally to prevent evaporation of the PCL, and the culture was placed on the stage of the confocal microscope over a serosal reservoir (80  microl of TES-buffered Ringer).

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	75	  PP2A is a major cellular phosphatase that regulates many protein targets.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	76	 PP2A functions as a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic subunit and two regulatory subunits, A and B (34).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The specificity of PP2A is determined by the unique combination of regulatory subunits associated with the catalytic subunit.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The A regulatory subunit is encoded by one of two genes and , which are 86% identical.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The A regulatory subunit is tightly associated with the catalytic subunit and functions as a scaffold to recruit the B regulatory subunit.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The B regulatory subunit is highly divergent in comparison with the other PP2A subunits.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The B regulatory subunit is divided into the B, B', B'', and B''' families, which are encoded by at least 14 different genes, some of which produce as many as five splice variants.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The diversity of regulatory subunits gives rise to over 75 distinct PP2A enzymes.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	83	 By mass spectrometry, we observe peptides from all three PP2A subunits (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Importantly, the MS/MS spectra provide amino acid sequence information that allowed us to precisely identify the PP2A regulatory subunits associated with CFTR-(1451-1476) as A and B' (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	85	By Western blot, we confirmed that the PP2A catalytic, A regulatory, and B' regulatory subunits associate with CFTR-(1451-1476) but not other CFTR C-terminal peptides (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Furthermore, these PP2A subunits also co-precipitate with endogenous CFTR from Calu-3 cell membranes (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	87	 2B), consistent with an interaction in vivo.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The PP2A B subunit, which is structurally unrelated to the B' family, does not co-purify with CFTR-(1451-1476) or co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In addition, we asked whether PP2A phosphatase activity purified with full-length CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	90	 CFTR immunoprecipitates were assayed for PP2A using a colorimetric phosphatase assay.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	91	 We find that a PP2A-like activity specifically co-precipitates with CFTR, but not an IgG control (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Characteristic of PP2A, the phosphatase activity was inhibited by 1  microM okadaic acid or 1  microM endothall, potent inhibitors of PP2A (IC50 = 0.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Although okadaic acid and endothall can also inhibit PP1 (IC50 = 10 nM and 5  microM, respectively), previous studies have found no evidence to support the ability of PP1 to physically associate with CFTR, to dephosphorylate CFTR in vitro, or regulate channel activity (13, 18, 20).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Although PP2C has been shown to be associated with CFTR in baby hamster kidney cells, the assay buffer does not contain Mg2+, which is required for PP2C activity.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Taken together, these data suggest that the phosphatase activity associated with CFTR is PP2A.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	105	  The PP2A B' Subunit Binds Directly to the COOH Terminus of CFTR It is clear that multiple phosphatases can regulate CFTR channel activity.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	106	 However, the degree to which PP2A contributes to this regulation varies in different functional assays and cell systems.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Given the diversity of PP2A enzymes, we were intrigued by the possibility that the B regulatory subunit may, in part, account for these differences.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Therefore, we asked whether the PP2A B' subunit could interact directly with CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	109	 We find that PP2A B' subunit expressed and purified from reticulocyte lysates binds to CFTR-(1451-1476) but not other CFTR C-terminal peptides (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	110	 NHERF-1, previously shown to interact with the extreme COOH terminus of CFTR, is enriched by the CFTR-(1471-1480) peptide, demonstrating the specificity of this assay (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Although we do not find the catalytic or A subunit associated with the purified B' subunit from reticulocyte lysates (data not shown), we cannot rule out the possibility that these subunits are present at low levels and may be influencing binding to CFTR-(1451-1476).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Using bacterially expressed, purified B' subunit, we observe direct and dose-dependent binding to CFTR-(1451-1476) (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Furthermore, we also find that the core PP2A dimer, composed of the catalytic and A regulatory subunit, do not bind to CFTR-(1451-1476) unless the B' subunit is present (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Whereas it is not clear whether the B' subunit alone is necessary and sufficient for targeting PP2A to CFTR, these data suggest that the B' subunit may play a critical role in the binding specificity.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	115	PP2A Localizes to the Apical Cell Surface of Airway Epithelia If PP2A is a physiologically relevant CFTR phosphatase, we reasoned that its subcellular localization should partially overlap with CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Given the large number of PP2A substrates, we expect the ubiquitously expressed catalytic and tightly coupled A regulatory subunits to have a broad cellular distribution.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	117	 However, specific B regulatory subunits, which target the PP2A enzyme to distinct subcellular compartments, should have a more restricted localization.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Using a pan-B' antibody, which recognizes all five gene products (, , , , and ), we examined the localization of PP2A in the human airway.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	120	 We find that B' staining strongly localizes to the apical membrane of ciliated cells in superficial epithelia and gland ducts, consistent with the localization of CFTR in these tissues.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Although we cannot unambiguously attribute the apical localization to the B' subunit, it is likely that this staining reflects the distribution of one or a combination of the cytosolic B' subunits, B', B', B', and B' (35).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	122	 In addition, we observe staining of perinuclear membranes and nuclear speckles, which is consistent with the observation that the B' and B' localize to the nucleus (35, 36).

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	138	  As we expected, the PP2A catalytic and A regulatory subunits are more broadly localized in airway epithelia (data not shown) but clearly localized to the apical cell surface of ciliated cells.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	139	 The antibodies directed against the catalytic and A regulatory subunits detect both gene products for each subunit.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Thus, these antibodies label every PP2A molecule that we expect to give a broad distribution in all cell types.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Whereas the pan-B' antibody detects five distinct gene products, this still only represents one of four families of the highly divergent PP2A B regulatory subunit.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Accordingly, the staining pattern for the B' subunit exhibits a more restricted distribution, including the apical cell surface.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	143	 These localization data support our biochemical evidence for an in vivo interaction between CFTR and PP2A.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In excised membrane patches, endogenous PKA activity activates CFTR when exogenous cAMP is added in excess or when membrane-associated adenylate cyclase is activated by receptors (6, 9).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	147	 In patch preparations, CFTR channel activity reflects the phosphorylation status of the channel, which is regulated by a balance between PKA and endogenous phosphatases (6, 18, 37).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Consequently, CFTR channel gating is increased under conditions in which PKA activity is elevated, such as increased cAMP or the inhibition of phosphodiesterases (1, 10).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	149	 We hypothesize that "rundown" of CFTR activity following excision results from a shift in the balance between endogenous PKA and phosphatase activities.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Based on our biochemical analyses demonstrating a physical association between CFTR and PP2A, we tested this hypothesis by examining CFTR rundown in excised patches under control conditions and in the presence of PP2A inhibitors.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	151	 We compared the average pipette current during the first 30 s of outside out recordings with the average pipette current measured from 270 to 300 s, as performed in previous studies (38).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Under control conditions, the pipette solution contained ATP and GTP, conditions that allow CFTR gating to reflect the activity of endogenous PKA (6).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Furthermore, current flow through the patch is mediated by Cl- traversing CFTR, since no channel events are observed, and pipette current is near zero with protein kinase A inhibitor (100 nM) in the pipette (0.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Furthermore, the inhibitor data demonstrate that endogenous PP2A can regulate CFTR channel activity.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	186	 These results strongly suggest that PP2A functions as a relevant CFTR phosphatase in epithelial tissues.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	187	 We also tested whether PP2A inhibitors altered basal CFTR activity in an intact epithelium.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	188	 We measured basal short circuit chloride currents in freshly excised sections of mouse jejunum in Ussing chamber experiments.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Previous studies demonstrated that CFTR constitutes the major chloride channel in these preparations, since jejunum from CFTR-/- mice do not exhibit significant chloride conductance (43).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	190	 We find that over the course of control experiments, basal CFTR activity declined over time (Isc =-9.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	191	 In agreement with our patch clamp data, we find that the PP2A inhibitor endothall (100  microM) prevented rundown of CFTR activity, resulting in increased chloride conductance during the course of the 90-min recording (Isc = 12.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In CF lung disease, PCL volume is depleted, reflecting an imbalance in solute transport across the epithelium (44-47).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Ultimately, PCL depletion results in defective mucociliary clearance, which supports bacterial colonization and exposes individuals to life-threatening infections (27, 44-48).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Previous studies have demonstrated that CFTR mediates the majority of PCL secretion and plays a fundamental role in maintaining basal PCL volume (36, 49).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Therefore, we asked whether inhibition of PP2A would increase CFTR activity and thereby increase PCL levels in primary HBE cultures.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The PCL was labeled with florescent dextran as previously described (27).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	198	 PCL height was measured immediately before and 10 min after the indicated treatments.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Vehicle treatment did not significantly change PCL height (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	200	 However, cultures treated with okadaic acid exhibited an 30% increase in PCL height (PCL =+2.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Because PP2A inhibition is likely to influence the activities of many cellular proteins, we asked whether CFTR was required for the increase in PCL.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Consistent with previous data demonstrating the importance of CFTR in PCL secretion, we find that the CFTR inhibitor, CFTRinh172, causes PCL height to decrease by 30% (PCL =-3.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Furthermore, in the presence of CFTRinh172, okadaic acid was similar to the CFTRinh172 alone (PCL =-2.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Thus, the inhibition of PP2A with okadaic acid increases PCL height by a mechanism that requires CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	205	 These results are consistent with our biochemical and electrophysiological studies demonstrating that CFTR is physically and functionally associated with PP2A in epithelial tissues.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	206	The regulation of CFTR by phosphatases has been extensively studied.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Whereas it is clear from the work of many laboratories that multiple phosphatases can affect CFTR channel activity, the specificity of this regulation is poorly understood.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	208	 We identified PP2A in a biochemical screen for proteins that associate with residues 1451-1476 of the CFTR COOH terminus.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The power of our approach is illustrated by the fact that we unambiguously identified the exact PP2A regulatory subunits associated with CFTR by mass spectrometry as A and B'.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	210	 To date, at least 21 distinct PP2A regulatory subunits have been identified (2 A regulatory and 19 B regulatory subunits) (for a review, see Ref.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Importantly, it is the unique combination of regulatory subunits that governs the enzymatic activity, substrate specificity, and localization of PP2A enzymes (35, 51).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Thus, the identification of the exact subunits associated with CFTR provides insight into the specificity of CFTR channel regulation by phosphatases.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	213	Using purified proteins, we find that the divergent B' subunit interacts directly with CFTR-(1451-1476) and is required for the binding of the catalytic and A regulatory subunits.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	214	 These data suggest that the B' subunit may target the PP2A enzyme to CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	215	 It is intriguing to speculate that the expression of the B' subunit may account for the differences in the ability of PP2A to regulate CFTR channel activity in different cell types and tissues.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Many of the CFTR phosphatase studies have utilized heterologous expression systems such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (13), baby hamster kidney cells (20), and Hi-5 insect cells (19), which may or may not express relevant CFTR phosphatases and subunits (13, 19, 20).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	217	 We are unable to ask whether the PP2A B' subunit is expressed in these cell types by reverse transcription-PCR, since there is insufficient sequence information available at this time.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	218	 However, the expression of specific PP2A subunits in these cells should be an important consideration for future experiments.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	219	 (33) reported an interaction between CFTR and PP2A, which involves the direct binding of the ubiquitously expressed PP2A A regulatory subunit to the CFTR regulatory domain.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	220	 To demonstrate the specificity of the CFTR/A interaction, Vastiau et al.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	221	 (33) showed that the overexpressed heat repeats 1-10 cause a decrease in CFTR rundown, presumably due to the disruption of the A/CFTR interaction.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	222	 However, the PP2A B subunits also bind to heat repeats 1-10 of the A subunit and would have been dislodged from the phosphatase complex (52, 53).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Thus, in these assays, the observed decrease in CFTR rundown could be attributed to the disruption of the interaction between CFTR and both the PP2A A and B regulatory subunits.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Nonetheless, the anchoring of PP2A to the CFTR chloride channel may involve multiple sites of interaction mediated by the PP2A A and B' subunits.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	225	Previous studies have demonstrated a clear role for PP2A in the deactivation or rundown of CFTR in native sweat ducts, cardiac myocytes, baby hamster kidney cells, 3T3 fibroblasts, and Hi-5 cells (14, 16, 18, 19).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	226	 However, the importance of PP2A in CFTR regulation in epithelial tissues seems variable.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Thus, we chose to study the physical and functional association of CFTR and PP2A in airway epithelia.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Indeed, we found that CFTR and PP2A interacted in Calu-3 cells as the PP2A catalytic, A regulatory, and B' regulatory subunits specifically co-precipitate with endogenous CFTR (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Additionally, we examined the localization of PP2A subunits in the human airway.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	230	 If, in fact, PP2A regulates CFTR channel activity in epithelial tissues, we would expect the phosphatase to be present at the apical cell surface, consistent with the localization of CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	231	 The ubiquitously expressed PP2A catalytic subunit and A regulatory subunit had a diffuse staining pattern, which clearly included the apical membrane of the superficial epithelium (data not shown).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Alternatively, staining with a pan-B' regulatory subunit antibody showed a more restricted distribution, including strong staining at the apical plasma membrane (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Thus, the PP2A subunits associated with CFTR are present at the apical cell surface where CFTR functions.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Since the available B' antibodies detect all family members, we cannot rule out the possibility that other B' subunits other than B' may also associate with CFTR or localize to the apical surface of airway epithelia.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	235	 (54) identified an interaction between Chk2 and the PP2A B' subunit and found that the other highly similar B' family members, B', B', B', and B', were also able to bind to Chk2 in vitro.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Consequently, other PP2A B' regulatory subunits may interact with CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	237	 However, we did not find an association between CFTR and a structurally unrelated B regulatory family member, B (PR55a) by pull-down (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	238	 2A) or immunoprecipitation (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Thus, the PP2A molecules associated with CFTR at least appear to be specific for the B' family.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	240	We found that CFTR and PP2A are functionally associated in airway and intestinal epithelial cells.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	241	 In the presence of PP2A inhibitors, CFTR rundown was blocked in outside-out membrane patches from Calu-3 cells and intact mouse jejunum (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Consistent with our biochemical observations, the presence of PP2A in the membrane patches containing CFTR strongly suggests that these proteins are closely compartmentalized.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Furthermore, our data suggest that PP2A is a relevant CFTR phosphatase in epithelial tissues, in agreement with Vastiau et al.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	244	 (33), who found that the addition of okadaic acid in Caco-2 epithelial cells delayed channel rundown following forskolin treatment.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	245	 In T84 and airway epithelial cells, PP2A inhibitors did not block the rundown of CFTR following maximal activation by forskolin (15, 20).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	246	 A major difference between our data and data of other studies is that we chose to measure the effect of PP2A inhibitors on basal CFTR currents as opposed to CFTR currents following maximal activation with forskolin or PKA.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	247	 It is possible that endogenous PP2A plays a role in regulating basal CFTR currents but that other phosphatases contribute to the deactivation of hyperphosphorylated CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Future studies are needed to address the relative contribution of different phosphatases to the regulation of CFTR channel activity in epithelial tissues.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	249	In the airways, the mucus layer provides a defensive barrier that traps and clears bacteria and noxious particles from the airways (44-47).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	250	 The underlying PCL provides a low viscosity fluid that facilitates ciliary beating and mucus clearance (12, 55, 56).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Based on inhibitor studies, CFTR has been demonstrated to play a central role in the maintenance of basal PCL height (36, 49).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Furthermore, the loss of CFTR function results in decreased PCL height and increased viscosity.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	253	 If, in fact, PP2A is a relevant CFTR phosphatase in airway epithelia, we reasoned that the inhibition of PP2A should increase CFTR chloride conductance and ultimately increase PCL height in primary HBE cultures.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	254	 We find that the inhibition of PP2A by the addition of okadaic acid to primary HBE cultures produces a 30% increase in PCL height, consistent with an increase in CFTR activity (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Additionally, when CFTR channel activity is blocked by CFTRinh172, okadaic acid does not have a significant effect of the PCL.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Thus, okadaic acid treatment increases PCL height through a CFTR-dependent mechanism, consistent with our hypothesis that CFTR is compartmentalized with and regulated by PP2A in epithelial tissues.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	257	In addition to regulating channel activity by dephosphorylating CFTR, PP2A may also be important for mediating other signaling and trafficking events for CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	258	 For example, AMP-activated protein kinase, which directly binds to CFTR and negatively regulates channel activity, can also directly interact with PP2A via the A regulatory subunit (12, 56).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Moreover, the direct interaction between CFTR and AMP-activated protein kinase has been mapped to CFTR residues 1420-1457, adjacent to the residues where we observe PP2A binding (residues 1451-1476) (12).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	260	 It is interesting to speculate that PP2A and AMP-activated protein kinase may function to stabilize each other's interactions with CFTR or may compete for binding to the CFTR COOH terminus.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	261	In summary, we establish that CFTR is physically and functionally associated with PP2A.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Our data demonstrate that PP2A directly interacts with CFTR via the B' regulatory subunit.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that PP2A regulates CFTR in airway epithelia, the major tissue affected in CF.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Finally, we demonstrate that the inhibition of PP2A in well differentiated HBE cultures increases PCL height.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Because decreased PCL underlies the basic defect in airway clearance observed in CF patients, our data suggest that PP2A may be a useful therapeutic target for CF.

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received May 14, 1998; Revised and Accepted July 17, 1998.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	4	In order to gain a better insight into the structure and function of the regulatory domain (RD) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, 19 RD missense mutations that had been identified in patients were functionally characterized.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Nine of these (I601F, L610S, A613T, D614G, I618T, L619S, H620P, G628R and L633P) resulted in aberrant processing.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	6	 No or a very small number of functional CFTR proteins will therefore appear at the cell membrane in cells expressing these mutants.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	7	 These mutations were clustered in the N-terminal part of the RD, suggesting that this subdomain has a folding pattern that is very sensitive to amino acid changes.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Mutations that caused no aberrant processing were further characterized at the electrophysiological level.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	9	 First, they were studied at the whole cell level in Xenopus laevis oocytes.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Mutants that induced a whole cell current that was significantly different from wild-type CFTR were subsequently analysed at the single channel level in COS1 cells transiently expressing the different mutant and wild-type proteins.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Three mutant chloride channels, G622D, R792G and E822K CFTR, were characterized by significantly lower intrinsic chloride channel activities compared with wild-type CFTR.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Two mutations, H620Q and A800G, resulted in increased intrinsic chloride transport activities.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Finally, T665S and E826K CFTR had single channel properties not significantly different from wild-type CFTR.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	14	Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The disease is characterized by abnormal salt transport across the apical border of epithelial cells (1).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The CFTR protein (2-4) is a transmembrane protein consisting of two repeated motifs, each composed of a transmembrane domain and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), separated by a highly charged regulatory domain (RD).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The RD consists of alternating clusters of positively and negatively charged amino acids and harbours multiple consensus sequences for phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) (3).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	18	Reconstitution of the CFTR protein into proteoliposomes proved that it forms a linear low conductance chloride channel (5).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Activation of CFTR is complex and occurs in different steps.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	20	 First, the RD is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent PKA.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This step is enhanced through pre-stimulation with PKC (6).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In a second step, ATP binds to and is hydrolysed at the first NBD, thereby opening the channel and allowing chloride ions to flow down the electrochemical gradient.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In a third step, ATP hydrolysis at NBD2 closes the channel (7).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	24	 As long as the RD is phosphorylated, ATP can re-open the channel.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Dephosphorylation of the RD by phosphatases (8) results in final closure of the channel.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	26	The precise mechanisms by which the RD regulates anion flow is far from understood.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Although the RD contains nine consensus sites for PKA, they all are redundant and phosphorylation at a single site is sufficient for channel activation (9).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Given the fact that activation of CFTR can only occur through PKA phosphorylation, this degeneration of phosphorylation sites is very puzzling.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	29	 On the other hand, the channel can be locked in the activated state through mutagenesis of Ser to Asp moieties at the PKA consensus sites (10).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	30	 This observation indicates that negative charges introduced by PKA phosphorylation are important for channel activation.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Deleting part of the RD (amino acids 708-835) will also yield a CFTR channel that escapes PKA regulation and that is constitutively active (11).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	32	 It was therefore hypothesized that the RD closes the chloride channel pore and that it will be repulsed from the pore when negative charges are introduced.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Although these [Delta]R-CFTR proteins are constitutively active, their open probability (Po) is only one third of that found for wild-type CFTR.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Moreover, addition of an unphosphorylated RD to [Delta]R-CFTR has no effect on this channel activity, while addition of a phosphorylated RD doubles the Po.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This increase in activity apparently results from a higher rate of channel opening because of a higher sensitivity of NBD1 for ATP.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Based on these findings it was hypothesized that phosphorylation of the RD changes the sensitivity of NBD1 for ATP (12,13).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	37	Given the crucial role of the RD in the regulation of channel activities, a thorough knowledge of its structure and function is warranted.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In this regard, the known RD missense mutations found in patients could provide important information about the metabolism and the function of the RD.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Our investigations of 19 missense mutations will show that some mutations affect protein maturation, others lead to decreased function or gain of function, while still others appear to have no effect in the assay systems used.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	40	RESULTS Cross-species analysis of the RD.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	41	When exon 13 sequences of CFTR from nine different organisms were aligned (Fig.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	42	 1), a high conservation of the N-terminal part (RD1, up to amino acid 650) was observed.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In the C-terminal two- thirds (RD2), only the PKA phosphorylation sites were conserved and they were all located in this subdomain.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The RD is highly charged, in part due to the presence of PKA consensus sequences which are highly basic.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Two acidic amino acid stretches were found.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The first one (amino acids 725-730) is located in the first half of RD2 and, although this region is poorly conserved, its negative charge was found in all species studied.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The second acid region (amino acids 822-828) was located at the end of the RD and was completely conserved.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Alignment of exon 13 sequences derived from different species.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Exon 13 derived from spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias, GenBank accession no.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	50	 116141), African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis, GenBank accession nos 64623 and 1617482), cow (Bos Taurus, GenBank accession no.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	51	 461719), sheep (Ovis aries, GenBank accession no.

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	53	 625338), European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculuc, GenBank accession no.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	54	 1100985), Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus, GenBank accession no.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	55	 382755) and house mouse (Mus musculus, GenBank accession no.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	56	 192567) were aligned using the GENALIGN multiple sequence alignment program of the Intelligenetics software.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Mutations detected in patients (I601F, L610S, A613T, D614G, I618T, L619S, H620P, H620Q, D622G, G628R, L633P, T665S, F693L, K698R, V754M, R766M, R792G, A800G, I807M, E822K and E826K) are indicated in bold and underlined, the PKA phosphorylation sites by an arrow and the two acidic domains are boxed.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	58	Of the 21 RD missense mutations, three (K698R, R766M and R792G) were located in PKA recognition consensus sites.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Only R766M and R792G disrupted a PKA recognition site and might therefore interfere with CFTR regulation.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The different RD mutations affected almost all, except D648V, V754M and A800G, amino acid moieties that were absolutely or highly conserved.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The high conservation of these mutated amino acids highlights their importance for structure and function.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Six of the 21 disease mutations affected the charge of the amino acid residue and two even resulted in an amino acid of opposite charge.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The latter two were located in the highly conserved C-terminal acidic domain.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	64	Effect of RD mutations on CFTR processing.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	65	At the beginning of this study, 19 different RD mutations (Table 1) had been described in patients.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Since then, it was found that the F693L mutation is a polymorphism (14,15) and that the I807M polymorphism is associated with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) (our unpublished data).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Two additional disease mutations, which were not characterized at the functional level in this study, were identified [K698R and V754M (15)].
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The nature by which all the RD mutations cause CFTR dysfunction is, however, unknown.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	69	 It is known that some CFTR mutations, like F508, cause misfolding of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in retention and degradation by the quality control system that operates in this cell compartment (16).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Therefore, we first determined the maturation pattern of the different mutant CFTR proteins listed in Table 1.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The different mutations were introduced into wild-type CFTR cDNA, inserted in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 and the mutant constructs were transfected into COS1 cells.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The corresponding proteins were analysed by means of pulse chase experiments.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	73	 When CFTR translation products enter the ER, they become glycosylated through addition of two high-mannose glycosyl groups on the fourth extracellular loop.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	74	 This event gives rise to the appearance of a 150 kDa protein, the most prominent form of wild-type CFTR after 30 min chase (Fig.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	75	 As the protein leaves the ER and enters the Golgi apparatus, the glycosyl groups become modified to complex sugar groups and this gives rise to a protein with lower mobility (190 kDa), as can be seen in lanes 2 and 3 of Figure 2.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Only the 190 kDa protein will move further to the plasma membrane and will contribute to chloride channel activity.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This maturation pattern was found not only for wild-type CFTR but also for some of the mutants (Table 2), such as I807M CFTR (Fig.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Some of the mutants, however, presented an abnormal maturation pattern, as can be seen for L610S and D614G CFTR (Fig.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	79	 These mutant proteins only yielded the 150 kDa form, even after 210 min chase, indicating that they gave rise to misfolded proteins that were retained and degraded in the ER.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	80	 In order to confirm that the 150 kDa form was indeed the ER form and the 190 kDa form was the complex glycosylated one, two enzymatic digestions were performed (results not shown).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	81	 When the immunopurified proteins were incubated with endoglycosidase H, an enzyme that only recognizes and cleaves off high-mannose residues, only the 150 kDa forms of the maturing and non-maturing mutants were digested.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	82	 N-glycosidase F, an enzyme that recognizes and degrades high-mannose and complex glycosyl groups, degraded the 150 kDa as well as the 190 kDa form.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The mutations that gave rise to a protein that was not able to proceed to the 190 kDa form (I601F, L610S, A613T, D614G, I618T, L619S, H620P, G628R and L633P; Table 2) are therefore class two mutations (17), where the disease phenotype is caused by the absence of sufficient CFTR protein at the cell surface.

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	90	Since all studied mutations were identified in patients, they were expected to interfere with normal CFTR chloride channel function.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Mutations that caused no arrest in protein maturation were therefore analysed at the electrophysiological level.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	92	 To this end, CFTR RNA of the maturing mutants was prepared by in vitro transcription and injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The basal and cAMP-induced whole cell chloride currents were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The results are shown in Figure 3.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Four mutations (T665S, R792G, E822K and E826K) caused a significant reduction in the cAMP-induced chloride current.

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	120	Altered chloride transport activities can either be caused by a difference in the number of functional CFTR proteins incorporated into the apical cell membrane and/or by differences in the conductive and/or gating properties of these channels.

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	144	Since the discovery of the CFTR gene, 21 RD missense mutations have been identified in patients.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	145	 We studied the effect of 19 of these mutations (Table 1) on the maturation and electrophysiological properties of CFTR.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Nine mutations caused aberrant processing: I601F, L610S, A613T, D614G, I618T, L619S, H620P, G628R and L633P.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	147	 A very striking observation was that all mutations that caused a processing defect were clustered in the N-terminal part (amino acids 601-619) of the RD, while those that showed a normal maturation pattern were clustered in the C-terminal end (amino acids 648-826).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	148	 These effects were not caused by the different types of mutations that had been introduced, since similar amino acid changes were found in both subdomains.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	149	 In the region linking these two parts the effect of a mutation depends on the amino acid change introduced.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	150	 This is illustrated for amino acid 620, where two different mutations were detected in CF patients.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	151	 When His620 was changed to Gln, no effect on maturation was observed.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	152	 When His620 was changed to Pro, an amino acid that dramatically affects the secondary structure of the protein and therefore possibly its correct folding, a non-maturing protein was obtained.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	153	 It should be noted, however, that the effects of mutations involving Pro are not that dramatic when they are located in the second subdomain of CFTR, since a recombinant protein in which three wild-type Pro residues were mutated still formed the mature 190 kDa form (18).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	154	The RD has initially been assigned to that portion of the CFTR protein that is encoded by exon 13.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that the RD can be divided into two subdomains.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Cross-species analysis revealed that the N-terminal part of this domain has been highly conserved at the amino acid level during evolution, from shark to human, while in the C-terminal two-thirds only the phosphorylation sites are conserved (19).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Moreover, all the RD phosphorylation sites are exclusively located in this second part.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	158	 A new model for NBD1 was recently obtained by computational modelling, based on the X-ray structure of bovine mitochondrial F1 ATPase.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	159	 According to this model, amino acids 453-650, which have so far been attributed to the exon 13 RD, are in fact predicted to be part of NBD1 (20).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Here we found that missense mutations located in this part of the RD fail to mature, a characteristic of the majority of NBD1 mutations (21).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	161	Mutations that did not affect maturation (H620Q, G622D, D648V, T665S, F693L, R766M, R792G, A800G, I807M, E822K and E826K) were subsequently analysed at the electrophysiological level.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	162	Three of these (G622D, R792G and E822K) gave rise to chloride channels with significantly lower Po than the wild-type channel.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	163	 One of these mutations, R792G, disrupts a consensus recognition site for PKA.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Since it was shown that this site is phosphorylated in vivo by PKA (9) and that it is one of the strongest stimulatory sites for CFTR activation (22), elimination of this PKA recognition sequence might result in a chloride channel with aberrant regulation and, as a consequence, lower activity.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Strikingly, two mutations (H620Q and A800G) showed a significantly increased Po, when compared with wild-type CFTR.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	166	 So far, only the P574H mutation, located in NBD1, has been shown to give rise to a protein with higher intrinsic chloride transport properties.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	167	 This mutant, however, does not mature (23,24).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The `hyperactive' disease-causing mutations described here, H620Q and A800G, do mature.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	169	The remaining mutations (D648V, T665S, F693L, R766M, I807M and E826K) caused no significant alterations in intrinsic chloride channel activity.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	170	 F693L turned out to be a polymorphism (15), thereby explaining its normal function.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	171	Apart from being a chloride channel, CFTR is also a regulator of other channels.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	172	 It was found that CFTR is a negative regulator of amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (25-28) and a positive regulator of outwardly rectifying chloride channels (29,30), of potassium channels (31) and of an ATP channel associated with CFTR (32).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Therefore, mutant proteins that have a wild-type or an increased channel activity may cause a CF phenotype due to abnormal regulatory properties.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	174	 In view of the fact that the RD is quite unique for CFTR, compared with other ATP-binding cassette proteins, and that an interaction between the RD and the ATP channel has been shown, this domain becomes the prime candidate to play a crucial role in the regulatory activities of CFTR.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	175	We have recently shown that polymorphic alleles, like those found at the M470V locus, can also affect CFTR properties, both at the maturational and the electrophysiological levels (33).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The `normal' or `hyperfunctional' mutations could therefore cause CFTR malfunctioning when present on a particular haplotype background.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Since the haplotypes were not known for most of the mutations studied, their functional effect might have been masked.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	178	 On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that these patients carried an as yet undetected second mutation on the same CFTR allele.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	179	 As a result, the studied exon 13 mutation would then be a polymorphism.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	180	In conclusion, based on the maturation studies, the CFTR RD can be subdivided into two subdomains: the N-terminal one-third of exon 13, which is very sensitive to missense mutations, and the C-terminal part of exon 13, which shows less stringent structural requirements.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	181	 For some mutations, however, no defect in maturation could be detected.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Moreover, they gave rise to chloride channels with intrinsic activities that were similar to or even higher than wild-type CFTR.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Further experiments are required to clarify the mechanism by which the latter mutations cause disease.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	184	MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction of RD mutants.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	185	An XhoI-KpnI fragment containing the CFTR coding region was isolated from the prokaryotic vector pTG5960 (Transgene SA, Strasbourg, France) and inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	186	 In order to remove a potential ATG start codon derived from the multiple cloning site of pTG5960, the construct was digested with KpnI and EcoRV and the resulting linear plasmid was blunt-end ligated after T4 DNA polymerase treatment.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The CFTR coding region present in the resulting construct was characterized by dideoxy sequencing and one polymorphism, V470, was identified.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The sequence also contained three neutral amino acid changes (t930c, a933g and t936c) that had been introduced in order to inactivate a cryptic prokaryotic promoter (36).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	189	 All RD missense mutations that had been reported before May 23, 1996, to the Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Analysis Consortium (Table 1) were introduced using the Transformer Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The primers used for mutagenesis are listed in Table 1.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The complete CFTR coding region of the 20 mutants was sequenced; no other mutations than the desired ones were found.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	192	For single channel measurements, the different mutant and wild-type CFTR cDNAs were transferred to the bicistronic GFP expression vector pCINeo/IRES-GFP (37).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	193	 For this purpose, wild-type CFTR cDNA derived from pcDNA3-CFTR was ligated as a T4 DNA polymerase-treated XhoI-SacI fragment in pCINeo/IRES-GFP.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The latter had first been linearized with NheI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and dephosphorylated with bovine alkaline phosphatase.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	195	 The RD and its flanking sequences were subsequently removed from pCINeo/wtCFTR-IRES-GFP by complete digestion with XbaI and partial digestion with BstXI and was replaced by the corresponding mutant CFTR fragments that had been obtained by complete digestion of the different mutant pcDNA3-CFTR constructs with XbaI and BstXI.

0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	1	Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	2	THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER) serves as a way station during the biogenesis of nearly every integral membrane and secreted protein synthesized in eukaryotic cells.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	3	 As such, its primary role is to facilitate the folding of nascent polypeptides.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Thus plentiful among the ER resident proteins are 1) enzymes that catalyze conformational rearrangements, such as protein disulfide isomerase and peptidylprolyl isomerase; 2) enzymes that chemically modify the nascent polypeptide, such as signal sequence peptidase and oligosaccharyl transferase; and 3) molecules that retain the polypeptide in a soluble, aggregation-free state.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The factors constituting this last group are molecular chaperones, many of which were first identified as heat shock proteins (HSPs) because their synthesis is induced when cells are exposed to high temperatures or other stresses.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, most HSPs have cellular homologs that are constitutively produced, and these are named heat shock cognate proteins (HSCs).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	7	 HSC and HSP molecular chaperones are defined by their molecular masses (in kDa), and a plentiful class found in every cell type are those with a molecular mass of ~70 kDa (i.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	8	HSP70 and HSC70 hydrolyze ATP concomitant with their binding to and release from polypeptide substrates, and their ATPase activities may be activated by another group of chaperones (21, 33) known as HSP40 or DnaJ homologs.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In some cases, the HSP40 cochaperone delivers a polypeptide substrate to the HSP70 or HSC70 (17, 37).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	10	 With the use of a variety of in vitro techniques, the HSC70 and HSP70 chaperones have been shown to bind preferentially to short stretches of amino acids with overall hydrophobic character (3, 13, 31).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Such motifs are normally buried within the core of a native protein but may become solvent accessible during protein folding and upon protein denaturation.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Thus HSC70 and HSP70 chaperones are ideally suited to aid unfolded proteins en route to their native conformations by limiting protein aggregation.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	13	Deletion of the phenylalanine at position 508 in the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the most common mutation associated with CF (27).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	14	 CFTR most likely functions as a chloride channel in the plasma membrane of airway and other epithelial cells, but cells containing only the F508 variant either lack or harbor variable amounts of the protein at the plasma membrane (7, 16).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Both wild-type and the F508 mutant form of CFTR are translocated into the ER membrane, at which time protein folding should commence.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	16	 However, in vitro studies by Qu and colleagues (25, 26) suggest that the efficiency of F508 CFTR folding is severely impaired compared with that of the wild-type protein.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	17	 It has also been shown that the F508 mutant protein is unable to undergo an ATP-dependent conformational change in the ER (20, 40).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Consistent with an inability of F508 CFTR to fold efficiently, incubation of cells expressing the mutant at lower temperatures, a condition that may favor protein folding and/or stability, permits some of this variant to traffic to the plasma membrane where it is active (10), albeit with a reduced open probability and half-life (9, 11, 19).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In contrast, if CFTR folding is retarded in the ER, the protein becomes a substrate for ER-associated degradation, a quality control mechanism that degrades aberrant proteins in the secretory pathway (4).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Degradation of CFTR, like most other ER-associated degradation substrates, requires ubiquitinylation and delivery to the multicatalytic cytoplasmic proteasome (14, 36, 38).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Although a significant proportion of even wild-type CFTR is degraded, nearly all of the F508 mutant is destroyed; therefore, cells expressing only the mutant form of the protein are phenotypically null.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	22	Because F508 CFTR is unable to attain a native conformation in the ER, it should not come as a surprise that it interacts with molecular chaperones.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Specifically, cytoplasmic HSC70 and HSP90, the luminal Ca2+-binding chaperone calnexin, and a cytoplasmic HSP40 homolog Hdj2 can be coprecipitated with CFTR (18, 22, 24, 39).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	24	 HSC70 and Hdj2 also prevent the in vitro aggregation of the first nucleotide-binding domain of CFTR (22, 34), the domain in which the phenylalanine at position 508 resides.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Although wild-type, folded CFTR is released from the chaperones on its transit from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, HSC70 and calnexin remain bound to the mutant until degradation ensues (24, 39).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	26	 A HSC70-interacting factor, CHIP, has recently been shown to facilitate the degradation of immature forms of CFTR (23).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	27	 One interpretation of these combined data is that the chaperone-CFTR complexes represent folding intermediates.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	28	Because several human diseases arise from defects in protein folding (4, 35), because of the devastating effects and widespread occurrence of CF, and because a profound amount of information is available on the mechanisms of molecular chaperones, the modulation of protein folding and chaperone activity has been attempted with small molecules and genetic manipulations.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	29	 For example, it was demonstrated by the Welch (5) and Kopito (32) laboratories that F508 CFTR-expressing cells incubated in glycerol, a polyol known to stabilize proteins in vitro, contain ER-matured forms of CFTR and display cAMP (forskolin)-activated plasma membrane chloride transport, a hallmark of functional CFTR.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Glycerol also facilitates the in vitro folding of the first nucleotide-binding domain lacking the phenylalanine at position 508 by preventing off-pathway intermediates from forming (25).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	31	 F508 CFTR-expressing cells incubated in trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), an osmotic stabilizer found in sharks to protect proteins from urea denaturation, exhibit similar properties (5).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Compounds such as TMAO and glycerol are now commonly known as chemical chaperones.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	33	Another means to alter protein folding in vivo is through the modulation of intracellular chaperone concentration.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	34	 (28) showed that sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA), an ammonia scavenger approved for the treatment of urea cycle disorders and a known transcriptional regulator, permits a fraction of F508 CFTR to mature in bronchial epithelial cell lines and primary nasal epithelial cells from patients with CF.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Maturation of the mutant coincides with cAMP-stimulated plasma membrane Cl conductance in the treated cells.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	36	 To determine the molecular basis of 4PBA-mediated rescue of the F508 CFTR phenotype, immunoprecipitations were performed to examine the amount of CFTR associated with HSC70, and a 4PBA dose-dependent decrease in the amount of CFTR-HSC70 complex was observed (30).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Because HSC70 was shown to facilitate ubiquitination of several test proteins in vitro (2), the authors suggested that HSC70 targets CFTR for degradation and that 4PBA, through an unknown mechanism, reduces the amount of the complex by which CFTR is delivered to the proteasome.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	38	The studies described above support the concept of using chaperone modulation as a means to rectify the pathophysiology associated with F508 CFTR.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Now, three papers in this issue of the American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology (8, 12, 29) represent a significant leap in our understanding of the molecular basis of chaperone modulation, with the ultimate hope that such interventions may become clinically relevant for CF.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	40	Building on previous studies, Rubenstein and Lyons (29) show that the mechanism by which 4PBA downregulates HSC70 levels is through a decrease in the stability of HSC70 mRNA.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Although HSC70 mRNA is known to be relatively unstable, 4PBA appears to further accelerate its degradation.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Coincident with an acceleration of mRNA degradation, an ~40% reduction in the amount of HSC70 is evident.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The mechanism by which this occurs is unknown, but it has been shown that inhibiting the initiation of yeast HSC70 translation leads to a rapid destruction of its message (1).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Because a large number of translation poisons are known, many of which were first isolated as antibiotics, this hypothesis can be tested.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	45	Does 4PBA only modulate HSC70 levels? Although previous data (30) suggested that this was so, new work from Choo-Kang and Zeitlin (8) indicates that 4PBA raises HSP70 levels, leading to increased HSP70-F508 CFTR complex formation and F508 CFTR maturation.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	46	 One concern is that this phenomenon may arise from a secondary effect of decreasing HSC70 levels (see above), which, in turn, could induce a general heat shock or stress response.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	47	 However, the authors show that CFTR maturation is also facilitated by selectively increasing the intracellular levels of HSP70 by transient transfection with an HSP70 expression vector.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	48	These combined studies suggest that modulating the levels and thus the activities of HSC70 and HSP70 enhances CFTR maturation.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	49	 They also point to the complexity of HSP70 or HSC70 function in the cell.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	50	, HSP70) facilitates protein folding, its homolog (i.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	51	, HSC70) targets a misfolded protein for degradation.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Previous data suggest that multiple chaperones bind coordinately to nascent polypeptides.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Although the functions of many of these chaperones are likely to be redundant, it seems logical that a subset is required for folding and another subset is necessary for protein degradation.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	54	 If one group fails to fold the polypeptide, another is readily available to target the substrate for destruction.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The activities of the unique sets of chaperones may be further defined by the action of the HSP40/DnaJ cochaperones that regulate HSP70 and HSC70 function.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	56	 In other cases, the folding and degradation targeting activities may reside in one chaperone complex.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	57	 For example, HSP90 has been proposed to facilitate both CFTR maturation and degradation (18).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	58	Another means to catalyze CFTR folding is through the use of chemical chaperones, an attack that has shown promise in in vitro model systems as described above.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	59	 To determine whether this approach is feasible in an animal system, Fischer et al.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	60	 (12) examined whether TMAO corrects the F508 CFTR trafficking defect in mice.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Because the severity of the defect associated with the F508 form of CFTR is most prevalent in the rodent intestine, measurements of rectal potential difference (RPD) were undertaken in control mice, those lacking CFTR, and F508 CFTR mice.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Administration of TMAO over 24 h by subcutaneous injection reveals significant increases in forskolin-activated RPD hyperpolarization in the control and F508 CFTR mice, consistent with a partial rescue of the folding defects associated with the wild-type and mutant proteins.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Most promising from a clinical perspective is the observation that administering the flavinoid apigenin, a CFTR activator, further increases the forskolin-activated RPD in the F508 CFTR-expressing mouse.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	64	 This result supports the promise that combined therapeutic attacks may present the best option to lessen the pathophysiology of CF.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Combining small-molecule activators of CFTR function is warranted, particularly in this case, because the concentrations of TMAO used for these studies are quite high and the physiological effects of prolonged administration of TMAO are unknown.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	66	Might chaperone-based therapies become clinically relevant and generalized to the spectrum of diseases that arise from protein misfolding? The corrective effects of glycerol and 4-PBA on the maturation and secretion of another "conformational disease"-causing protein, the Z variant of antitrypsin, have been recently reported by Burrows et al.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	67	 In addition, other chaperone modulators are currently being examined for their ability to correct misfolded proteins.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	68	 15-Deoxyspergualin, a known HSC70 effector and immunosuppressant, increases the cAMP-stimulated plasma membrane Cl channel activity of F508 CFTR-expressing cells (15).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	69	 However, because an increase in ER-matured forms of F508 CFTR could not be observed with 15-deoxyspergualin treatment, only a small amount of the mutant had likely trafficked to the plasma membrane and yielded the desired activity.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Nevertheless, with the advent of combinatorial chemistry and more defined methods to examine protein folding and chaperone action at the molecular level, I suspect that we will see a new convergence of chemical, cell biological, and biophysical tools geared to combat a variety of human diseases.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Even the originally proposed CFTR structure, which has proved to be remarkably prescient, was largely based on a comparison of human CFTR with a number of other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family members (Riordan et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Furthermore, cross-species sequence comparisons between the small number of CFTR homologs available in the early 1990s highlighted that identified mutations had occurred in evolutionary conserved residues (Diamond et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	12	 1991 ; Tucker, Tannahill, and Higgins 1992 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These early but necessarily limited analyses clearly demonstrated the importance of evolutionary information in interpreting the effects of mutations and have also frequently been taken into account in the design of functional studies.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Therefore, such a large number of missense mutations identified in the human CFTR and the abundance of structural and functional analysis data accumulated over the past decade, if evaluated together in the context of a sequence comparison of all of the currently available CFTR orthologs, will allow a significantly improved refinement of the domain structure of CFTR.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This will, in turn, facilitate interpretation of the identified mutations.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The central thesis of this work represents such an attempt, and, towards that end, the already large number of CFTR orthologs has been expanded by the determination of the sequences of two full-length CFTR orthologous isoforms from a single teleost fish species, the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	17	The availability of this newly expanded number of CFTR sequences also offered an opportunity to reevaluate the use of mouse models for CF studies and, from a phylogenetic point of view, to check whether the paraphyly of the Glires (Lagomorpha and Rodentia), determined using CFTR sequences, was reliable or simply the result of a long-branch attraction artifact between the long rodent branch and the very divergent outgroup (Xenopus) (Vuillaumier et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In this regard, a partial coding sequence from the eastern gray kangaroo (Macropus giganteus; a marsupial mammal whose divergence time with placental mammals is about 120 Myr) was also produced in order to determine whether such an outgroup long-branch attraction artifact existed.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	19	Three steps were taken to isolate the salmon CFTR cDNAs by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Second, when a specific CFTR fragment was obtained, new specific primers were designed and further PCR fragments were amplified.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These efforts generated two sets of three overlapping clones covering most of the salmon CFTR-coding sequence.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Finally, the remaining translated and the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of the two cDNAs were obtained using a 5'/3' Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) Kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) or a similar Marathon cDNA cloning kit (Clontech) utilizing isoform-specific primers.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Phylogenetic analysis was performed principally using the branch-and-bound search of PAUP (Swofford 1999 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	41	 To check the impact of a suspected artifact on the tree reconstruction method, trees were also reconstructed using uncorrected distances and corrected distances (Kimura 1983 ) through the neighbor-joining approach (Saitou and Nei 1987 ) using the MUST package (Philippe 1993 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Moreover, absolute mutational saturation was tested by plotting pairwise observed differences against pairwise inferred substitutions in the most parsimonious tree using PAUP and MUST.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	58	 This is given wide support by recent in vivo expression data: although both sCFTR-I expression and sCFTR-II expression have been shown to increase in the gill following abrupt seawater exposure, the pattern of temporal expression for each gene is considerably different (Singer et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Moreover, the existence of two different genes encoding the same product is not entirely surprising, as many fish species, including salmonids (Hordvik 1998 ), have undergone tetraploidization events during their evolutionary histories, and duplication of certain hormone genes (e.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Furthermore, there is also circumstantial evidence suggesting the presence of two CFTR genes in another teleost fish, the killifish: two transcripts and two polypeptides were detected in the gill by Northern blotting (Singer et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	63	 1998 ) and Western blotting (Mickle and Cutting 2000) , respectively.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	64	 These observations, taken together, strongly suggest that sCFTR-I and sCFTR-II represent different isoforms and that the presence of duplicate CFTR isoforms may be a more general phenomenon in teleost fish species.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Indeed, based on such an approach, a "functional R domain" has recently been defined (Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000 ; see also fig.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	102	 See table 2 for the CFTR sequences used for alignment.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	103	The new definition of the NH2 terminus of NBD1 combines the following considerations.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The principal evidence comes from evolutionary data.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	105	 As illustrated in figure 2 , there is a sharp increase in sequence conservation beginning at P439 in comparison with the immediately preceding sequence.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	106	 The first six amino acids of the originally defined NBD1 (i.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	107	, F433 to T438) are quite divergent (even to the extent of deletions having occurred in several species), and the upstream region is a divergent sequence track of 20 amino acids.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	108	 In contrast, downstream of P439, not only is there a stringently conserved three-amino-acid motif (i.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	109	, P439-V440-L441), but also most of the nonstringently conserved residues from K442 to A457 have changes mainly involving substitutions between conservative amino acids, and this region is then followed by the highly conserved Walker A motif (GSTGAGKT, amino acid 458 to amino acid 465).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	110	 A similar transition from divergence to sequence conservation is also present in the equivalent location of the aligned sequences of other ABC transporter family members, as illustrated in a sequence comparison of the 17 bacterial membrane proteins that form the periplasmic permease gene family (Mimura, Holbrook, and Ames 1991 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Second, this definition is consistent with most of the structural models of human CFTR, where the NH2 terminus of NBD1 was regarded as T438 (Higgins 1992 ), L441 (Bianchet et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	112	 1997 ), and around V440 (Hoedemaeker, Davidson, and Rose 1998 ), respectively.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	113	 This definition also appears to correlate reasonably well with the three-dimensional crystal structure of HisP (the ATP-binding subunit of the bacterial histidine transporter), where P439 would be predicted to occur at the very beginning of the second ss strand of HisP (Hung et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Third, this definition falls within amino acids N432 to E449 the functionally defined NH2 terminus of NBD1 (Chan et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Finally, this definition is given further support by the mutational pattern in this transitional region (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	116	However, one may argue that the new definition of the NH2 terminus of NBD1 might have inappropriately excluded the sequences aligned to the first ss strand of HisP (Hung et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Of particular relevance to this point is residue F433, an aromatic amino acid that corresponds to residue Y16 of the HisP.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	118	 The structure of HisP has been considered a good model for the binding of ATP to an NBD, in which the aromatic Y16 was confirmed to play a critical role (as determined by mutational studies by Shyamala et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Moreover, the structures of the other two prokaryotic NBD proteins, LivF and the amino-terminal NBD of RbsA, show a very similar binding interaction between the NBD and ATP, that is, the side chain of an aromatic residue (analogous to Y16 in HisP) interacts with the adenine ring of ATP to stabilize nucleotide binding.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Furthermore, an aromatic residue 20 to 30 amino acids upstream of the start of the Walker A motif (in a similar position relative to Y16 in HisP) is conserved in other ABC transporter NBDs (summarized in Berger and Welsh 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	121	 By inference, F433 in the human CFTR may participate in ATP binding.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	122	 However, a recent functional analysis has refuted such a possibility and highlighted the unique structure of CFTR NBD compared with other NBD structures (Berger and Welsh 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Undoubtedly, this finding adds further weight to the newly defined NBD1.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	124	We previously defined the NH2 terminus of the R domain as beginning at C647 (Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Consequently, G646 could be considered the COOH terminus of NBD1.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	126	 However, the concurrent functional approach defined the COOH terminus of NBD1 as occurring between G622 and Q634 (Chan et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Nevertheless, G646 seems to be a more logical positioning of the true boundary linking NBD1 and the R domain in CFTR.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	128	 In addition to the previous arguments (Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000) , further supporting evidence also exists.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Again, the principal evidence comes from evolutionary data.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	130	 As indicated in figure 2 , the sequence from S623 to G646 is as well conserved as that from F587 to G622; the latter is the common part of the extended NBD1 in the two studies (Chan et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	131	 2000; Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Perhaps a more important indication comes from a sequence alignment with other ABC transporter NBDs; for example, HisP ends exactly at residue G646 of the human CFTR homolog (see fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Moreover, it is important to note that the functional assembly of paired CFTR segments severed at L633/Q634 is not as good as that of those cleaved at N432/F433 (Chan et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	134	 In this regard, it will be interesting to compare paired CFTR fragments cleaved at the newly defined NBD1/R domain boundary (i.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	135	, G646/C647) with those cleaved at L633/Q634.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	136	Refinement of the Boundaries of NBD2 The original location in the amino acid sequence of NBD2 is from Y1219 to R1386 (Riordan et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Historically, NBD2 has received much less attention than NBD1.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Now, with the boundaries of NBD1 redefined, those of NBD2 can be similarly refined.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Accordingly, the NH2 terminus of NBD2 could be defined as going from A1225 by reference to the relative position of the highly conserved Walker A motif, and this also correlates fairly well with the mutational pattern (the appearance of missense mutations clustering around the Walker A motif: GRTGSGKS, at amino acid 1244 to amino acid 1251) in the transitional region in NBD2 (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	140	 However, when the COOH terminus of NBD2 is extended to P1443 by reference to the redefined NBD1 (see also fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	141	 1998 ), the very COOH-terminal portion of this "new NBD2" shows poor sequence conservation.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Yet, this is not so surprising if it is considered in the context of the ABC transporter family, where for example, its counterpart region in the 17 bacterial periplasmic permeases is similarly divergent (Mimura, Holbrook, and Ames 1991 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Thus, it seems clear that the very COOH-terminal portions of NBDs are, in general, less functionally restrained throughout the ABC transporter family, although this is in stark contrast to the NBD1 of CFTR, where the very COOH-terminal portion is highly conserved (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	144	 While it is not clear whether this sequence conservation is related to the immediately following R domain (which is unique to CFTR), it lends further weight to the unique structure of CFTR NBD1.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	145	Although P1443 could represent the COOH terminus of a "new NBD2," this should not be accepted without any reservations.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	146	 The significant sequence divergence of the very COOH-terminal portion of this "new NBD2," the different structural requirements of a CFTR NBD compared with other ABC transporter NBDs in general (Berger and Welsh 2000) , and the differential roles between the CFTR NBD1 and NBD2 in particular (discussed below) argue for an alternative definition.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Here again, it is reassuring how well the evolutionary data, clinical observations, and functional studies concur.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	148	 The initial location of sequence divergence in this transitional region was clearly situated at E1418 (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	149	 In addition, the shortest truncation that is associated with CF disease (with pancreatic insufficiency and recurrent pulmonary infection) terminates at Q1412 (http://www.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Furthermore, a review of several functional studies clearly points to the fact that CFTR truncated at/or upstream of V1415 significantly affects the biogenesis, maturation, and stability of the protein, but those molecules truncated at or downstream of N1419 do not (Rich et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	151	 1999 ; Gentzsch and Riordan 2001 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	152	 These three lines of observation, together with the mutational pattern in this region, strongly suggest that residue E1417 can be confidently assigned as the COOH terminus of NBD2.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	153	 This new definition is also further validated by the analysis which has redefined the C-tail of the CFTR (discussed below).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	154	Functional Delineation of the C-Tail The COOH terminus of NBD2 could naturally be anticipated to be the NH2 boundary of the C-tail, and this appears to best delineate its functional role in the CFTR.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	155	 On the one hand, the newly defined C-tail is "nonessential," as the effects on the biogenesis, processing, and stability of the CFTR previously assigned to the original C-tail have now been relocated to within the newly defined NBD2.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Moreover, even the two trafficking signals thought to reside in the newly defined C-terminal tail, at Y1424 and the dileucine pair at L1430-L1431, have been demonstrated not to alter the steady-state amount of nascent or mature CFTR in recent functional studies (Gentzsch and Riordan 2001) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	157	 On the other hand, the newly defined C-tail does appear to be "essential," as the well-conserved motif involving the final three amino acids (TRL) represents a PDZ-interacting domain which is required for the polarization of CFTR to the apical plasma membrane in epithelial cells (Moyer et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Even so, it is important to note that this PDZ-binding motif alone is not sufficient for the polarized distribution of CFTR (Milewski et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Therefore, the C-tail as a whole would play a minor role in the pathogenesis of CF disease.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Indeed, neither S1455X (Mickle et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	161	ca/cftr) caused a severe CF phenotype.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	162	 By inference, any single missense mutations identified in the C-tail may not have a significant functional consequence.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Consistent with this hypothesis, none of the three missense mutations identified in this region (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	164	 2 ) can be confidently assigned as causal for CF disease; for example, R1422W was identified in a CF patient who also carried the mutations F508del and D993Y, and R1453W was identified in a patient with diffuse panbronchiolitis (http://www.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Finally, attention may be drawn to the well conserved, negatively charged motif (E1469 to E1474) in the C-tail.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	166	Further Insights into the Differential Function of NBD1 and NBD2 That the two NBDs are not functionally equivalent was immediately noticed in the early 1990s.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Not only were CF-associated mutations found predominantly in CFTR's NBD1 as opposed to NBD2, but also mutations of homologous amino acid residues within NBD1 or NBD2 resulted in different effects on CFTR maturation and function (Cheng et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	168	 More recently, the different roles of NBD1 and NBD2 in the CFTR chloride channel and the regulation of other ion channels have been further investigated through a variety of approaches (e.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	169	Apart from the fact that there are more disease-associated mutations in NBD1 than in NBD2, and more than half of the most common missense mutations or single-amino-acid deletions occur in NBD1, figure 2 reveals an additional interesting observation regarding mutational patterns in the well-conserved motifs in the NBDs.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	170	 While there are 17 missense mutations clustered in the LSGGQ motif (LSGGQ, amino acids 548 to 552) and the Walker B motif (RAVYKDADLYLLD, amino acids 560 to 572) in NBD1, there are only four missense mutations in the equivalent regions (LSHGH [amino acids 1346 to 1350] and RSVLSKAKILLLD [amino acids 1358 to 1370]) of NBD2.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Conversely, while there is only one missense mutation in the Walker A motif (GSTGAGKT, amino acids 458 to 465) in NBD1, there are five mutations in the corresponding motif (GRTGSGKS, amino acids 1244 to 1251) in NBD2.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	172	 This finding is intriguing since, on the one hand, although Walker A and Walker B are presumably both involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, the exact mechanisms remain largely unknown.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	173	 On the other hand, while it is generally believed that ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 and NBD2 may drive channel opening and closing, respectively (reviewed by Nagel 1999 ), recent biochemical analysis suggests that opening and closing may occur as a consequence of nucleotide binding and dissociation or hydrolysis at a functional unit involving both domains (Aleksandrov et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Therefore, it is tempting to ask whether the distinct mutational patterns in these important motifs are linked intrinsically to functional differences of the Walker A and Walker B sites within the two NBDs.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Elucidation of this question would improve our understanding of the basic physiology of CFTR, as well as that of other ABC transporters.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Nevertheless, this observation gives further support to the idea that NBD1 and NBD2 make different contributions to the gating of CFTR channels.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	177	Further Insights into the Differential Role of MSD1 (F81 to V350) and MSD2 (I860 to S1150) Each MSD was predicted to contain six transmembrane segments (TMs), three extracellular loops (ECLs), and two intracellular loops (ICLs).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	178	 As in the case of the two NBDs, functional differences have also been found for the two MSDs (e.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	179	, Yue, Devidas, and Guggino 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	180	 A comparison of the stringently conserved residues in the TMs of the two MSDs reveals that the TMs in MSD1 are generally more conserved than those in MSD2 (data not shown; see also fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	181	 2 ); TM6 (12 out of 21 residues; 57.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	182	1%) and TM12 (11 out of 22 residues; 50.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	183	0%) are the most conserved motifs in the two MSDs, respectively, and TM6 is the most conserved of all.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	184	 The evolutionary conservation of these regions correlates perfectly with analysis that suggests that (1) TM6 and TM12 line the CFTR pore, (2) TM6 is the main determinant of the pore properties of CFTR, and (3) MSD1 and MSD2 each contribute differently to CFTR pore properties (Sheppard and Welsh 1999 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	185	A defining feature of ion channels is their selectivity, the ability to pass certain ions at a high rate while at the same time effectively excluding others.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	186	 While discrimination between different cations in certain cation channels is known to occur over a short region of the pore known as the selectivity filter, the existence of a discrete anion selectivity filter in the pores of Cl- channels is controversial (Linsdell, Evagelidis, and Hanrahan 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Nevertheless, based on the above-mentioned evolutionary data, such a selectivity filter in the CFTR, if it indeed exists, would most likely be located in the most highly conserved TM TM6.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Not surprisingly, the anion selectivity (Br-  >  Cl-  >  I-) of the CFTR pore was found to be mainly determined by the first half of the protein (Yue, Devidas, and Guggino 2000) , and mutations in several residues in TM6, including K335 (Anderson et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	189	 1991 ), F337 (Linsdell, Evagelidis, and Hanrahan 2000) , T338 (Linsdell, Zheng, and Hanrahan 1998 ), and R347 (Cheung and Akabas 1997 ), were shown to significantly affect anion selectivity.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Moreover, the stringently conserved motif T351-R352-Q353 immediately downstream of TM6 has also been suggested to loop back into the channel, narrowing the lumen and thereby forming both the major resistance to current flow and the anion selectivity filter (Cheung and Akabas 1997 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Assuming that an anion selectivity filter resides in the vicinity of TM6, it is interesting to note the presence of another highly conserved motif also in this vicinity (Q359-T360-W361-Y362-D363).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Furthermore, there is also a similarly stringently conserved motif downstream of TM12 in MSD2, L1156-M1157-R1158-S1159-V1160.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	193	Inspection of figure 2 also reveals that the four ICLs are generally more conserved than the TM and ECL subdomains in the MSDs.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	194	 To date, most of the missense mutations identified in each ICL and a 19-amino-acid deletion concerning ICL2 have been investigated by functional analysis (reviewed in Sheppard and Welsh 1999 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	195	 These studies strongly indicated that the ICLs were critical for correct protein processing.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Among the four ICLs, ICL4 (amino acid Q1035 to amino acid R1102, with a sequence homology as high as 72% across the 15 CFTR species) turns out to be the most conserved subdomain in the entire CFTR sequence.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	197	 This stringent sequence conservation, coupled with a cluster of missense mutations identified in this subdomain (among which two homozygosities, H1085R [Yoshimura et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	198	 1999 ] and R1066C [Casals et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	199	 1997 ], cause a severe CF phenotype), undoubtedly underlies its functional significance within CFTR.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	200	 While a large fraction of the analyzed ICL4 missense mutations disrupted the biosynthetic processing of CFTR, this was not universally the case.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Most importantly, those processed mutants had no discernible effect on the channel's pore properties, but they did alter gating behavior, the response to increasing concentrations of ATP, and stimulation in response to pyrophosphate (Cotten et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Thus, ICL4, and probably the other three ICLs, may actively participate in interdomain interactions; for example, they may link the NBDs to MSDs, thereby coupling the activity of NBDs to the gating of the channel.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	203	Possible Motifs Implicated in the Interdomain Interaction Between the NH2-Terminal Tail (N-tail; M1 to R80) and the R Domain An eliciting finding is that the N-tail controls CFTR channel gating through a physical interaction with the R domain.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Not surprisingly, this positive regulatory activity was mapped to a cluster of acidic residues, D47, E51, E54, and D58, within the highly charged and conserved motif D44 to E60 (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Since no effects of any of the N-tail mutations on steady-state phosphorylation in vitro or in vivo were detected, the N-tail most likely modulates channel activity by controlling access of the phosphorylated R domain to inhibitory or stimulatory sites within the channel (Naren et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	206	The fact that a cluster of stringently conserved acidic residues in the N-tail appears to bind to part of the R domain (most probably the region involving amino acids 708 to 740 and the nearby surrounding sequences; Naren et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	207	 As illustrated in figure 2 , there are three highly conserved, positively charged motifs (K696-R697-K698, R709-K710, and R764-R765-R766) in this region.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Although the conservation of these motifs may be explained by the fact that they potentially participate in phosphorylation of the R domain, the possibility that all, or at least some, of them serve as counterparts to the acidic residues in the N-tail cannot be excluded, particularly if the fact that none of them appear to be phosphyorylated by PKA in vivo is taken into account (Cheng et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	209	 More recently, a relatively small portion of the R domain (residues 760 to 783) that encompasses the stringently conserved motif (R765-R766-Q767-S768-V769-L760) was found to be critical for the prevention of constitutive activity of the CFTR (Baldursson et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	210	 This further highlights the functional importance of these motifs when it is considered that they are conserved even within the most evolutionarily divergent R domain sequences.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Future studies focusing on these motifs may result in the revelation of further novel molecular mechanisms.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	212	How Many Missense Mutations Are Functional? Unlike splicing and truncating mutations, it is always difficult to assign a definitive role to missense mutations, especially when they are detected in single cases.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Functional analysis provides important data, but extrapolation to clinical effects may not be straightforward.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	214	 This can be seen in the conflicting results that often occur in some aspects of CF research, exemplified by the two different models for salt and water transport across epithelia (reviewed by Wine 1999 ), as well as the disparity among results on the intracellular localization of F508del-CFTR (reviewed by Drumm 1999 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	215	 There is ongoing effort to tackle this issue (e.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	216	, the CF European Network: the Second Consensus Meeting Towards Validation of CFTR Gene Expression and Functional Assays, Estoril, March 30 to  April 1, 2001).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	217	We believe that a combined analysis of the currently available data can complement this effort and enhance our understanding of the identified mutations, particularly those that are missense.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Taking advantage of the previously redefined R domain, a systemic evaluation of the missense mutations occurring in this region was produced, and as a result, some of these mutations, such as F693L, V754M, and T760M, were identified as being likely to represent neutral polymorphisms (Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Similarly, the missense mutations occurring in evolutionarily divergent regions, for example, N418S, G424S, Q890R, and K1177R, may also represent neutral polymorphisms.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	220	 At the other extreme, for example, the mutations I506M and F508C, which occur in stringently conserved residues in the functionally important NBD1, have also been confirmed to be nonfunctional variants (Kobayashi et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	221	 1990 ; Kalin, Dork, and Tummler 1992 ; Will et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The assignment of mutations as in these two extreme cases would raise a serious concern that a certain fraction of the identified missense mutations in classic and atypical CF patients may in fact merely represent polymorphisms rather than mutations associated with the disease.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	223	 If this assumption is correct, it is not unreasonable to infer that the truly causal mutation event may remain unidentified in a certain fraction of patients in whom the disease has been incorrectly assumed to be caused by identified "missense mutations.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	224	The above assumption is further supported by the following considerations.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The large size of the CFTR gene makes it difficult to analyze the entire coding sequence, not to mention the intronic sequence.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Consequently, initial identification of one DNA variant may discourage further screening efforts, thereby ignoring a second variant in cis in the gene.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Even if the whole CFTR gene were analyzed, certain variants, such as large deletions within the gene (which are being detected at an increasing rate; http://www.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	228	ca/cftr), are still not readily detected by common mutational screening techniques (Girodon-Boulandet, Cazeneuve, and Goossens 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	229	 In addition, the promoter sequence (Romey et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	230	 1999 ) and the upstream regulatory region (Nuthall et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	231	 1999 ) of the CFTR gene may be targets for extended mutational screening.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Moreover, mutations in other genes in certain CF-like disease subjects should be considered (Mekus et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	233	Taken together, it is likely that a certain fraction of the missense mutations identified in the CFTR gene may be ultimately confirmed to be nonpathological polymorphisms.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	234	 It is even possible that some of them may turn out to be modifiers of another variant in the CFTR gene or even in another gene.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	235	 An answer to this question will significantly improve our understanding of the disease, as well as that of the protein itself.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Nevertheless, this vast number of missense mutations represents an invaluable resource for exploring the subtlety of the CFTR structure-function relationship, and figure 2 could serve as an important complement to ongoing mutation detection and functional analysis efforts in the CF field.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	237	A Comprehensive Phylogenetic Analysis: Implications for Animal Models of CF An additional dividend of the availability of a large number of CFTR sequences is their benefit concerning the use of animal models in CF studies.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	238	 We had previously suggested that the rabbit could be a better CF model than the current murine model, mainly based on (1) anatomical and developmental data, (2) comparison of CFTR promotor sequences and partial coding sequences, and (3) phylogenetic analysis of those sequences (Vuillaumier et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Although sequence comparisons clearly showed a higher similarity between rabbit and primate sequences than between murine and primate sequences or even between rabbit and murine sequences, the phylogenetic implications were ambiguous.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	240	A long-branch attraction artifact (Felsenstein 1978 ) of the murine lineage toward the outgroup was suspected (Vuillaumier et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	241	 This classical artifact of phylogenetics concerns all tree reconstruction methods.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	242	 It occurs when rates of character change vary among lineages, provoking in trees the grouping of lineages sharing close rates, whatever the evolutionary relationships.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	243	 To solve this ambiguity, additional sequence data (particularly from further species) were required for a successful analysis.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	244	 When all of the full-length CFTR amino acid sequences were analyzed in this study (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	245	 1 ), the murine lineage was the most basal of the placental mammals, a strange result possibly due to a long-branch attraction.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Moreover, the position of the rabbit was ambiguous.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	247	 In the most parsimonious tree (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	248	 1 ) and in the neighbor-joining tree from corrected distances (data not shown), the rabbit is a sister group to the bovids + primates clade.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In the neighbor-joining tree based on uncorrected distances, the rabbit is the sister group to the primates as in our previous report (Vuillaumier et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	250	 When an extended set of exon 13 to coding sequences including a nonplacental mammal (the kangaroo) and another nonmurid rodent (guinea pig) were analyzed (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	251	 3 ), the guinea pig represented a sister group to the rabbit corresponding to the Glires (node E), while the murids were still the most basal of the placental mammals.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Assuming that rodents are a monophyletic group (Novacek and Wyss 1986 ; Luckett and Hartenberger 1993 ; Philippe 1997 ), it appears that the murids are artifactually basal in the placental tree, as they should be a sister group to the guinea pig within clade E.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Thus, the high level of divergence of the mouse sequence not only makes the mouse an inappropriate model for CF studies, but also provokes a phylogenetic artifact.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Unfortunately, the addition of the kangaroo sequence did not correct this artifact, as it was added as a taxon closer to placental mammals than the frog is, in order to break a long branch that could have reduced the possibility of the murid long-branch attraction.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Nevertheless, the conclusions from the phylogenetic analysis do not challenge the proposition of the rabbit as a better CF model whose sequence is more closely related to humans (than murine species are).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Additionally, the guinea pig appears to be an equally good model candidate.

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	2	We investigated adenosine (Ado) activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in vitro and in vivo.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	3	 A2B Ado receptors were identified in Calu-3, IB-3-1, COS-7, and primary human airway cells.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Ado elevated cAMP in Calu-3, IB-3-1, and COS-7 cells and activated protein kinase A-dependent halide efflux in Calu-3 cells.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Ado promoted arachidonic acid release from Calu-3 cells, and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibition blocked Ado-activated halide efflux in Calu-3 and COS-7 cells expressing CFTR.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Forskolin- and 2-adrenergic receptor-stimulated efflux were not affected by the same treatment.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Cytoplasmic PLA2 (cPLA2) was identified in Calu-3, IB-3-1, and COS-7 cells, but cPLA2 inhibition did not affect Ado-stimulated cAMP concentrations.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In cftr(+) and cftr(/) mice, Ado stimulated nasal Cl secretion that was CFTR dependent and sensitive to A2 receptor and PLA2 blockade.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In COS-7 cells transiently expressing F508 CFTR, Ado activated halide efflux.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Ado also activated G551D CFTR-dependent halide efflux when combined with arachidonic acid and phosphodiesterase inhibition.

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	13	THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated Cl channel and is responsible for regulating ion transport in many tissues where it is expressed, including the airways and airway submucosal glands, sweat glands, gastrointestinal tract, pancreatic and bile ducts, and the reproductive tract (58, 74).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Defective CFTR function disrupts ion transport, which is believed to contribute to the clinical sequelae characteristic of cystic fibrosis (CF) (49, 58, 67, 74).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	15	 CFTR regulation in vivo is accomplished through ATP binding and hydrolysis at nucleotide binding domain-1 and -2 and regulation of the phosphorylation status of the regulatory domain (10, 11, 36).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This process is complex and depends on cAMP production through surface receptors that couple to adenylyl cyclase, cAMP degradation by phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity (40, 41), domain-domain interactions within the CFTR (55), protein-protein interactions between the CFTR and associated regulatory proteins (31, 32, 54, 64), and direct phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the regulatory domain by protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphatases (6, 11), respectively.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Receptor-based pathways that signal through cAMP are therefore relatively accessible candidates for promoting activation of the CFTR in vivo.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This has been established for 2-adrenergic receptors, which are commonly stimulated in assays to detect CFTR-dependent Cl secretion as measured by changes in the nasal potential difference (PD) in mice and in humans (44).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	19	Adenosine (Ado) is a Cl secretagogue that signals through P1 purinergic receptors, and recent studies have demonstrated that A2B Ado receptors (ARs) can tightly couple to CFTR through PKA.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In Calu-3 cells, part of this coupling is due to compartmentalized signaling of CFTR with adenylyl cyclase and PKAII through A kinase anchoring protein interactions (34, 71).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	21	 T84 cells also express A2B-ARs, where they have been shown to mediate neutrophil-stimulated Cl secretion (48, 70).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Studies (2-4) have also suggested a role for phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in Ado-activated Cl secretion in T84 cells.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The nature of this role and whether similar signaling contributes to CFTR activation in other CFTR-expressing cells and tissues, however, are unknown.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	24	In this report, we describe CFTR regulation by A2-ARs in vitro and in vivo and evaluate the contribution of cytoplasmic PLA2 (cPLA2) to A2 receptor signaling in airway cells and the murine airway.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Our findings suggest that A2 receptors maximize CFTR activation by signaling through both adenylyl cyclase-PKA and cPLA2 and that components of these receptor signaling pathways can activate common disease-causing CFTR mutations.

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	343	 Isotype-specific PDEis were studied at concentrations ~20-fold over the inhibition constant of their respective PDEs.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	344	 Cells were also studied with Ado + AA alone (i.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	345	 Values are means  plus or minus  SE of all cells studied in each condition (n  >  40).

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	347	In this report, we investigated the cellular pathways utilized by Ado to activate CFTR-dependent ion transport.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Using a series of experimental systems, including single cells, polarized cell monolayers, and in vivo measurements in cftr(+) and cftr(/) mice, we demonstrated that Ado, through A2-ARs, activates CFTR-dependent halide transport.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	349	 These receptors are expressed in human airway cells and signal in part through cAMP and PKA.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	350	 We also demonstrated the dependence of this signaling pathway on PLA2 activity in vitro and in vivo.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	351	 Finally, we showed that the two most common disease-associated CFTR mutations can be activated by A2B receptors alone (F508 CFTR) or by using messenger pathways stimulated by A2B receptors (G551D CFTR).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	352	 These results help to establish the physiological role of Ado-stimulated Cl secretion in vivo and may identify new targets for improving the function of mutant CFTR molecules.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	353	Ado is a ubiquitous signaling molecule, serving protean functions ranging from regulation of neurotransmission to cardiovascular tone and inflammation in many organ systems.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	354	 Our results, together with those of other investigators, indicate an important role for Ado as a regulator of CFTR.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	355	 Ado and A2 receptors are potent activators of Cl secretion in primary human airway cell monolayers, in addition to canine and gerbil airway cells and T84 intestinal cells (28, 46, 59, 70).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	356	 In each of these systems, Cl secretion has been accomplished in the setting of low cAMP levels.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	357	 Part of this high efficiency is due to compartmentalization of A2B receptors, transduction proteins, and CFTR (34, 71).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	358	 Our results suggest that in addition to spatial compartmentalization, efficient transduction between A2 receptors and CFTR involves cPLA2 activation and AA signaling.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	359	 A2 receptors, including A2A and A2B subtypes, classically signal through stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, cAMP, and, ultimately, PKA (56).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	360	 Although A2A receptors appear to hold more strictly to this observation, A2B receptors have been shown to stimulate additional signaling pathways such as phospholipase C, direct regulation of calcium channels, and, in our experience, PLA2 (26).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	361	 These observations are of particular interest because recent studies (27) have demonstrated abnormal lipid profiles, including elevated AA levels, in murine CF tissues.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	362	 Our findings demonstrate that lipid signaling may be important to the regulation of CFTR activity by Ado in vitro and in vivo.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	363	 The present results therefore set the stage for future studies designed to test the relationship between membrane lipid composition, A2 receptors, and CFTR activity.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	364	There are two general classes of PLA2 enzymes: cPLA2 (three subtypes) and secretory PLA2 (seven subtypes) (33).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	365	 Both are expressed in many tissues including the lung and leukocytes.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	366	 cPLA2 translocates to cell membranes after activation and primarily releases AA from membrane lipids.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	367	 cPLA2 has been shown to play an important immunologic role in human airway epithelial cells, governing AA release from epithelia after immunostimulation (76).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	368	 Studies (50) have also observed dysregulation of PLA2 in the CF airway, with increased AA release seen after bradykinin exposure in F508 CFTR-expressing airway cells compared with normal control cells.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	369	 AA is the parent molecule of two important inflammatory signaling cascades including 1) the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, which leads to the production of prostanoids and thromboxanes and 2) the lipoxygenase pathway in which AA is metabolized to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and the leukotrienes A4-E4.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	370	 Clinical studies suggest that products of AA metabolism, including proinflammatory species, have direct relevance to CF-related inflammation.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	371	 The COX-1 inhibitor ibuprofen is routinely used in the pediatric CF population to reduce lung inflammation and slow the progression of CF lung disease (45).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Glucocorticoids, which suppress COX-2 expression, have also been studied in CF clinical trials, attenuating the decline in pulmonary function in pediatric CF patients (25).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	373	 The relevance of AA signaling pathways to CFTR activity and ion transport, however, has not been previously demonstrated.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	374	 Our results suggest that a buildup in AA may have beneficial effects on CFTR activity in the context of its activation by surface receptors.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	375	The mechanism by which A2 receptors activate CFTR-dependent Cl transport is complex.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	376	 CFTR activation by A2 receptors could be blocked by either PKA or cPLA2 inhibition (Fig.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	377	 Production of cAMP was not reduced by PLA2 inhibition in any of the three cell lines (Fig.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	378	 Although 10 min of high-dose (100  microM) AA exposure could stimulate some cAMP production in the two airway cell lines (primarily Calu-3 cells, likely through the actions of distal metabolites such as PGI, PGE2, PGF2 or PGD) (73), it failed to augment cAMP production by Ado or acutely activate CFTR when used alone (COS-7 or Calu-3 cells; Fig.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	379	 These results suggest that the additional effects of AA on CFTR-dependent halide transport were not through influences on total cellular cAMP.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	380	 Rather, A2 receptors appear to activate both adenylyl cyclase and cPLA2 in parallel, with each signaling pathway contributing to the maximization of CFTR activity.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	381	 PLA2 signaling was not necessary to activate CFTR through receptors, however, because 2-adrenergic stimulation activated CFTR-dependent Cl transport in vitro and in vivo despite cPLA2 inhibition (Figs.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	382	Figure 12 is a summary model that provides three possible mechanisms by which cPLA2 and AA could contribute to A2 receptor activation of CFTR.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	383	 It is possible that Ado and/or AA exerts its effects in part by activating K+ channels and increasing the driving force for halide efflux.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	384	 AA has been shown to have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on epithelial K+ channels, and modulation of basolateral K+ channel activity can strongly influence transepithelial Cl transport (20, 21).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	385	 In related experiments, Ado-activated halide efflux in CFTR-expressing COS-7 cells was not reduced by two K+ channel blockers, including barium and tetraethylammonium (10 mM each) (18, 19).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	386	 These results suggest that the stimulatory effects of Ado on CFTR seen in our studies were independent of K+ channel activation.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	387	 The observation that AA augmented the stimulation of CFTR by Ado and forskolin (Figs.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	388	 5 and 11), but failed to stimulate CFTR alone in vitro (Fig.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	389	 5), suggests that AA may exert a permissive effect on CFTR activation.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	390	 Membrane-derived fatty acids, including AA and its metabolites, have been demonstrated to interact with ion channels and influence their activation by other signaling molecules, including nucleotide sensitivity of ATP-activated K+ channels (5, 65), light-sensitive transient receptor potential, and transient receptor potential-like channels (14), small Cl channels in rabbit parietal cells (61), the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (9), and calcium channels as part of oscillating calcium currents (51).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	391	 AA does interact with CFTR and alter its Cl channel activity.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	392	 Cytoplasmic AA produces a flickery block of CFTR in inside-out membrane patches after heterologous expression (1, 35, 47).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	393	 Membrane lipids (including AA) can have differential effects on the function of other channels, stimulating channel activity on one surface and inhibiting channel activity on the other (52).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	394	 We speculate that AA or one of its metabolites may interact with an external portion of the channel or with an unidentified regulatory factor that secondarily influences CFTR Cl channel function.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	395	 Alternatively, products of AA metabolism could accelerate local cAMP production and, in this way, increase CFTR channel activity.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	396	 This process would be difficult to detect with total cellular assays to quantitate [cAMP].
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	397	 The effect would need to be quite dramatic, however, because G551D CFTR, which has previously been shown to be poorly responsive to powerful phosphorylating stimuli, appears to be activated by costimulation with AA (Fig.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	398	 This occurs despite no detectable change in [cAMP] when combined with Ado (Fig.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	399	 6A) but is most pronounced when combined with PDE inhibition.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	400	 Single-channel-based studies will be necessary to help clarify the mechanism by which cPLA2 and AA promote CFTR activity.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	401	 Finally, our results do not exclude the possibility that additional processes may be involved because CPZ has been shown to have effects on other cell signaling pathways in addition to PLA2 (8, 12, 23, 43, 57).

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	405	 AA or products of AA metabolism, when combined with cAMP, helped maximize CFTR transport of Cl.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	406	 The mechanism could involve effects on the electrochemical driving force for ion transport through CFTR (i.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	407	, activation of K+ channels) through direct effects of lipid species with CFTR or associated factors (direct effects) or possibly by increasing the rate of cAMP production in the vicinity of CFTR (accelerated cAMP production).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	408	 COX, cyclooxygenase; LO, lipoxygenase.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	409	 7-9 indicate that Ado is a potent Cl secretagogue in vivo, activating CFTR-dependent Cl transport across the murine nasal mucosa more predictably than Iso (when studied at 100  microM).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	410	 This is of relevance to human nasal PD protocols, which typically use 2-receptor stimulation with Iso to aid in the detection of CFTR-dependent Cl transport.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	411	 Our results suggest that comparisons of these two receptor pathways in human subjects may improve the sensitivity of the nasal PD, which could have implications for clinical studies that use this assay to measure low-level CFTR function.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	412	 The importance of PLA2 signaling to Ado activation of Cl transport was also demonstrated in vivo because Ado- but not Alb-stimulated Cl conductance was sensitive to PLA2 inhibition.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	413	A2 receptor signaling may also be useful in improving the activity of disease-related CFTR mutations.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	414	 Using an in vitro system, we have demonstrated that CFTR mutations from three subclasses (classes II, III, and IV) can be activated by A2B receptors (17) (Figs.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	415	 Although the expression levels of the mutant CFTRs were far higher than those found in vivo, the results shown in Figs.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	416	 10 and 11 support the notion that mutant CFTRs, when localized to the cell membrane, can be activated by endogenous receptor-based signaling pathways.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	417	 Current approaches to increase mutant CFTR activity, including improvement of CFTR biosynthesis [e.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	418	, suppression of premature stop mutations with aminoglycoside antibiotics (7, 15, 75)], increase in trafficking of F508 CFTR to the cell membrane [e.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	419	, treatment with butyrate compounds (60)], or treatment of surface mutant CFTRs with activating compounds [e.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	420	, genistein or PDE inhibitors (38, 68)] may be complemented by the use of A2 receptor signaling pathways.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	421	 Our findings also suggest that common mutant CFTRs should be at least partially responsive to this signaling pathway when available at the cell membrane.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	422	In summary, our studies demonstrate that A2B-ARs are expressed in CF and normal airway cells, localizing predominantly to the apical membrane of polarized Calu-3 cells.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	423	 A2 receptors mediate activation of CFTR-dependent Cl transport in vitro and in vivo, utilizing cPLA2 and AA in addition to cAMP and PKA.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	424	 Ado and A2-ARs compare favorably with other agents as activators of CFTR-dependent Cl conductance, stimulating Cl secretion better than the 2-adrenergic receptor agonist Iso in mice and activating F508 CFTR similar to forskolin in vitro.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	425	 Our studies therefore provide a rationale for the investigation of the effects of Ado and A2 receptor signaling on measured Cl secretion in humans.

0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	5	THE MAJOR DISEASE-CAUSING mutation of the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508) in the predicted cytoplasmic domain known as the first nucleotide binding fold (NBF1).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Approximately 70% of CF patients are homozygous for the F508 cftr, and  > 90% carry at least one F508 cftr allele (compound heterozygotes) (11).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Nascent wild-type human (h)CFTR is translated and core-glycosylated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	8	 A fraction of the core-glycosylated hCFTR protein (25 to 40%; Refs.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	9	 36 and 48) is transported to the Golgi apparatus, where glycosylation is further modified to form mature hCFTR that is targeted to the plasma membrane (5).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	10	 There, the wild-type hCFTR functions as a cyclic nucleotide-regulated anion channel and serves a number of transport functions, including regulation of other ion transport proteins and membrane recycling phenomena (2, 8).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In contrast to wild-type hCFTR, nearly all of F508 hCFTR is retained in the ER in its core-glycosylated form and sorted to the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation pathway instead of the Golgi apparatus (5, 25).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	12	 It is believed that improper folding of the mutant protein is recognized by proteins comprising a cellular "quality control" mechanism that retains misfolded proteins for degradation (44).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Chaperone proteins are also involved in the processing of hCFTR and at least two proteins, HSP70 and calnexin, bind F508 hCFTR with greater avidity than wild-type hCFTR (39).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The process of recognition by the quality control machinery and the conformation of the misfolded F508 hCFTR have not been elucidated.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In epithelia homozygous for the F508 mutation, retention and degradation of the mutant hCFTR essentially eliminates the capacity for cyclic nucleotide-regulated anion secretion, and it is believed that this deficit is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the disease (38).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	16	Defective processing of F508 hCFTR is at least partially reversible.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Studies in cells expressing recombinant F508 hCFTR and tissues cultured from transgenic F508 murine (m)CFTR mice have shown that a fraction of the mutant protein undergoes biosynthetic maturation when cells are grown at subphysiological temperatures (26 degrees C) (13).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Studies in which F508 hCFTR-expressing cells were treated with "chemical chaperones" such as glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or organic cellular osmolytes such as myo-inositol and betaine have also found increased maturation of F508 hCFTR, a result that was attributed to stabilization of the mutant protein (1, 3, 22, 52).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Overexpression of the mutant protein either by transfection or by treatment with butyrate results in trafficking of F508 hCFTR to the plasma membrane (4, 40).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The above observations have important therapeutic implications because F508 hCFTR in the plasma membrane retains its capacity as a cyclic nucleotide-regulated anion channel (13).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Studies in cell-free systems indicate that stimulated F508 hCFTR may have channel kinetics similar to wild-type hCFTR (23, 31, 42), whereas on-cell patch studies measure reduced channel kinetic activity compared with wild-type hCFTR (12, 20, 24).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Even if F508 CFTR has reduced function and shorter membrane residence (32), previous studies suggest that only a small amount (10 to 15%) of F508 CFTR activity in the membrane is required to restore epithelial function and moderate disease (15, 26).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Combined with recent pharmacological studies showing that F508 hCFTR channel activity can be significantly enhanced by treatment with compounds such as 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (CPX), genistein, or class III phosphodiesterase inhibitors (28), it is clear that correcting F508 hCFTR trafficking is a viable strategy for treating CF.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	24	Recent studies have shown that expression of polypeptides representing the structural domain of a protein (i.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	25	, "domain mimics") can predictably alter posttranslational processing of the protein.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Expression of a minigene encoding the carboxy terminus of human ether-a-go-go-related gene was shown to rescue a carboxy-terminal truncation mutant from misprocessing (29).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In another study, a 6-mer peptide mimic of the reactive center loop of 1-antitrypsin was used to block pathological polymerization of the Z variant mutation of the protein (35).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	28	 With regard to CFTR, expression of a polypeptide representing the NBF1 plus the regulatory "R" domain of hCFTR was shown to inhibit activity of ENaC, the epithelial Na+ channel reputedly regulated by CFTR (45).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Because the NBF1 domain of hCFTR is the location of F508 as well as several other processing mutants (46), the NBF1 domain itself may serve as a "checkpoint" for recognition by the cellular quality control machinery or, alternatively, may function in a critical intramolecular interaction that stabilizes hCFTR structure within the ER.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Therefore, we hypothesized that expression of the NBF1 domain may be sufficient to increase F508 CFTR activity in epithelial cells.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The NBF1 domain of CFTR is well conserved among mammalian species (17), and in the mouse, deletion of F508 results in a mCFTR processing defect that recapitulates the fundamental cellular defect of F508 homozygous CF patients (16, 50).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In the present study, both heterologous cell systems expressing recombinant F508 hCFTR and epithelial monolayers from a F508 CFTR homozygous mouse were used to test the hypothesis that expression of a NBF1 domain mimic increases trafficking F508 CFTR and restores cAMP-stimulated anion secretion.

0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	38	 For stable expression of the NBF1 construct in the polarized MGEF and MGEN epithelial cell lines (passages 3 to 16), the NotI-flanked construct was subcloned into the retroviral vector pLXSNz [i.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	39	 John Olsen, University of North Carolina) that was engineered with Zeocin resistance] to form the proviral component NBF1-LXSNz.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	40	 As a positive control, hCFTR cDNA was introduced into the plasmid to produce the proviral component hCFTR-LXSNz.

0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	145	 However, similar to our findings with the NBF1-expressing MGEN cells, expression of only the NBF1 domain did not result in cAMP-regulated anion permeability.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In the present study, restoration of cAMP-regulated anion secretion required NBF1 coexpression in F508 CFTR-expressing epithelial cells.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	147	Expression of cytosolic domain mimics has previously been used to alter specific intra- and intermolecular interactions within cells.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Pioneering work by Lefkowitz and coworkers (33) used domain mimics to disrupt interactions between plasma membrane receptors and G proteins coupled to phospholipase C activation.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	149	 More recently, a domain mimic expressed via a minigene was used to rescue misprocessing of a carboxy-terminal truncation mutant of human ether-a-go-go-related protein (29) and a domain peptide was used to selectively mask portions of mutant 1-antitrypsin to prevent posttranslational polymerization within hepatocytes (35).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	150	 With regard to CFTR, exogenous copies of the R domain have been shown to interact with full-length CFTR and modify gating behavior of its channel activity (34).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Domain mimics of CFTR and the integral membrane protein syntaxin 1A were used to modify channel activity and demonstrate a direct protein-protein interaction (37).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Furthermore, peptide mimics have been used to demonstrate binding interactions between NBF1 and the R domain of CFTR, which could be partially disrupted by introduction of the F508 mutation (6).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	153	Given the findings of the present study and previous observations with expression of recombinant F508 CFTR (4, 40), at least two mechanisms can be postulated that would result in increased processing of F508 CFTR beyond the ER.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	154	 First, expression of recombinant NBF1 may overwhelm the quality control system that is involved in retention and degradation of the mutant protein.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	155	 A similar process could be postulated for the plasma membrane appearance of F508 hCFTR when the mutant protein is overexpressed in heterologous cell systems (4, 40).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	156	 This mechanism would predict competitive binding for, perhaps specific, chaperone proteins or proteases, thereby allowing escape of mutant protein from the ER.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	157	 However, some evidence weakens the case for this proposed mechanism.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Our measures of protein expression in the C127 cells indicated that clones expressing wild-type NBF1 were more likely to have greater expression of the fully processed F508 CFTR compared with clones expressing the F508 NBF1 peptide (Fig.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	159	 This seems contrary to the prediction that F508 NBF1 would be more efficacious in competing for quality control proteins.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Furthermore, although it is possible that the concentration of the recombinant NBF1 at the quality control binding site(s) far exceeds that needed to discern differences between the two domain mimics, our estimates of NBF1 peptide concentration ( < 5 ng/ microl in cell pellets, as based on detection of the flag epitope with M2 monoclonal antibody) are well below the millimolar concentrations that are typically necessary to inhibit proteases with chemical inhibitors (25, 49).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The second potential mechanism by which NBF1 expression may lead to increased processing of F508 CFTR is that coexpression of additional NBF1 peptides may bind immature F508 CFTR and stabilize its structure in the ER.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	162	 For example, peptide interaction with the R domain of F508 CFTR may mask a site on the misfolded protein that is recognized by the quality control machinery, or additional copies of NBF1 may temporarily interact with F508 CFTR to catalyze a folding reaction that results in properly folded protein.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Given recent evidence that mature CFTR protein may dimerize in the plasma membrane (51), it seems plausible that cooperation between different CFTR monomers may be necessary for correct folding and that this interaction may be mimicked by the NBF1 domain peptides.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	164	Although the precise mechanism resulting in increased expression of F508 CFTR at the plasma membrane using coexpression of NBF1 peptides remains speculative, the significant aspect of the present study is that it suggests a refinement for therapeutic approaches to correcting F508 CFTR processing.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	165	 One major drawback to the use of viral vectors such as adeno-associated virus 2 for gene therapy is that the packaging capacity of the virus is limited, which, with a large gene like CFTR, leaves little capacity for promoter sequences (14).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Thus modification of the strategy to instead transfect only the NBF1 domain is attractive because the small size of the construct (0.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	167	5 kb) would improve packaging efficiency.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Furthermore, two biological advantages of using NBF1 domain transduction as therapy can be envisioned.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	169	 First, the expression of F508 CFTR is driven by its endogenous promoter, which may avoid the consequences of CFTR overexpression on the epithelium, e.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	170	, reduced cell proliferation potential (41).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	171	 A second advantage is that the NBF1 peptide is less likely to be toxic than the full-length channel protein when inadvertently expressed in nontarget tissues.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The NBF1 construct fused to a protein transduction domain (43) may also be useful for peptide therapy, especially if the smallest effective subunit of NBF1 can be defined.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Thus, on the basis of the observations in the present study, the therapeutic approach to correcting the basic protein-processing defect of F508 CFTR should be refined to focus on NBF1 domain mimics that alter trafficking of the mutant protein.

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Department of Biological Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305-5020.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, December 14, 2001, and in revised form, January 16, 2002.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	3	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 is the site of synthesis of membrane and secretory proteins and the site of their conformational maturation and assembly into correctly folded functional molecules.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	4	 "Quality control" refers to the system that monitors the folding and assembly of proteins in the ER, ensuring that only correctly folded proteins can mature to later compartments of the secretory pathway (1, 2).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Nascent proteins that fail to fold or assemble in the ER are degraded by a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (3).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Studies in mammalian cells and in yeast have led to the formulation of a general model for ERAD in which substrates are degraded by cytoplasmic proteasomes following retrotranslocation (i.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	7	 "dislocation") across the ER membrane by a process that requires the Sec61 translocon and functional ubiquitylation machinery at the cytosolic face of the ER membrane (4-6).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Dislocation of ERAD substrates across the ER membrane is kinetically coupled to their degradation by proteasomes, and in many cases, cytosolic intermediates of degradation are hard to detect (7, 8).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Although a central role for proteasomes in ERAD is widely accepted, a number of studies have suggested that other, nonproteasomal, proteolytic systems may also contribute to the elimination of misfolded proteins from the ER (9-12).

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Although nearly 1000 mutations have been linked to cystic fibrosis, the majority of Caucasian cystic fibrosis patients have at least one copy of the F508 mutation, a temperature-sensitive allele that is unable to fold correctly at physiological temperature.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	13	 As a consequence, F508 CFTR (F508) is not deployed to the plasma membrane and is instead rapidly degraded without being processed in the Golgi apparatus (14, 15).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	14	Several lines of evidence support a role for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in F508 turnover.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	15	 First, CFTR undergoes both co-translational and posttranslational ubiquitylation when expressed in a cell-free system (16, 17).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Second, inhibition of proteasome function with chemical inhibitors or with a dominant negative form of ubiquitin leads to accumulation of multiubiquitylated, undegraded forms of CFTR and F508 (13).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Third, degradation of F508 in a cell-free system is sensitive to inhibitors of both the 19 S and 20 S subunits of the proteasome (17, 18).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Curiously, despite this compelling evidence in support of a role for proteasomes in the degradation of misfolded CFTR, the effect of proteasome inhibition on the disappearance of F508 from pulse-chase studies is minimal (9, 13).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	19	 This observation has led some investigators to conclude that other proteolytic systems are primarily responsible for the ERAD of misfolded CFTR molecules (9).

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	58	 In the presence of MG132, a specific proteasome inhibitor (26), the half-life of this species was only modestly extended (t1/2 = 1.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	59	 A minor band migrating at Mr ~50,000 probably corresponds to an amino-terminal fragment of the GFP-508 fusion protein comprising Mr ~20,000 of CFTR in addition to the GFP moiety because it reacted with antibody to GFP, but not with an antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of CFTR (data not shown).

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Our results (data not shown) indicate that the HMW material was soluble in nonionic detergent and competent for degradation, strongly suggesting that the increase in molecular weight was due to covalent modification with Ub, as observed previously for CFTR in cell-free extracts (17).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	76	Quantification of the pulse-chase data indicates that MG132 was only marginally effective at stabilizing the Mr 170,000 F508 band.

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	79	 This observation suggests several plausible explanations.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	80	 First, as suggested by Jensen et al.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	81	 (9), in addition to proteasomes, other proteolytic systems could also contribute to F508 ERAD.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Alternatively, it is possible that some proteolytic activities within the proteasome remain uninhibited in the presence of MG132 and continue to degrade the substrate.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Finally, immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled material from detergent extracts of pulse-labeled cells may underestimate the amount of stable F508 if some of the protein becomes insoluble, if the epitope used for immunoprecipitation becomes inaccessible, or if the increased molecular weight (due to polyubiquitylation and/or aggregation) of the protein prevents it from being well resolved by SDS-PAGE.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	84	 We reasoned that a noninvasive method of monitoring the fluorescence of GFP-F508 in intact cells using fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis may be a more accurate way to measure protein stability because it does not rely upon efficient recovery of radiolabeled protein from cells or upon the detection of a resolvable electrophoretic species.

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Although epoxomicin can inhibit all three of the characterized activities of the proteasomes, it is 66- and 500- fold more effective at inhibiting the chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) activity than the trypsin-like or peptidyl-glutamyl hydrolyzing activities, respectively (30).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	131	 To investigate whether the low-affinity component of the MG132 and epoxomicin titrations was due to non-CT-L activities, we performed a titration of epoxomicin in the presence of 500  microM YU102, an ','-epoxyketone inhibitor that is selective for the peptidyl-glutamyl hydrolyzing activity of the proteasome (30).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	132	 This treatment resulted in a small (10-15%) but significant increase in the degree of inhibition of GFP-F508 fluorescence decay at all epoxomicin concentrations (Fig.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	133	 These results suggest that the CT-L and peptidyl-glutamyl hydrolyzing activities of the proteasome may contribute independently to the degradation of GFP-F508.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	134	A hallmark of proteolysis by the Ub-proteasome system is its dependence on ATP hydrolysis.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	135	 ATP is required for at least two steps in Ub-dependent degradation: activation of Ub, and substrate unfolding (31, 32).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	136	 However, previous studies suggested that the fraction of CFTR degradation that is insensitive to proteasome inhibitors is independent of ATP (9).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	137	 To assess the dependence of GFP-F508 degradation on ATP, we assayed GFP-F508 fluorescence in ATP-depleted cl.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	138	 These data demonstrate that GFP-F508 degradation is absolutely dependent on the presence of cellular ATP.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	139	 The degradation of GFPu was similarly dependent upon ATP (Fig.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	140	ER-associated degradation is a central element of the quality control pathways that ensure that only correctly folded and assembled proteins are deployed in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Although many studies have confirmed a primary role of the Ub-proteasome system in ERAD, the apparently minimal effect of highly potent proteasome inhibitors on the degradation of CFTR has remained an enigma and has suggested that other ATP-independent proteolytic systems also contribute to ERAD.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In this study, we have used a fluorescent substrate to re-evaluate the role of the UPS in ERAD.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Our data establish the primacy of the UPS in the degradation of ER-associated misfolded CFTR and suggest that the different proteolytic functionalities of the proteasome, associated with the three active -subunits, may operate independently in the degradation of an ERAD substrate (GFP-F508), but apparently not in the degradation of a cytoplasmic substrate (GFPu).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Three lines of evidence support our conclusion that the UPS is the principal pathway for degradation of misfolded CFTR.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	145	 First, proteasome inhibitors, but not inhibitors of serine or cysteine proteases or inhibitors of lysosomal or autophagic pathways, strongly stabilize GFP-F508 fluorescence.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Second, GFP-F508 degradation was inhibited by MG132 and epoxomicin in a dose-dependent fashion, with biphasic apparent IC50 values in the expected range for CT-L and non-CT-L activities (30).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Third, GFP-F508 degradation was strictly dependent on ATP, a hallmark of UPS-mediated proteolysis (31, 32).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	148	 The possibility that other proteases initiate the clipping of the CFTR molecule while it is situated in the ER membrane, followed by proteasome-mediated proteolysis, is also unlikely because simultaneous addition of protease and proteasome inhibitors did not protect CFTR from degradation.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Although our results do not rule out participation in CFTR degradation of protease classes for which cell-permeable inhibitors are not available (i.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	150	 aspartic proteases, aminopeptidases, and so forth) or of substrate-specific proteases (e.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	151	 colligin is a specific inhibitor of procollagen degradation (33)), these data establish that inhibition of proteolytic activities of the proteasome alone is sufficient to prevent the degradation of the majority of F508 molecules in living cells.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	152	In previous studies using metabolic pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation, proteasome inhibitors including MG132 and lactacystin had a very modest effect at inhibiting the decay of the electrophoretic species corresponding to core-glycosylated F508 degradation (9, 13).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	153	 In the present work, we show that at least part of radiolabel lost from core-glycosylated GFP-F508 could be recovered as high molecular weight material.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Because this HMW material remains competent for degradation, our data suggest that in the absence of proteasome function, a significant fraction of radiolabeled GFP-F508 molecules are converted to multiubiquitylated forms.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Accumulation of HMW forms in the presence of proteasome inhibition is not observed for most other ERAD substrates such as the -subunit of the T-cell receptor (7, 34) and soluble proteins such as IgG light chains (8), which tend to accumulate as core-glycosylated detergent-soluble monomers in the ER after proteasome inhibition.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	156	 It is likely that this difference is a consequence of the topology of CFTR, in which most of the mass of the protein is accessible to the cytoplasmic face of the ER and hence to components of the ubiquitin conjugation system.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	157	 A recent study reported that inhibition of proteasome function leads to accumulation of a substantial fraction of CFTR in reconstituted cell-free extracts as high molecular weight multiubiquitylated protein (17).

0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	1	Department of Physiology and Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	2	RAPID CHANGES IN salt and water movement occur in many epithelial tissues that respond quickly to alterations in overall salt and water balance.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	3	 For example, the amount of Cl secreted by the shark rectal gland can vary greatly in response to changes in the external environment (4).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	4	 To rapidly change the rate of transport, epithelial cells regulate the transport rates of specific ion channels, pumps, and carriers.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	5	 This regulation commonly occurs by either affecting the activity of an individual transport process and/or the number of transport entities in the plasma membrane.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The activity of many ion channels is regulated by voltage, by extracellular ligands, or by intracellular signal transduction mechanisms (6).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Thus many ion channels can be easily switched on and off to match the needs of a rapidly changing physiological process.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	8	 CFTR is an excellent example of a highly regulated Cl channel (2).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The activity of CFTR is controlled by the coordination of two processes, phosphorylation of several sites primarily within the regulatory domain followed by ATP binding and hydrolysis by the nucleotide binding domains.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These two processes act together to both switch on and regulate channel opening (3).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	11	In contrast, in some clear-cut cases, once inserted into the plasma membrane the activity of a variety of transporters is difficult to regulate.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In those cases, the most effective way to modulate transepithelial transport is to alter the number of transporters in the plasma membrane.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	13	 For example, it is well known that mature aquaporin water channels move water in an unregulated fashion (1).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	14	 To modulate overall transepithelial water transport such as in the renal collecting duct, vesicles containing aquaporin 2 water channels are rapidly inserted into the plasma membrane following activation by antidiuretic hormone (8).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The specific question addressed by this article in focus is whether exocytosis is involved in the activation of Cl secretion via CFTR in the human airway serous cell line, Calu-3.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Serous cells are located primarily in the submucosal glands of human airway and are known to express CFTR.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	17	The overall question of how much of the function of CFTR is dependent on its insertion into the plasma membrane can be answered by the phrase "it depends.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	18	" CFTR is expressed in a variety of tissues, including airway, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, heart, and kidney, where it participates in ion transport (5).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Thus how much of CFTR-mediated transport is controlled by exocytosis may depend critically on which organ is being considered.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Moreover, when cultured cells are being studied, it may also depend on the degree of differentiation of the cells.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	21	For example, in the current article in focus (Ref.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	22	 C913 in this issue), Loffing and colleagues demonstrate that exocytosis of CFTR-containing vesicles is not involved in the activation of Cl secretion in Calu-3 cells.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Similarly, exocytic delivery of CFTR does not occur in gallbladder epithelium (14).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Presumably in these tissues, activation of resident CFTR is sufficient to regulate transport.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In other tissues such as the shark rectal gland, bronchial epithelial cells, and in transporting cell lines such as Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II and A6, cAMP increases the amount of CFTR in the apical cell membrane (7, 9, 11, 13).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In T84 cells (a colonic epithelial cell line), the results are conflicting, suggesting either that culture conditions may affect the machinery for cAMP-dependent exocytosis of CFTR (12, 15) or that methodological difficulties in localizing CFTR in the plasma membrane make it difficult to detect exocytosis of CFTR.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Thus the question of how much of a role exocytosis plays in regulating the transport of CFTR in T84 cells is still unresolved.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	28	Loffing and colleagues (10) speculate that serous cells in the airway have high basal rates of Cl and antibiotic secretion.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	29	 This may require that high levels of CFTR be present at all times to support such a high level of transport.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Given that CFTR is highly regulated both by phosphorylation and ATP binding and hydrolysis, then why do some tissues need to control its function further by rapidly moving CFTR to the plasma membrane via exocytosis? One may speculate that stimulation of transport via CFTR, by increasing the number of channels though exocytosis, may occur only in tissues such as the shark rectal gland, where very large and rapid changes in transport occur.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Moreover, when confluent LLC-PK1 cells expressing F508 CFTR were treated with DMSO and mounted in an Ussing chamber, a further increase in cAMP-activated short-circuit current (i.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Butyrate, an epithelial differentiating agent, has been shown to augment F508 maturation in nonpolarized cells grown on plastic (3).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Another report suggested the possibility that butyrate increases ion transport in CF nasal epithelia, although augmentation of F508 maturation was not directly shown (36).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Improvements in F508 CFTR due to butyrate have not been attributed to differentiating effects per se but to increased CFTR mRNA and protein levels.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The F508 folding defect is also temperature sensitive and influenced by high concentrations of glycerol (7, 37).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	18	 CFTR normally functions as a Cl channel in the context of polarized epithelial monolayers.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, interventions that activate maturation and Cl secretion through F508 CFTR in physiologically important systems such as polarized epithelial cell monolayers have been difficult to establish.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	20	An effort in many laboratories has been directed toward development of channel openers for the F508 CFTR.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This strategy depends on at least some (e.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	94	 We found that treatment for 4 days with 2% DMSO led to maximal effects on F508 maturation and transepithelial Cl transport in these cells.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	95	 This 2% DMSO schedule had no visible effect on cell viability, and, in a quantitative assay of cell growth (CellTiter 96, Promega), the well-known differentiating effects of DMSO (which slow cell proliferation) decreased cell proliferation in the LLC-PK1 cells by only ~15%.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	96	 We therefore settled on this schedule for future studies.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Incomplete processing of CFTR can be identified by the absence of a mature, fully glycosylated (band C) form of the protein (4).

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	101	, band B) represent the high-mannose, endoglycosidase H-sensitive forms of the protein that are established cotranslationally in the ER.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The maturation of CFTR from core to complex glycosylation reflects the transition of the protein from the ER to the Golgi, where attachment of carbohydrates and trimming are accomplished as CFTR proceeds to the trans-Golgi network.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Immunoprecipitation of CFTR after a 4-day pretreatment with DMSO is shown in Fig.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The result shows the appearance of mature, fully glycosylated CFTR after DMSO treatment in F508 cells.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	105	 This result supports the notion that F508 maturation is augmented by DMSO.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Figure 1 also indicates a small increase in total CFTR protein in LLC-PK1 cells after DMSO treatment.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	107	 To determine whether this increase was due to effects on steady-state levels of mRNA, we performed a semiquantitative RT-PCR from total cellular mRNA.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	108	 DMSO did not appear to cause increases in CFTR mRNA levels as judged by this RT-PCR assay (Fig.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Unlike previous reports concerning butyrate treatment (3), the experiment suggests that increased F508 CFTR mRNA does not account for the modest increase in total F508 protein after DMSO treatment or the increase in band C.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	110	 These results also suggest that DMSO promotes F508 maturation through a mechanism that is different from that observed with butyrate.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	173	 LLC-PK1 cells exhibit a more differentiated phenotype under these conditions, as indicated by tight junction formation, epithelial resistance measurements, and the capability to perform vectoral ion transport (11, 30, 38, 39).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Under these conditions, F508 LLC-PK1 cells had low, but detectable, Cl transport that was absent in parental (non-CFTR expressing) cells (P  <  0.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	176	 A 3-day DMSO treatment of F508 CFTR-expressing cells led to forskolin-activated currents in the direction of Cl secretion that were greatly increased compared with untreated F508 LLC-PK1 cells (P  <  0.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Transport was absent in parental LLC-PK1 cells with or without DMSO treatment, indicating specificity for F508 CFTR expression.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Studies of wild-type CFTR-expressing cells are shown for comparison.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	198	 We performed the same sorts of experiments shown above on F508 LLC-PK1 cells following incubation with 10% glycerol (for 48 h), 5 mM butyrate (for 24 h; longer incubations led to substantial toxicity), or growth at 27 degrees C (for 48 h).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Each of these interventions has been shown to augment F508 processing in certain cell types grown on plastic (3, 7, 37).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	200	 We saw no evidence with any of these approaches of either Isc activation or band C CFTR.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	201	 These results are significant because they suggest that DMSO acts to potentiate F508 CFTR maturation through a mechanism that 1) is different from that observed with glycerol or butyrate, 2) is more potent than can be obtained with glycerol or butyrate, at least in the LLC-PK1 model, and 3) allows insertion of the F508 CFTR in the plasma membrane of a transporting cellular monolayer in vitro.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	203	 To determine whether DMSO altered the phenotype of LLC-PK1 cells, we probed cells grown on plastic with an antibody to ZO-1, a constituent of epithelial tight junctions (15, 41).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Organization and assembly of tight junctions is an additional, useful measurement of polarity and differentiation in epithelial cell monolayers.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Well-organized tight junctions occurring in an ordered distribution indicate a higher level of polarity and differentiation, whereas tight junction antigens that are absent, poorly developed, or distributed throughout the cytoplasm or plasma membrane may be indicative of a less differentiated phenotype.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	213	 The maturation of F508 CFTR can be augmented further by treatment with nontoxic concentrations of a differentiation agent known to increase epithelial cell polarity, DMSO (14, 23, 31, 40).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The in vitro model described here for cell monolayers (as opposed to previous studies of nonpolarized cells grown on plastic) might be useful in the development of procedures to augment F508 CFTR maturation or to study openers of F508 CFTR Cl channels present in the plasma membrane.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	215	We tested the possibility that DMSO, like butyrate, increases F508 CFTR mRNA levels (Fig.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	216	 We saw no evidence of increased CFTR mRNA in either wild-type or F508 LLC-PK1 cells under the same DMSO treatment conditions that partially corrected F508 protein processing.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Moreover, butyrate treatment of F508 cells at 5 mM caused no improvement in Cl transport in an Ussing chamber protocol.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	218	 These results suggest that DMSO augments the maturation of F508 CFTR by a mechanism that is different from the known effects of butyrate.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	219	 DMSO has also recently been suggested to act as a "chemical chaperone" and to correct the folding and biogenesis of the pathogenic prion protein in vitro (W.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Welch, personal communication).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Although it is possible that DMSO has effects on CFTR folding, there is no direct evidence in our experiments that DMSO can reach cytoplasmic levels that alter the kinetics, efficiency, or other aspects of CFTR folding in living cells to augment F508 CFTR processing.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Therefore, although an effect on CFTR folding remains an important consideration in our experiments, further studies will be necessary to test a direct role for DMSO as a chemical chaperone for CFTR.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	223	In our experiments, interventions that increase epithelial cell polarity and differentiation also conferred increases in F508 CFTR maturation.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Growth of epithelial cells on permeable supports is a well-established method of augmenting epithelial cell differentiation and has been described previously as leading to dome formation and a more differentiated phenotype in many cell types (13, 18, 25).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	225	 LLC-PK1 cells have previously been reported to switch from an undifferentiated to a more differentiated phenotype when grown on filters (48).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	226	 This method was therefore selected as one way to increase cell polarity in our experiments.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	227	 We showed that growth on permeable supports also led to functionally detectable F508 CFTR in the plasma membrane by Isc measurements (Fig.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	228	 DMSO treatment is another well-described method for augmenting cell differentiation in epithelial cells derived from different tissues (14, 23, 31, 40).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Accordingly, we tested the influence of DMSO on F508 CFTR maturational processing.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	230	 DMSO treatment caused increased resistance in LLC-PK1 monolayers (presumably on the basis of greater organization of tight junctions), and the same treatment led to further increases in F508 CFTR activity at the cell surface (Figs.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Moreover, we observed that organization of tight junctions in LLC-PK1 cells increased under the same conditions that led to F508 maturation (Figs.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Finally, vectoral chloride transport (Fig.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	233	 5) should only be detectable in a polarized epithelial monolayer and was observed in our studies of anion transport.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Together, these experiments indicate that a more differentiated phenotype also confers an increase in F508 CFTR maturation.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The effect of DMSO on F508 CFTR processing was also observed in primary human nasal polyp cells but not in nonepithelial cells (mouse fibroblast, L cells; Fig.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Experiments in these other cell types suggest the usefulness of the approach for activating F508 processing in human epithelial cells.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	237	Transmembrane proteins are often distributed throughout the plasma membrane when cells are undifferentiated.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	238	 With the onset of differentiation and the development of adherens junctions, tight junctions, and cell matrix interactions, structural polarity is established.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	239	 The process by which proteins target to the apical membrane appears to occur by a default mechanism (10).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Our results may indicate that cellular polarity helps establish part of this default pathway.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	241	 The possibility that F508 CFTR enters the apical targeting pathway specifically after an increase in cellular differentiation is suggested by results in Figs.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Other contributors to F508 maturation, including stabilization of the folded structure of F508 protein, a change in F508 CFTR interactions with cellular chaperones, or a decrease in the rate of degradation of F508 CFTR in the ER (so as to allow more time to reach the Golgi), are among the alternative explanations for the findings shown here.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	243	In summary, the ER in epithelial cells is a hostile environment, insofar as the CFTR is concerned.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Wild-type and F508 molecules, even when folded into functional Cl channels, are polyubiquitinated and degraded in short order (half time of ~30 min) by the proteasome and possibly other proteolytic pathways (20, 44).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	245	 CFTR that escapes the ER and enters the Golgi may reach a "safe haven," where half time increases to  > 12 h for the post-ER form.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Our data suggest, after DMSO treatment in LLC-PK1 cells, an increased amount of the post-ER complex-glycosylated and membrane-localized F508 CFTR is observed.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Because neither block of ubiquitination nor proteasome inhibition has been reported to enhance F508 maturation, it is less likely that the effects observed here are caused by blockade of the proteasome or of ubiquitination.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Our results raise the possibility that induction of polarity in LLC-PK1 cells might increase a transition of F508 CFTR from the ER to the trans-Golgi network (Figs.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	249	 If the F508 CFTR quality control mechanism becomes "leaky" in differentiated cells compared with the undifferentiated state, the findings could have important implications concerning the in vivo processing of F508 CFTR, which occurs in well-organized cells within tissues characterized by tight junctions and polarity.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Further experiments are needed to test this possibility, as well as to test the effects of DMSO treatment in F508 CF mice.

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	3	The in vivo transcription start sites of the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) and its murine homologue (Cftr) have been mapped in a range of tissues using the technique of 5[prime] rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5[prime] RACE).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	4	 These are the first in vivo transcription start sites for CFTR or Cftr to be reported.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Distinct, tissue-specific patterns of CFTR start site usage were identified in both mouse and human.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In particular, striking variation in the position of the murine Cftr transcription start site was seen along the length of the intestinal tract; different start sites being utilized in ileum and in duodenum.

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In addition, a novel 5[prime]-untranslated exon of murine Cftr, denoted exon -1, was identified and shown to be expressed exclusively in mouse testis.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Expression of exon -1-containing Cftr transcripts was shown by mRNA in situ hybridization to be confined to the germ cells and to be regulated during spermatogenesis.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	10	Cystic fibrosis is a common, autosomal recessive disease characterized by intestinal blockages, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, male infertility and progressive, degenerative lung disease (1).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These diverse symptoms result from mutation of a single gene, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or CFTR (2,3), the product of which functions as a cAMP-regulated, low conductance chloride channel (4).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	12	CFTR exhibits complex patterns of tissue-specific expression being expressed at low levels in specialized epithelial cells of the intestinal crypts, airway submucosal glands, pancreatic ducts, sweat gland ducts and the male reproductive tract (5-8).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In addition, the observed patterns of expression indicate that CFTR expression is regulated by hormones (9) and during development and differentiation (8,10,11).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Although the patterns of regulated CFTR gene expression are well known, surprisingly little is known of the genetic elements and transcription factors that regulate the tissue-specific expression of CFTR.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Both the mouse and human CFTR genes have promoters which resemble those of `housekeeping' genes (12-14), an observation that is inconsistent with the tissue and cell type specificity of CFTR expression.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	16	Knowledge of the position of the CFTR transcription start site utilized in CFTR-expressing cells in vivo is a prerequisite to understanding the regulation of the CFTR promoter.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	17	 CFTR transcription start sites previously have only been mapped in a number of immortalized cell lines (12,13,15), and it cannot be concluded that identical sites are used in vivo.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In the present study, we used a 5[prime] rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5[prime] RACE) approach to map accurately transcription start sites of human CFTR, and its murine homologue Cftr, in a range of primary tissues.

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	45	 However, we can conclude that the most abundant products correspond to the major transcription start sites for Cftr and that, collectively, the minor 5[prime] RACE products constitute at most 10% of Cftr transcripts in any tissue.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Importantly, the two major start sites mapped in the ileum (-72 and -75) are used with approximately equal frequency while the two start sites mapped in the duodenum (-60 and -19) are used in an ~4:1 ratio, respectively.

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Because of limited availability of human tissues, it has not been possible to determine whether these two alternative start sites represent variation in start site usage along the length of the human intestinal tract, as is the case with murine Cftr, or whether these alternative start sites are used in different CFTR-expressing cell types all along the length of the intestine [e.

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The results of this in vivo transcription mapping study are broadly consistent with previously published data from immortalized cell lines in that the single transcription start sites utilized in adult lung (-69) and pancreas (-68) and one of the start sites identified in intestine (-69) are close to the major CFTR start site(s) mapped in the colonic epithelial adenocarcinoma cell lines T84, HT-29 and Caco-2 (12,13,15).

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	71	The observation that distinct CFTR transcription start sites are utilized in adult (-69) and foetal lungs (-132) is intriguing given the previously reported developmental regulation of CFTR expression in the lung (10,11,18).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	72	 CFTR mRNA levels are substantially higher in foetal lungs than in adult lungs, with CFTR expression declining dramatically after birth, although the precise age at which this down-regulation occurs is not known.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	73	 It is possible that a switch in transcription initiation from the -132 site to the -69 site correlates with a particular stage in lung development.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	74	 A correlation between the pattern of CFTR transcription start site usage and the level of CFTR mRNA expression previously has been reported in CFTR-expressing cell lines, suggesting that a mechanism of CFTR regulation operates at the level of start site selection (15).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	75	 These data suggest that a similar mechanism might operate during human lung development.

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Cftr is expressed first in pachytene spermatocytes, with expression being maintained as these cells undergo meiotic division, to produce round spermatids, and then declining as the round spermatids elongate (22).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	96	 In order to determine whether Cftr exon -1 shows the same cell type-specific pattern of expression, we examined the in vivo expression of Cftr exon -1 in mouse testis by mRNA in situ hybridization.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	97	 A series of consecutive sections of adult mouse testis were hybridized with probes specific for exon -1 (Fig.

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Identical patterns of cell type-specific expression were observed with both probes, demonstrating that expression of the exon -1-containing Cftr transcript is regulated during stages of spermatogenesis, in agreement with our previous observations of Cftr expression in mouse testis (22).

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	105	CFTR expression in human testis has been reported to be extremely low and not associated with any particular cell type or with any particular stage of spermatogenesis-strikingly different from the rodent expression pattern (23).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Nevertheless, the existence of a human equivalent of the testis-specific murine Cftr exon -1 was investigated by performing 5[prime] RACE PCR in order to identify the CFTR transcription start site utilized in adult human testis.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The 5[prime] RACE procedure was repeated a total of three times, but no CFTR-specific product bands could be amplified.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	108	 As a positive control, CFTR expression in human testis was confirmed by RT-PCR using an internal CFTR primer set (not shown).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	109	 It was concluded, therefore, that the level of CFTR expression in human testis is extremely low but detectable by RT-PCR, but that this low level expression is below the limit of detection by 5[prime] RACE due to the latter method's inherently lower sensitivity.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Thus, the position of the CFTR start site utilized in adult human testis remains unknown, and no conclusions can be drawn regarding the expression of a human equivalent of murine Cftr exon -1 in human testis.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	111	In this study, we have mapped the in vivo transcription start sites for human CFTR and its murine homologue Cftr.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Using a sensitive 5[prime] RACE technique, we were able to map CFTR start sites in a number of different mouse and human tissues.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	113	 These are the first in vivo CFTR transcription start sites to be mapped for any species.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	114	In the case of murine Cftr, the use of distinct, tissue-specific transcription start sites leads to the production of Cftr transcripts which differ in the length of their 5[prime]-untranslated regions (5[prime] UTRs).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The observation that distinct transcription start sites are used in different tissues suggests that the tissue-specific regulation of Cftr expression may, in part, operate at the level of transcription start site selection.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Analysis of the primary sequence of the 5[prime]-flanking region of murine Cftr provides some clues as to how tissue-specific start site selection might be achieved.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	117	 No sequence likely to correspond to a TATA box element could be found upstream of any of the in vivo transcription start sites identified for murine Cftr (Fig.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	118	 However, Table 4 illustrates that sequences surrounding three of the Cftr transcription start sites, the -82 site utilized in lung and the -60 and -19 sites utilized in duodenum, are similar to the consensus sequence for the mammalian initiator (Inr) element, PyPyA(+1)N(T/A)PyPy, that has been suggested to maintain the fidelity of transcription initiation in promoters devoid of TATA boxes (24).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	119	 It is likely, therefore, that an Inr-dependent mechanism is responsible for directing the formation of a transcription pre-initiation complex in these tissues.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Sequence context of murine Cftr transcription start sites.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	121	 In each case, the transcription start site (+1) is underlined Position of start site Sequence context Inr consensus PyPyA(+1)N(T/A)PyPy -549 AGAAGGA -82 GCATTGA -75 CCTGGTC -72 GGTCCTG -60 CCAGATG -19 TCATTGC.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	122	Tissue-specific variation in the position of the CFTR start site was also observed in human tissues.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Most notably, distinct start sites appear to be used in adult and in foetal lungs.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	124	 However, the exact position of the CFTR transcription start site relative to the translation initiation codon does not appear to be conserved between equivalent tissues of mice and humans, suggesting that the precise mechanisms responsible for correct start site selection are not conserved cross-species.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	125	 This is perhaps not surprising given the apparent lack of primary nucleic acid sequence homology between the mouse and human proximal promoter regions (19,25).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	126	The identification of a testis-specific, untranslated exon of murine Cftr (exon -1) implies that Cftr expression in this tissue is under the control of a testis-specific alternative promoter.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Murine Cftr falls into a group of genes demonstrating cell type-specific expression in the testis, with expression being regulated during spermatogenesis (22).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Other genes in this group include many whose protein products are thought to play a particular role in the complex process of spermatogenesis (reviewed in 26), and a potential role for the Cftr chloride channel during spermatogenesis has been suggested (22).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Genes such as Cftr that are expressed both post-meiotically in the testis and in other tissues often produce testis-specific transcripts, generated by the use of testis-specific promoters, altered polyadenylation and/or tissue-specific alternative exon splicing (26).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	130	 We have shown that the testis-specific Cftr transcript is generated through the use of an alternative promoter and alternative splicing in the 5[prime] UTR, to include exon -1 at the extreme 5[prime] end of the transcript.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The vast majority (95%) of Cftr transcripts in mouse testis contain this additional untranslated exon, implying an important role for exon -1 with regard to either the function of Cftr in testis or the regulation of Cftr expression in this tissue.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The latter alternative would appear to be more plausible as a number of genes expressed post-meiotically in rodent testis exhibit negative translational regulation mediated by the binding of regulatory proteins to specific 5[prime] UTR sequences (reviewed in 27).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	133	 One of the families of germ cell-specific proteins proposed to mediate translational regulation in the testis are the Y-box proteins (28).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Y-box proteins may function both as DNA-binding transcription factors, which bind to specific, cis-acting Y-box promoter elements, and as RNA-binding proteins, which mediate translational regulation via mRNA masking in vertebrate gametes (29).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	135	 In this context, it is interesting to note that a Y-box consensus sequence, previously suggested to act as a positive regulator of transcription in the murine Cftr promoter (14), is contained within exon -1 and thus will be present exclusively in the 5[prime] UTR of testis-specific Cftr transcripts.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	136	Another feature of the murine Cftr 5[prime]-flanking region suggests that translational regulation may be a more general mechanism controlling Cftr expression.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	137	 An additional AUG codon is present at position -58, upstream of the Cftr ORF (Fig.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	138	 This upstream AUG precedes a short upstream ORF (uORF) that, if recognized by the translation machinery, would produce a small peptide of five amino acids in length.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	139	 This uORF will be present in the 5[prime] UTR of Cftr transcripts initiating upstream of position -58, including the major Cftr transcripts expressed in lung, foetal lung, ileum, kidney, uterus and testis.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The upstream AUG occurs in a weak Kozak context, with neither the critical purine at position -3 nor the G at position +4 being present (30), whereas the AUG of the Cftr ORF occurs in a much stronger Kozak context (31).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The scanning model predicts that translation will usually initiate at the first AUG in a favourable Kozak context (30).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Nevertheless, interaction between the translation machinery and the upstream AUG may have the effect of reducing the translation efficiency of the Cftr ORF.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The presence of the short uORF would therefore be predicted to reduce the translation efficiency of the major Cftr transcripts expressed in lungs, ileum and testis but not those expressed in duodenum, as the uORF is absent from the 5[prime] UTR of the duodenum transcript initiating at position -19 and is too close to the m7G cap site to exert an effect in the transcript initiating at position -60 (31).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Thus, by the use of distinct transcription start sites, the expression of Cftr might also be modulated at the translational level.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	145	The identification of the major Cftr transcription start sites utilized in vivo is an essential prerequisite to understanding the function of the Cftr promoter.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	146	 It will now be possible to define the promoter elements, transcription factors and mechanisms directing the complex patterns of in vivo Cftr expression.

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Two probes were used to detect different regions of a single Cftr mRNA: the first, CFTR 10-12, corresponded to an internal region of Cftr spanning exons 10-12 [base pairs 1580-1865 of the Cftr cDNA (19)] in the vector Bluescript KS (Stratagene); the second, CFTR -1, contained 150 bp of mouse Cftr exon -1 and 50 bp of RACE anchor primer sequence, amplified from the mouse testis major 5[prime] RACE product by PCR using anchor primer (Gibco-BRL) and the primer MC -1R (5[prime]-ACCGTGGCCAATCTGCGGGACTTAGAACCC), and cloned into Bluescript SK (Stratagene).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	163	 The Bluescript vectors contain opposing T3 and T7 promoters to allow the synthesis of both 32P-labelled antisense RNA probes and control unlabelled sense strand RNAs by in vitro transcription.

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Following RNase digestion and precipitation, protected products were resolved on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by exposure to Kodak X-omat AR film.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	167	In situ hybridization was performed essentially as described previously (17).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Probes specific for two regions of mouse Cftr were used for in situ localization of Cftr mRNA: the first, CFTR 10-13, corresponded to a fragment of Cftr exons 10-13 [bases 1580-2108 of the Cftr cDNA (19)] in the vector Bluescript KS; the second, CFTR -1 was the same as that used for RNase protection (above).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Both probes were cloned in Bluescript vectors containing opposing T3 and T7 promoters for the generation of [35S]UTP-labelled sense and antisense strand RNA probes by in vitro transcription.

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	3	Expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and of at least one other member of the ATP-binding cassette family of transport proteins, P-glycoprotein, is associated with the electrodiffusional movement of the nucleotide ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Evidence directly implicating CFTR expression with ATP channel activity, however, is still missing.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Here it is reported that reconstitution into a lipid bilayer of highly purified CFTR of human epithelial origin enables the permeation of both Cl and ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Similar to previously reported data for in vivo ATP currents of CFTR-expressing cells, the reconstituted channels displayed competition between Cl and ATP and had multiple conductance states in the presence of Cl and ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Purified CFTR-mediated ATP currents were activated by protein kinase A and ATP (1 mM) from the "intracellular" side of the molecule and were inhibited by diphenylamine-2-carboxylate, glibenclamide, and anti-CFTR antibodies.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The absence of CFTR-mediated electrodiffusional ATP movement may thus be a relevant component of the pleiotropic cystic fibrosis phenotype.

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	10	THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) supports ATP-dependent Cl channel activity (3, 14).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	11	 However, controversy still exists as to whether this functional feature of CFTR is sufficient to explain the complete pathophysiology of this disease (7).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The cellular epithelial cystic fibrosis (CF) phenotype, for example, is associated both with a dysfunctional phospholipase A2 activity and a deranged arachidonic acid metabolism (10, 24) and with an abnormally increased apical epithelial Na+ permeability (6), which is regulated by CFTR (26).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Expression of CFTR is also associated with the recovery of outwardly rectifying Cl channel activity of CF cells (12) by an autocoid mechanism entailing the release of cellular ATP, which, in turn, helps modulate other cell responses (23).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These disparate observations are unlikely to stem from an altered Cl conductance.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Alternate paradigms to explain the various features of the CF phenotype are currently being sought.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	16	CFTR has been implicated in the release of cellular ATP (18, 23) and electrodiffusional ATP movement (17, 22, 23); however, other studies have failed to detect electrodiffusional ATP movement in preparations containing a functional CFTR (13, 21).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In this report, we have revisited the question of whether CFTR is capable of permeating ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Highly purified and functional human epithelial recombinant CFTR (14) was reconstituted into a lipid bilayer in which addition of protein kinase A (PKA) and ATP elicited diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC)-inhibitable Cl- and ATP-permeable ion channel activity, in agreement with our previous findings in intact cells (9, 22, 23).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The present data indicate that ATP transfer by CFTR may not require an "adjacent" transmembrane structure to allow permeation of the nucleotide.

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	212	 These findings indicate that, although CFTR is capable of Cl permeation, its ability to preferentially move Cl or ATP may depend not only on the driving force for the intracellular nucleotide ATP but also on the ATP species, the PATP/PCl, and the intracellular Cl concentration.

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	237	The expression of CFTR has been recently associated with the otherwise unapparent permeation of ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	238	 This phenomenon has been observed by the cAMP-induced release of ATP from CFTR-expressing cells under physiological conditions (18), as well as by electrophysiological studies under highly nonphysiological conditions (22), which determined, nevertheless, the channellike nature of the PKA-induced ATP movement at the single-molecule level (17, 22, 23).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	239	 This is in agreement with our observation that cAMP activation is associated with extrusion of ATP in wild-type (18) but not in 508 CFTR-expressing cells (8).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	240	 The molecular steps associated with ATP movement in CFTR-expressing cells, however, have not been unequivocally determined.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Although the simplest possible explanation for these findings is to implicate CFTR itself as the channel responsible for the ATP-permeable pathway, direct evidence to support this claim is still lacking.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	242	ATP-permeable channels in CFTR-expressing cells may be a reflection of endogenous functional channel proteins that are regulated by, but are distinct from, CFTR.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	243	 For example, expression of both mammalian (1) and Drosophila melanogaster (5) P-glycoproteins, CFTR congeners of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transport proteins, has been associated with the expression of ATP channel activity, thus raising the possibility that transport proteins other than CFTR are present in certain preparations.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	244	 At least one recent report demonstrated an osmotically stimulated electrodiffusional ATP movement in human hepatoma cells seemingly devoid of CFTR (28).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	245	 A direct role of CFTR in ATP movement has also been questioned by recent reports that failed to detect ATP-permeable channel activity in cells or preparations containing CFTR (13, 21).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	246	 However, these studies also failed to detect "any" other ATP channel activity, which is inconsistent with the ATP release associated with CFTR expression (18, 23).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	247	 This raises the possibility that the presence of putative ATP-permeable pathways in CFTR-expressing preparations may largely depend on the cellular (tissue) model under study and/or the nature of the ATP complexes driven.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Alternate possibilities, however, may also entail more critical experimental conditions for determining ATP movement than previously expected.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	249	 A previous study that failed to detect ATP release from CFTR-expressing cells (27), for example, may have simply failed to meet the technological parameters suitable for detecting the expected amounts of ATP released to the extracellular milieu (18).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Furthermore, the possibility that under certain conditions, electroneutral ATP complexes are driven through channel structures cannot yet be ruled out.

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	254	 5D), a condition similar to previously reported values for CFTR-associated Cl movement (13).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	255	 This finding further suggests that both Cl and ATP may compete with each other for the conductance pore of the channel, as was originally reported in intact cells (22).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	256	Reconstituted CFTR ATP channel activity was readily inhibited by the anti R-domain CFTR antibody MAb 13-1 (Genzyme), in agreement with previous reports in intact cells (19).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	257	 The possibility that a functional CFTR is required to regulate ATP channels other than CFTR, however, cannot be easily ruled out, since, as indicated above, recent studies failed to detect any ATP-permeable channel activity in preparations containing CFTR (13, 21).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	258	 At least one such study was conducted with a purified CFTR preparation similar to the one presented in this report (13).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Thus a likely possibility is that activated CFTR, which is indeed permeable to Cl, may behave as an ATP-selective ion channel only under certain circumstances (see below).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	260	 It should also be noted that these reports did not exactly mimic our present or previous studies.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	261	 We have found that PKA activation of CFTR, for example, was readily observed (15 of 18 experiments) in experiments tested with daily fresh batches of PKA.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	262	 However, under certain experimental conditions, namely the use of "older" PKA (prepared  > 24 h before the experiments), CFTR activation under Cl-free conditions also required the presence of sustained holding potentials (between +100 and +150 mV; 41 of 82 experiments).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	263	 This finding may actually explain previous failed attempts to obtain single ATP channel currents from reconstituted CFTR in which PKA was absent (21) and further suggests the possibility that adjacent structures other than CFTR may also be required for proper channel activation in vivo (19).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	264	Although the reason for the required voltage activation of CFTR in the presence of PKA is as yet unknown, it is not unprecedented for ATP transport by other ABC transporters.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Concerning the electrodiffusional ATP movement by the murine mdr1 gene product, P-glycoprotein (1), for example, it was observed that a double mutation of this channel protein in either nucleotide-binding domain rendered the mutated P-glycoprotein completely unable to spontaneously release cellular ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	266	 However, voltage activation reestablished ATP transport and, interestingly, Cl channel activity associated with this protein as well (1).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Similar findings have also been recently observed with the D.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	268	 melanogaster mdr gene products Mdr65 and Mdr49 P-glycoprotein homologues, which were also voltage activated (5).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Although it is unlikely that this activation process has any physiological significance, it raises the interesting possibility that other relevant intracellular factors that are absent in the purified CFTR preparation may be required for a proper PKA activation of CFTR.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Under no circumstances, however, did voltage stimulation induce any ATP-permeable channel activity in the absence of PKA.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	271	The present data also dispel a common misconception about the size of ATP as it is transported through this channel molecule.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	272	 In solution, ATP takes various conformations by interacting with counterions other than Mg2+ (11).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	273	 However, only one conformation has been observed for the MgATP2 complex, the relevant moiety associated with molecules that bind and/or hydrolyze ATP (4, 11).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	274	 The average planar diameter of the MgATP complex under these conditions is  < 5 A (see Fig.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	275	 6), at least similar to, if not smaller than, the expected diameter of I, a CFTR-permeable anion (for details, see Fig.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Thus ATP "size" is not a constraint to movement through CFTR, provided that it is either free or complexed to Mg2+.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Counterion-ATP complexes of larger sizes, however, may reflect different interactions with CFTR.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	278	 A recent paper (13), reporting that purified CFTR was tested and failed to detect ATP transport, suggested that the K2ATP salt used in that study actually blocked Cl movement through CFTR.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Because K+ is almost nine times larger than Mg2+, the larger K2ATP moiety is likely to be a blocking agent of CFTR channel activity.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	280	 This is in agreement with an expected, undetectable, 0.

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Molecule (of either model) is largely oblong.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Shorter diameter is drawn from steric distance between N1 and N3 of pyridine ring (2.

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Thus phosphates "encircle" adenine moiety (using ribose as the hinge), such that their position is coordinated not only by nucleoside but also by their surrounding oxygens.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	295	 In comparison, N1-N3 distance in MgATP2 was found to be identical to that of free ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	296	 However, arrangement of phosphates surrounding adenine moiety was completely different, as distance between C4 and O25, which is 0.

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	298	18 A (C2-P18) in MgATP2, thus suggesting that, although both models have similar diameters, MgATP seems to be "longer" than free ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Both structures were "minimized" for structural errors but not by their minimal energy conformations.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Furthermore, it is also important to realize that ether bonds for either model were computed as 1.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	301	0, despite the fact that bond orders for high-energy phosphates are significantly shorter (on the order of 0.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	302	41), thus suggesting much smaller 3-dimensional structures (20).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Model of free ATP, however, is almost identical (although without structural minimization) to that of Stryer's Biochemistry (Ref.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	304	 329), although other possible conformations for MgATP2 (Ref.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	305	 352) were not explored in above molecules.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	306	Reconstituted CFTR mediated the electrodiffusional movement of both Cl and ATP and displayed several conductance states, which may be related to "clustering" of CFTR in complexes that have the same perm-selectivity properties.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Each ion seems to modify the permeability properties of the other, which may be due to either competition for one another at the conductance pore of the channel or the possibility that both ions have distinct, but mutually interactive, permeable pathways.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	308	 This is a phenomenon that will require further investigation.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Interestingly, however, both the cis concentration of Cl and the trans concentration of ATP modified the single-channel conductance of CFTR.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	310	In conclusion, the present data are consistent with the most likely, but not exclusive, possibility that CFTR permeates ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	311	 This is in close agreement with previous reports indicating that wild-type CFTR (9, 17, 22, 23), but not 508 CFTR (8), may be involved in ATP movement in vivo.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	312	 "Contaminant" channels that are permeable to ATP but are distinct from CFTR cannot be ruled out, although the finding that preparations with different degrees of purification of CFTR, including the purified protein, show functional characteristics similar if not identical to those observed in vivo strongly suggest a direct role of this channel protein in ATP movement.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Additional studies, including mutational analysis of this channel protein, will be required, however, to further assess the relevance of the CFTR-mediated ATP transport in the context of Cl vs.

0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, February 11, 2004 , and in revised form, March 22, 2004.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	4	Interestingly, inefficient protein biogenesis appears to occur even for "wild type" proteins, with a number of examples that include the epithelial sodium channels (6), Shaker-type potassium channels (7), major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (8), the opioid receptor (9, 10), the erythropoietin receptor (11), the erythrocyte anion exchanger 1 (Band 3) (12), and CFTR (13).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Many of these proteins, including CFTR, are assembled in the cell membrane as part of a multiprotein complex (14, 15), suggesting that the molecular rationing of the components in these complexes might be regulated during biogenesis.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	6	CFTR is a large transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of two homologous halves, each containing six transmembrane segments (TMD1 and TMD2) and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1 and NBD2), that are connected by a regulatory domain (16).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The 1480-amino acid protein is a member of the traffic ATPase or ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter family (17) and functions as a cAMP-regulated Cl- channel (18, 19) that regulates other ion conductive pathways including epithelial Cl-, Na+, and ATP transport (20-22).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The most common mutation in CFTR, F508, results in the production of a protein that fails to exit the ER (13) and is rapidly degraded by ERAD (23-25).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Interestingly, even the wild type protein is substrate for ERAD, with as much as 75% being degraded by the proteasome during biogenesis (13, 24, 25).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Since only a small fraction of newly synthesized wild type CFTR reaches the cell surface where it performs its biological function, the question has often arisen as to why CFTR biogenesis so inefficient.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	11	 A study by Tector and Hartl (26) suggested the possibility that transmembrane segment 6 in TMD1 is unstable due to 3 charged residues within this domain.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Substitution of these residues with non-charged amino acids resulted in an increase in protein stability but a loss of chloride transport (26), suggesting that protein stability had been compromised for biological function.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This hypothesis has not been evaluated in cells endogenously expressing CFTR.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	14	It has been suggested that an appropriate cellular context may be necessary to support proper membrane protein trafficking (reviewed in Refs.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In addition, it is possible that altered protein trafficking may result from the use of overexpression systems or non-physiological experimental conditions (reviewed in Bertrand et al.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Given that the initial studies of CFTR biogenesis were performed primarily in transfected, heterologous overexpression systems, a careful analysis of endogenous CFTR biogenesis both in the early (ER) and post-Golgi pathways is warranted.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Heterologous systems may lack CFTR binding partners such as EBP50, syntaxin 1A, and CAL (15, 29-33), and association of these and other proteins with CFTR may be required for proper maturation and/or trafficking.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	18	In the present studies, we monitored the maturation efficiency of CFTR in two human epithelial cell lines that endogenously expresses CFTR, Calu-3 (34), and T84 cells (35).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Metabolic pulse-chase analysis of CFTR in these cells grown under both nonpolarizing and polarizing conditions indicated that core glycosylated (Band B) CFTR is very efficiently (100%) processed to a maturely glycosylated (Band C) protein that is extremely stable.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Moreover, quantitative cell surface biotinylation assays revealed that the CFTR surface pool is substantially elevated in Calu-3 cells compared with heterologous expression systems.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Thus, endogenous CFTR maturation differs fundamentally from the patterns reported in recombinant overexpression systems, and these differences extend across multiple cellular compartments.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Our findings cast doubt upon the viewpoint that wild type CFTR protein maturation is inefficient.

0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Calu-3 cells were grown on 12-mm filters and metabolically labeled, and CFTR maturation efficiency was monitored as described in the legend to Fig.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Conversion of the Band B to Band C was compared at each time points of the chase.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Results are plotted as percent of Band B at the 30 min (highest density) chase time.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	171	  The fact that CFTR surface expression is not elevated in polarized cells was somewhat surprising, given that in HT29 cells, a colonic epithelial cell line, CFTR surface expression requires polarization of the colonocytes (50).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	172	 To confirm that Calu-3 cells had formed polarized monolayers, we monitored the expression a ZO-1, a marker for tight junctions (red) (51), and CFTR (green) localization in the Calu-3 cells using immunocytochemistry (Fig.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	173	 5B indicate that the Calu-3 cells have formed tight monolayers as evidenced by ZO-1 staining (red) close to the apical surface and that CFTR (green) is found both at the cell surface and in intracellular sites.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Next, we tested whether the rate and efficiency of CFTR maturation was affected by cell polarity.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	175	 5C confirm that similar to conventional tissue culture conditions (Fig.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	176	 2, A and B), CFTR maturation is also efficient under polarizing conditions ( > 90%).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Interestingly, these experiments in Calu-3 monolayers suggested that the amount of radiolabeled CFTR dramatically decreased compared with non-polarized conditions and that rates of conversion of newly synthesized (Band B) CFTR to fully glycosylated (Band C) CFTR was slower than under standard conditions.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Only 30% of the newly synthesized (Band B) CFTR was converted into fully glycosylated (Band C) at 2 h, and maturation was completed only after 6 h of chase.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	179	CFTR Maturation Is Efficient in T84 Cells Grown under Standard Tissue Culture Conditions To determine whether efficient CFTR maturation is a special feature of Calu-3 cells or present in other endogenous CFTR expressing cell lines, we also tested T84 and HT29 colonic epithelial cell lines endogenously expressing wild type CFTR.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	180	 6A indicates that steady state CFTR protein levels are highest in Calu-3 cells.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	181	 In T84 and HT29 cells, CFTR levels are 3- and  > 10-fold lower than in Calu-3, respectively (Fig.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	182	 TaqMan RT-PCR measurements demonstrated that CFTR message levels in T84 cells are 4-fold and in HT29 are 10-fold lower than in Calu-3 cells grown under the same conditions (Fig.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Because of low transcription and consequent low translation of CFTR in HT29 cells, only T84 cells synthesized sufficient amounts of the protein to effectively follow maturation efficiency.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	184	 6C, although CFTR synthetic levels were quite low and maturation efficiency in the early chase periods was variable, by the end of the 4th h into the chase, the maturation of the newly synthesized protein was virtually 100% in T84 cells.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	185	 These results indicate that efficient processing of endogenous wild type CFTR is not a unique feature of Calu-3 cells but also exists in a colonic epithelial cell line.

0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	189	" CFTR maturation efficiency was monitored in T84 cells as described in the legend to Fig.

0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	192	Initial studies of CFTR biogenesis described complete and early degradation of the F508 CFTR and inefficient maturation of the wild type protein (13, 24, 52).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Most of these studies employed heterologous overexpression systems, with one exception (24).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Kopito and colleagues (24) compared wild type CFTR maturation efficiency in stable HEK cells to HT29 and T84 cells endogenously expressing wild type CFTR.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In these cells, CFTR expression levels were 10-50-fold lower than in HEK, but the maturation efficiency of CFTR was only 25% after 2 h of chase.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In our studies, CFTR maturation in Calu-3 and T84 cells reached the maximum (100%) only after 4 h.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Analysis of CFTR maturation efficiency in COS-7 and HeLa cells suggested that there was no significant increase in Band C levels between the 2- and 4-h chase periods, whereas in Calu-3 cells and T84 cells CFTR maturation was only completed by the end of the 4th h.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This slower CFTR processing noted in endogenously expressing cells was even more pronounced in Calu-3 cells grown as polarized monolayers.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	199	 As a comparison with other cell lines, we found that CFTR mRNA and protein levels were 4- and 10-fold higher in Calu-3 cells than in T84 and HT29 cells.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	200	 While we were not able to follow the maturation of the protein in HT29 cells, analysis in T84 revealed that CFTR maturation was very efficient and only complete by the end of a 4-h chase.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	201	A more rapid disappearance of Band B CFTR in T84 and HT29 than in HEK cells was also described and attributed only to degradation (24).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	202	 However, those experiments were completed before the role of the proteasome in early CFTR degradation was described or before protein overexpression was shown to overload the proteasome.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Subsequently, it has been demonstrated that either the inhibition of the proteasome (25, 48) or protein overproduction (53) could result in delayed degradation.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Therefore, it is now clear that disappearance of Band B could be due to both degradation and maturation.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	205	 In our studies, proteasome blockade revealed that in Calu-3 cells disappearance of band B was not due to proteasomal degradation, whereas in HeLa cells it partially was.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	206	The increased half-life of the mature CFTR in Calu-3 cells suggests that epithelial factors stabilize CFTR.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	207	 This finding is supported by studies showing that CFTR half-life in heterologous systems is 8-12 h (38, 52), whereas in LLC-PK1 (54) and in MDCK cells (55), two kidney epithelial cells stably expressing the wild type CFTR, the half-life is significantly longer when the cells are grown under polarized conditions.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Increased stability of the mature wild type CFTR in epithelial cells is also consistent with our previous findings that growing MDCK cells as polarized monolayers results in increased steady-state CFTR levels and function.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Furthermore, possible cell type-specific differences in wild type CFTR biogenesis and stability are suggested by our findings that cellular polarization in Calu-3 cells did not have a significant effect on total and cell surface CFTR levels in contrast to our previous findings in MDCK cells (56).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	210	Both morphological and cell surface biotinylation studies indicate the existence of a large intracellular CFTR pool in Calu-3 cells.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	211	 The dynamics and precise cellular localization of this pool remain unclear, but several studies (44, 57-61) have indicated that CFTR is found in endosomal and recycling endosomal compartments.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	212	 How regulation of surface localized CFTR is accomplished in polarized epithelia and whether there is a physiological role for the intracellular pool remain open questions.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	213	The factors that allow efficient CFTR maturation as well as those that are responsible for stabilizing the mature protein in Calu-3 and T84 cells have not been identified.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	214	 However, dramatic progress has been made recently in identifying tissue-specific factors that organize the delivery and function of transport proteins to their appropriate membrane domains (27, 62-64).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	215	 These results suggest that both the cellular context and molecular rationing of transport components are important not only for proper function but also for intracellular trafficking (27, 64).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Nevertheless, normal epithelial cell function depends on the accurate delivery of a large number of membrane components to a particular cell surface domain, and defects in this process often lead to disease (3, 4).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Therefore, it is crucial to understand how different cell types organize the biogenesis and intracellular processing of key molecules (27, 28).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Since CFTR plays a central role in the regulation of epithelial ion transport in multiple organ systems, understanding its biogenesis, cellular distribution, and stability in epithelia may be the first step toward identifying the molecular defects leading to early degradation of otherwise functional mutants, such as F508 CFTR.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	219	The importance of elucidating the biogenesis and intracellular journey of wild type CFTR is also underscored by two publications indicating that some F508 CFTR can be found at the cell surface in native epithelia (65, 66).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	220	 These earlier reports raise the possibility that in the correct physiological milieu, even the mutant protein might traffic differently than reported in heterologous expression systems.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Furthermore, a number of CFTR-associating proteins have been identified and shown to regulate either the function (32) or the intracellular journey of CFTR (33).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Whether these or other yet to be identified proteins have any effect on the biogenesis and stability of the wild type protein in native epithelia remains to be determined.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Although endogenous, wild type CFTR synthesis is quite low in many native tissues, our results suggest the usefulness of cell lines endogenously expressing CFTR as powerful tools for investigating cell type-specific differences in CFTR biogenesis and function.

0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	4	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) contains two membrane-spanning domains; each consists of six transmembrane segments joined by three extracellular and two intracellular loops of different length.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To examine the role of intracellular loops in CFTR channel function, we studied a deletion mutant of CFTR (19 CFTR) in which 19 amino acids were removed from the intracellular loop joining transmembrane segments IV and V.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This mutant protein was expressed in a human embryonic kidney cell line (293 HEK).
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Fully mature glycosylated CFTR (170 kDa) was immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with wild-type CFTR cDNA, while cells transfected with the mutant gene expressed only a core-glycosylated form (140 kDa).
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The chloride efflux rate (measured by 6-methoxyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl) quinolinium SPQ fluorescence) from cells expressing wild-type CFTR increased 600% in response to forskolin.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In contrast, 19 CFTR-expressing cells had no significant response to forskolin.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Western blotting performed on subcellular membrane fractions showed that 19 CFTR was located in the same fractions as F508 CFTR, a processing mutant of CFTR.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These results suggest that 19 CFTR is located in the intracellular membranes, without reaching the cell surface.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Upon reconstitution into lipid bilayer membranes, 19 CFTR formed a functional Cl channel with gating properties nearly identical to those of the wild-type CFTR channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, 19 CFTR channels exhibited frequent transitions to a 6-picosiemens subconductance state, whereas wild-type CFTR channels rarely exist in this subconductance state.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These data suggest that the intracellular loop is involved in stabilizing the full conductance state of the CFTR Cl channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	15	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ()consists of five distinct regions, with two putative membrane-spanning domains, two nucleotide-binding folds, and a regulatory domain(1) .
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	16	 CFTR forms a Cl channel of linear conductance(2, 3) , which is regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation (2, 4, 5, 6) at multiple sites in the regulatory domain and by binding and hydrolysis of ATP by the nucleotide-binding folds (7, 8, 9, 10) .
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The structure and function of these five domains of CFTR have been extensively studied(11, 12, 13, 14) .
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In contrast, little is known about the role of intracellular loops and their contribution to the function of the CFTR Cl channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	19	The intracellular loops of other channel proteins appear to participate in channel function.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	20	 For instance, mutations in the second intracellular loop of the Shaker K channel affect channel inactivation(15) .
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Deletion of a portion of the putative cytosolic loops between two transmembrane repeats of the Na channel slows the rate of channel inactivation(16) .
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	22	 To investigate the role of the intracellular loops of CFTR in Cl channel function, we studied a deletion mutant of CFTR (19 CFTR) in which 19 amino acids were removed from the intracellular loop joining transmembrane segments IV and V in the first membrane-spanning domain.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This is the largest and most hydrophilic loop in the first membrane-spanning domain, as one-third of the residues in this loop are charged.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	24	 These features make this loop a candidate for electrostatic or allosteric interactions with other cytosolic domains of CFTR (nucleotide-binding folds, the regulatory domain, or other intracellular loops) and cellular proteins to contribute to channel function.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	25	Subcloning of CFTR GeneThe wild-type and F508 CFTR cDNAs (17) were subcloned into an Epstein-Barr virus-based episomal eukaryotic expression vector, pCEP4 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), between the NheI and XhoI restriction sites.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The mutant gene, which lacks 57 nucleotides between nucleotides 930 and 987, was shuttled from pBluescript into pCEP4 by substituting the corresponding fragment in pCEP4(WT) (where WT is wild type) with the mutant one between the KpnI and AflII restriction sites.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The mutant clone (pCEP4(19)) was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing of the shuttled fragment from nucleotides 874 to 1040.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	28	Cell CultureA human embryonic kidney cell line (293-EBNA, Invitrogen) was used for transfection and expression of wild-type and mutant CFTR proteins.

0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The frequent occurrence of subconductance state resulted in an asymmetric distribution of the first open level of the 19 CFTR channel (indicated by O1 and O2).

0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	227	In this study, we examined the function of a CFTR deletion mutant, 19 CFTR.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	228	 This deletion mutation results in incomplete glycosylation and intracellular retention of CFTR based on the following observations.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	229	 (i) An immunoprecipitation/Western blot assay identified a core-glycosylated form of 19 CFTR (140 kDa), different from the fully mature glycosylated protein (170 kDa); (ii) subcellular fractionation showed the 19 CFTR protein localized predominantly in the intracellular membranes; and (iii) an SPQ assay of cells expressing 19 CFTR showed no forskolin-stimulated Cl transport.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	230	 However, this processing mutant maintained functional Cl channel activity, presumably in the intracellular organelles, when reconstituted into lipid bilayer membranes.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	231	 The most notable difference between wild-type and 19 CFTR channels lies in the distribution of conductance states.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	232	 The deletion mutation caused frequent occurrence of a subconductance state within the Cl channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	233	The most common disease-causing mutation of CFTR is the deletion of a single phenylalanine residue at position 508 (F508 CFTR).
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Most of the F508 CFTR protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and fails to reach its intended site of action in the plasma membrane.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	235	 With regard to processing at 37  degrees C, 19 CFTR appears to be similar to F508 CFTR.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	236	 However, F508 CFTR appears in the fully mature glycosylated form and can traffic to the plasma membrane following incubation at lower temperature (26-30  degrees C) (Fig.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Unlike F508 CFTR, the misprocessing of 19 CFTR is temperature-insensitive: the protein remained in the core-glycosylated state in intracellular organelles even at 26  degrees C.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	238	 The F508 CFTR proteins, once at the plasma membrane, give rise to functional Cl channels similar to those of wild-type CFTR in terms of open probability (26) and conductance state(24, 26) .
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	239	A cardiac-specific isoform of CFTR lacks 30 amino acids in the intracellular loop between transmembrane segments II and III.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	240	 It is caused by alternative splicing of exon 5 of the CFTR mRNA(27) .
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Cardiac CFTR functions as a cAMP-dependent protein kinase-regulated Cl channel with conduction properties similar to those of epithelial CFTR(9, 28) .
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	242	 However, when expressed in HeLa cells, human CFTR lacking exon 5 failed to generate a cAMP-mediated chloride transport by the SPQ assay, apparently due to defective intracellular processing(29) .
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	243	 The strategy applied here to the study of CFTR channel function can be used to study even misprocessed or mislocalized channels and therefore ought to be applicable to the study of the effects of deleting exon 5 on CFTR channel function as well.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	244	The 19 amino acids deleted in 19 CFTR span a major part of the intracellular loop joining transmembrane segments IV and V.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	245	 This segment is highly hydrophilic, with about one-third of the residues being charged (two lysines and four glutamates).
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Several factors could account for the subconductance state associated with the 19 CFTR channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	247	One possibility is that retention of the 19 CFTR protein in intracellular membranes alters the function of the Cl channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Maturation of CFTR from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane involves several processing and post-translational modifications (e.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	249	 The endoplasmic reticulum membrane contains other proteins, including various types of chaperons, that could interact with CFTR and alter the function of the Cl channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	250	 However, the gating kinetics and open probability of the 19 CFTR channel in the intracellular membrane are similar to those of the wild-type CFTR channel in the plasma membrane, so the deletion of these 19 amino acids did not alter the essential function of the CFTR Cl channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Moreover, the wild-type CFTR channel occasionally enters the O2 subconductance state characteristic of the 19 CFTR channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	252	 These observations suggest that the subconductance state associated with the 19 CFTR Cl channel is probably an intrinsic property of the CFTR protein, but the deletion affects CFTR in such a way as to favor the O2 conductance state.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	253	A second possibility is that this loop interacts with other domains (nucleotide-binding folds, the regulatory domain, and other intracellular loops) in CFTR or with other cellular proteins that are involved in the conductance state transition.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Deletion of part of this loop might then affect the channel structure allosterically by changing these inter- or intramolecular interactions and thus induce a quasi-stable open configuration in addition to the full open state.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Understanding the distribution of subconductance states associated with the single Cl channel should provide valuable information about structure-function relationships in the CFTR Cl channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	256	The approach reported here allows functional characterization of CFTR in any intracellular membranes besides the endoplasmic reticulum membrane(25) .
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	257	 By preparing vesicles from intracellular membranes separated from the plasma membrane, in principle, one can study any processing mutant in the lipid bilayer system.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Further experiments are necessary to test the role of specific amino acids of the intracellular loops (e.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	259	 positively and negatively charged and hydrophobic amino acids) in the regulation of the conductance state of the CFTR Cl channel.

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	4	 With a reconstituted system, we show that a Sec61 complex lacking Sec61 is essentially inactive when elongation and membrane targeting of a nascent chain occur at the same time.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The translocation process is perturbed at a step where the nascent chain would be inserted into the translocation channel.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, if sufficient time is given for the interaction of the nascent polypeptide with the mutant Sec61 complex, translocation is almost normal.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Thus Sec61 kinetically facilitates cotranslational translocation, but is not essential for it.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	8	Using chemical cross-linking we show that Sec61 not only interacts with subunits of the Sec61 complex but also with the 25-kD subunit of the signal peptidase complex (SPC25), thus demonstrating for the first time a tight interaction between the SPC and the Sec61 complex.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Interestingly, the cross-links between Sec61 and SPC25 and between Sec61 and Sec61 depend on the presence of membrane-bound ribosomes, suggesting that these interactions are induced when translocation is initiated.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We propose that the SPC is transiently recruited to the translocation site, thus enhancing its activity.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	11	IN higher eukaryotes, most proteins are transported across the ER membrane in a cotranslational manner.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The translating ribosome binds tightly to the ER membrane (Connolly et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	13	, 1994), and the growing nascent polypeptide chain is transferred directly from the channel in the ribosome into a channel in the membrane (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975; Connolly et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	14	, 1989; Simon and Blobel, 1991; Gorlich et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	15	, 1992b; Gorlich and Rapoport, 1993).
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	16	The cotranslational translocation pathway in mammals can be reproduced with reconstituted proteoliposomes containing only three membrane protein components: the SRP receptor complex, the translocating chain-associating membrane (TRAM)1 protein, and the Sec61 complex (Gorlich and Rapoport, 1993).
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The signal recognition particle (SRP) receptor is required to target a ribosome- nascent chain complex to the ER membrane.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The function of the TRAM protein is still unclear; it is only required for the translocation of a subset of proteins (Gorlich et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The Sec61 complex represents the essential core of the translocation machinery in the ER membrane.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	20	 It consists of three subunits, an  subunit (Sec61) that spans the membrane 10 times, and  and  subunits (Sec61 and Sec61, respectively) that each span the membrane a single time.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	21	The Sec61 complex is evolutionarily highly conserved and is proposed to carry out at least three different functions.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	22	 First, it is the major constituent of the protein conducting membrane channel.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Cross-linking experiments have shown that its  subunit is in continuous proximity of nascent polypeptide chains passing through the membrane (Mothes et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Recent electron microscopic data demonstrate that the Sec61 complex can form cylindrical oligomers that presumably represent the channels (Hanein et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Second, the Sec61 complex is tightly associated with membrane-bound ribosomes and is likely to be the ribosome receptor (Gorlich et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	26	, 1994; Jungnickel and Rapoport, 1995).
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Third, the Sec61 complex is involved in a signal sequence recognition event that takes place inside the membrane (Jungnickel and Rapoport, 1995).
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	28	The role of the Sec61 complex subunits for its different functions is not yet clear.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Whereas the presence of a multi-spanning  subunit in a channel-forming protein complex may not be surprising, the role of the two small single-spanning polypeptide chains remains mysterious.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	30	 A particular enigma is the  subunit.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the simultaneous deletion of the  subunits of the two homologous Sec61 complexes (Sec61p and the Ssh1p complex) is not lethal; the cells only show a growth defect at elevated temperatures (Finke et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Thus, despite the fact that the protein is evolutionarily highly conserved, it does not appear to be absolutely required in vivo.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Posttranslational protein transport across yeast ER membranes in vitro is reduced, but not completely prevented, when the  subunits are lacking.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	34	 At which point the transport process is inhibited, and whether the  subunits play any role in the cotranslational mode of protein transport has not yet been investigated.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	35	The function of the  subunit of the Sec61 complex may not necessarily be restricted to the actual translocation process.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The transport of proteins across the ER membrane must be intimately coupled to their modification and folding, and it seems possible that the  subunit could be involved in interactions between the translocation channel and modifying enzymes or chaperones.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	37	 A physical association of these proteins with the channel may enhance the efficiency of their function.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	38	 A good example is the signal peptidase, an abundant enzyme whose active site is in the lumen of the ER.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Although it can cleave the signal peptide of even completed polypeptide chains, its efficiency is probably much higher when it can act on polypeptide chains that are just emerging from the translocation channel into the lumen of the ER.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	40	 One may therefore predict its physical association with channel constituents.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The signal peptidase complex is composed of five membrane protein subunits (Evans et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	42	, 1986), two with an active site for enzymatic activity, one with a lumenal domain of unknown function, and two (12 and 25 kD) with cytosolic domains.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The function of the latter is particularly unclear because they cannot contribute to the enzymatic activity on the lumenal side of the membrane, and are not essential for the viability of yeast cells (Lively and Walsh, 1983; Fang et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	44	, 1996; Kalies and Hartmann, 1996; Mullins et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	45	 They would be especially good candidates to serve as linkers to the translocation channel.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	46	In the present paper, we have analyzed the role of the  subunit of the Sec61 complex in the cotranslational translocation pathway in mammals.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Using a reconstituted system, we demonstrate that the  subunit kinetically facilitates, but is not essential for, cotranslational translocation.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The protein does not play a role in the interaction of the ribosome with the Sec61 complex, but rather in the insertion of the nascent chain into the translocation site.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Using a bifunctional cross-linker, we also provide evidence that it interacts specifically with the 25-kD subunit of the signal peptidase complex (SPC25), thus demonstrating for the first time a tight interactions between the SPC and the Sec61 complex.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Cross-linking is only observed in the presence of membrane-bound ribosomes.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	51	 These data thus suggest that, upon ribosome binding to the Sec61 complex, an interaction between the cytosolic domains of the Sec61 and SPC25 serves to recruit the signal peptidase complex to the translocation site.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Together with the observation that cross-linking between the  and  subunits of the Sec61 complex is also dependent on translocation, these data provide first evidence for structural changes in the translocation apparatus upon initiation of cotranslational translocation.

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	138	 With this protocol, proteoliposomes lacking Sec61 were active in translocation, although their activity was lower by a factor of three compared with the wild-type complex (Fig.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Thus, the depleted proteoliposomes are capable to translocate polypeptides if given enough time in the membrane targeting reaction.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The results also indicate that the Sec61 complex lacking its  subunit has not been irreversibly denatured during the prolonged immunodepletion procedure.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	141	 These data suggest that the ribosome-nascent chain complex was targeted to the membrane and thus brought in contact with the signal peptidase, but that a subsequent translocation step was perturbed.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	142	 We also found that a fragment of preprolactin of 86 amino acids could be efficiently targeted to reconstituted proteoliposomes and reached a protease-protected state even if Sec61 was lacking (data not shown), supporting the conclusion that insertion of the nascent chain into the Sec61-depleted translocation site can occur if no chain elongation is going on.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	143	It should be noted that in the absence of membranes, almost no full-length preprolactin could be observed (Fig.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	144	 1 B, lanes 1 and 9), indicating that under the conditions used, SRP produced a tight translational arrest.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Both the microsomes and the two types of proteoliposomes were able to release the translational arrest (Fig.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	146	 1 B, lanes 2-4 and 10-12), indicating that this reaction is not dependent on the presence of Sec61.

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	148	Our data suggested that in the absence of Sec61, the binding of the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the ER membrane is less efficient.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	149	 This could be due to either a defect in the interaction of the mutated Sec61 complex with the ribosome, or to a perturbed insertion of the nascent chain into the translocation site.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	150	 We therefore analyzed whether the  subunit plays a role in ribosome binding.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Depleted and mock-depleted proteoliposomes were incubated at physiological salt concentrations with radioactively labeled ribosomes and increasing amounts of unlabeled ribosomes, both lacking nascent polypeptide chains.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Under these conditions, the ribosomes interact mainly with the Sec61 complex (Kalies et al.

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Scatchard plot analysis was used to estimate the number of binding sites and the apparent dissociation constants (Fig.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Both the depleted and mock-depleted proteoliposomes were found to bind ribosomes with approximately the same binding constant.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Also, the number of binding sites was about the same.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The measured parameters are in good agreement with published data for the binding of ribosomes to PK-RM and proteoliposomes (Kalies et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	158	, 1994), although the dissociation constants seem to be somewhat higher at 26 degrees  than at 0 degrees C.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Thus, steps other than the interaction between SRP and its membrane receptor or the binding of ribosomes to the Sec61 complex must be responsible for the less efficient insertion of the nascent polypeptide chains into proteoliposomes lacking Sec61.

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	204	 However, to our surprise, when PK-RM were used in cross-linking experiments, not only were no additional cross-links observed, but those between Sec61 and Sec61 and between Sec61 and SPC25 could no longer be seen (Fig.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Treatment of RM with high salt or puromycin alone did not change these cross-links (data not shown), suggesting that their disappearance requires the dissociation of the ribosomes into subunits.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	206	 In agreement with this assumption, proteoliposomes reconstituted from a crude detergent extract of microsomes or proteoliposomes containing only the purified Sec61 complex, which both lack membrane-bound ribosomes, also did not give these cross-links (Fig.

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	240	Taken together, these data provide evidence that the  subunit of the Sec61 complex is involved in ribosome- dependent conformational changes of the translocation channel and that it specifically interacts with the signal peptidase during cotranslational translocation.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	241	In this paper, we have studied the role of the  subunit of the Sec61 complex during cotranslational protein translocation into the mammalian ER.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	242	 We have found that the translocation competence of reconstituted proteoliposomes immunodepleted of Sec61 is greatly reduced when tested under conditions in which membrane targeting and translation occur at the same time.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	243	 However, if ribosomes carrying short nascent chains are first targeted to the membrane before translation is continued, i.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	244	, if enough time is given for their membrane insertion, the depleted proteoliposomes are only marginally reduced in their activity.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	245	 These results can be explained by the assumption that elongation of a nascent chain and its insertion into the translocation channel are kinetically competing processes: if the membrane insertion is too slow, elongation of the nascent chain would continue in the cytosol and its folding would prevent a later interaction of the signal sequence with the translocation apparatus.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	246	 We therefore infer that the  subunit is required for a rapid insertion of the ribosome-bound nascent chain into the translocation sites in the ER membrane.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The observation that the  subunit is not essential is in agreement with the fact that the deletion of the two  subunits in yeast cells is not lethal and leads to a growth phenotype only at elevated temperatures.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Since microsomes isolated from the mutant had a reduced activity for posttranslational protein transport, these and the present results indicate that the  subunit plays a role in both pathways, but is not absolutely required in either one.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	249	As the cotranslational translocation process is known in much detail, we have been able to analyze the effect of Sec61 depletion on the various steps.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	250	 One of the first steps is the interaction of the ribosome-nascent chain- SRP complex with the SRP receptor in the membrane that leads to the release of the translational arrest exerted by SRP.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	251	 This reaction was not perturbed by the depletion of Sec61, although previous data showed that, for optimal release, both the SRP receptor and the Sec61 complex are required (Gorlich and Rapoport, 1993).
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	252	 We therefore conclude that the  subunit is not essential for this activity of the Sec61 complex.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	253	 The binding of ribosomes to the ER membrane was also not affected by the absence of Sec61.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Both the number of binding sites and the dissociation constant remained unchanged and were almost identical to the values determined for the reconstituted, purified wild-type Sec61 complex.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	255	 These results are consistent with the observation that proteolytic degradation of the cytosolic domain of Sec61 in microsomes does not prevent the binding of ribosomes (Kalies et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Taken together, our results indicate that even in the absence of Sec61, efficient release of the SRP arrest and binding of the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the Sec61 complex can occur.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	257	 This conclusion is further supported by the observation that the membrane targeted nascent chains undergo signal peptide cleavage by signal peptidase located in the wrong orientation in the reconstituted membrane.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	258	 It therefore appears that a step subsequent to membrane targeting, most likely the step in which the nascent chain is inserted into the Sec61 channel, is perturbed in the absence of the  subunit.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Structural changes in the Sec61 channel, which may be required for its opening (Crowley et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	260	, 1994; Jungnickel and Rapoport, 1995), may occur with a reduced rate.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	261	To further analyze the function of Sec61, we have probed its molecular environment in ER membranes by cross-linking.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	262	 A bifunctional cross-linker was used that reacts specifically with SH groups and therefore can be expected to give a relative simple cross-linking pattern.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	263	 As predicted, in rough microsomes Sec61 was found in close proximity to the  subunit of the Sec61 complex.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	264	 We also found a cross-linked product consisting of two Sec61 molecules, perhaps explained by the occurrence of oligomers of the trimeric Sec61 complex in microsomes (Hanein et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Most interestingly, however, a specific cross-linked product containing SPC25 was observed.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Conversely, when the cross-linking partners of SPC25 were analyzed, the only partner outside the signal peptidase complex was found to be Sec61.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Remarkably, 70% of SPC25 could be cross-linked to Sec61.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	268	 We therefore believe that the cross-link between the two proteins indicates their specific interaction.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	269	 These data provide the first evidence that the signal peptidase physically contacts the protein conducting channel in the membrane.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	270	 The cross-linking between Sec61 and SPC25 has likely occurred between their cytosolic domains since the only cysteine in Sec61 is in its NH2 terminus and two appropriately located cysteines exist in the NH2-terminal domain of SPC25 (Fig.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	271	 7), previously shown to be cytosolic (Kalies and Hartmann, 1996).
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	272	 SPC25 has almost no amino acid residues in the lumen of the ER where the active site of the signal peptidase resides (Fig.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	273	 7) and its function was therefore obscure.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	274	 On the basis of our data, we propose that it is involved in an interaction with the Sec61 complex to bring the enzyme close to the translocating polypeptide substrate.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	275	 However, sequestration in the translocation site may not be absolutely essential for its function because the signal peptidase complex is very abundant and can probably reach its substrates by mere diffusion in the plane of the membrane, explaining why neither SPC25 nor Sec61 are essential for the viability of yeast cells.

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	282	Further evidence for our conjecture that Sec61 may be involved in recruiting the signal peptidase complex to the translocation site comes from cross-linking experiments in which ribosome-stripped membranes were used.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	283	 These membranes gave many cross-link-reduced cross-links between Sec61 and SPC25.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	284	 After retargeting of ribosome-nascent chain complexes at almost ribosome-free membranes, the cross-linking between both proteins was increased, suggesting that their interaction is induced when translocation is initiated by ribosome binding.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	285	 The cross-linking between Sec61 and Sec61 was also dependent on the presence of membrane-bound ribosomes.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Both effects required the dissociation of the ribosome, and not merely the release of the nascent chain from the ribosome, since they occurred with puromycin at high but not at low salt concentrations.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	287	 The changes in cross-linking pattern upon ribosome removal or retargeting of ribosome-nascent chain complexes could be caused by conformational alterations in an assembled complex or by dissociation of an assembly into subcomplexes.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	288	 In any case, they provide first evidence for structural changes among known components of the translocation apparatus induced by the onset of cotranslational translocation.

0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	3	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR)1 mediates transepithelial chloride transport across epithelial cells in the airways, intestine, pancreas, and sweat gland.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Some mutations in CFTR cause the lethal genetic disease cystic fibrosis, which produces chronic lung infection, progressively impaired pulmonary function, and pancreatic insufficiency.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The most common CFTR mutant, F508-CFTR, is retained at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and consequently is unable to function as a plasma membrane chloride channel (1).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Electrophysiological studies indicate that the ER-retained F508-CFTR is at least partially functional in excised ER membranes (2).

0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	9	 4) indicates that under certain conditions F508-CFTR can be transported to the plasma membrane and restore cell chloride permeability.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	10	CFTR biosynthesis is an inefficient process.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Newly synthesized wild type (wt)-CFTR and F508-CFTR are folded into the ER membrane where they become core-glycosylated (5, 6).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Only 20-30% of newly synthesized wt-CFTR is transported to the Golgi where complex glycosylation occurs, with the remaining protein ubiquinated and degraded by the proteasome (7, 8).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Wild type CFTR exists initially in a protease-susceptible form (t1/2 ~30 min) that becomes more stable upon transport from ER to Golgi (t1/2 ~24 h), whereas F508-CFTR is rapidly degraded (t1/2 ~30 min) (5, 6).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Inhibition of proteasome function results in the formation of aggresomes, which are detergent-insoluble, perinuclear protein aggregates common to many degenerative diseases (9-11).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	15	CFTR folding in the ER appears to be facilitated by interactions with the cellular quality control machinery.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Wild type CFTR and F508-CFTR have been shown to interact with the molecular chaperones Hsc70, Hdj2, Hsp70, Hsp90, and calnexin but not with BiP or Grp94 (12-15).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Recent data suggest that the Hsc70 co-chaperone CHIP (C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) targets immature CFTR for proteasome-mediated degradation (16).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Biochemical data indicate that calnexin and Hsp70 bind F508-CFTR more avidly than wt-CFTR (12, 13).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The differential processing of F508-CFTR and wt-CFTR, however, is probably not accounted for by gross structural differences.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Proteolytic cleavage experiments have suggested that the conformation of F508-CFTR is similar to that of the early, relatively unstable form of wt-CFTR (17).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In vitro folding studies of the isolated nucleotide binding domain 1 (containing the phenylalanine 508 residue) support the view that the F508 mutation does not affect structure (18, 19) but may affect folding kinetics.

0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	90	 As found in prior photobleaching studies (26, 27), the fluorescence recovery remaining after fixation represents reversible (diffusion-independent) photobleaching because fixation abolishes diffusion.

0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	153	 These findings suggest that ATP depletion does not alter ER continuity or gross structure and that the immobilization of F508-CFTR in ATP-depleted cells results from interactions with ER proteins.

0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	175	This study has shown that although F508-CFTR is retained in the ER, it diffuses at a comparable rate to wt-CFTR in BFA-treated cells.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Similar observations were made for the T126M mutant of AQP2 (a water channel that is partially misfolded and similarly retained in the ER, Ref.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	177	 27) and for a temperature-sensitive folding mutant of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (29).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Therefore, slowed or restricted F508-CFTR mobility in the ER cannot account for its failure to be exported.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Efficient recycling from the Golgi or failure to be recognized by the ER export machinery remain possible explanations for the ER localization of F508-CFTR.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The observation of small amounts of F508-CFTR in post-ER membranes suggests that efficient recycling may be responsible for the retention of F508-CFTR in the ER (30).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	181	The small immobile pool of F508-CFTR and the substantial immobilization after ATP depletion suggest that a greater fraction of F508-CFTR interacts with molecular chaperones than does wt-CFTR.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Approximately 50% of F508-CFTR was immobile after ATP depletion, with only minor effects on the mobility of wt-CFTR.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The simplest interpretation of this finding is that ATP depletion, which stabilizes protein interactions with molecular chaperones, is able to reveal F508-CFTR interactions that are not observable under normal conditions.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	184	 As discussed in the Introduction, F508-CFTR structure is thought to be similar to that of an early intermediate of wt-CFTR, and biochemical evidence supports F508-CFTR associations with molecular chaperones.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	185	Additional maneuvers were performed to investigate specific interactions between wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR and the cellular protein processing machinery.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation by tunicamycin resulted in significant slowing and immobilization of both wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR, similar to findings for the VSVG glycoprotein (29).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Similar results were found with a glycosylation-null wt-CFTR mutant, which was poorly expressed in the plasma membrane as determined by biotinylation studies (not shown).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Protein glycosylation can facilitate folding, sorting, and quality control (31).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Our data are thus consistent with a role for glycosylation in CFTR folding.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Proteasome inhibition causes the accumulation of deglycosylated wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR in detergent-insoluble, high molecular weight aggregates (9, 32).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Consistent with the observations here, Bebok et al.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	192	 (32) demonstrated an association between the Sec61 translocation system and CFTR that was enhanced by proteasome inhibition.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	193	 After prolonged (14 h) incubation with lactacystin, wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR were found in aggresomes (9, 10).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Aggresomes are vimentin-enclosed, pericentriolar, electron-dense structures that contain aggregates of misfolded, often ubiquinated proteins associated with molecular chaperones and proteasomes.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	195	 As expected, the GFP-CFTR chimeras were completely immobile in aggresomes.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	196	Inhibition of interaction between Hsp90 and CFTR by geldanamycin also slowed the diffusion of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR, with greater immobilization of F508-CFTR.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Geldanamycin has been shown to disrupt interactions of Hsp90 and CFTR, increasing the degradation rates of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR (14).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Hsp90 has thus been proposed to have a potential role in protecting CFTR from rapid degradation.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	199	 The relative immobilization of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR after geldanamycin treatment supports a role of Hsp90 for CFTR processing.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	200	 As suggested for VSVG by Nehls et al.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	201	 (29), we believe that the physical state of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR after perturbation of CFTR processing by tunicamycin or geldanamycin may be different from that produced by ATP depletion.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The slowing and immobilization of CFTR by ATP depletion may represent CFTR interactions with molecular chaperones existing in large complexes (33), whereas the immobilization after tunicamycin and geldanamycin, or molecular deglycosylation, may represent CFTR self-aggregation.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Because of the logarithmic relationship between molecular radius and diffusion rate for a protein in a bilayer, substantial aggregates (10-100 units) must be formed to significantly slow diffusion.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The similar responses of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR to some of the pharmacological maneuvers are consistent with the intrinsically inefficient folding of wt-CFTR, which when compared with P-glycoprotein (another member of the ABC cassette family) is poorly folded.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	205	The diffusion coefficient for CFTR diffusional mobility in the ER, ~10  x  1010 cm2/s, is within the range of other ER membrane proteins that have been studied.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The membrane water channel AQP2 (retained in the ER with BFA) and the ER-retained mutant AQP2-T126M have diffusion coefficients of 2.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Cytochrome P450 2C2, an intrinsic ER protein, has a diffusion coefficient of 5.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	208	 VSVG in its native and misfolded states and two ER resident transmembrane proteins (lamin B receptor and the -subunit of the signal recognition particle receptor) have diffusion coefficients of 26-50  x  1010 cm2/s, depending upon temperature (29).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Two Golgi resident transmembrane proteins (galactosyltransferase and the KDEL receptor) retained in the ER with BFA have diffusion coefficients of 21-48  x  1010 cm2/s, depending upon cell type and temperature (29, 35).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The diffusion coefficient of the ER-retained MHC class 1 molecule H2Ld is 20-46  x  1010 cm2/s and that of TAP1 (transporter associated with antigen presentation 1) is 12  x  1010 cm2/s (36).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	211	 The variation in these diffusion coefficients probably reflects different protein sizes, interactions with ER and cytoplasmic proteins, and ER composition in different cells.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	4	Despite the absence of a TATA element, the transcription of the CFTR gene may be initiated through several discrete start sites (6,7), including those that are tissue-specific (8).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	5	 An intact CCAAT consensus is also required for accurate transcript initiation (9).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Both basal and cAMP-mediated regulation of CFTR transcription involve a weak cAMP response element (CRE) nucleotide consensus (10,11) in tandem with a consensus inverted CCAAT element or Y box (9).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In addition, CFTR transcription may be modulated by additional overlapping cis-acting elements, including a polymorphic YY1 site, located in the human minimal CFTR promoter (12).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	8	 CFTR promoter activity may be enhanced by exogenous transfected NF-B via its binding to the  to 1103 B element (13).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	9	 CFTR expression is also regulated through interactions with factors involved in remodeling of chromatin structure, such as CDP/cut and hGCN5 (14).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	10	Because none of these cis-acting elements confers tissue-specific control of CFTR expression, several studies focused on identifying potential regulatory elements that lie mainly outside the coding region.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Extensive analyses of the chromatin structure identified multiple clusters of DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) (15,16), some of which contain tissue-specific enhancer elements (17,18).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Multiple binding sites for a tissue-specific transcription factor, called HNF1, recently identified in various DHS core, modulate likewise CFTR expression (19).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Despite extensive studies, the transcriptional regulatory networks of CFTR expression remain to be unraveled.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	14	Our current model for the regulation of human CFTR expression proposes that multiple transcription factors interact with previously reported polymorphic and composite cis-acting elements encompassing a CArG-like motif (12,20).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The CArG box (CC(A/T)6GG), originally defined as the core component of the serum response element (SRE), is found in the 5' region of immediate early response genes, such as c-fos (21), and in many muscle-specific gene promoters (22).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This DNA element binds serum response factor (SRF), highly regulated and interactive transcription factor, which is phylogenetically conserved and belongs to the MADS box family of proteins, with MCM1, Agamous, Deficiens and SRF (23).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Although SRF is particularly enriched in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle lineages (24,25), it is also expressed in a variety of human cell lines from distinct tissue origins (26), and, to a lesser extent, in ectoderm-derived tissue such as gastric epithelium (27).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Interestingly, it has been shown that Drosophila SRF homolog is expressed in a subset of tracheal cells and regulates cytoplasmic outgrowth during terminal branching of the tracheal system (28).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Hence, it has been suggested that SRF plays an essential role in the formation of the respiratory system.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Moreover, it has been recently shown that SRF is involved in myofibroblast differentiation during lung damage (29).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Therefore, we hypothesized that trans-acting factors interacting with CArG-like motif, such as SRF, could be important in CFTR expression regulation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	22	 We provided evidence that SRF is expressed in bronchial epithelial cell expressing endogenous CFTR protein.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Through the use of combined gel mobility shift to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we first demonstrated that SRF protein binds, both in vitro and in vivo, the CFTR minimal promoter region spanning the CArG-like motif.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Mutagenic studies and transient co-transfections experiments showed that SRF alone is not sufficient to transactivate the CFTR gene.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Upon some mutations of the CFTR-CArG-like element, promoter activity is severely decreased, potentially implying YY1 as a co-repressor.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Given the YY1 well-defined role in the transcriptional regulation of some SRE-dependent promoters (30 to 33), we explored the putative role of YY1 on the CFTR promoter activity and demonstrated functional interplay between this factor and SRF.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Finally, by stringent in silico structural analysis, we identified additional multiple near consensus CArG sites within the highly conserved promoter and intronic regions of the CFTR gene.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We also documented the existence of SRF-containing protein complexes on numerous predicted CFTR CArG-like elements.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Taken together, the data obtained classify CFTR as a novel SRF target gene, subject to modest but significant SRF activation, and open the gate to further investigate how SRF may be involved in the regulation of CFTR gene expression.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	30	Plasmids constructs The original luciferase expression vector pGL3-Basic containing the wild-type human CFTR minimal promoter was described previously (12).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	31	 To further study the putative composite cis-acting element located at  to 108 from the major transcription initiation site of the human CFTR promoter (38), the CFTR-CArG-like motif was either mutated in a consensus CArG box or in a degenerated motif.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Mutations were introduced into the WT-pGL3 plasmid using an oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis system (QuickChangeTMSite-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Consistent with previous studies (50,51), we showed that the human minimal CFTR promoter is remarkably conserved across the orders studied (Figure 1B, right panel).

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	171	 To measure the expression levels of SRF mRNAs, we used a RT to PCR-based procedure previously described by Davis et al.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Amplification of SRF from bronchial epithelial cells and myoblasts yielded a fragment of the same size, 651 bp (Figure 2A), as that of the full-length SRF transcript produced by RT to PCR from human hearts (52).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	174	 The 453 bp band corresponding to SRF lacking exon 5 (SRF5) was only detected in the C2C12 myoblast line (Figure 2A).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	175	 To ensure that these bands were not the result of a PCR artifact or genomic contamination of samples, negative controls such as exclusion of RT or RNA during cDNA synthesis were included in each assay.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	176	 As expected, no PCR product appeared when either RT or the template was omitted (Figure 2A).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Densitometric analysis revealed that bronchial epithelial cells contained an appreciable amount of SRF mRNA.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Nuclear extracts from A549, Beas2B and C2C12 cells were electrophoresed and then assayed by western blotting with anti-SRF antibody reported to recognize all four isoforms of the protein (52).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	179	 As shown in Figure 2B, we found that robust expression of a 67 kDa band, that based on molecular mass, corresponds to full-length SRF (SRF-FL) in all of the cell lines examined.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Consistent wit RT to PCR analysis, a 57 kDa band corresponding to SRF5 was only detected in the C2C12 myoblast line.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	181	 As a control, we checked the ss-actin levels (Figure 2B).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Densitometric analysis of western blot revealed no apparent difference in the expression level of SRF proteins between the myoblasts and epithelial cells (Figure 2B).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	183	 In subsequent western blot analyses in which parallel blots were probed with only the secondary antibody, no band was detected (data not shown), thus confirming that these bands are indeed specific for SRF.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	184	 As further evidence, A549, Beas2B and C2C12 cells express relatively large amounts of SRF, the cell lines were assessed by indirect immunofluorescence labeling.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	207	 We performed two series of bandshift experiments.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	208	 First, we incubated the 32P-labelLed WT oligonucleotide corresponding to CFTR-CArG-like element sequence (as indicated in Table 2) with bacterially expressed SRF.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	209	 As shown in Figure 3A (lane 3), EMSA revealed a recombinant SRF to WT duplex.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	210	 As shown in Figure 3A (lane 5), bands defined as the CFTR-CArG-like-SRF complex disappeared when 100-fold molar excess of specific competitor containing the consensus SRE motif, derived from human c-fos promoter (56), was added.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	211	 In contrast, competition by an irrelevant oligonucleotide (noted UC) did not appear to significantly alter the complex suggesting specificity of binding (lane 6).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	212	 To confirm precisely the identity of protein binding in the minimal CFTR promoter (from  to 121 to  to 83 bp), bacterially expressed SRF was preincubated with anti-SRF antibody before incubation with 32P-labelled probe.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	213	 As shown in Figure 3A (lane 4), bands corresponding to CFTR-CArG-like-SRF complex disappeared, and more slowly migrating bands appeared when anti-SRF antibody was added.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	214	 To verify the antibody specificity, control experiments were performed either in the absence of the SRF protein (Figure 3A, lane 7) or in the presence of an irrelevant antibody (Figure 3A, lane 8).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	215	 These results demonstrate that the CFTR-CArG-like element is a bona fide SRF-binding site.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Second, we performed additional EMSA with the WT oligonucleotide, as main binding target, and nuclear extracts from both epithelial and muscle cells (Figure 3B).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	217	 While three nucleoprotein complexes were formed from nuclear extracts of Beas2B and C2C12 cells on the WT probe, five complexes were detected from A549 cells.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Each nuclear protein complex was designated by an upper case relative to nuclear lysate followed by a Roman numeral indicating its position into the gels.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The binding specificity of the different complexes was examined by competition analyses with both specific and non-specific unlabeled oligonucleotides (Figure 3B, lanes 2 to 4).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Although a few non-specific binding activities were observed, complexes BII, BIII, AIII, AV, CI, CII and CIII were efficiently competed with an excess of both WT and c-fos SRE unlabeled specific competitors indicating binding specificity (Figure 3B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Control experiments including an irrelevant oligonucleotide did not reveal any change in electrophoretic profiles (Figure 3B, lanes 4).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	222	 To evaluate whether the SRF protein contributes to the formation of nucleoprotein complexes interacting with the CFTR-derived SRF site, we used a specific antibody against the SRF protein.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Although the incubation with the anti-SRF antibody apparently failed to give any discrete supershift from various sources of nuclear proteins, a significant decrease of specific complexes was observed (Figure 3B, lanes 6).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	224	 This effect seemed to be specific because none of these nuclear protein complexes was supershifted or abolished when a non-specific antibody was used (Figure 3B, lanes 7).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Control experiments containing only the anti-SRF antiserum and the radiolabeled WT oligonucleotide did not reveal any binding activities (Figure 3B, lanes 8).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	226	 In addition, supershift assays performed with the radiolabeled c-fos SRE oligonucleotide instead of the WT probe showed that bands corresponding to SRE to SRF complex disappeared and more slowly migrating bands appeared (Figure 3B, lane 10).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	227	 The absence of supershift for specific WT binding complexes (Figure 3D, lanes 6) may be explained if the epitope recognized by the anti-SRF antibody is part of (or located near) the CFTR-CArG-like DNA-binding site.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Antibody binding would compete DNA binding, resulting in a significant decrease or total disappearance of CArG-like complexes rather than in supershifted complexes.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Alternatively, if the interaction between the CFTR-CArG-like DNA-binding site and the SRF protein is insufficiently strong, it could be not as stable as the one observed with the SRE probe (Figure 3B, lane 10) to be detected as a supershift in gel retardation assays.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	230	 On the one hand, other DNA-binding proteins that are potentially part of this complex could interfere with the antibody's access to SRF protein.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	246	  SRF binds the CArG-like motif of the CFTR minimal promoter within intact chromatin under physiological conditions Although there is extensive evidence that SRF can bind to CArG-like elements in in vitro assays and that it is involved in transcriptional regulation through CArG elements in reporter assays in cultured cells with a typical epithelioid morphology (53), there is a lack of direct evidence for involvement of SRF in transcription of the endogenous CFTR gene within the context of intact chromatin.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	247	 To directly address whether SRF also binds in vivo, ChIP was carried out in bronchial epithelial cells.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	248	 For this purpose, DNA-binding proteins of Beas2B epithelial cells were covalently linked to genomic DNA by treatment of the cells with formaldehyde.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	253	 As expected, PCR signals were obtained when the DNA/protein adducts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-SRF antibody from both Beas2B (Figure 4, rows B and C, lane 1) and A549 (data not shown) epithelial cell lines.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	254	 In contrast, the negative controls, in which immunoprecipitation was performed with an irrelevant antibody (Figure 4, rows A to C, lane 3) or without antibody (Figure 4, rows A to C, lane 2), did not show any PCR signal.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	266	 We therefore addressed the ability of the WT-pGL3 construct, previously described (12) to drive the expression in Beas2B, A549 and C2C12 cells.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	267	 As shown in Figure 5A, an efficient transcription of the CFTR promoter could be readily observed in all three cell lines compared with monkey kidney fibroblasts (COS-7), which are negative for CFTR expression (36,37).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Surprisingly, the activity of the minimal CFTR promoter in C2C12 cells was 4 to 5.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	269	5 times higher than that observed in Beas2B and A549 cells, respectively.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Although the expression of the CFTR protein was previously evidenced in some muscle cells (57 to 59), it has never been investigated in mouse C2C12 myoblasts.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Therefore, we investigated the CFTR expression at both mRNA and protein levels.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	272	 To examine CFTR mRNA expression in mouse myoblasts (C2C12), total RNA isolated from epithelial and non-epithelial cells was analyzed via RT to PCR with CFTR-specific primers (Table 1).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	273	 As shown in Figure 5B, while no PCR product for CFTR was seen with COS-7 cells, the expected CFTR amplified product was obtained for both epithelial (A549 and Beas2B) and muscular (C2C12) cell lines.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	274	 No product was detected in the absence of reverse transcriptase or RNA (noted No RT or No RNA, respectively).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Although the HPRT PCR control showed non-equivalent amounts of cDNA used in the different PCRs, densitometric analysis revealed that C2C12 cells contained an appreciable amount of CFTR mRNA.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Further determination of CFTR expression in C2C12 myoblasts was conducted by western blot analysis (Figure 5C).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Caco-2 cells were used as positive control and COS-7 as negative control.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	278	 As shown in Figure 5C, while mature fully glycosylated band C CFTR was observed in A549, Beas2B and C2C12 cells, the core glycosylated band B CFTR occurred at the same molecular mass only in a subset of cell lines, indicative of potential variations in glycosylation process.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	279	 To rule out the possibility of antibodies cross-reactivity or non-specific labeling, indirect immunofluorescence analysis was performed with another anti-CFTR antibody, L12B4 (Figure 5D).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	280	 As expected, the Caco-2 cell line used as a positive control showed strong immunoreactivity for CFTR protein (Figure 5D, row D).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	281	 In contrast, and as expected, COS-7 cells used as negative control did not stain with this anti-CFTR antibody (Figure 5D, row E).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	282	 No staining was detected when the primary antibody was omitted (Figure 5D, row F).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	283	 The comparison of immunofluorescence images between epithelial (Figure 5D, row A, B and D) and muscular (Figure 5D, row C) cells provides evidence that CFTR is significantly expressed in C2C12 myoblasts.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	284	 However, because the indirect immunofluorescence experiments were performed in permeabilized cells, they do not distinguish between CFTR that is located in the apical membrane and CFTR that is located in a vesicular pool just beneath the apical membrane.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	285	 These findings, together with the transcriptional activities presented above, suggest that the minimal CFTR promoter might contain tissue-specific enhancer(s) as well as repressive cis-regulatory elements that have the ability to mitigate the activity of the CFTR promoter between epithelial and non-epithelial lineages.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Because CF affects mainly epithelial tissues and Beas2B consistently yielded higher enhancer activity than A549, we restricted subsequent studies to this bronchial epithelial cell line.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	312	  Effects of SRF on the proximal CFTR promoter To assess whether SRF protein might affect CFTR transcriptional regulation, we took two related approaches.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	313	 First, we co-transfected either exogenous full-length SRF or truncated SRF mutants with the wild-type CFTR minimal promoter.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Second, we utilized a siRNA approach to ask whether a reduction in endogenous SRF levels could affect basal CFTR activation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Luciferase assays were carried out in Beas2B cells using the indicated SRF expression vectors and the WT-pGL3luciferase reporter construct (Figure 6B, left panel).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	316	 The 3XSRE-fos TATA-Luciferase reporter gene was used as positive control because its transcriptional activity is highly dependent on SRF binding (Figure 6B, right panel).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	317	 As expected, while this synthetic promoter containing several consensus SREs was markedly and significantly activated ( > 2-fold) by forced expression of full-length SRF protein (pHiv-SRF) (Figure 6B, right panel), truncated SRF mutants either containing only the amino acids 133 to 264 corresponding to DNA-binding domain of SRF (pHiv-DBD-SRF), or deleted of amino acids 153 to 165, an essential part for the DNA binding (pHiv-DN-SRF) induced modest but significant decrease of SRE activity (10% and 30%, respectively).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	318	 When these SRF expression vectors were transiently co-transfected with the WT-pGL3 luciferase reporter construct, the trans-activator effect of SRF was notably reduced.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Indeed, overexpression of full-length and dominant-negative (pHiv-DN-SRF) SRF proteins resulted in 50% increased and 30% decreased of luciferase activity, respectively (Figure 6B, left panel).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Unexpectedly and inconsistent with previous study (60), the pHiv-DBD-SRF construct induced 40% increase of the WT-pGL3 luciferase activity.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	321	 This results disparity may be explained by the fact that the c-fos promoter study (60) assessed the DBD to SRF domain activity via microinjection of corresponding truncated SRF polypeptide.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Perhaps, the best explanation for this increased activity is that the DNA-binding domain of SRF, also called MADS box, is sufficient for transcriptional activation of some SRF-dependent genes because it mediates interactions with accessory co-activators (61).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	323	 These results suggest that neither of the regions outside the MADS box, N- or C-terminal, appear essential for transactivation of the CFTR promoter by SRF.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	344	  To further establish the role of SRF in mediating the increase in CFTR gene transcription, we performed siRNA experiments (Figure 6C).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	345	 To demonstrate the efficacy of specific SRF siRNA construct, Beas2B cells were co-transfected with either control or SRF siRNA plasmids and western blots were performed to analyze levels of SRF in these cells.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	346	 Densitometric analysis of western blot showed that endogenous SRF levels were strongly reduced in the presence of the SRF siRNA plasmid (Figure 6C, left panel).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	347	 Then, control and SRF siRNA plasmids were co-transfected into Beas2B cells with either the WT-pGL3 or the 3XSRE luciferase reporter construct.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	348	 As shown in Figure 6C (right panel), reduction of endogenous SRF protein level decreased the activity of both wild-type CFTR promoter and 3XSRE-fos TATA-Luciferase reporter constructs by 25%.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	349	Taken together, these findings indicate that endogenous SRF into bronchial epithelial cells normally function as transcriptional coactivator for the CArG-mediated transactivation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	350	 However, we found that SRF activated the CFTR promoter less well than the SRE-containing synthetic promoter, suggesting that the CArG-like element mediated CFTR transcriptional activation probably required other bridging or co-activating factors.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	351	The CArG-like element contained in the human minimal CFTR promoter is important but not sufficient for basal transcriptional activity in Beas2B cells To assess the transcriptional relevance of the CArG-like binding sequence of CFTR minimal promoter, mutants were performed to create either more consensus CArG element or degenerated motif (Table 1).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	352	 We used the D upper-case and the C upper-case to designate the Degenerated CArG motifs and the Consensus CArG elements, respectively.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	353	 To ensure the efficacy of mutations in abrogating transcription factor binding, we first performed a series of EMSA experiments with each CArG mutant and the WT probe (Table 2).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	354	 As expected, based on the sequence analysis, the mutations resulting in more degenerated CArG motifs (D1, D2, D3 and D4 mutants) completely abolished SRF-binding activity (Figure 7A, lanes 1 to 4), when we compared with SRF-WT complexes (Figure 7A, lane 5).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	355	 In addition, the probes containing more consensus CArG boxes (C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 mutants) bound SRF more strongly in nuclear extracts prepared from Beas2B (Figure 7A, lanes 6 to 10).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	356	 Inclusion of an anti-SRF antibody partially abolished SRF-binding activity and resulted in a slower mobility band, confirming the identity of the binding protein (Figure 7A, lane 11).

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	358	 Compared with luciferase activity resulting from the WT-pGL3 construct, variable increases in reporter activity are observed when D1, D2, D3 and D4 mutant constructs, with disrupted CArG motif, were transiently transfected.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	359	 On the other hand, mutations that create more consensus CArG element result in either reducing or increasing in the transcriptional activity (Figure 7B).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	360	 Consistent with the preceding gel-shift results revealing an uncharacterized protein/DNA complex with slightly slower mobility and variable intensity compared with the SRF to DNA complex, these finer mutagenesis studies suggest that both co-activators and co-repressors might interact with the studied promoter sequences.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	361	 Taken together, these data demonstrated that the CFTR-CArG-like element alone is not sufficient to confer basal transcriptional activation of the CFTR gene.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	370	  Functional antagonism between SRF and YY1 through competition for the CFTR-CArG-like binding As a further means of establishing the role for SRF-binding CArG boxes in mediating either the CFTR-enhancer or silencer activity observed with the different minimal CFTR promoter mutants, we performed additional computational analyses.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	371	 Sequence analysis of CArG boxes and their immediate flanking sequences showed that C1, C3 and C4 constructs contain consensus binding sites for a number of transcription factors, in addition to SRF, including the transcription factor YY1.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	372	 These findings with previous work (12) have particularly evoked our interest to examine the role of YY1 in SRF-mediated CFTR transcriptional activity.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	373	In a first set of experiments, we evaluated whether the YY1 factor contributes to the formation of nucleoprotein complexes interacting with the WT, C1, C3 and C4 radiolabeled probes.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	374	 As shown in Figure 8A, incubation with specific anti-YY1 antibody resulted in either a significant decrease or total disappearance of some complexes normally formed between the CArG boxes and a component of Beas2B nuclear extracts, establishing DNA binding between YY1 and the sequences tested.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	375	 As expected, control experiment performed with radiolabeled probe, D2, devoid of any YY1 binding site and the anti-YY1 antiserum did not reveal any change in electrophoretic profiles indicating specificity of the YY1 binding.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	376	 Thus, these EMSAs demonstrated that the CFTR-CArG-like (WT probe) and more consensus CArG elements (C1  <  C3  <  C4) served as binding site for at least two distinct nuclear factors, namely SRF and YY1 from bronchial epithelial cells.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	390	  Then, to determine whether the interaction of these two factors with their target DNA (CFTR-CArG-like or more consensus CArG sequence) was either mutually inclusive or exclusive, EMSAs were conducted using bacterially expressed SRF and nuclear extracts prepared from Beas2B cells transfected with a YY1 expression vector as a source of YY1 DNA-binding activity.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	391	 As shown in Figure 8B, the YY1-binding complex was significantly reduced by increasing SRF binding activity, suggesting their mutually exclusive binding to CArG sites.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	392	Consistent with other studies (32,62), these EMSAs results suggested as a working hypothesis that both SRF and YY1 likely act as functional competitors in the CFTR promoter activity.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	393	 Since the minimal CFTR promoter is activated by SRF and knowing from previous studies (30 to 33) that YY1 negatively regulates some promoter containing CArG elements, it seemed logical to first assess whether YY1 could also repress the CFTR promoter.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	394	 We asked whether CArG-like-binding site in the CFTR promoter acted as negative regulatory elements.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	395	 Several CFTR promoter reporter constructs containing either CArG-like (namely, WT) or consensus CArG element (C1, C3 and C4) were co-transfected with SRF and/or YY1 expression vectors into Beas2B cells.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	396	 As shown in Figure 8C, while co-transfections with SRF alone resulted in 1.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	397	5- to 2-fold luciferase activation, forced expression of YY1 protein caused a strong decrease in reporter activities (50 to 75% of the control luciferase value).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	398	 Therefore, we wanted to determine the functional relationship of both factors in the CFTR activity regulation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	399	 Transient co-transfections analysis of combination of protein expression vectors showed that over-expression of SRF either did not restore (Figure 8C, panel with the WT and C4 reporter constructs) or only very slightly raised the YY1-repressed reporter activities (Figure 8C, panel with the C1 and C3 reporter constructs).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	400	 These findings are consistent with results obtained from co-transfections performed with the YY1 expression vector alone and previous alpha-actin promoter studies (30 to 33), in which YY1 acted as a strong repressor.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	401	 Taken together, these data suggested functional antagonism between SRF and YY1 through DNA-binding competition.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	403	 Four CArG binding sites were found in the CFTR promoter regions, and seven in the intronic regions.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	423	  We showed that all the predicted CArG elements occur in highly conserved CFTR non-coding regions (Figure 9B), which may contain tissue-specific transcription factors (5).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	424	 We provided evidence that the majority of in silico predicted CArG motifs form specific DNA to protein complexes with bacterially expressed SRF protein (Figure 9C, left panel).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	425	 We also demonstrated by using Beas2B nuclear extracts and supershift assays that some of these CArG elements bound in vitro SRF protein (Figure 9C, right panel, lanes 1, 3, 7 and 9).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	426	 Finally, additional ChIP experiments indicated that the only tested CArG element, located at  to 2373 bp in the CFTR promoter, bound SRF in chromatin from intact cultured Beas2B cells (Figure 9D, lane 1).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	427	 Collectively, these findings support the concept that SRF may play a key role in the CFTR expression regulation via binding to multiple CFTR CArG elements.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	428	Comparisons of nucleotide sequences of this CFTR promoter region in eight mammalian species representing three different orders (Primates, Artiodactyla and Lagomorpha) revealed high levels of conservation of the minimal promoter region, as described previously (64).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	429	 However, the CArG-like element (GC(T/A)6GG), which does not conform to the authentic CArG box (CC(T/A)6GG), is absent from three species (sheep, cow and rabbit).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	430	 Even though this motif occurs in only a subset of the input sequences, it does not necessarily mean that it is of no functional importance.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	431	 Instances of cis-regulatory elements being species-specific have been already reported for the CFTR gene (50).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	432	 More generally, it is well known that some transcription factors can tolerate more than one type of nucleotide at a given position of the binding site.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	433	 Instances of substitutions in both the central core of the CArG element and the highly conserved contact points for SRF, at the terminal ends, not impairing SRF binding have been previously reported (48,65 to 68).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	434	 Taken together, these data support the notion that the CFTR-CArG-like element has possible important implication in the CFTR transcriptional regulation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	435	Interestingly, analysis of SRF expression has revealed relatively high expression levels of SRF protein in the bronchial epithelial cells (Figure 2), as shown in other differentiated epithelial cells (27).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	436	 Accumulating evidence supports the concept that SRF could contribute to the CFTR expression regulation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	437	 In addition to regulating growth-responsive genes and numerous muscle-specific genes (22,69), SRF is also described as a key trans-binding factor in various important physiological events.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	438	 For example, SRF has been shown to regulate pulmonary development in Drosophila (28), to promote both re-epithelialization and muscular structure restoration during gastric ulcer healing (70) and more recently to be involved in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum-targeted gene (67).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	439	 Therefore, it was relevant to examine the potential role of SRF on the CFTR transcriptional activity.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	440	In the present study, we demonstrated that CFTR-CArG-like element forms specific DNA to protein complexes that include SRF protein as part of the complex, in vitro and in vivo (Figures 3 and 4).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	441	 We have investigated the expression driven by the proximal human CFTR promoter in a pGL3 construct in both epithelial and myoblasts lines.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	442	 Results of our transient transfections of 3XSRE-fos TATA and WT-pGL3 luciferase reporter genes showed that the human minimal CFTR promoter encompassing a CArG-like motif was sufficient to drive the expression in both cell types (Figure 5).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	443	 Consistent with other studies showing CFTR expression in smooth muscle tissue (71,72), our results demonstrated that the human CFTR minimal promoter had the ability to drive the expression in muscle lineages.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	444	 Our transient co-transfections analyses performed with full-length and dominant-negative SRF forms expression vectors, and also specific SRF siRNA constructs (Figure 6, panels B and C) provide the first evidence for a positive role of the SRF protein in the regulation of the human CFTR promoter.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	445	 However, the SRF-induced CFTR transactivation, though significant, is relatively modest.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	446	 These data with the results of finer mutagenesis studies presented in Figure 7 support the concept that SRF alone is not sufficient to drive the basal expression of the CFTR gene.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	447	 As suggested by other previous studies (73 to 75), it is likely that additional factors might be required to optimally drive the CFTR promoter, as well as to specify the cell-type-restricted expression.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	448	 Since YY1 was previously shown to bind the CFTR promoter (12) and a subset of SREs serve as binding sites for YY1 (30 to 33), we first evaluated this candidate in the SRF-mediated CFTR transcriptional activity.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	449	 The data analysis suggests a functional antagonism between SRF and YY1 through binding competition for the CFTR-CArG-like box.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	450	 However, the analysis of combinatorial co-transfection studies, presented in Figure 8C, suggests that the functional interplay between SRF and YY1, alone, is not sufficient to account for basal CFTR transcriptional activation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	451	 Further studies will be necessary to determine whether another player might be involved in this functional interplay and accounted for the basal transcriptional CFTR activity observed in the Beas2B bronchial epithelial cells.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	452	Interestingly, we showed that, in addition to the CArG-like element defined in the minimal promoter of the CFTR gene, there are three CArG motifs located at the 5' end of the gene and seven are present in the intronic regions (Figure 9).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	453	 We also evidenced SRF binding to CArG elements of the endogenous CFTR gene in the context of intact chromatin (Figures 4 and 9D).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	454	 Although the role of these more distal CArG boxes has yet to be assessed, these findings are of major importance, since it has been shown that optimal activity of the SRF-dependent target genes may require a number of CArG boxes, including those that are defined in the intronic region (66,67,76).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	455	 Moreover, as already suggested for the -actin promoters (32,74), perhaps the presence multiple CArG elements in the CFTR gene with cooperative binding events might be essential for SRF to prevent YY1 from binding to the CFTR promoter.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	456	 Clearly, further studies are needed to directly investigate the role of these multiple CArG elements in transcriptional regulation of the CFTR gene.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	457	Taken together, our results demonstrated for the first time that the human CFTR promoter is a novel SRF target gene, subject to modest but significant SRF activation partially due to functional antagonism between YY1 and SRF through mutually exclusive DNA-binding activities of YY1 versus SRF to the CFTR-CArG-like site.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	458	A critical question is, thus, how might SRF contribute to orchestrating cell-restricted and context-dependent programs of CFTR gene expression? Our findings and investigations to date clearly indicate the presence of several different underlying mechanisms of SRF-dependent transcriptional activation, as represented in Figure 10.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	459	 These might include association of SRF with a variety of cell-restricted co-factors (noted in gray bubbles, Figure 10), such as MRTF-A highly expressed in epithelial cells of the lung, kidney, colon and testis, and MRTF-B also expressed in smooth muscle cells (77), ternary complex factors, such as p62 and SAP-1 (25,78) and remodeling chromatin co-factors in an HAT-dependent manner, such as the CREB-binding protein (79).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	460	 In addition, it is well known that binding of SRF to the CArG box induces an acute bend in the DNA and that this bending may vary with changing base compositions across the CArG box (80).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	461	 Such bending can probably facilitate interactions with other proteins already involved in the CFTR expression regulation, such as NF-B (13) and C/EBP (9) and described as interacting with SRF (81).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	462	 Finally, the Ras-related GTPases family (rac, RhoA and cdc42) might have a critical role in the activation of SRF (82).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	463	 Indeed, it is reported that RhoA-induced SRF activation occurs through a phenomenon of  actin treadmilling  restricted to CArG-dependent genes that do not have adjacent ETS-binding sites (e.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	464	 smooth muscle cell restricted CArG genes) (83,84).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	465	 Moreover, it has been shown that the activation of SRF may be mediated by the NF-B and C/EBP transcription factors (81).

0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	0	Transcriptional Adaptation to Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Deficiency* Yan Xu , Jean C.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Divisions of  Pulmonary Biology,   Developmental Biology,   Pediatric Informatics, and  Pulmonary Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229-3039.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, October 8, 2002, and in revised form, November 13, 2002.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	3	Cystic fibrosis (CF)1 is the most common lethal, inherited pulmonary disorder and is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (1).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	4	 More than 800 distinct mutations in the CFTR gene have been associated with clinical diseases characteristic of cystic fibrosis (2).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Whereas many organs are affected in CF, morbidity and mortality in the disease is primarily related to mucus accumulation, recurrent infections, and excessive inflammation in the lung.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Whereas the pathogenesis of CF is not fully understood, abnormalities in cyclic AMP-dependent chloride secretion and excessive sodium reuptake by epithelial cells related to CFTR deficiency are thought to alter fluid homeostasis at the airway surface liquid leading to its dehydration, impaired mucociliary clearance, and infection (see Ref.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Because the elucidation of the primary structure of CFTR, a myriad of functions and numerous interactions with other cellular proteins have been ascribed to CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Thus, in addition to the role of CFTR in the regulation of cAMP-dependent chloride transport, this protein may play pleotropic roles in many cellular processes by interacting with the cytoskeleton, membrane transport proteins, as well as receptors, protein routing and degradation machinery (2).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	9	 A number of studies support the concept that the excessive inflammatory responses occur in the CF lung, but the mechanisms underlying these abnormalities have not been clarified.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Changes in levels of IL-8 and other proteins mediating inflammatory signaling including NFB and iNOS have been associated with CF, in the presence or absence of infection, raising the possibility that abnormalities in CFTR may constitutively alter pathways mediating inflammation (4-6).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	11	In the lung, CFTR is distributed primarily in apical regions of airway and submucosal gland epithelial cells (7).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Abundance and cellular sites of expression of CFTR are strongly influenced by developmental, spatial, and humoral factors, supporting the concept that the expression and function of CFTR are regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Despite extensive study, the precise role of CFTR in the pathogenesis of CF disease remains poorly understood.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	14	 At the clinical level, severity of CF disease is highly variable even among individuals bearing identical mutations, supporting the concept that environmental and hereditary factors may influence the severity of the disorder (2).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These clinical observations, and observations demonstrating strain differences in the severity of CF phenotype after CFTR gene targeting or mutation in mice (8), support the concept that the expression of CFTR and its function in cellular processes may be influenced by many genes or pathways intensifying or mollifying CF disease in various organs.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Morbidity and mortality in patients with CF is strongly associated with pulmonary disease caused by mucous accumulation, inflammation, and infection; however, deletion of CFTR mice does not cause significant pulmonary disease suggesting that expression of alternative channels or other complementary genes maintains pulmonary homeostasis in the mouse.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Whereas numerous in vitro and in vivo models have been developed for study of CFTR, analysis of genomic responses to the presence or absence of CFTR are complicated by heterogeneity of cell models, and culture conditions that may influence cell function and gene expression independently of CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Direct RNA analysis of pulmonary tissue from humans with CF is complicated by the nearly ubiquitous, severe pulmonary infections that may secondarily modify cellular responses and gene expression, complicating identification of responses to CFTR in vivo.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	19	Transgenic mice bearing a null mutation in CFTR (CFTR()), generally succumb to intestinal disease in the weanling period (9).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	20	 To generate healthy mice deficient in CFTR, the human CFTR cDNA was expressed in the intestinal epithelium under control of the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein gene promoter (iFABP), fully correcting small intestinal pathology and supporting normal postnatal survival of CFTR() mice (10).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The iFABP-hCFTR, mCFTR() mice have been maintained in a mixed FVB/N, C57BL/6 background without evidence of gastrointestinal or pulmonary disease for nearly a decade in our laboratory.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Histological andbiochemical studies identified no overt pathology in lung tissue from these mice compared with CFTR expressing littermate controls (10, 11).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Mice were maintained in filtered microisolator cages.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Sentinal mice were free of mouse pathogens.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Lungs of adult iFABP-hCFTR, mCFTR(), and control mice were free of bacterial pathogens or colonization as assessed by quantitative culture of lung homogenates on blood agar plates.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	26	RNA Preparation-- Matings of FABP-hCFTR(+/+)/mCFTR(/) mice to wild type FVB/N-mCFTR(+/+) mice were used to produce F1 FABP-hCFTR(+/)/mCFTR(/+) mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These mice were crossed to generate F2 offspring littermates that were then genotyped, choosing FABP-hCFTR(+)/mCFTR() and hCFTR(+)/mCFTR(+) mice for use in RNA comparisons.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	28	 To minimize the potential influence of strain differences in this colony, lung RNA was isolated from sex-matched littermates at 3, 6, and 11 weeks of age.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	29	 RNA was also isolated from lungs of surviving CFTR()/hCFTR() and CFTR(+) littermates at 3 weeks of age for comparison with those bearing the iFABP-hCFTR transgene.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	30	 All CFTR(+) mice were heterozygous for the targeted mCFTR gene.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Lungs from sex-matched littermates were carefully dissected and the conducting airways and mediastinal structures removed.

0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	127	 To simplify the calculation, we assumed that genes in each category could be fit to a binomial distribution.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	128	 The binomial probability was calculated for each category using the entire U74Av2 as reference data set.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	129	 "Inflammatory Response" was the most represented category of those RNAs increased in mCFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Among RNAs whose abundance was increased by the lack of CFTR, those influencing inflammation, transcription, and transport were most highly represented and consisted of a group of functional categories quite distinct from those whose expression was decreased in mCFTR() mice (Tables I-III).

0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	132	The potential influence of the FABP-hCFTR transgene on RNA expression was also assessed using the Welch t test at the three ages.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Differentially regulated RNAs identified in analysis of gastrointestinal-corrected mice were similarly affected in mCFTR() mice, demonstrating a lack of effect of iFABP-hCFTR on this subset of genes.

0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	140	 mRNA levels were normalized using -actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	141	2 (Kcnj15), CEBP, TNF-AIP-3, and Grin 2d mRNA were significantly increased in CFTR() mice compared with control littermates (Fig.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	142	 As expected, murine CFTR was not detectable by RT-PCR in mCFTR() mice, nor was hCFTR mRNA detected in lung from the iFABP-hCFTR bearing mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	143	The absence of CFTR caused stereotypic changes in gene expression in the lungs of CFTR() mice in the absence of detectable infection or inflammation.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Cellular responses to CFTR included enhanced expression of transcription factors and signaling pathways known to influence CFTR gene expression (IL-1 and CEBP).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Likewise, expression of RNAs modulating inflammation, ion transport, protein trafficking, and degradation were altered, indicating that a number of cellular pathways may compensate for or mediate CFTR-dependent functions that, in turn, may maintain normal pulmonary homeostasis in the CFTR() mice or alternatively, influence CF phenotype following response to pathogens.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	146	 The absence of CFTR initiates reproducible changes in lung gene expression that may modify inflammation, host defense, and other cellular functions, that likely contribute to or mollify the pathogenesis of pulmonary disease in CF.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	147	Because strain is known to influence pulmonary findings in CF mice (8), and the transgenic mice presently studied were generated in a mixed FVB/N, C57 Bl/6 background, lung RNA was compared from sex-matched littermates at various ages.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	148	 An extensive data set was utilized to identify CFTR-dependent changes in gene expression that were present throughout development and in the absence of inflammation, seeking to identify pathways influenced primarily by CFTR, rather than sex, strain, age, or other secondary phenomena.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	149	 As expected, expression of mCFTR was not detected in the gastrointestinal-corrected mCFTR() mice, consistent with previous findings (10).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Histologic analyses, performed presently and previously, demonstrated no structural abnormalities, infection or inflammation in the lungs of these mice as maintained in our vivarium (10, 11), supporting the concept that changes in gene expression were related to CFTR and not to age or lung disease.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Analysis of arrays prepared from pairs of mCFTR() mice and mCFTR(+) littermates (those lacking the iFABP-hCFTR transgene), confirmed the microarray findings, demonstrating both the lack of mCFTR mRNA in lungs of the mCFTR() and that RNA changes were independent of the iFABP-hCFTR transgene.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	152	Expression of Genes Modulating CFTR-- Expression of a number of genes known to influence CFTR expression was enhanced in the lungs of CFTR() mice, including CEBP and IL-1 suggesting that CFTR cells responded by enhancing levels of RNAs encoding transcription factors or pathways that may compensate for the lack of CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	153	 IL-1 increased CFTR gene transcription in epithelial cells in vitro (15) and cis-acting elements binding CEBP (to CCAAT enhancer sites) and c-Fos (to AP-1 elements) are present in the promoter-enhancer regions of the mouse CFTR gene (16, 17).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Previous studies demonstrated that CEBP directly enhanced CFTR gene transcription in vitro (18), thus, the increased CEBP expression may represent a potential compensatory response to CFTR deficiency that, in turn, may influence expression of genes unrelated to CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Expression of c-fos was also increased in the mCFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Whereas AP-1 sites have been identified in the hCFTR promoter, the precise role of c-fos in regulation of CFTR has not been clarified; although treatment of various cell types with phorbol esters decreased CFTR gene transcription in vitro (18).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Because CEBP and c-fos activate or inhibit the expression of numerous genes that share cis-active elements with the CFTR gene, changes in their activity may broadly influence gene expression, perhaps inadvertently linking CFTR deficiency to the expression of genes whose activities are not directly related to CFTR protein function.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	158	 RNA encoding TNF-AIP-3, a zinc finger transcription factor, was also increased in the CFTR() mice, further linking transcription responses to the lack of CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Of considerable interest, TNF-AIP-3 RNA was induced by either IL-1 or TNF.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	160	 TNF-AIP-3 inhibited NFB translocation in vitro, and may represent a compensatory response to the increased expression of IL-1 seen in the CFTR() mice (19).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	161	 JAK-3, nuclear receptor subfamily 2, and interferon regulatory factor-1 RNAs were decreased in CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	162	 These RNAs encode transcription factors that regulate various pathways involved in inflammation and may, therefore, represent responses to the proinflammatory proteins induced in the CFTR() mice, in essence, being secondarily responsive to initial compensatory changes.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	163	Enhanced Expression of Genes Modulating Inflammation-- Genes involved in inflammation were overly represented among the RNAs induced and were distinct from those that were decreased in the lungs from CFTR() mice (Table III).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Most prominent among genes whose expression was increased were a family of calcium-binding proteins termed the calgranulins (S100A8, S100A9, and calbindin D9K).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	165	 S100A8 is expressed primarily by macrophages and monocytes and its expression is enhanced by various cytokines including TNF-, IL-1, and interferon  (20, 21).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	166	 This family of peptides is expressed by various cell types and share potent chemoattractant activities, stimulating inflammatory cell trafficking.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Increased expression of S100A8 (calgranulin A) was previously demonstrated in alveolar macrophages from CFTR mutant mice, the authors suggesting that increased S100A8 may contribute to the enhanced inflammatory responses seen in the absence of CFTR (22).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Expression of S100A8 by alveolar macrophages was induced by TNF-, interferon  and IL-1, mediated at least in part by AP-1-dependent pathways (20).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Chitinase A mRNA was also consistently increased in the lungs of CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The acidic chitinase A is a small peptide containing a mammalian lectin domain that binds complex carbohydrates on surfaces of microbial pathogens including fungi.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Like the S100 family of proteins, chitinase family members are also expressed by alveolar macrophages in the lung (23).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Thus, decreased mCFTR initiated changes in expression of gene expressed primarily in alveolar macrophages.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	173	 It remains unclear whether these responses are mediated by direct effects of CFTR in alveolar macrophages or by altered cellular signaling initiated by the lack of CFTR in epithelial or other pulmonary cells that secondarily alters macrophage activity.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	174	Intense neutrophilic infiltration and an increased IL-8 production are strongly associated with CF lung disease in humans (2).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Increased IL-8 and neutrophilic infiltrates were observed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from CF patients in the absence of documented pulmonary infection (4).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Although it remains possible that antecedent, but resolved, infections may have contributed to the increased inflammation observed in the CF, these observations support the concept that CF is associated with increased susceptibility to pulmonary inflammation.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	177	 In the present study, IL-1, IL-4, and CSF-1 receptor RNAs were increased and each may contribute to the proinflammatory milieu.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	178	 IL-1 enhances CFTR gene transcription, induces inflammation, and is known to stimulate production of the S100-calgranulins, perhaps indicating a network of genes influenced by CFTR through IL-1.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	179	 IL-4 is a potent inflammatory mediator that enhances inflammation and mucous production in airway epithelia.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Transgenic animals expressing IL-4 or animal models in which IL-4 is induced developed severe goblet cell hyperplasia, increased mucous production, and inflammatory cell infiltrates (24), findings typically found in patients with cystic fibrosis.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	181	 CSF-3r RNA encoding a receptor that mediates monocytic cell migration, proliferation, and activity in response to CSF-3 (G-CSF) was increased 3-4-fold in the CFTR() mice (25).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Thus, taken together, expression of a number of genes; many influenced by IL-1 and mediating inflammation, were induced in the lungs of CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	183	Despite the increased expression of proinflammatory molecules, there is no evidence of inflammation in the lung of the CFTR() mice perhaps indicating that normal homeostasis is maintained by the complex responses of the lung to the lack of CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	184	 The presence of stereotypic changes in expression of many genes suggests that the presence of a single ameliorating gene, for example, an alternative chloride channel, does not fully explain the physiologic adjustment of the lung the CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	185	 At present, it is unclear whether these proinflammatory responses are secondary to changes in the expression and function of CFTR in the epithelial cells that, in turn, modulate cell signaling and cytokine production in the lung.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Alternatively, the absence of CFTR in the alveolar macrophages may alter expression of genes mediating inflammation in those cells.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	187	 It is of considerable interest that changes in RNAs modifying inflammation were altered in the lungs of mCFTR() mice in the absence of detectable bacterial infection or inflammation, supporting the concept that the transcriptional adjustment to CFTR deficiency suffices to maintain normal pulmonary homeostasis in the mouse in vivo.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Alternatively, the levels of expression of the proinflammatory molecules may not be adequate to cause histologically detectable inflammation.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	189	 It remains unclear whether these adjustments in gene expression may, in turn, render the CFTR() mice susceptible to inflammation following infection or injury.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	190	Changes in NFB- and TNF--dependent Pathways-- RNAs encoding a number of proteins involved in TNF signaling and NFB activation were also induced in the CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The abundance of TNF-AIP-3 mRNA, a zinc finger transcription protein, a protein whose expression is induced by both TNF- and IL-1, was increased in the CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	192	 TNF-AIP-3 inhibits NFB activity at target genes (19) and may represent a response to the proinflammatory milieu established in the CFTR() lung.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	193	 PEG-3, a protein that regulates the induction of NFB following TNF stimulation, was also increased, providing for the support for transcriptional relationships between CFTR deficiency and activity of NFB (26).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Recent studies of Schroeder et al.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	195	 (27) support the concept that the CFTR is required for regulation of NFB, serving as a pattern-associated molecular recognition molecule, following pulmonary exposure to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In that study, NFB activation and its nuclear trafficking were deficient in CF cells.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Taken together with the observation that IL-1-mediated transcription of CFTR gene transcription is dependent upon NFB, this important pathway mediating inflammation appears to be influenced by CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	198	In the present microarray analysis, CFTR deficiency was associated with increased claudin 8 and decreased gap junction connexin 37.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Decreased expression of gap junction proteins (Cx43, 40, -37, and -32) and decreased gap junction communication were observed in various in vitro cell systems after exposure to proinflammatory cytokines (28).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The observed changes in RNAs mediating cell adhesion and increased expression of IL-1 seen in the CFTR() mice are consistent with findings that in the absence of CFTR, IL-1 and TNF- failed to inhibit cell communication via gap junctions.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Previous studies demonstrated that CFTR is required for the uncoupling of gap functions between epithelial cells during inflammation, a process that may restrict the spread of pathogens or signaling among adjacent cells.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	202	 It will be of interest to test whether cell adhesion mediated by the claudins is also linked to the pathogenesis of CF.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	203	Changes in Protein Degradation Pathways-- Several genes involved in protein degradation were altered in the absence of CFTR compared with normal.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Proteosome 26 S subunit (PSMC3) is the major proteolytic component of the ubiquitin-dependent proteosome.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Proteosome 26 S regulates degradation of proteins influencing cell cycle, oncogenesis, transcription, and immunity, including CFTR itself (29, 30).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The proteosome is composed of two subcomplexes, the 20 S proteosome and PA700.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	207	 PSMC3 expression was modestly, but significantly increased (1.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	208	 In contrast, PA28 (PSME3), an activator of the 20 S proteosome, was decreased 1.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	209	 These observations are consistent with previous findings that proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF- or interferon- increased expression of the 26 S proteosome and its activators PA28  and  (31), whereas expression of PA28  was decreased by interferon- (32).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	210	 RNA encoding adaptor protein complex AP-2, 1 subunit (Ap2a1), a protein involved in the formation of intracellular transport vesicles was also decreased in the absence of CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	211	 CFTR co-precipitates with -adaptin (33).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Recent studies demonstrated that a C-terminal domain of CFTR binds to the AP-2 adaptor complex to form clathrin-coated vesicles that mediates CFTR internalization (34).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	213	 ADP-ribosylation factor 5 belongs to a family of GTP-binding proteins that play important roles in the control of membrane trafficking, including formation of secretory vesicles at the trans-Golgi network, endosomal and vesicle-plasma membrane fusion (35).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Recent studies support the concept that CFTR regulates endosomal fusion and vesicular trafficking (36, 37) indicating potential relationships between CFTR and the actions of ADP-ribosylation factor 5.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Another gene in this functional category is represented by kinesin3, an mRNA that was decreased in the lungs of CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	216	Transport Proteins Influenced by CFTR-- RNAs encoding several transmembrane transport proteins and receptors were also altered in the lungs of CFTR() mice, including solute carrier 38 (member 4), the potassium inwardly rectifying channel (Kir 4.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	217	2 or Kcnj 15), the glutamate receptor (Grin 2d), the naturietic peptide receptor 3 (Npr-3), and the 3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB-3).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Thus, expression of a number of membrane transport proteins was influenced by CFTR, perhaps representing compensatory responses to defects in CFTR-mediated transport activity.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	219	2 and Grin 2d RNAs were increased 2-3-fold in CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	220	2 is expressed in respiratory epithelial cells at sites similar to that of CFTR (38).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	221	2 regulates cation transport upon which chloride transport via CFTR or other chloride channels may be influenced.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Surprisingly, there is evidence for interactions between CFTR and Kir family members because they are both known to bind via PDZ binding domains through interactions with channel interacting PDZ domain protein (39).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Likewise, there is precedence for PDZ-dependent interactions among glutamate receptors, CFTR, and Kir family members (40).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Thus, the lack of CFTR enhanced the expression of a number of membrane proteins that may interact with CFTR via PDZ domains, perhaps indicating that CFTR-protein complexes may initiate changes in gene expression.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	225	 These findings support the concept that CFTR interacts with numerous membrane transport proteins and do not support a model in which activity of an alternative Cl transporter alone suffices to compensate for the lack of CFTR in pulmonary cells in the CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	226	Regulation of Cell Receptors by CFTR-- Natriuretic peptide receptor C (Npr-3 or NprC) was increased more than 2-fold in CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Natriuretic peptides comprise a family of 3 structurally related molecules: atrial (ANP), brain (BNP), and C-type (CNP) whose functions are cGMP-dependent (41, 42).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Among them, CNP increased ciliary beat, mucociliary clearance in airway epithelial cells, and activated CFTR-dependent chloride transport (42).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Natriuretic peptides regulate cytokine-stimulated NO production via the binding of Npr-3 (43).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Because deficient NO production was observed in respiratory epithelial cells of the iFABP-hCFTR, CFTR() mice, the increased expression of Npr-3 in CFTR() mice may represent a compensatory response influencing airway clearance and nitric oxide production via cGMP (44).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	231	 In contrast to the transport/receptors that were induced, ADRB3, a G protein-coupled transmembrane protein mediating cAMP production was decreased in CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	232	 ADRB3 is co-expressed with CFTR in airway epithelium (45) and may be functionally coupled to CFTR via cAMP-independent pathways (46).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	233	 2-Adrenergic receptors directly interact with CFTR via the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor to form a signal transduction complex (47).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Co-regulation of ADRB3 and CFTR may indicate that these proteins interact closely at both structural and functional levels, a finding that may be linked to the important role of -adrenergic stimulation and cAMP in the activation of chloride transport mediated by CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	235	Altered Expression of RNAs Encoding CFTR Interacting Proteins-- Surprisingly, analysis of the RNA influenced by CFTR identified a number of proteins that directly or indirectly interact with CFTR via protein-protein interactions.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	236	 This list included proteins involved in protein trafficking and degradation (proteosome 26 S and PA28 subunits and -adaptin), ion transport (Kcnj15 and Grin 2d), and receptors (Npr-3 and ADRB3).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Interaction of CFTR with many proteins occurs via PDZ binding domains that mediate protein-protein complex formation.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	238	 The finding that expression of CFTR interacting proteins is altered in the lungs of CFTR() mice, suggests that CFTR influences networks of signaling and transport activities in the cell and that cells respond to CFTR deficiency via transcriptional responses to CFTR-protein complexes, rather than to CFTR per se.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	239	Are Changes in Gene Expression Bystander Effects?-- Whereas genomic responses may compensate for the lack of CFTR mRNA and represent compensation for CFTR function, some responses may be secondary and mediated by pathways not directly related to the action of CFTR per se.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Alterations in cytokine production or changes in transcription factor activity caused by the absence of CFTR may secondarily change the behavior of numerous cell types, that may, in turn, contribute to the pathogenesis of CF lung disease by processes that are not direct functions of CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Because CFTR is known to form a membrane-associated cyclic nucleotide-activated Cl channel and interacts with numerous other cellular proteins, changes in gene expression may indicate that cells sense the CFTR protein, CFTR-dependent activity, or CFTR-protein complexes that initiate transcriptional responses related to or unrelated to CFTR function.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	242	 At present, it is unclear whether the "sensor" is chloride ion, the presence of CFTR, or CFTR-protein complexes in intracellular and membrane compartments or to other functions of CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Likewise, the hierarchy and interrelatedness of the networks of RNA responses to CFTR deficiency remain to be unraveled.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	244	Maintenance of pulmonary homeostasis in the mCFTR() mouse was associated with complex adaptive responses in gene expression.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	245	 CFTR influenced RNAs encoding transcription factors, ion channels, membrane receptors, cytokines, and intracellular trafficking proteins.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Finally, CFTR altered the expression of a number of proteins that interact with CFTR via protein-protein interactions perhaps representing transcriptional responses to functions mediated by CFTR() protein complexes (Fig.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The diversity of genes whose expression was altered by CFTR support the concept that, in addition to regulation of Cl transport, CFTR plays diverse roles in multiple cellular functions.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	248	 The present findings support the hypothesis that pulmonary homeostasis in the CFTR() mouse is maintained by complex genomic responses to the lack of CFTR rather than by the action of a single alternative Cl channel.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Finally, the genes and pathways identified in this study provide new links between CFTR and cellular processes that may influence the pathogenesis of CF lung disease.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, October 23, 2001, and in revised form, November 12, 2001.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	4	Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)1 (1-3).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	5	 CFTR is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel and channel regulator (4) that mediates salt and water balance in a number of tissues, including the airways, intestines, pancreatic and sweat ducts, and kidney tubules (5).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In many polarized epithelial tissues, CFTR functions in the apical cell membrane but in the sweat duct CFTR is localized to both the apical and basolateral cell membranes.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Because a common mutation in CFTR, F508, is degraded through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated processes, many studies have focused on the trafficking of CFTR through this compartment (6).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Much less attention has been devoted to how CFTR is processed through the post-ER pathways.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	9	We reported previously that the polarization of CFTR in the apical membrane of human airway and kidney epithelial cells is altered in CFTR mutants lacking the C-terminal domain (7, 8).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These data suggested that the C-terminal domain plays a role either in the trafficking to and/or stability within the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The last three amino acids of CFTR (Thr-Arg-Leu) comprise a consensus sequence known to bind to PDZ domain proteins, a family of proteins containing a 80- to 90-amino acid motif that binds to the C terminus of a variety of ion channels and receptors (9-11).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	12	At least two PDZ domain-containing proteins, Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor, NHE-RF (also called EBP50), and the CFTR-associated protein CAP70 are known to bind to the terminal amino acids of CFTR (12, 13).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	13	 NHE-RF is a submembranous phosphoprotein that regulates the apical membrane Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 (14).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Because NHE-RF associates with ezrin, which itself binds to the regulatory subunit of PKA (15), it was hypothesized that NHE-RF anchors CFTR to the cytoskeleton at a subapical compartment targeting protein kinase A near CFTR (12).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	15	 E3KARP, an NHE-RF-related protein, was also shown to interact with CFTR (16, 17).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	16	 CAP70, a subapical protein with four PDZ domains, binds to at least two CFTR molecules simultaneously via PDZ3 and PDZ4 (18).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	17	 CAP70 and NHE-RF enhance CFTR Cl channel activity in excised patches probably by cross-linking CFTR dimers (18, 19).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	18	 NHE-RF, E3KARP, and CAP70 are localized to subplasma membrane regions reflecting their proposed roles in anchoring and/or regulating CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	19	Although there is growing evidence of a functional interaction between CFTR and PDZ domain proteins at the plasma membrane, little is known about whether PDZ domain proteins play a role in intracellular trafficking of CFTR along the ER, the Golgi, and the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The post-ER secretory pathway involved in the trafficking of wild type and mutant CFTR to the plasma membrane is poorly characterized.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	21	 A recent study has demonstrated that CFTR has an unusually low distribution in cis-Golgi compartments compared with most membrane proteins (20), raising the possibility that CFTR may utilize novel modes of anterograde and retrograde trafficking mechanisms.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	22	Two-hybrid Screening and Cloning of CAL-- Yeast two-hybrid screening was used to identify proteins that interact with the C terminus of CFTR (21).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The bait consisted of the C-terminal 51 amino acids of rat CFTR (aa 1428-1478 of rCFTR), amplified by PCR from a rat lung MATCHMAKER cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The PCR products were subcloned into the BamHI/PstI sites of a pAS2-1 vector, in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Because truncation of C-terminal CFTR residues (TRL) abolishes the binding (Fig.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	215	To confirm that the C terminus of CFTR was involved in the interaction, we immobilized biotinylated peptides corresponding to the C-terminal 8 and 24 residues of CFTR on NeutrAvidin beads and incubated the peptides with whole cell lysates prepared from 16HBE14o cells.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The bound fractions were examined by Western blot using CAL antisera.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Because the last 8 residues of CFTR bind to CAL, the interaction is likely to be direct and not mediated through other proteins.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	220	To test whether CAL is present in a complex with CFTR in vivo, CFTR was immunoprecipitated from T84 cell lysates using an R-domain antibody from Genzyme and the precipitated fraction was analyzed by Western blotting using CAL antibody.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	349	 To understand how PDZ domain proteins may work together in regulating CFTR trafficking and membrane organization, we examined the effect of overexpressing NHE-RF alone and co-expressing NHE-RF and CAL on CFTR cell surface expression.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Whereas CAL overexpression inhibited CFTR currents (Fig.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	355	 It has been shown that NHE-RF under certain conditions can enhance the open probability of CFTR in excised patches, but this stimulation was diminished when expression of NHE-RF was high (19).

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	358	 Clearly, the effect of NHE-RF on restoring CFTR currents in cells overexpressing CAL parallels the restoration of CFTR in the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	359	We identified a Golgi CFTR-interacting protein, CAL, that plays a role in regulating the plasma membrane expression of CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	360	 CAL is the first PDZ domain protein identified that regulates the trafficking of CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	361	 Biochemical evidence suggests that CAL can exist as a multimer that is mediated by domains in the N-terminal region.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	362	 CAL can form clusters of CFTR within the cell when overexpressed, suggesting that multimers of CAL may tether more than one CFTR within the cell as a mechanism to regulate export to the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	363	 This is consistent with data that overexpression of CAL suppresses CFTR expression at the cell surface.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	364	 In contrast to its effect on CFTR, CAL does not affect VSVG surface expression (see Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	365	 8C) or of P-glycoprotein expression, proteins that sort to the plasma membrane but do not have C-terminal PDZ interacting domains.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	366	 CAL also does not affect surface expression of CFTRTRL, eliminating the possibility that the inhibition of surface expression is due simply to the nonspecific effect of protein overexpression.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	367	 Thus, the role of CAL is restricted to proteins such as CFTR with C-terminal, PDZ domains capable of binding CAL.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	368	 Given the wide distribution of CAL in many tissues, it is likely that CAL can regulate the surface expression of molecules other than CFTR as long as they have a C-terminal domain capable of binding to CAL.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	369	 Although CAL is located primarily located within the Golgi, it is also found at the plasma membrane where it may also function (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	370	CAL contains two putative coiled-coil domains that play a role in membrane association.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	371	 Coiled-coil domains are found in SNARE proteins and a large number of Golgi resident proteins.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Recently, it has been shown that CAL can bind to the Q-SNARE protein syntaxin 6, a protein whose primary function is unknown (31).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	373	 It is likely that the coiled-coil domains of CAL may mediate interactions with multiple Golgi proteins.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	374	CAL overexpression also reduces the rate of appearance of CFTR in the plasma membrane suggesting that CAL may reduce the anterograde trafficking of CFTR to the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	375	 CAL also reduces the half-life of CFTR in the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	376	 There are at least two possible scenarios to explain how CAL may interact with CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	377	 First, CAL may be part of an anterograde trafficking complex that controls CFTR movement from ER to Golgi and to the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	378	 CAL with two coiled-coil domains may tether CFTR to the Golgi as a requisite step in moving CFTR to the cell surface.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	379	 The overexpression of CAL may disrupt the stoichiometry of such an anterograde trafficking complex and favor retention of the CAL CFTR complex in the Golgi.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	380	 Second, CAL may also regulate the retrograde trafficking of CFTR from the Golgi to ER and perhaps promote the recycling of CFTR to the ER for degradation.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	381	 Thus CAL, like the PDZ protein GRASP 55/65, may play a role in vesicle budding and cargo selection in ER to Golgi and Golgi to membrane transport (35, 36).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	382	 8a, overexpression of CAL enhances the ER-localized, immature, and core-glycosylated form of CFTR (band B), which is localized to the ER.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	383	If the role of CAL is to tether CFTR to the Golgi, then what promotes CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane? Clearly, the majority of CAL is located within the Golgi, yet some is also found near the plasma membrane (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	384	 Also, membrane-biotinylated CFTR can be co-immunoprecipitated with CAL (data not shown) indicating that some CAL CFTR complexes do travel to the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	385	 Unlike CAL, other PDZ domain proteins such as NHE-RF and E3KARP are associated with the plasma membrane (12), suggesting that they play a key role in the function of CFTR at the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Our data show that, when CAL is overexpressed, CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane is reduced but that suppression can be reversed by NHE-RF.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	387	 We hypothesize that, because CAL is more abundant in the Golgi, binding of CFTR to CAL may be favored.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	388	 As a CAL CFTR complex traffics to the plasma membrane where NHE-RF is abundant, CFTR may then bind to NHE-RF, which tethers CFTR to the actin-based cytoskeleton.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	389	 This tethering of CFTR to the plasma membrane increases the half-life of CFTR in the plasma membrane resulting in the apical polarization of CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	390	2 Overexpression of CAL increases its expression both in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane (data not shown), shifting the stoichiometry of the interaction of the CFTR with NHE-RF toward CAL and decreasing the half-life of CFTR in the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	391	 Our data answer a critical question as to why more than one PDZ domain protein interacts with CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	392	 At least for CAL and NHE-RF, we show that both are concentrated in different locations within the cell and only transiently interact, most likely within the plasma membrane, to regulate the surface expression of CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	393	 Thus, this regulation by two or more PDZ domain proteins may allow for the precise regulation of CFTR surface expression.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	394	Other membrane proteins are found to bind to multiple PDZ domain proteins.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	395	 For example, the C termini of the GluR2/3 subunits of AMPA receptors bind to both GRIP/ABP, which contains 7 PDZ domains (37), and to PICK1, which contains a single PDZ domain as well as a domain that interacts with protein kinase C (38).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	396	 Phosphorylation of the C terminus of GluR2 by protein kinase C prevents its binding to GRIP but not to PICK1, which may contribute to the protein kinase C-induced rapid internalization of surface GluR2 subunits (39).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	397	 Likewise, the C terminus of the 1-adrenergic receptor binds to a pair of PDZ proteins, PSD-95 and MAGI-2 (40, 41).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	398	 Although the agonist-induced internalization of the 1-adrenergic receptor is attenuated by PSD-95 co-expression, it is markedly increased by co-expression with MAGI-2 (41).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	399	 These reports, as well as our present findings, support the notion that multiple PDZ domain proteins interact with the same short C terminus of a membrane protein to regulate its function.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	400	The precise mechanism of how CAL may hand off CFTR to NHE-RF remains unknown.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	401	 It is not clear whether it is driven strictly by mass balance, by affinity, or by a combination of these two.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	402	 In our co-expression system, NHE-RF expression is ~4.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	403	 Under these conditions, NHE-RF may sufficiently compete with CAL for CFTR binding strictly by mass action.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	404	 Immunofluorescence localization studies suggested that CFTR is present in both the apical membrane and in the subapical vesicles (42).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	405	 These findings were confirmed by cryoimmunogold electron microscopy (43).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	406	 The translocation of CFTR from the intracellular pool to the plasma membrane may be regulated by protein kinase A as observed by some investigators (44, 45) but not by others (23, 46).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	407	 It is possible that CAL may pass CFTR off to NHE-RF in the subapical vesicles.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	408	 If so, it is important to determine the endogenous levels of CAL, NHE-RF and other CFTR binding proteins in these locations, as well as their relative affinity to CFTR in native tissues that express CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	409	 It is likely that these data, together with their regulation by protein kinase A and/or other physiological and pathophysiological stimuli, will provide a more comprehensive understanding of CFTR trafficking and its regulation in different native tissues.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	5	In cell-attached membrane patch recordings, the single-channel current-voltage (I-V) relationship of CFTR outwardly rectifies (Berger et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	6	 (1991) attributed this outward rectification to Goldman-type rectification caused by the Cl- concentration gradient.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, subsequent studies have offered alternative explanations.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	8	 (1993) proposed that rectification is a function of the concentration and permeability of anions within the cell.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Second, Fischer and Machen (1994) attributed rectification to high frequency gating of the CFTR Cl- channel at negative voltages.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Third, studies by a number of investigators have demonstrated that large anions cause a voltage-dependent block of the CFTR Cl- channel when they are present in the intracellular solution (McDonough et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	11	, 1994; Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1996; Sheppard and Robinson, 1997; Zhou et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	12	 These anions bind within a deep wide vestibule at the intracellular end of the CFTR pore to prevent Cl- permeation (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1996; Sheppard and Robinson, 1997; Hwang and Sheppard, 1999; Zhou et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This block of the CFTR Cl- channel by large intracellular anions is reminiscent of the effect of intracellular cations on inward-rectifier K+ channels (Kir channels; Hille, 2001).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Inward rectification of these K+ channels is caused by voltage-dependent block by Mg2+ and polyamines found in the cytoplasm of the cell (Vandenberg, 1987; Lopatin et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Thus, as first proposed by Tabcharani et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	16	 (1991), the outward rectification of CFTR Cl- channels observed in cell-attached membrane patches is likely caused by voltage-dependent block by large anions found in the cytoplasm of the cell (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998a, 1999).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	17	When inside-out membrane patches excised from cells expressing wild-type human CFTR are bathed in symmetrical Cl--rich solutions, the single-channel I-V relationship of CFTR is linear (e.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	18	 However, we previously observed inward rectification of wild-type CFTR Cl- currents in excised membrane patches from C127 cells expressing wild-type human CFTR (Lansdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	19	, 2000; Cai and Sheppard, 2002).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	20	 At negative voltages, the I-V relationship was linear, whereas at positive voltages, the I-V relationship exhibited inward rectification that was most marked at voltages above +50 mV (Lansdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	21	, 2000; Cai and Sheppard, 2002).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Using excised membrane patches from baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing wild-type human CFTR, Linsdell and colleagues observed similar results in some studies (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1999; Linsdell and Gong, 2002), but not in others (e.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	23	, 1998; Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998b).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	24	 (1996) reported inward rectification of CFTR Cl- channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In this study, we investigate the mechanism of inward rectification of the CFTR Cl- channel.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	71	 In brief, digitized current records generated by pCLAMP software were imported with no further filtering and baseline corrected (program PRE).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Using a recursive Viterbi algorithm (program SKM), idealized currents were produced.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Finally, rate constants for kinetic models were calculated from the idealized current dwell time sequence using a maximum likelihood approach (program MIL).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	74	 For consistency with analyses using pCLAMP software, transitions  < 1 ms were excluded.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	75	To investigate the voltage dependence of rate constants, we first calculated rate constants at equivalent positive and negative voltages from individual membrane patches.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	269	 We attribute this subtle effect of voltage on Po to the changes in mean burst duration and interburst interval counterbalancing each other.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	270	To understand better the voltage dependence of CFTR channel gating, we calculated rate constants for both kinetic schemes at -50, -20, +20, and +50 mV and fitted the data using the single exponential function k=k0Pexp (Eq.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	289	 We were especially interested in the effects of PPi on the voltage dependence of CFTR channel gating, because PPi abolished the asymmetric permeability of CFTR to large organic anions (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998b).

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	332	 10 D compares the Po of human and murine CFTR at negative and positive voltages.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	333	 These data demonstrate two important differences between human and murine CFTR: first, the Po of the full open state of murine CFTR is much reduced compared with that of human CFTR (Fig.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Second, the Po of murine CFTR is greatly decreased at positive voltages, whereas that of human CFTR is little changed (Fig.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	335	 For murine CFTR, the Po value at +80 mV decreased by 49  plus or minus  10% (n = 10) when compared with that at -80 mV (P  <  0.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	336	 In contrast, for human CFTR, the Po value at +75 mV was decreased by only 5  plus or minus  1% (n = 6) when compared with that at -75 mV (P  <  0.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	337	 Thus, these single-channel data suggest that inward rectification of murine CFTR is stronger than that of the human CFTR Cl- channel.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	338	In principal, inward rectification of the CFTR Cl- channel might either result from channel block by a soluble factor or be an intrinsic property of the CFTR channel protein.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	339	 Studies of other ion channels provide strong support for both hypotheses.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	340	 For example, the inward rectification of Kir channels, NMDA receptors, and cyclic nucleotide to gated channels is caused by voltage-dependent block of outward current flow by extrinsic cations.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	341	 In the case of Kir channels the blocking cations are intracellular Mg2+ and polyamines (Vandenberg, 1987; Lopatin et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	342	, 1994), whereas for NMDA receptors and cyclic nucleotide to gated channels the blocking cations are extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Nowak et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	343	, 1984; Zimmerman and Baylor, 1986).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	344	 In contrast, inward rectification of KAT1, an inward-rectifier K+ channel from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, results from an intrinsic gating mechanism (Zei and Aldrich, 1998).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	345	 Like voltage-gated K+ channels (Hille, 2001), KAT1 possesses a voltage-sensor, the S4 segment that uses the energy of voltage to control channel gating (Zei and Aldrich, 1998).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	346	Several lines of evidence suggest that channel block is not likely to account for inward rectification of the CFTR Cl- channel in excised inside-out membrane patches.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	347	 First, changes in the composition of the intra- and extracellular solutions did not abolish inward rectification (for data and discussion, see the online supplemental material, available at http://www.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Second, inward rectification has been observed using cells expressing either native or recombinant wild-type human CFTR (e.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	349	, Quinton and Reddy, 2000; Lansdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	350	, 2000; Linsdell and Gong, 2002; this study), indicating that inward rectification is independent of the expression system used to investigate CFTR.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	351	 Third, inward rectification of CFTR Cl- channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers was unaffected by changes in the composition of the lipid bilayer (Zhao et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	352	, 1996), suggesting that the surface charge of the membrane lipid does not affect inward rectification.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	353	 Fourth, the effects of voltage on the function of the murine CFTR Cl- channel (present study) indicate that inward rectification is a common characteristic of human and murine CFTR.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	354	 Fifth, mutation of several residues within the MSDs alters the shape of the I-V relationship of CFTR.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	355	 Inward rectification of CFTR Cl- currents is accentuated by mutation of R334, T338, T339, and S341 (sixth transmembrane segment (M6); Gong and Linsdell, 2003; Linsdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	356	, 2002), S1118 (M11; Zhang et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	357	, 2000), and T1134 and N1138 (M12; Gupta et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	358	 In contrast, mutation of V317 (M5; Zhang et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	359	, 2002) causes outward rectification of CFTR Cl- currents.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	360	 Based on these data, we speculate that inward rectification is an intrinsic property of the CFTR Cl- channel.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	361	 Because ADP and PPi, two agents that interact with the NBDs, are without effect on inward rectification and because site-directed mutations in the MSDs enhance inward rectification, we propose that the CFTR pore determines this property of the CFTR Cl- channel.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	362	For the CFTR pore, itself, to be responsible for inward rectification, the architecture of the pore should facilitate the flow of Cl- from the intra- to the extracellular side of the membrane, but hinder Cl- flow in the opposite direction.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	363	 To transport ions at maximal translocation rates, ion channels have evolved charged lined vestibules that concentrate and funnel ions toward the selectivity filter (Green and Andersen, 1991; Dutzler et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	364	 Based on these considerations, inward rectification of current flow through the CFTR pore might be achieved by asymmetries in the geometry of the intra- and extracellular vestibules, differences in the distribution of Cl--binding sites between the two vestibules or a combination of these factors.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	365	Evidence for asymmetries in the topology of the intra- and extracellular vestibules is provided by studies of anion permeation and channel block.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	366	 Anion permeation studies indicate that the narrowest part of the CFTR pore is 0.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	367	60 nm in diameter (Cheung and Akabas, 1996; Linsdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	368	, 1997), widening under certain circumstances to a diameter of 1.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	369	3 nm (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998b).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	370	 This constriction, which likely represents the selectivity filter, occurs in the region of F337 and T338 in M6 because mutation of these residues altered dramatically the anion permeability sequence of CFTR, whereas mutation of other residues in M6 had less marked effects on anion permeation (Linsdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	371	, 1998, 2000; McCarty and Zhang, 2001; Gong et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	372	, 2002; Gupta and Linsdell, 2003).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	373	 On the intra- and extracellular sides of this constriction, the pore enlarges.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	374	 The voltage dependence of channel block by large organic anions suggests that the CFTR pore contains a wide intracellular vestibule that funnels blocking anions deep into the pore where they bind, occlude the pore, and block Cl- permeation (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1996; Sheppard and Robinson, 1997; Hwang and Sheppard, 1999; Zhou et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	375	 Less is known about the topology of the extracellular end of the CFTR pore.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	376	 Based on the ability of methanethiosulphonate reagents in the extracellular solution to react with M6 residues toward the cytosolic side of the membrane (Cheung and Akabas, 1996), there might also be a wide extracellular vestibule.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	377	 However, the inability of open-channel blockers to reach their binding sites when added to the extracellular solution and the short length of extracellular loops 3 and 6 led McCarty (2000) to propose that CFTR has a small extracellular vestibule.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	378	 Consistent with this idea, Linsdell and Hanrahan (1998a)(b) demonstrated that CFTR exhibits an asymmetric permeability to large organic anions (e.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	379	, galacturonate, glutathione, and lactobionate).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	380	 During the normal gating cycle, flow of large organic anions through the CFTR pore is only permitted in the intra- to extracellular direction (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998a,b).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	381	The sixth transmembrane segment plays a crucial role in determining the pore properties of CFTR (Sheppard and Welsh, 1999; McCarty, 2000; Gong et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	382	 Within M6, the residues R334 (Smith et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	383	, 2001; Gong and Linsdell, 2003), K335 (Anderson et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	384	, 2002), and possibly R352 (Guinamard and Akabas, 1999; Gong et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	385	, 2002) contribute to Cl--binding sites.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Assuming that the narrowest part of the CFTR pore occurs in the region of F337 and T338 (see above and Linsdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	387	, 1998, 2000; McCarty and Zhang, 2001; Gong et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	388	, 2002; Gupta and Linsdell, 2003), the data suggest that three Cl--binding sites (S341, I344, and R352) might be located in a spacious intracellular vestibule, whereas two Cl--binding sites (R334 and K335) might be located in a more confined extracellular vestibule.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	389	 This simple model suggests that current flow through the CFTR pore might inwardly rectify.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	390	 However, an important caveat of this model is that present knowledge of the mechanism of anion permeation by the CFTR Cl- channel is incomplete and it is quite likely that residues in other transmembrane segments contribute to Cl--binding sites.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	391	 Nevertheless, asymmetries in the size of the intra- and extracellular vestibules and/or the distribution of Cl--binding sites within the CFTR pore are plausible explanations for the inward rectification of CFTR Cl- currents.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	392	Besides the architecture of the CFTR pore, voltage-dependent gating might make some contribution to the observed inward rectification of current flow through the CFTR Cl- channel.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	393	 Work by other investigators and ourselves demonstrate that CFTR channel gating exhibits voltage dependence despite the lack of a marked effect of voltage on Po.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	394	 First, using cell-attached membrane patches from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing wild-type human CFTR, Fischer and Machen (1994) demonstrated that slow (ATP dependent) gating is voltage independent, whereas fast (flickery intraburst) gating is voltage dependent, becoming the dominant gating mode at strong negative voltages.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	395	 Second, using excised membrane patches from Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type human CFTR, Zhang et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	396	 (2002) demonstrated that burst duration increases at negative voltages, whereas interburst interval is unaffected by voltage.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	397	 Third, to investigate the flickery closures that interrupt bursts of channel openings, Zhou et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	398	 (2001) analyzed the gating kinetics of the CFTR variant K1250A whose prolonged openings facilitate the discrimination of fast and slow gating events.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	399	 (2001) found that the rate of transition from the short-lived closed state to the open state exhibits voltage dependence and is sensitive to permeant anions in the extracellular solution, suggesting that brief flickery closures represent the voltage-dependent occupancy of an anion-binding site within the CFTR pore by unknown intracellular anions.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	400	To elucidate the effects of voltage on CFTR channel gating, we adopted a different strategy to other investigators.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	401	 We employed kinetic modeling to analyze the gating behavior of single wild-type human CFTR Cl- channels in excised membrane patches bathed in symmetrical Cl--rich solutions at 37 degrees C and lightly filtered our data.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	402	 Using this approach, we determined the effect of voltage on both fast and slow gating events.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	403	 Our data indicate that voltage has significant effects on CFTR channel gating.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	404	 Membrane depolarization decreased both the duration of bursts and the interburst interval, but increased the duration of gaps within bursts.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	405	 However, because the voltage dependencies of the different rate constants were in opposite directions, Po was largely unaffected by voltage.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	406	 The voltage independence of Po and the lack of effect of ADP and PPi on the inward rectification of CFTR Cl- currents argue that changes in CFTR channel gating do not contribute to the rectification of macroscopic CFTR Cl- currents.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	407	 However, other data suggest the contrary.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	408	 First, the predicted CFTR Cl- current (N x i x Po) at +100 mV, which is accounted for by reductions in both i and Po, agrees closely with the measured CFTR Cl- current at this voltage.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	409	 Second, the Po of murine CFTR is decreased markedly at positive voltages.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	410	 Third, comparison of the data of Smith et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	411	 (2001) and Gong and Linsdell (2003) suggests that the strong inward rectification of the CFTR variant R334C is not accounted for by voltage-dependent changes in i.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	412	 Based on these data, we argue that voltage-dependent changes in CFTR channel gating contribute to the inward rectification of macroscopic CFTR Cl- currents.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	413	Our data indicate that the total equivalent gating charge for CFTR is only 0.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	414	 The small size of the gating charge of CFTR is consistent with the lack of marked voltage dependence of CFTR channel gating.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	415	 The data suggest that residues with charged and uncharged polar side chains move only a very small distance within the transmembrane electric field.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	416	 These residues might be located either along the full-length of the CFTR pore or restricted to a specific region of the permeation pathway.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	417	 Alternatively, linear three-state kinetic schemes might be too simple to describe the voltage dependence of CFTR channel gating.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	418	 Because the total equivalent gating charge of CFTR is comparable to the amount of charge movement intrinsic to the voltage-dependent Cl- channel ClC-0 (Chen and Miller, 1996), we favor the former idea.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	419	 The amino acid sequence of ClC-0 lacks a motif equivalent to the S4 segment, the voltage sensor of voltage-gated cation channels (Hille, 2001).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	420	 Instead, permeant anions in the extracellular solution act as the source of the gating charge (Pusch et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	421	 The binding of Cl- ions to a Cl--binding site located at the extracellular end of the ClC-0 pore causes a conformational change that precedes channel opening and inward Cl- flow (Chen and Miller, 1996).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	422	 Because bound Cl- ions traverse the transmembrane electric field, gating is both voltage and Cl- concentration dependent (Pusch et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	423	 Excitingly, the structural basis of this gating mechanism has been elucidated following the determination of high-resolution crystal structures of bacterial CLC proteins (Dutzler et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	424	 In these bacterial CLC channels, the Cl--binding site closest to the extracellular end of the selectivity filter is gated by the carboxyl group of glutamate (E)148 that protrudes into the CLC channel pore: when the carboxyl group of E148 is bound to the Cl--binding site the pore is closed, but when a Cl- ion binds the pore opens to allow Cl- permeation (Dutzler et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	425	The regulation of CLC channel gating by localized motions of an amino acid side chain (Dutzler et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	426	, 2003) raises the question as to whether a similar mechanism might operate in the CFTR Cl- channel.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	427	 However, anion permeation through the CFTR pore is tightly linked to the function of the NBDs that power channel gating.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	428	 (2003) recently demonstrated that glutathione permeation through the CFTR pore is controlled by ATP binding rather than ATP binding and hydrolysis as in the case of Cl- permeation.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	429	 These data suggest that global conformation changes in the structure of the CFTR protein control Cl- permeation, not local changes in the orientation of amino acid side-chains.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	430	 If this idea were correct, it would suggest that CFTR channel gating shares similarities with activation gating in K+ channels that involves the reorientation of transmembrane -helices (Jiang et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	431	 Future studies should test this possibility.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	435	 For example, at -100 mV basal current was -0.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	436	20 pA and at +100 mV basal current was 2.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	437	 When basal currents were subtracted from those recorded in the presence of ATP (1 mM) + PKA (75 nM), the outward rectification of basal current accounted for 6  plus or minus  2% (n = 10) of the inward rectification of CFTR Cl- current at +100 mV.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	438	2 In contrast to analyses of rate constant values at  plus or minus 75 mV using Student's paired t test, some analyses of rate constant data over the range -75 to +75 mV using one-way ANOVAs failed to achieve statistical significance.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	439	 We attribute this difference to the fact that paired data were used for analyses using Student's paired t test, but pooled data were used for one-way ANOVAs.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	7	 For example, CFTR interacts with several proteins containing PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domains.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Most of these proteins are localized in a subplasma membrane region (Short et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	9	, 2001), and one was found in the Golgi apparatus (Cheng et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Interactions were also detected between CFTR and proteins involved in the intracellular vesicle trafficking.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Notably, the C-terminus of CFTR binds to the endocytic clathrin adaptator complex AP-2 (Weixel and Bradbury, 2000), presumably during the internalization of CFTR from the plasma membrane.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Several studies are now focusing on the relationships between CFTR and proteins of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) family.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These proteins are involved in the membrane fusion events happening during the different steps of vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells (reviewed by Chen and Scheller, 2001).
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	14	Syntaxins belong to a subfamily of the t-SNAREs, whose C-terminal half contains the t-SNARE homology domain (Weimbs et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	15	, 1997) followed by a short hydrophobic tail that anchors the protein in its resident membrane.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The region of syntaxins upstream of this transmembrane domain protrudes at the cytoplasmic side of vesicle or plasma membrane.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Remarkably, a direct interaction between the SNARE homology domain of syntaxin 1A and the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CFTR is thought to be responsible for inhibiting CFTR chloride channel activity (Naren et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	18	We have previously described the cloning of human syntaxin 8 cDNA (STX8 gene), using the R domain of CFTR as a bait in the two-hybrid screening of a human fetal lung library (Thoreau et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Subsequently, syntaxin 8 has been localized in different endosomal compartments: it has been involved in trafficking from early endosome (EE) to late endosome (LE), or in homotypic fusion events in LE (Prekeris et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In the present study, we establish that syntaxin 8 overexpression inhibits CFTR channel activity and trafficking to the plasma membrane.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	21	 A direct regulation can also be suggested as we show evidence for the existence of a physical interaction between CFTR and syntaxin 8, either directly or within a protein complex.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Thus, we propose that syntaxin 8 is a member of the CFTR interaction network.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Our results strengthen the idea that the SNARE machinery directly regulates CFTR trafficking and activity.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	186	 GFP-CFTR is known to be functional and the GFP tag does not affect its trafficking and localization (Moyer et al.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Immunofluorescence study showed that in both cases (endogenous or overexpressed), syntaxin 8 was concentrated in a structure close to nuclear envelope, and a cytoplasm punctuated staining indicated the presence of syntaxin 8 in vesicle-like structures.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	209	Control experiments using Syn8TM exhibited a large cytosolic staining that clearly differed from the wild-type syntaxin 8 immunostaining pattern.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Cells overexpressing Syn8TM presented a plasma membrane staining of GFP-CFTR in focal planes (Fig.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	212	 5F), with an intensity level comparable to GFP-CFTR overexpressing cells.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	213	 This result evidenced that double transfection did not affect the expression level of exogenous proteins such Syn8TM or GFP-CFTR as compared with cells transfected with only one of these cDNAs.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Thus, we could discount the possibility that the syntaxin 8 inhibitory effect on CFTR trafficking was simply due to an excess of protein biosynthesis in the cell.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	215	Cells overexpressing wild-type syntaxin 8 exhibited a colocalization with GFP-CFTR only in the juxtanuclear region (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	216	 However, accumulation of GFP-CFTR or syntaxin 8 in this region did not seem to be linked to the coexpression of both proteins, as GFP-CFTR or syntaxin 8 alone also had a strong staining of this organelle near the nucleus.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	217	 In the cytoplasm, syntaxin 8 often appeared as dot-like structures corresponding presumably to endosome/lysosome structures, whereas GFP-CFTR appeared more homogenous in the entire cytosol.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	218	 So, apart from juxtanuclear organelles, wild-type syntaxin 8 and GFP-CFTR did not seem to be colocalized in the distal part of cytosol.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	219	 By contrast, the Syn8TM immunostaining pattern colocalized with GFP-CFTR not only in the juxtanuclear area but also in a large part of the cytosol.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	223	 We compared the intracellular localization of both proteins in COS-7 cells cotransfected with GFP-CFTR and Syn8 (A) or by GFP-CFTR and Syn8TM (B).
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Overexpressed (Aa) syntaxin 8 shows a predominantly perinuclear staining and also appears in a cytoplasm punctuated pattern.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	227	These results showed that overexpressing wild-type syntaxin 8, which is anchored on the vesicle membrane, disturbed CFTR trafficking, whereas cytosoluble syntaxin 8 had no or little effect on CFTR plasma membrane localization.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	228	 As a control, we analyzed the distribution of a plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoform (NCX2) (Li et al.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	230	 As expected, the surface localization of NCX2 in COS-7 cells was not affected by syntaxin 8 overexpression (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	231	GFP-CFTR and syntaxin 8 colocalize and are accumulated in recycling endosomes (RE) in COS-7 transfected cells To identify the subcellular compartments in which GFP-CFTR and syntaxin 8 colocalize, we performed immunofluorescence studies with three well characterized markers of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments on wild-type and doubly transfected COS-7 cells.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	232	 As expected, cells overexpressing GFP-CFTR and syntaxin 8 exhibited a strong staining for both proteins in a juxtanuclear area, a compartment where the two proteins highly colocalize (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Each fluorogram showed that most syntaxin 8 and CFTR fluorescent plots were placed on the bisector line (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	234	 This indicated a high degree of colocalization of both proteins.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	235	 In each immunostaining experiment, the highest intensity of merged fluorescence corresponded to the juxtanuclear region (data not shown).
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Syntaxin 8 immunostaining, whether using the rabbit polyclonal antibody (Fig.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	238	 7Ca), gave a classical tubular/vesicular-like pattern.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	239	 GFP-CFTR, as described above, was not localized on plasma membrane but on punctuated and tubular-like structures in the cytosol, and a strong signal was seen on the juxtanuclear area (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Lamp-1 (an LE/lysosomal marker) staining was observed as a strong vesicular and perinuclear pattern (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	241	 7Ac), but its distribution did not colocalize with Syn8 and GFP-CFTR cellular staining (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	242	 These data were confirmed by fluorograms showing that Lamp-1 fluorescence distribution was clearly separated from CFTR and Syn8 fluorescences (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	243	 By contrast, TfR immunostaining (endocytosis-recycling pathway) revealed a dot-like vesicular pattern more extensive in the cytosol than Lamp-1 staining (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Intracellular distribution between TfR and CFTR on the one hand (noted TfR/CFTR) and between TfR and Syn8 on the other hand (noted TfR/Syn8) was mostly in distinct compartments within the cell (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	245	 These results were supported by data from fluorograms, which showed two distinct fluorescences in each case.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Several plots with high intensity of overlapping fluorescence suggested a colocalization between TfR and CFTR on the one hand, and between TfR and Syn8 on the other, in vesicular structures near the nucleus (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	247	 When we compared the TfR/CFTR and TfR/Syn8 vesicular pattern in this region (insert), we observed many similarities suggesting that TfR, CFTR and Syn8 were present in the same vesicles.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	248	 As the juxtanuclear colocalization between CFTR and Syn8 partially matched to TfR localization, we could identify these vesicles as recycling or post-Golgi endosomes.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	249	 To test our hypothesis, we have used a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Rab11, a protein that has been found associated with trans-Golgi network (TGN) membranes, post-Golgi vesicles and recycling endosomes (Urbe et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	250	 In COS-7 cells, endogenous Rab11 displayed a punctuated vesicular pattern scattered throughout the cytoplasm and seemed to accumulate in a tubulo-vesicular structure near the nucleus (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	251	 In wild-type cells, a partial colocalization was found between Rab11 and TfR stainings (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	252	 7Db), but no overlap was detected between Rab11 and Lamp-1 stainings (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Finally, in COS-7 cells transfected with GFP-CFTR and Syn8, the Rab11 immunostaining profile matched exactly with CFTR and Syn8 stainings (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	254	 These results were sustained by fluorogram data showing Rab11/Syn8 and Rab11/CFTR fluorescent plots only on bisector line (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	255	 This clearly showed that these proteins had the same localization.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	256	 In conclusion, when syntaxin 8 inhibits CFTR trafficking in COS-7 transfected cells, CFTR appears to be restricted to a compartment including at least the recycling endosomes and possibly other post-Golgi vesicles.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	259	 In each experiment (except D), COS-7 cells were cotransfected with GFP-CFTR and Syn8, then costained with anti-syntaxin 8 antibody and anti-Lamp-1 (A), anti-TfR (B) or anti-Rab11 (C) antibodies.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Syntaxin 8 (a in A-C) and GFP-CFTR (b in A-C) exhibit perinuclear staining as expected.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	264	 These two proteins colocalize in the perinuclear region as shown in the merged images (d in A-C) and fluorograms (e in A-C).
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Lamp-1 immunostaining pattern (Ac) exhibits no colocalization with GFP-CFTR and syntaxin 8 both on merged image (Ad) and fluorograms (Af,g), whereas the immunostaining profile obtained with TfR (Bc) presents a partial colocalization on merged picture (Bd) and fluorograms (Bf,g).
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	266	 To further analyze colocalization compartments, we selected plots with high fluorescence intensity and placed them on the fluorogram bisector line (square in Bf,g) to generate images showing the colocalization patterns between CFTR and TfR (Bf') or Syn8 and TfR (Bg').

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	294	 GFP-CFTR was pulled down with syntaxin 8 either with the full-length cytosolic domain of syntaxin 8 or with each of its truncated domain but predominantly with its N-terminal half upstream of its t-SNARE domain.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	295	 However, this interaction was far weaker compared with GFP-CFTR binding to syntaxin 1A.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Nevertheless, these results were significant as CFTR was not retained by GST alone.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Because pull-down experiments revealed a weak physical interaction between syntaxin 8 and CFTR, we hypothesized that intermediary proteins could be involved in CFTR/syntaxin 8 complexes.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	298	 The best candidates were the other components of the endosomal SNARE complex: VAMP8, vti1b and syntaxin 7.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	309	Regulation of CFTR channel activity by syntaxin 8 We have observed that syntaxin 8 overexpression is responsible for a strong inhibition of CFTR channel, activated either by the cAMP pathway (forskolin stimulation) or by a cAMP-independent pathway through the CFTR activator MPB-91 (Derand et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Such regulation of ionic channels by SNARE proteins has already been described.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	311	 For example, physical interactions have been assessed between syntaxin 1A and P/Q-type calcium channels, N-type calcium channels (Bezprozvanny et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	312	, 2000) and amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (Saxena et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Interestingly, syntaxin 1A inhibits CFTR chloride current by direct protein-protein interaction between the t-SNARE homology domain of syntaxin 1A and the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CFTR (Naren et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	314	 In another study (Peters et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	315	, 1999), cAMP-induced delivery to plasma membrane of CFTR present in peripheral vesicles was inhibited by syntaxin 1A in Xenopus oocytes.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	316	 As in the case of syntaxin 1A, our electrophysiological data indeed showed an inhibition of the CFTR activity due to syntaxin 8 overexpression.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	317	 This regulation is protein specific, as when we performed the same experiment with syntaxin 3, a SNARE protein that does not bind CFTR, we obtained a normal CFTR activation.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Moreover, CFTR modulation required syntaxin 8 to be anchored in membrane, as we showed that its soluble form has no effect on CFTR activity.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Thus, CFTR may directly be regulated by a protein-protein interaction, or alternatively, syntaxin 8 overexpression may disturb the vesicular transport machinery.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	320	 This could affect CFTR recycling or cellular targeting towards the plasma membrane and consequently inhibit the chloride channel activity measured at the cell level.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	321	Physical interactions between syntaxin 8 and CFTR We have shown a direct protein-protein interaction, given that CFTR was pulled down using immobilized GST-syntaxin 8 recombinant proteins.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Moreover, CFTR and syntaxin 8 could be co-immunoprecipitated with each other from CHO-2T or HT29-CL19A cell extracts.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	323	 These data suggest that syntaxin 8 interacts with CFTR either directly, or as a component of a CFTR-containing complex.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	324	 However, this interaction is different from the one observed between syntaxin 1A and CFTR.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Recombinant GST-syntaxin 1A binds CFTR with a high affinity (Naren et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	326	, 1997), whereas the interaction between syntaxin 8 and CFTR appears to be weaker.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Moreover, unlike syntaxin 1A in which only the t-SNARE domain interacts with CFTR, each moiety of syntaxin 8 binds CFTR.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Despite the fact that it will be necessary to test the in vitro binding between the different domains of CFTR and syntaxin 8 to ascertain a direct physical interaction, the immunoprecipitation results confirm that syntaxin 8 and CFTR are part of the same complex.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	329	 As we have precipitated both proteins with the same efficiency in CHO transfected cells and in HT29-CL19A cells (endogenously expressing both CFTR and syntaxin 8), we conclude that this interaction was not induced solely by overexpression.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	330	 As the affinity between syntaxin 8 and CFTR is weak, syntaxin 8 may not be the major partner of CFTR.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Tierce proteins may be necessary to establish a protein complex containing syntaxin 8 and CFTR.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	332	 This hypothesis is consistent with the pull-down and immunoprecipitation experiments, and could explain the small amount of CFTR retained by GST-syntaxin 8.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Possible candidates partner are the different components of the heterotetrameric endosomal SNARE core complex: vti1b, syntaxin 7 and VAMP8 (Antonin et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Our pull-down experiments suggest that VAMP8 and vti1b, which strongly and directly interact with CFTR, could be partner proteins involved in a CFTR/syntaxin 8 multimeric protein complex.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	335	 This result strengthens the idea that an entire SNARE complex could regulate ion channel delivery/insertion, retrieval or recycling to the plasma membrane.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	336	Syntaxin 8 is involved in CFTR trafficking Syntaxin 8 physical binding and functional regulation of CFTR prompted us to investigate, at the cellular level, the effect of syntaxin 8 overexpression on CFTR localization.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	337	 GFP fluorescence analysis on COS-7+GFP-CFTR cells showed a strong plasma membrane staining characteristic of mature CFTR cellular localization.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	338	 However, when syntaxin 8 was cotransfected with GFP-CFTR, a dramatic decrease or a disappearance of CFTR plasma membrane staining was observed and both proteins colocalized in a perinuclear region.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	339	 Syntaxin 8 impact on CFTR trafficking does not apply to any channel as, when we overexpressed syntaxin 8, the plasma membrane localization of endogenous Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was not affected.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	340	Moreover, coexpression of GFP-CFTR and Syn8TM, a cytosoluble form of syntaxin 8 (depleted of its transmembrane domain), led to a normal trafficking of GFP-CFTR to the plasma membrane.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Furthermore, a plasma membrane colocalization between Syn8TM and GFP-CFTR was observed and, interestingly, Syn8TM was seen in the plasma membrane only if CFTR was present too.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	342	 More generally, Syn8TM is located mainly in cellular structures where GFP-CFTR is abundant.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	343	 So, when syntaxin 8 is soluble, it may physically bind CFTR and follow its trafficking, but when syntaxin 8 is anchored in vesicle membrane, it binds CFTR too, but only in the cellular compartment where syntaxin 8 assumes its function (i.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	344	 As Syn8TM had no or little effect on CFTR trafficking, inhibition of CFTR trafficking by syntaxin 8 overexpression could not be related to an excess of protein synthesis in endoplasmic reticulum.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	345	 Moreover, syntaxin 8 must be anchored in vesicle membranes to impair CFTR trafficking, which means that the t-SNARE function of syntaxin 8 can be engaged.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	346	 These results reinforce the physiological relevance of a putative regulator role of syntaxin 8 on CFTR channel activity.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	347	Syntaxin 8 is involved in CFTR recycling pathway The precise identification of the colocalization region of CFTR and syntaxin 8 was determined using fluorescent confocal microscopy and three well characterized antibodies against Lamp-1, an LE/lysosomal marker protein, TfR (transferrin receptor), an EE/RE marker protein, and Rab11, which stains RE and TGN membranes.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Our results exhibited no colocalization between Lamp-1 staining and the juxtanuclear compartment where CFTR and syntaxin 8 were accumulated.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	349	 TfR vesicular pattern partially matched with this region, and CFTR, syntaxin 8 and TfR seemed to be located together in thin perinuclear vesicles.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	350	 By contrast, Rab11 staining was highly similar to syntaxin 8 and CFTR juxtanuclear staining and we observed a high degree of colocalization both on fluorograms and on the merged image.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	351	 These results indicate that when syntaxin 8 is overexpressed with GFP-CFTR, both proteins are mainly localized in the same compartment, which could be identified as recycling endosomes and/or TGN membranes.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Because we have colocalized CFTR and syntaxin 8 with TfR and Rab11 proteins, we favour the recycling endosome hypothesis.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	353	Syntaxin 8 is a t-SNARE protein that belongs at least to the endosomal SNARE complex (Antonin et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	354	, 2000), and is consequently involved in the endosomal pathway like syntaxins 7, 11 and 12/13 (Prekeris et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	355	 Its cellular localization was determined mainly in the early endosome, but syntaxin 8 was also detected in the late endosome and lysosome organelles.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	356	 The early endosome is a dynamic compartment displaying a highly complex and pleiomorphic organization that contains clearly two functionally distinct subcompartments without real physical boundaries: plasma membrane proteins are recycled via the recycling endosomes or degraded via the endosomal carrier vesicles/multivesicular bodies of the degradation pathway (reviewed by Gruenberg, 2001).
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	357	 In some cases, syntaxin 8 was also observed at the plasma membrane (Subramaniam et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	358	, 2000; Kasai and Akagawa, 2001), suggesting a vesicular cycling of syntaxin 8.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	359	The mechanism of CFTR recycling is still poorly understood, but CFTR has previously been detected in recycling endosomes using fluorescence microscopy in human bronchial epithelial cells (Poschet et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	360	 Thus, physical binding between CFTR and syntaxin 8 may occur in recycling endosomes, a cellular compartment which is required for CFTR recycling pathway and where syntaxin 8, probably assembled with other SNARE proteins (i.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	361	 endosomal SNARE complex), is implicated in its vesicular trafficking function.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	362	 Syntaxin 8 overexpression is likely to disrupt the vesicular transport step in which it is involved, as it has been previously observed for several SNARE proteins (Dascher and Balch, 1996; Low et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	363	 This could explain CFTR accumulation in recycling endosomes in our experiments.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	364	 So our results show that syntaxin 8 appears as an important regulatory protein directly implicated in CFTR recycling pathway.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	365	In conclusion, SNARE proteins, and particularly syntaxin 8, participate actively in CFTR trafficking, recycling and/or in direct regulation of CFTR activity.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	366	 Here, we describe a relationship between CFTR and syntaxin 8 in the recycling endosome.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	367	 A recent paper showed that in cystic fibrosis cells a dysfunction in the recycling endosome pathway may have many repercussions on endocytic and plasma membrane processes (Poschet et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	368	 So elucidating the recycling pathway of CFTR could be important in understanding the physiopathology of cystic fibrosis.

0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received September 10, 2001; Revised and Accepted November 13, 2001.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	4	Relatively little attention has been given to progression of CF disease in utero though this affects postnatal pathology and may be of relevance to the likely success of gene therapy.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The initial pathology of CF is exhibited in the pancreas in the early second trimester of gestation, when proteinaceous material starts to obstruct the ductal tree (8,9).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This is perhaps not surprising since CFTR is expressed in epithelia from before the start of the second trimester of human development and CFTR expression levels are high in the mid-trimester pancreas (10 to 12).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In most tissues the CFTR expression levels show little fluctuation between the second trimester of gestation and postnatal life.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, CFTR appears to be developmentally regulated in both human and sheep lung epithelium (11 to 13) where high expression levels during fetal life are in contrast to much lower abundance of CFTR mRNA by birth, and into adulthood.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The significance of this down-regulation of CFTR expression is the major focus of this work.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	10	Since it is not feasible to investigate human lung development in utero, we have used the sheep to provide a useful model of human lung development (14).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The sheep lung is anatomically more similar to human than that of the mouse, having submucosal glands throughout the cartilagenous airway.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The expression pattern of CFTR in sheep is similar to humans, both temporally and spatially and we have shown that the ovine CFTR gene sequence shows close homology to the human gene (14,15).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Expression of CFTR during human and sheep lung development has so far been assessed primarily by means of in situ hybridization (11,12), northern blotting (10,13) and reverse transcriptase to polymerase chain reaction (RT to PCR) (10,13).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	14	 CFTR expression levels are high in the lung during the second trimester of gestation and low postnatally.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	15	 To date, developmental expression of CFTR has only been examined at a limited number of time points and data have not been accurately quantitative.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Our aim was to evaluate CFTR expression at specific time points throughout gestation using a real-time quantitative RT to PCR assay provided by TaqMan technology.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	17	 We have generated a developmental profile of CFTR mRNA in sheep with particular attention to the down-regulation of CFTR in the respiratory system.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This profile has identified key gestational ages where CFTR expression is maximal and hence when targeting of potential in utero therapies might be of most benefit.

0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	25	  Validation of the real-time CFTR RT to PCR assay target The region of the ovine CFTR gene chosen for generating the TaqMan amplifying primers and probe covered the boundary between exons 6a and 6b.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Since the CFTR gene is known to exhibit a range of alternatively spliced forms in a number of species (18) it was necessary to confirm that no aberrant transcripts lacking parts of exons 6a and 6b were produced from the ovine gene.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Conventional RT to PCR was carried out using primers spanning exons 4 to 7 and no alternative transcripts lacking exons 6a or 6b were detected in RNA from lung at mid-gestation or birth, pancreas, small intestine, salivary gland and colon at 2 days after birth (data not shown).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	28	 These results suggested that the real-time TaqMan RT to PCR assay targeted to the exon 6a/6b boundary, would accurately reflect total CFTR mRNA transcription.

0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	33	Two series of experiments were performed: the first evaluated CFTR expression in ovine lung tissues throughout the developmental time course; the second evaluated CFTR expression in eight ovine tissues at 83 and 108 days of gestation and at 2 days post-term.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	34	Developmental expression of ovine CFTR in the lung The developmental profile of CFTR expression in the lung showed a gradual fall in mRNA levels though the 147 days of gestation (Fig.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Values at 52 days of gestation, the end of the first trimester, were 75-fold higher than those at birth.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	36	 By 66 days, CFTR mRNA levels were reduced 4.

0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	38	 After levels peaked at 80 days of gestation, there was a gradual decline toward birth with negligible levels of expression by 4 days before term (143 days) and at birth.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Two days after parturition, levels of CFTR mRNA increased slightly and this expression level was maintained at 2 weeks of age and in adult sheep tissue.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Experiments were performed three times with samples analysed in triplicate.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	41	 To evaluate the variation in CFTR expression levels in individuals at specific time points, samples were analysed from a sib pair at 74 days gestation and a half-sib pair at 2 days after birth.

0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	62	 They confirm the observation that the levels of CFTR mRNA in the pancreas and digestive system are significantly higher (at least 5-fold) than in the lung epithelium even at the time of maximal expression in the respiratory system.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The observation of greater levels of CFTR mRNA in the colon than in the small intestine is probably a unique feature of the sheep and its digestive system as there are data to show the opposite distribution in the human intestine (11).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Glandular organs such as pancreas, lung and salivary gland had a similar pattern of expression characterized by higher expression early in gestation followed by a decline towards birth with levels maintained 2 days post-term.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	65	 CFTR mRNA levels were higher in both pancreas and salivary gland than in lung.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	66	 In trachea CFTR mRNA levels were comparable to values in lung during gestation but rose at 2 days post-term.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Small intestine expressed lower levels of CFTR mRNA before birth in comparison to 2 days after birth.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Colon initially expressed very high amounts of CFTR mRNA, which then decreased slightly at mid-gestation before rising again to a high level after birth.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	69	 CFTR mRNA expression in the ovine kidney is very low and declines between 83 and 2 days post-term.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	70	Developmental expression of ovine ENaC in the lung The CFTR and ENaC ion channels are thought to interact directly (2), hence it was pertinent to evaluate also the developmental expression of ENaC in the ovine lung.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	71	 These assays were performed using conventional RT to PCR rather than real-time TaqMan RT to PCR due to lack of full sequence information for ovine ENaC and reported alternative splicing of this gene (19).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	72	 In marked contrast to CFTR, expression of the subunit of ENaC is very low in the ovine lung at 52 days of gestation, but gradually rises through 108, 129, 143 and 147 (term) days of gestation to much higher levels in 2 days post-term and adult lung (Fig.

0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	80	However, the previous data did not evaluate CFTR expression throughout gestation.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The gradual decline in CFTR that we observed during ovine fetal lung development could be accounted for by at least two explanations.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Either, the percentage of cells that express CFTR within the lung epithelium decrease with time or the levels of expression within the same cell type gradually decreases.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	83	 On the basis of previous data we would expect the former explanation to be correct.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	84	 In postnatal human lung epithelium significant CFTR expression is limited to specific cells within the serous portion of submucosal glands and individual cells in the airway surface epithelium (20,21).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	85	 This is in contrast to the apparent expression of CFTR mRNA in the majority of cells in the fetal lung epithelium (11).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Furthermore, in human trachea, CFTR expression was seen to be intermediate and diffuse during the first trimester by in situ hybridization (11).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	87	 In the second trimester, CFTR mRNA expression was reduced and limited to a subset of cells in the epithelia of the trachea and by the third trimester, only individual cells expressed CFTR but at very high levels (12).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	88	High levels of CFTR mRNA expression have been observed by in situ hybridization in pancreas, small intestine and colon from an early gestational age in humans (11).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	89	 These expression levels remain constant throughout gestation in contrast to lung expression patterns.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The temporal and spatial expression of CFTR mRNA in ovine small intestine, pancreas, colon, salivary gland and kidney and muscle seen in our experiments, closely parallel the human gene (13).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	91	 However, the quantitative assays show that in contrast to the human CFTR gene, which is expressed at a higher level in the crypts of the small intestine than in the colon, ovine CFTR mRNA is most abundant in the colonic epithelium.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	92	 This may reflect functional differences in the ruminant digestive system.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	93	 It is of interest that the decline of CFTR expression observed in ovine fetal lung between 83 days gestation and 2 days after birth is also seen in pancreas and salivary gland.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	94	 CFTR may have a significant role in the development and differentiation of other glandular tissues.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	95	The physiological implications of the gradual decline in lung CFTR expression levels during gestation warrant further discussion.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The fetal lung is filled with a high chloride, low pH fluid that is distinct from amniotic fluid.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Chloride is actively secreted from the lung epithelium into the lung lumen during development and as a chloride ion channel, CFTR protein could contribute to this process.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	98	 However, chloride conductances other than CFTR are likely to be more important in fetal lung fluid secretion since CF is not associated with hypoplastic lungs at birth.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Furthermore, the profile of CFTR expression during gestation does not correspond to changes in lung liquid secretion (22,23).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	100	Postnatally, the major ion flows across the airway epithelium are uptake of sodium.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Lung liquid begins to be reabsorbed by ovine lung epithelium at 140 days of gestation.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Sodium reabsorption is achieved primarily by sodium channels located on the apical surface of the lung epithelium, the main one being the ENaC (24).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Recent data have shown that ENaC is inhibited by CFTR, which probably interacts directly with it (2,25,26).

0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	2	Expression of a mutated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has been shown to enhance proliferation within CF airways, and cells expressing a mutated CFTR have been shown to be less susceptible to apoptosis.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Because the CFTR is expressed in the epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract and all CF mouse models are characterized by gastrointestinal obstruction, we hypothesized that CFTR null mice would have increased epithelial cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis within the small intestine.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The rate of intestinal epithelial cell migration from crypt to villus was increased in CFTR null mice relative to mice expressing the wild-type CFTR.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	5	 This difference in migration could be explained by an increase in epithelial cell proliferation but not by a difference in apoptosis within the crypts of Lieberkuhn.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In addition, using two independent sets of CF cell lines, we found that epithelial cell susceptibility to apoptosis was unrelated to the presence of a functional CFTR.

0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In all mouse models of CF in which the CFTR has been deleted by insertional or deletional mutagenesis, intestinal pathophysiology is characterized by mucus accumulation in the crypts of Lieberkuhn, goblet cell hyperplasia, and intestinal obstruction.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In addition, the CFTR is expressed in the epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract with a reduction in expression along the crypt-to-villus axis (7, 26).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	15	Previously, Gottlieb and Dosanjh (9) showed that cultured C127 mouse mammary epithelial cells stably transfected with the F508-mutated CFTR remained viable and were less susceptible to apoptosis induced by cycloheximide or etoposide than cells expressing the wild-type CFTR.

0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Although this phenomenon has traditionally been attributed to inflammation, the possibility that the proliferative differences might be due to differential expression of the CFTR has not been addressed.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	19	Because all mouse models of CF (CFTR /) develop intestinal obstructions (10) and the CFTR is expressed in epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract, we hypothesized that the CFTR / mouse intestine would show evidence of altered apoptosis and/or enhanced proliferation relative to mice expressing the wild-type CFTR.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The hypothesis was tested in vivo using a knockout mouse model of CF.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Mice expressing a mutant CFTR were found to have a greater rate of migration of epithelial cells up the crypt-villus axis within the small intestine.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This increased rate could be attributed to an increase in the proliferative capacity of cells within the crypts of Lieberkuhn but not to differences in apoptosis.

0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Expression of the wild-type CFTR did not alter susceptibility to death by UV irradiation relative to the uninfected control cells.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	175	 -galactosidase expression made the cells more sensitive to UV irradiation.

0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	177	To further assess whether the original data were misleading, a second set of cell lines was tested to determine susceptibility to apoptosis based on expression of a functional or mutated CFTR.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	178	 In the CFT1 cell lines, at 16 h after UV irradiation, cell death increased in a dose-dependent manner to a similar extent across cell lines (Fig.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Similar data were obtained 6 h after UV irradiation using nuclear condensation and fragmentation as markers of apoptosis (Fig.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	180	 In addition, UV irradiation of CFT1 cell lines resulted in a similar time course of DNA degradation (data not shown) with DNA laddering present at 3 h after UV irradiation in all four cell lines.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Furthermore, cleavage of caspase 3 (PharMingen, La Jolla, CA) and caspase 9 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) after UV irradiation was not different across cell lines (data not shown).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Thus the current data from the C127 and CFT1 cell lines suggest that the CFTR does not play a role in apoptosis.

0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The amount of apoptosis seen for each cell line was similar and independent of the expression of the wild-type or mutated CFTR.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	195	Many CF patients and all mouse models of CF have a common pathology in their susceptibility to gastrointestinal obstruction.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In the normal intestine, epithelial cells line the villi of the absorptive surfaces.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	197	 These cells are continuously regenerated by proliferation in the crypts of Lieberkuhn, differentiation, and migration up the villi.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	198	 At the tips of the villi, the cells undergo apoptosis and are shed into the lumen (11, 24).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	199	 (18) have shown that both proliferation and apoptosis occur in the stem cells within the crypts and that apoptosis within the crypts is likely to be an important part of the homeostatic process for tissue maintenance.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Under normal conditions, stem cell proliferation and epithelial sloughing are in equilibrium.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	201	 As we have shown in the current study, epithelial cells in CFTR / mice migrate up the crypt-villus axis at a greater rate than in animals expressing a functional CFTR.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The epithelial cells from CFTR / mice migrated 27% farther in 48 h than those from the CFTR +/ mice.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	203	 This difference in rate is due to differences in proliferation and not apoptosis within the crypts of Lieberkuhn with ~12% more cells with proliferative capacity in the CFTR / mice than the CFTR +/ mice.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Because villus length is not different between the genotypes (data not shown), the increased number of cells proliferating within the crypt and migrating up the villi would lead to an increase in the mass of cells that are sloughed into the gastrointestinal tract.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	205	The increased proliferative capacity within the CFTR-null mice may be attributed to a cellular defect within the cells as a result of a nonfunctional CFTR, although the mechanism by which this might happen is unknown.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Potentially, differences in intracellular pH might account for the enhanced proliferation in CFTR / cells.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Cytosolic pH is thought to be one of the factors that control the rate of proliferation (8) with cytoplasmic alkalinization constituting a signal for mitogenesis (1, 22, 27).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	208	 In addition, cells with higher intracellular pH are more likely to be in the S, G2, or M phases of the cell cycle, whereas cells with lower pH are more likely to be in G1 (19).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Cells expressing a mutated CFTR have been reported (5, 6) to have an elevated cytosolic pH, and overexpression of the wild-type CFTR but not a mutant CFTR results in growth arrest (23).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Thus a mutation in the CFTR may result in an elevated intracellular pH, which stimulates the cell to undergo proliferation more readily and thus increase the rate at which epithelial cells of the crypts of Lieberkuhn proliferate and migrate up the intestinal villi.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	211	All the mouse models of CF show evidence of inflammation and intestinal obstructions (10); thus the possibility that the stimulus to enhanced proliferation within the intestine of the CFTR / mice might be due to differences in inflammation cannot be ruled out.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Proliferation in nasal polyps (12, 16) and epithelium of bronchial airways (15) has been shown to be increased in CF patients and has been attributed to airway inflammation.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Chronic inflammation has been shown to be present in the CF intestine with increased luminal content of immune cell constituents, secretory immunoglobulins, and cytokines (25).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Therefore, inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract potentially can be a stimulus to enhanced proliferation.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	215	Initial studies by Gottlieb and Dosanjh (9) showed decreased susceptibility to apoptosis in cells expressing the mutated CFTR relative to cells expressing the wild-type CFTR.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	216	 In this initial study, cycloheximide and etoposide were used to induce apoptosis.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	217	 The CFTR is an anion channel that when mutated does not allow for chloride to be transported across the plasma membrane.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Because this is a transport problem, one concern with the use of any drug or chemical to induce apoptosis is a difference in the ability of the cells to transport the drug or chemical across the cell membrane.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	219	 To avoid this potential problem in the current studies, UV irradiation was utilized as the apoptotic stimulus.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Cells expressing the mutated CFTR were more resistant to apoptosis induced by UV irradiation than cells expressing the wild-type CFTR, which is in accordance with the findings of Gottlieb and Dosanjh (9).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	221	 However, one control that was lacking from the original set of experiments was the introduction of the wild-type CFTR into these resistant cell lines to restore susceptibility to apoptosis.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	222	 In the current study, infection of C127 F08 cells with an adenovirus expressing the wild-type CFTR failed to restore susceptibility to apoptosis.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	223	 -galactosidase adenovirus-infected cells were found to be more susceptible to death than both the uninfected and infected CFTR cells.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	224	 The reason behind this increased propensity toward death is not known.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The -galactosidase construct used in these experiments was the nuclear-targeted protein, which, because of its location of expression, may make the cells more susceptible to the DNA-damaging effect of UV irradiation.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	226	 To confirm the findings from the C127 cells, an independent set of cell lines was used to determine whether expression of a mutated or wild-type CFTR results in differences in susceptibility to apoptosis.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Cells with a mutated CFTR were found to be no different in their sensitivity to UV irradiation than cells expressing the wild-type CFTR when evaluated for membrane destabilization detected by the uptake of YOPRO-1, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, DNA degradation, or caspase cleavage.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Thus taken together the data suggest that the CFTR does not play a role in a cell's susceptibility to apoptosis.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	229	In the CFTR-null mice, epithelial cell kinetics within the gastrointestinal tract differ from mice expressing at least one copy of the functional CFTR.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	230	 The altered proliferation within the crypts of Lieberkuhn is not accompanied by changes in apoptosis but results in an increased rate of cell migration up the villus.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	231	 The increased number of cells reaching the intestinal lumen might contribute to the viscosity of the luminal contents and increase the likelihood of intestinal blockage, one of the pathophysiological hallmarks of CF.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	232	 If epithelial cell proliferation and turnover is increased in parallel in the CF lung and pancreas, this might contribute to the viscosity of the bronchial and pancreatic secretions and exacerbate the symptoms of CF.

0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	2	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) forms an ion channel that is permeable both to Cl and to larger organic anions.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Here we show, using macroscopic current recording from excised membrane patches, that the anionic antioxidant tripeptide glutathione is permeant in the CFTR channel.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	4	 This permeability may account for the high concentrations of glutathione that have been measured in the surface fluid that coats airway epithelial cells.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Furthermore, loss of this pathway for glutathione transport may contribute to the reduced levels of glutathione observed in airway surface fluid of cystic fibrosis patients, which has been suggested to contribute to the oxidative stress observed in the lung in cystic fibrosis.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We suggest that release of glutathione into airway surface fluid may be a novel function of CFTR.

0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	8	CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) is caused by mutations in a single gene: the one that encodes the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	9	 CFTR, which is a member of the "ATP-binding cassette" (ABC) family of membrane transport proteins, forms a phosphorylation- and ATP-dependent Cl channel (3, 4).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	10	 It remains unclear how the reduced epithelial Cl permeability caused by the functional absence of CFTR leads to the complexity of symptoms seen in CF lung disease.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	11	 This, coupled with the structural similarity between CFTR and other ABC proteins, has long hinted that CFTR may also perform some other function.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	12	The anionic tripeptide glutathione (-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine; GSH) is the most important extracellular antioxidant in the lung (1, 20).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Airway surface fluid (ASF) contains ~400  microM GSH, ~50 times the concentration found in plasma and 100 times that found in the extracellular fluid of many other tissues (1, 5, 17, 20).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The source of the high concentration of GSH found in ASF is unknown (20).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Interestingly, the concentration of GSH in ASF is greatly reduced in CF (16), which may exacerbate the severe oxidative stress that results from chronic inflammation of the CF lung (19).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	16	    Indeed, antioxidant therapy for CF has previously been suggested (2, 16, 19).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	17	Recently we demonstrated that a broad range of large organic anions were able to permeate through the CFTR Cl channel from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, and we suggested that release of such anions into ASF might be a novel physiological function of CFTR (11).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Here we show that both GSH and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) can permeate through CFTR from the intracellular solution.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	19	 These results suggest that CFTR, in addition to its role as a Cl channel, may function as a permeation pathway by which GSH is released into ASF.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Such a function would suggest a previously unidentified link between CFTR and lung antioxidant defense.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Loss of this GSH permeation pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis of CF.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	22	Macroscopic CFTR current recordings were carried out on inside-out membrane patches excised from baby hamster kidney cells stably expressing CFTR, as described in detail elsewhere (9, 11).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Briefly, channels were activated by exposure of the cytoplasmic face of excised patches to 40-60 nM protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA) plus 1 mM MgATP.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	24	 All current traces shown have had the background leak current, recorded before addition of PKA, digitally subtracted, as described previously (9, 11).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Current traces were filtered at 100 Hz using an eight-pole Bessel filter, digitized at 250 Hz and analyzed using pCLAMP6 computer software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	26	Recording solutions contained (in mM) 150 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 TES, or 154 NaGSH or Na2GSSG plus 2 Mg(OH)2 and 10 TES.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	27	 All solutions were adjusted to pH 7.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Where the pipette solution did not contain Cl, the pipette Ag-AgCl wire was protected by an NaCl-containing agar bridge inside the pipette.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Voltages were corrected for measured liquid junction potentials of up to 12 mV existing between dissimilar pipette and bath solutions.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	30	 All chemicals were obtained from Sigma (St.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Louis, MO) except 4,4'-dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DNDS; Pfaltz  and  Bauer, Waterbury, CT) and glibenclamide (glyburide; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	32	Macroscopic current-voltage (I-V) relationships were constructed using depolarizing voltage ramp protocols as described previously (9, 11).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The current reversal potential, Erev, was estimated by fitting a polynomial function to the I-V relationship and was used to estimate permeability (P) ratios according to the equations (1) (2) where F is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	34	Block of CFTR Cl current by GSH and GSSG was analyzed using the Woodhull model of voltage-dependent block (21) (3) where i is the amplitude of the current remaining in the presence of blocker, i0 is the control, unblocked current amplitude, [B] is the blocker concentration, V is the membrane potential, and Kd(V) is the voltage-dependent dissociation constant, the voltage dependence of which is given by (4) where z' is the apparent valence of the blocking ion.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	35	Experiments were carried out at room temperature (21-23 degrees C).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Values are presented as means  plus or minus  SE.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	37	A broad range of large organic anions are able to carry current through CFTR when present in the intracellular solution (11).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	38	 PKA-stimulated I-V relationships obtained with GSH (Fig.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	39	 1B) in the intracellular solution and Cl in the extracellular solution (bi-ionic conditions) indicated that both of these large anions were permeant in CFTR, with mean permeabilities (according to Eqs.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	40	 1D) were measurably permeant when present in the extracellular solution under bi-ionic conditions.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	41	 This asymmetric permeability is similar to that which we previously observed with a number of other large organic anions (11).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	42	 This asymmetry is abolished by substances that "lock" CFTR channels in the open state, such as pyrophosphate (PPi) (11).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	43	 1, C and D, addition of 10 mM PPi to the intracellular solution stimulated the influx of GSH and GSSG from the extracellular solution.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	44	 All of these properties of GSH and GSSG permeation are similar to those we described previously for a number of different large organic anions (11).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	45	 As discussed in more detail elsewhere (11), the reasons for the disruption of asymmetric permeability caused by PPi are not currently known but may involve inhibition of ATP hydrolysis-dependent transitions between different channel open states.

0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Note that the permeability of the divalent anion GSSG is very low compared with GSH and other large monovalent anions (Fig.

0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	51	 A-D: example current-voltage (I-V) relationships recorded with either GSH or GSSG present in intracellular or extracellular solution under bi-ionic conditions, as stated on each individual panel.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	52	 CFTR currents were consistently much smaller with intracellular GSSG than under any of the other ionic conditions studied; reasons for this are unknown.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	53	 I-V relationships such as those shown in A-D were used to calculate mean permeabilities for GSH (E) and GSSG (F), when present in intracellular solution (In) or extracellular solution (Out) under bi-ionic conditions.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Numbers in parentheses are number of patches examined.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Permeability ratios shown for GSH and GSSG in extracellular solution in absence of pyrophosphate (PPi) are maximum values, since no reversal potential was observed under these conditions over voltage range studied.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Actual permeabilities under these conditions are likely to be considerably lower; they may be zero (see Ref.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	57	The suggestion that intracellular large organic anions were permeant in CFTR and not simply transported by some CFTR-regulated transport process was supported by the finding that currents carried by such large anions were inhibited by the CFTR open-channel blockers DNDS and glibenclamide (11).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Both DNDS and glibenclamide also blocked the current carried by intracellular GSH under bi-ionic conditions (Fig.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	59	 This suggests that GSH and Cl share a common permeation pathway through CFTR, as previously suggested for other large anions (11).

0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	63	If GSH and GSSG are able to permeate through the CFTR Cl channel pore, then they might also be expected to act as open channel blockers of CFTR Cl current.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Indeed, the large organic anions gluconate and glutamate, both of which are permeant in CFTR when present in the intracellular solution (11), are also low-affinity blockers of Cl permeation through the channel (10).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	65	 3, addition of GSH (5 mM) or GSSG (10 mM) to the intracellular solution reduced the macroscopic CFTR Cl current recorded with 150 mM NaCl present on both sides of the membrane.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Block by intracellular GSH and GSSG was immediate and readily reversible, consistent with an open channel block mechanism.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Analysis of the blocking effects of GSH and GSSG using the Woodhull model (21; see METHODS) suggested Kd(0) = 15.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	68	02 (n = 5) for GSH and Kd(0) = 23.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Thus, although the affinity of channel block by these two anions is relatively low, it is at least 20 times higher than that estimated for intracellular gluconate or glutamate ions at a membrane potential of 0 mV (~600 and 1,100 mM, respectively; Ref.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The ability of intracellular GSH and GSSG to act as blockers of CFTR Cl current is consistent with their being able to enter the pore from the intracellular end.

0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	74	Despite early skepticism due to its structure, CFTR has been conclusively proven to be a Cl channel.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Reduced transepithelial Cl transport is thought to be the primary defect in CF (15); however, the link between this reduced Cl permeability and the pathogenesis of CF lung disease remains unclear.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Previously, we suggested that CFTR may fulfill another direct transport role, allowing efflux of a broad range of large organic anions from the cytoplasm (11).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Based on our present results, we propose that a potential physiological substrate for this transport pathway is the important antioxidant molecule GSH.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The ability of GSH to permeate through CFTR suggests a direct link between CFTR and antioxidant defense in the lung.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	79	GSH is synthesized in the cytoplasm, where levels of 1-10 mM are typical (17).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	80	 High concentrations of GSH (~400  microM) are also found in ASF of healthy individuals (1).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	81	 We propose that GSH may be released into ASF via CFTR, further emphasizing the role of CFTR in determining ASF composition (18).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Because cytoplasmic concentrations of GSH are so high, a passive permeation pathway would presumably be sufficient to mediate release of such amounts of GSH into ASF.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Loss of this GSH transport pathway may contribute to CF lung disease.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The levels of GSH are greatly reduced in ASF of CF patients (16), potentially exacerbating the oxidant stress that results from neutrophil-dominated inflammation of the CF lung (16, 19).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	85	 GSH levels in ASF are also reduced in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and adult respiratory distress syndrome and are increased in cigarette smokers with no clinical evidence of lung disease (16).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	86	GSH and GSSG transport by CFTR suggests a functional similarity between CFTR and the structurally related ABC proteins, multidrug resistance protein (MRP) and canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT; also known as MRP2).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Both MRP and cMOAT mediate ATP-dependent export of large intracellular organic anions, in particular glutathione-S-conjugates (6, 14).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	88	 GSSG is a substrate for both MRP- and cMOAT-mediated transport (8, 14).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Unconjugated GSH may be transported by cMOAT (14) but is thought not to be transported by MRP (8); however it may act as a cosubstrate for MRP-mediated transport of unconjugated compounds (12, 13).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Potential functional overlap between CFTR and other ABC proteins is of particular interest, since it has been suggested that MRP may be able to functionally substitute for CFTR in the lung and alleviate CF symptoms (7).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Our results suggest that such functional substitution may be due to restoration of GSH or GSH-conjugate transport.

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	4	Received for publication, December 7, 2001, and in revised form, May 1, 2002.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	5	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)1 is responsible for the cAMP-activated chloride conductance of epithelial cell apical membranes (1).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Mutations in the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis, whereas hyperactivity of this transport pathway produces secretory diarrhea.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The folding of CFTR is energetically complex; misfolding and degradation of the protein are features of the most common CFTR mutation (F508) (2, 3).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In addition, F508 CFTR is unable to undergo ATP-dependent conformational changes in the ER that are required for its proper folding.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	9	 When CFTR folding is retarded in the ER, the protein becomes a target for proteolysis by ER-associated degradation mechanisms that police the protein secretory pathway for misfolded or incompletely complexed proteins (4).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This degradation involves ubiquitination of the aberrant protein and its delivery to the proteasome (5, 6).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Nearly all of the F508 CFTR produced by the cell is destroyed in this manner; and because of its complex folding pattern, much of the wild-type protein is also degraded.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The mechanisms that govern CFTR folding/degradation processes are facilitated by chaperone and co-chaperone protein interactions (discussed further below).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	13	The primary step in CFTR activation involves cAMP/protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of its central regulatory (R) domain, which not only permits the channel to gate, but also alters pathways for CFTR trafficking at the plasma membrane (7).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In recent years, protein interactions at several CFTR domains have been implicated in channel function and trafficking.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The N-terminal cytosolic tail of CFTR is a site of syntaxin 1A binding (8), and syntaxin 1A overexpression is thought to inhibit CFTR currents by reducing channel gating (9) and by interfering with regulated CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane (10).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	16	 A motif promoting CFTR endocytosis has been identified at the C terminus, and this region interacts physically with the plasma membrane endocytic adapter (AP-2) complex (11, 12).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The C terminus of CFTR corresponds to a PDZ (PSD-95/Disc-large/ZO-1) binding motif, which interacts with ezrin radixin moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 or E3KARP to bring ezrin into proximity with CFTR (13, 14).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Ezrin can anchor protein kinase A at a position physiologically appropriate for CFTR phosphorylation (15, 16), and ezrin interactions with the cytoskeleton permit retention of CFTR at the apical membrane as a mechanism to establish its polarity in epithelial cells (17).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Here, we report the interaction of CFTR with another multidomain protein, the cysteine string protein (Csp).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	20	The Csps were first discovered in Drosophila and Torpedo (18, 19), and their expression has now been documented in a variety of tissues from several mammalian species (20, 21).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Csp null mutants in Drosophila produce a temperature-sensitive block of synaptic transmission followed by paralysis and premature death.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These findings demonstrate a crucial role for Csp in neurosecretion (22).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In neurons, Csp is associated predominantly with synaptic vesicles (19), and in secretory cells it is found in large dense core or secretory granules (23, 24).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Studies of membrane dye labeling (25) and neurotransmitter release (26, 27) indicated that Csp knockouts exhibit defective neurotransmitter exocytosis; presynaptic endocytosis and vesicle recycling appear to be intact.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Studies in neuroendocrine (28) and endocrine cells (24) have confirmed that altered Csp expression elicits an impaired secretory phenotype.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	26	Csps contain an N-terminal "J-domain," a central cysteine-rich "string" region, and a phylogenetically more variable C-terminal domain.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The J-domains of Csps are structurally conserved among different species, and this region provides a fingerprint of Csp as a member of the DnaJ/Hsp40 (heat shock protein) chaperone family.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	28	 As observed for other chaperone proteins (29), the HPD motif of the Csp J-domain mediates its binding to and activation of the Hsc70 chaperone ATPases, which influence protein conformation/binding.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Structural predictions indicate that the C terminus of Csp1 may form a coiled-coil region, and this structure may be important in view of the emerging evidence that Csp can interact with proteins involved in exocytosis, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein and syntaxins 1A and 4 (21, 30, 31).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Thus, prior results suggest that Csp could link functions of the SNARE complex with those of Hsc70.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The concept that assembly of the core fusion complex requires chaperone activity has been raised previously (21); however, the explicit roles of Csp and Hsc70 in the assembly or disassembly of SNARE components are not yet known.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The C terminus of Csp contains the only primary structural difference that exists between the mammalian isoforms: full-length Csp1, and its C-terminal truncated variant, Csp2 (32, 33).

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	260	Csp Coexpression Inhibits CFTR Biogenesis-- The influence of Csp coexpression on the steady-state levels of CFTR expressed in mammalian cells was determined by cotransfecting HEK293 cells with plasmids encoding Csp and CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	261	 CFTR levels were determined by immunoblot after 24 h.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	262	 The Csp cDNAs used for transfection included an N-terminal Myc-tag, permitting exogenous Csp expression to be detected using an anti-Myc antibody (lower panel, Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	263	 As shown in the top panel of Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	264	 9A, the coexpression of either Csp1 or Csp2 with CFTR (lanes 3 and 4) eliminated the expression of mature, glycosylated CFTR (band C) and produced an accumulation of immature CFTR (band B).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	265	 This finding suggests that Csp overexpression interferes with the processing of CFTR to its mature form and that it stabilizes the immature form of CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	266	 The effect of exogenous Csp on CFTR biogenesis is specific because the Csp2 double mutant (H43V/E93Q) eliminated its inhibitory effect on CFTR maturation (lane 5).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	267	 In other experiments, a similar result was obtained with the Csp2 single mutant, H43Q, implying that a functional J-domain is critical for the inhibitory effect of Csp overexpression.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	268	 The enhancement of CFTR protein level by the Csp2 double mutant found in oocytes was not observed in mammalian cells.

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Experiments were otherwise performed as in panel A.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	277	Because Csp is an Hsc70-binding protein, we examined the levels of Hsc70 by immunoblot under these conditions.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	278	 As shown in the middle panel of Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	279	 9A, the effect of Csp1 or 2 on CFTR expression was not associated with a change in Hsc70 expression levels when this Hsc70-binding protein was expressed.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Thus, the failure of cells to express mature CFTR is not caused by a change in the expression of this important CFTR chaperone.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	281	 In addition, the specificity of the Csp effect for CFTR biogenesis was determined by coexpressing Csp with the VSV-G.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Csp coexpression did not affect the production of the mature VSV-G, in experiments performed in a manner similar to those with CFTR (Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	283	 This result suggests that the effect of expressed Csp is specific for maturation of CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	284	The effect of Csp on the steady-state expression of mature CFTR was supported by the results of pulse-chase assays.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	285	 10, Csp1 coexpression in HEK293 cells blocked the conversion of immature CFTR to mature CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	286	 As in prior studies (5), ~30% of wild-type CFTR matures to the fully glycosylated band C protein (lower panels); however, no band C was detected in Csp-coexpressing cells.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	287	 In addition, the half-life of immature CFTR was prolonged, consistent with the accumulation of band B observed in the steady-state data (Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Similar effects on the biogenesis of mature CFTR resulted from the coexpression of Csp2 (data not shown).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	289	 With Csp coexpression, the rise in band B production at chase periods of 30 and 60 min is probably attributed to the lack of cold methionine and cysteine in the chase media; nevertheless, the experiments with CFTR alone were performed identically.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	290	 The results indicate that Csp interferes with CFTR biogenesis when Csp is overexpressed.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	291	 The implications of these findings for a physiological role of Csp in the production of CFTR will be discussed below.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	292	The results of this study show that Csp is expressed in a variety of epithelial cell lines, several of which are models for CFTR-mediated chloride secretion.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	293	 These cells expressed predominantly Csp1, as observed previously in neurons and secretory cells (21) (e.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Immunofluorescent labeling showed a membrane-limited distribution of Csp in ER and apical membrane compartments.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Significant amounts of CFTR coprecipitated with Csp from Calu-3 cell lysates; in protein binding assays, Csp associated with both the CFTR R-domain and the N terminus.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	296	 The overexpression of Csp decreased CFTR biogenesis, and it correspondingly reduced the functional response of CFTR to cAMP stimulation.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	297	 These results indicate that Csp interacts physically and functionally with CFTR in epithelial cells.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	298	 This is the first report of an action of Csp on protein maturation, as discussed below.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	299	Role of Csp in Regulated Exocytosis-- Csp is expected to influence CFTR directly by virtue of its localization at the cytosolic surfaces of intracellular membranes that contain CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	300	 A defining feature of the Csps is their central cysteine-rich (string) domain, where palmitoylation at multiple sites permits Csp to associate with membrane lipid (49).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Immunofluorescence demonstrated that Csp is distributed in membrane-limited compartments, including the apical membrane domain, in Calu-3 cells (Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	302	 The Csps were discovered in Drosophila, and from their cellular distribution and knockout studies, a role for these proteins in neurotransmitter secretion became apparent (18).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Studies in neuroendocrine (28) and endocrine cells (24) have confirmed the role of Csp in regulated exocytosis.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Several studies have implicated a regulated exocytic event in the control of plasma membrane CFTR channel density (50).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	305	 In Xenopus oocytes expressing CFTR, cAMP stimulation enhances the chloride current and elicits increases in membrane capacitance and cell surface CFTR labeling, consistent with cAMP-regulated insertion of CFTR into the plasma membrane (10, 41, 51).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	306	 In adenovirus-transduced Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, CFTR was distributed in both intracellular and plasma membrane compartments under basal conditions and was recruited to the plasma membrane during cAMP stimulation (52).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	307	 The partial colocalization of Csp with CFTR at the apical membrane domain of Calu-3 cells (Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	308	 2E) and its interaction with mature (band C) CFTR (Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	309	 3A) is consistent with the concept that this protein may participate in post-Golgi CFTR trafficking events.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	310	 It will be interesting to determine whether Csp interacts with CFTR in a regulated trafficking compartment because this location would be consonant with the documented role of Csp in regulated exocytosis.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	311	 To perform such studies, however, it will be necessary to obviate the influence of Csp on CFTR maturation.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	312	A Role for Csp in CFTR Biogenesis-- We found Csp to be localized in airway epithelial cells in a compartment marked by the ER resident protein, calnexin.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that more of the core glycosylated, immature CFTR was associated with Csp than was the mature, fully glycosylated protein, particularly in proportion to the steady-state expression levels of the mature and immature forms of CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	314	 In addition, Csp coexpression reduced the production of mature CFTR, and this effect of Csp appears to require a functional J-domain.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	315	 These results imply that Csp and CFTR interact during CFTR biogenesis in the ER.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	316	 As a member of the DnaJ family of proteins, Csp could play a role in CFTR processing via its association with Hsc70.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	317	 The DnaJ proteins can serve as co-chaperones that recruit Hsc70 ATPases to specific substrates, where they activate the ATPase activity of the chaperone to modulate protein conformation (folding) or protein-protein interactions (4, 29).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Hsc70 has long been recognized as a CFTR chaperone, which coprecipitates with CFTR in the presence of ATP (39).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Hsc70 has been shown to assist in preventing the aggregation of NBD1, the domain in which the common CFTR folding mutant, F508, is located (4, 53, 54).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Normally, wild-type CFTR will be released from chaperones as it achieves its native conformation, but Hsc70 is thought to remain attached to misfolded CFTR where it can recruit the ubiquitin ligase, CHIP, to facilitate proteosome-mediated CFTR degradation (40, 55).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	321	Csp is a J-domain protein that interacts with Hsc70 and enhances its ATPase activity (56).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	322	 The interaction of Csp with Hsc70 and CFTR is likely to affect CFTR processing in one of two ways.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	323	 First, Csp may be a CFTR co-chaperone that stabilizes intermediate forms of CFTR to promote their folding and maturation.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	324	 This model suggests that Csp contributes positively to CFTR maturation, similar to the Hsc70 co-chaperone, Hdj-2 (53).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Second, Csp interactions with nonfolded CFTR intermediates may contribute to the degradation of nascent CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	326	 This model suggests that Csp may contribute to CFTR degradation, similar to the Hsc70-interacting protein, CHIP (see below).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Either model could explain how Csp overexpression reduces the steady-state expression levels of mature CFTR in mammalian cells or oocytes and therefore, the cAMP-stimulated CFTR currents (Figs.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	328	 In the first model, Csp overexpression causes a prolonged association of Hsc70 with CFTR, which can target CFTR for degradation (55).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Hsc70 has been shown to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of several cellular proteins (57).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	330	 For example, overexpression of Hsc70 leads to ubiquitination and degradation of apolipoprotein B (58).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Thus, a prolonged Csp-mediated association of CFTR with Hsc70, because of Csp overexpression, could lead to CFTR degradation, despite the possibility that the physiological role of Csp is to facilitate CFTR biogenesis.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	332	The second model is trivial, in that augmenting the level of a protein involved in CFTR degradation would reduce CFTR expression.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Illustrative of this model is the Hsc70-binding protein CHIP, a ubiquitin ligase whose overexpression promotes proteasome-mediated CFTR degradation (40).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	334	 CHIP appears to recognize slowly folding or misfolded forms of CFTR and promotes their destruction by binding to CFTR-associated Hsc70.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	335	 CHIP then targets CFTR to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	336	 The finding that proteosome inhibitors fail to promote trafficking of class II CFTR mutants suggests that mechanisms exist for irreversible targeting of protein to intracellular degradation processes before their cellular destruction.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	337	 CHIP appears to be a component of this pathway; in principle, Csp could function in this manner as well.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	338	Several findings favor the co-chaperone model.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	339	 First, the predominant interaction of Csp with CFTR band B in Calu-3 cells (Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	340	 3) suggests a physiological role for Csp in the maturation of CFTR because the majority of the CFTR expressed in these cells is the fully glycosylated mature form.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Second, the direct interaction of Csp with CFTR subdomains in the absence of Hsc70 (Figs.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	342	 4 and 5) suggests that Csp may localize Hsc70 at specific sites to facilitate CFTR folding.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	343	 In contrast to CHIP (40), Csp does not require Hsc70 for its interaction with CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	344	 Third, Csp overexpression stabilized CFTR band B, which is contrary to the result expected for a protein that promotes degradation.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	345	 Finally, previous data indicate a positive role for Csp in protein folding processes, also favoring the first model of Csp interaction.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	346	 As is true of other DnaJ proteins, Csp can bind to unfolded proteins and prevent their aggregation (49).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	347	 This activity is synergistic with the similar action of Hsc70.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Together, these findings suggest that Csp may serve as a co-chaperone during CFTR biogenesis.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	349	Csp Interactions with the N terminus and R-domain-- With regard to protein interactions that could regulate CFTR biogenesis, it is interesting that Csp has the capacity to bind to both the R-domain and the CFTR N terminus.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	350	 Previous studies implicate the N terminus as a site important for the normal processing of CFTR and suggest that interactions of the R-domain with other CFTR subdomains may facilitate its biogenesis (3).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	351	 N-terminal truncations of CFTR are poorly processed, and little of the truncated protein is able to traffic to the plasma membrane.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	352	 In addition, several N-terminal disease mutations are processing mutants.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	353	 Several studies indicate that a pivotal point in CFTR synthesis is the generation of the R-domain.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	354	 Before synthesis of the R-domain, CFTR is unstable and is associated with chaperones to prevent NBD aggregation (53, 54).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	355	 Once the R-domain is formed, chaperone protein associations with CFTR decrease, and the nascent protein becomes more stable.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	356	 Other studies indicate that mutations near the N terminus of CFTR which lead ultimately to protein degradation are not recognized by the ER-associated degradation machinery until the R-domain is synthesized (3).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	357	 This implies that degradation processes recognize structural interfaces between CFTR subdomains.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	358	 These interdomain effects may be mediated by specific co-chaperones that can interact with several CFTR subdomains to facilitate access of Hsc70 to intermediates in the folding pathway; Csp is a candidate for such interactions.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	359	Finally, the discussion has focused primarily on CFTR biogenesis in the ER; however, it is possible also that the physiological action of Csp involves the trafficking of immature CFTR to post-ER compartments.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	360	 For example, Csp and CFTR could interact in the transition of CFTR to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment or to proximal Golgi regions prior to CFTR glycosylation.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	361	 The mechanistic involvement of Csp in such trafficking processes may parallel its action in regulated exocytic events (see discussion above), presumably exploiting its interaction with Hsc70 to facilitate trafficking protein interactions.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	362	 In addition, a nonconventional pathway for CFTR trafficking has been proposed recently (59, 60) involving direct transit from the ER to the trans-Golgi network, perhaps via an endosomal compartment.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	363	 Csp could be involved in these trafficking steps; however, the significance of their role in CFTR maturation was cell type-dependent, and the presence of this pathway in epithelial cells has not yet been demonstrated.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	364	 Further studies will be necessary to evaluate these possibilities.

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	4	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) encodes a transmembrane protein (CFTR) which functions in part as a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated chloride channel.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	5	 CFTR expression is controlled temporally and cell specifically by mechanisms that are poorly understood.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Insight into CFTR regulation could be facilitated by the successful introduction of the entire 230 kb human CFTR and adjacent sequences into mammalian cells.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	7	 To this end, we have introduced two different CFTR-containing yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) (320 and 620 kb) into Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO) cells.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Clonal cell lines containing human CFTR were identified by PCR, and the genetic and functional analyses of one clone containing each YAC are described.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Integration of the human CFTR-containing YACs into the CHO genome at a unique site in each cell line was demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Southern blot analysis suggested that on the order of one copy of human CFTR was integrated per CHO cell genome.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Fiber-FISH and restriction analysis suggested that CFTR remained grossly intact.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Northern analysis showed full-length, human CFTR mRNA.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Immunoprecipitation followed by phosphorylation with protein kinase demonstrated mature, glycosylated CFTR.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Finally, chloride secretion in response to cAMP indicated the functional nature of the human CFTR.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This study provides several novel results including: (i) functional human CFTRcan be expressed from these YACs; (ii) CHO cells are a permissive environment for expression of human CFTR; (iii) the level of human CFTR expression in CHO cells is unexpectedly high given the lack of endogenous CFTR production; and (iv) the suggestion by Fiber-FISH of CFTR integrity correlates with functional gene expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These YACs and the cell lines derived from them should be useful tools for the study of CFTR expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	17	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population (1 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	18	 It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) leading to the loss of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-stimulated chloride efflux from epithelial cells (2 -4 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	19	 CFTR is a 230 kb gene encoding a 1480 amino acid transmembrane protein which functions as a chloride channel with several other regulatory properties (5 ,6 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	20	 More than 600 mutations in CFTR have been identified in individuals with CF (7 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The most common mutation, a deletion of 3 bp leading to the loss of a phenylalanine residue at position 508, is found in nearly 70% of CF alleles (8 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	22	CFTR is expressed primarily in exocrine epithelia from the lung, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and sweat glands (9 -11 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The expression is generally low in these tissues, although a few specific epithelial cell types, such as the serous cells in the submucosal glands of the lung, have relatively high level expression (12 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The mechanisms that govern the level and the cell specific regulation of CFTR expression have been explored but remain poorly understood.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The putative promoter region lies within 3800 bp of the start site of CFTR transcription and supports low level expression of reporter genes in vitro (13 -16 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	26	 CFTR expression can be induced by cAMP (17 ) and suppressed by phorbol ester (18 ,19 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	27	 (20 ) demonstrated that the induction of CFTR expression by protein kinase A is mediated by an 8 bp cAMP responsive element upstream from CFTR.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	28	 (21 ) analyzed the function of an inverted CCAAT element at -132 to -119 upstream from CFTR in detail.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	29	 They showed that transcription factor binding to this element confers both basal and cAMP-induced CFTR expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The level of CFTR expression also appears to be related to the state of cellular differentiation (22 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Additional regulatory elements have been shown to lie within this 5'-flanking region as well as within the first CFTR intron (23 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	32	 DNase I hypersensitivity sites have been demonstrated within the 120 kb upstream of CFTR, but no correlation with cell type specific CFTR expression was observed (24 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Taken together, these studies provide little insight into the exact mechanisms that determine the level and specificity of CFTR expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	34	One novel approach to study CFTR expression is to introduce the entire 230 kb gene and flanking sequences into mammalian cells.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Obstacles to this approach include: (i) obtaining an appropriate vector containing a full-length, human CFTR without deletions, mutations or rearrangements; (ii) maintaining the integrity of CFTR during vector propagation; and (iii) transferring CFTR intact into appropriate mammalian cells.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) provide potential vectors for such a study.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	37	 YACs containing human CFTR were generated soon after the gene was identified (25 ,26 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Although the genetic structure of these YACs has been studied, the functionality of CFTR contained within them has not been established.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	39	The goal of the present study was to determine if two different YACs containing full-length, human CFTR and ~45 or 335 kb of adjacent upstream sequence can produce functional human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) in mammalian cells.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The analyses that follow demonstrate the functionality of the human CFTR contained within each YAC.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	41	 RESULTS Human CFTR-containing YACs are used to generate stable Chinese hamster ovary cell lines.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	42	Each YAC used in this study contains full-length, human CFTR (Fig.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The neomycin resistance gene (neor) was introduced into the right arm of each YAC and the extent of human sequence surrounding CFTR was determined by restriction analysis.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The smaller YAC, yCFTR325-Neo, is ~320 kb and contains 45 kb of flanking sequence upstream from the CFTR transcriptional unit and 30 kb of 3'-flanking DNA.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The larger YAC, yCFTR8-Neo, is ~620 kb and contains 335 kb of 5'-flanking and 40 kb of 3'-flanking DNA.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Map of the two YACs used in this study.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	47	 yCFTR325-Neo is ~320 kb and contains 45 kb of 5'-flanking and 30 kb of 3'-flanking DNA.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	48	 yCFTR8-Neo is ~620 kb and contains 335 kb of 5'-flanking and 40 kb of 3'-flanking DNA.

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The NruI sites in the human DNA as well as the two sites in the right YAC arm are indicated by `N'.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	51	In separate experiments, Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO) cells were fused with yeast spheroplasts containing one of the two YACs.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	52	 CHO cells that incorporated neor were identified by their clonal growth in the presence of G418.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Approximately 50 colonies of CHO cells from each YAC transfer were present after 2 weeks of G418 selection.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Twenty clones derived using the smaller YAC and 27 clones derived using the larger YAC were randomly selected and sub-cultured.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Fourteen clones containing the smaller YAC and seven containing the larger YAC were randomly selected and analyzed to determine if they contained human CFTR, as described below.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	56	Screening of CHO cell clones for human CFTR was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of genomic DNA using two sets of intron primers, one spanning exon 2 and the other, exon 6a.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	57	 These primers were chosen toward the 5'-end of the gene since neor was located beyond the 3'-end of CFTR.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Seven out of 14 clones derived using the smaller YAC and the six out of seven clones derived from the larger YAC were positive for CFTR exons 2 and 6a.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Control CHO cell DNA was negative under identical reaction conditions.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Clones positive for both exons were analyzed for CFTR mRNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using primers spanning exon 7 to exon 9.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Three out of seven clones derived using the smaller YAC and four out of six clones derived using the larger YAC were positive.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Control CHO cell RNA was negative under identical reaction conditions (data not shown).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Based on this screening, candidates were chosen for further study.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The detailed genetic and functional analyses of the two clones with the highest level of CFTR mRNA are described below.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The cell line designated CS2/C5 was derived using yCFTR325-Neo, and CS1/F2 was derived using yCFTR8-Neo.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	66	 A single site of integration is identified in each cell line.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	67	Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on metaphase nuclei from CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 to determine the site of CFTR integration (Fig.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Using a YAC derived from y37AB12 (25 ) containing the entire CFTR as a probe, the human CFTR was localized to a single locus in each clone.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The human CFTR was integrated at CHO chromosome band 4p21-23 in the CS2/C5 cell line and at CHO chromosome band 5q27 in the CS1/F2 cell line.

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The intensity of the bands from 10 [mu]g of CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 DNA was similar to that obtained from 5 [mu]g of HT-1080 DNA.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	80	 These data suggest that on the order of one copy of CFTR was integrated into the CHO genome in each cell line.

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In the absence of endogenous CFTR activity in CHO cells, the release of 36Cl- from the cell layer of the clones in response to cAMP indicates the presence of functional human CFTR produced from the introduced YACs.

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	153	This study describes the generation of two clonal CHO cell lines, CS2/C5 and CS1/F2, containing full-length, human CFTR.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	154	 These cell lines were derived from the fusion of CHO cells with yeast spheroplasts containing two different YACs which include human CFTR and ~75 or 375 kb of adjacent sequences.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on metaphase nuclei to indicate the site of YAC integration.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	156	 A single site of integration on a different CHO chromosome was found in each cell line.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Southern analysis suggested that each clone most likely contains on the order of one copy of human CFTR per CHO cell genome.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Fiber-FISH suggested the gross structural integrity of the transferred CFTR in both cell lines.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The integrity of the integrated CFTR was indicated further by restriction analysis of genomic DNA.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	160	 These results suggested that the majority of human CFTR was grossly intact and correlated with functionalCFTR production, potentially extending the application of Fiber-FISH beyond its current status as a genetic mapping tool (28 ,29 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The Fiber-FISH also suggested that the flanking sequences common to both YACs were present in both cell lines.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Finally, the sequence-tagged site, sL12, located at the extreme 5'-end of yCFTR8-Neo (26 ) was detected in DNA from CS1/F2 cells suggesting that this larger YAC is incorporated in its entirety into the CHO genome (data not shown).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	163	The parental YACs used in these experiments were constructed several years ago (25 ,26 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Although the human CFTR contained in these YACs has been shown to be grossly intact, even after transfer into Chinese hamster fibroblasts (30 ), the functionality of the CFTR has not been established until now.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The present study demonstrates the production of full-length CFTR mRNA and functional protein by both CS2/C5 and CS1/F2.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Human CFTR production in these cell lines implies that the regulatory elements needed for gene expression are contained within these YACs.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The ability of these cells to produce mature and functional protein at the cell surface for more than 15 passages is demonstrated by cAMP-stimulated 36Cl- efflux.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	168	 CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 are distinctive from the other clonal lines generated in this study because their CFTR mRNA can be detected by both RT-PCR and Northern analysis.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	169	 None of the other cell lines created in this study and analyzed by Northern analysis have comparable mRNA transcripts.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	170	The rate of 36Cl- efflux observed in both CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 at early passages is similar to that seen in T84 cells, despite the fact that they have lower CFTR mRNA and protein levels than T84 cells.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	171	 This data supports previous studies in which cAMP-mediated chloride efflux was a sensitive indicator of functional protein without direct correlation with the level of CFTR expression (31 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	172	Ordinarily, YAC gene transfer is carried out in a mammalian cell line in which the gene of interest is endogenously expressed, placing the YAC into an environment likely to be permissive for the human promoter (32 -35 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	173	 In contrast, the present study demonstrates YAC-mediated gene transfer into cells lacking endogenous CFTR production (36 ,37 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	174	 It is unclear why only human CFTR appears to be functionally expressed when both the endogenous and transferred genes could potentially interact with the same basal transcription factors.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Several aspects of YAC integration may support expression of the transferred human CFTR in these CHO cell clones.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	176	 For example, it has been suggested that transferred YACs may retain a chromatin structure that favors expression (38 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	177	 CFTR expression from these YACs may be favored by the requirement that the nearby neor has to be expressed in order for the cells to survive, forcing the adjacent chromatin to remain open.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	178	 In addition, the human and hamster genes could have different affinities for DNA binding proteins.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	179	 An alternative explanation is that the hamster CFTR is mutated and cannot produce functional CFTR.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	180	 To better understand the differential expression of the hamster and human genes, it would be useful to directly compare the structure of the two genes.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	181	 However, this work remains to be done because hamster CFTR has not yet been extensively characterized.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In the present studies, full length human CFTR probes did not clearly cross hybridize with control CHO cells, suggesting there is very little homology between the hamster and human CFTR, or perhaps that the gene is absent in the control CHO line.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	183	The etiology of the unexpectedly high level of human CFTR expression in these CHO cell lines is also unclear.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Each clonal cell line produces mRNA and protein at easily detectable levels.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The FISH and Southern analysis suggest that this level of expression is likely a consequence of CFTR integrated at a unique locus in each cell line at a copy number on the order of one per CHO genome.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	186	 In contrast, when the techniques employed in the present study are applied to evaluate CFTR expression in normal diploid human epithelial cells, it is difficult to detect CFTR mRNA (10 ) or protein (S.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Cheng, Genzyme, Framingham, MA, pers.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The level of CFTR expression could be related to a number of factors including the regulatory sequences within the YAC vector, the distance the gene lies from the YAC ends and the integration site in the host genome (32 ,38 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Another potential positive influence on CFTR promoter function is the SV40 enhancer that supports neor expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The SV40 enhancer has been shown to augment CFTR promoter function in reporter gene constructs (15 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	191	 In addition to these factors, the liberation of the gene from a negative regulatory element, possibly downstream, in a region not included in either YAC, could result in higher than expected expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Other CFTR-containing YACs with additional flanking sequences are available (26 ) and could be used to address this issue.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	193	The similar levels of human CFTR expression in CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 cells suggest that the expression is independent of the site of integration.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Such position independent expression is not necessarily expected in cell lines created by YAC transfer.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	195	 It has been postulated that a buffer of DNA sequence might insulate the gene of interest from positional effects at the site of integration (32 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	196	 The extensive amount of sequence upstream from CFTR in these YACs could potentially act as a buffer and might account for the similar level of expression seen in the two different clones.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The detailed analysis of more clones derived from each YAC would be necessary to determine how any of these factors contribute to the level of human CFTR expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	198	This study demonstrates that the CFTR contained within the YACs used in this study are free of gross rearrangements and are functional.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Furthermore, the expression of the introduced gene indicates that sufficient sequence is present to promote human CFTR expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Although this is the first study investigating the function of the full-length, human CFTR contained within YACs, a limited number of studies have documented functional protein production from other human genes transferred to mammalian cells by YAC vectors (34 ,38 -42 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	201	 These cell lines often have appropriate regulation of the transferred genes and have been used to study various aspects of gene expression (38 ,39 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	202	The CFTR-containing YACs and cell lines described in this paper offer several advantages over other model systems for the study of CFTR expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Analysis of the role of the intron sequences and the flanking sequences contained within these CFTR-containing YACs may help to elucidate the regulation of CFTR expression in ways not possible when cell lines are created with cDNA constructs (36 ,43 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	204	 In addition, the cells in this study do not have a growth disadvantage when compared to the parental CHO cells.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Finally, these YACs can be manipulated in yeast to generate mutations in CFTR or modified to include reporter genes in place of human sequences.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Thus, these YACs and the cell lines derived from them should be useful tools for the study of CFTR gene expression.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	4	We have previously described a protocol for the simultaneous isolation and reconstitution of a protein kinase A (PKA)-sensitive outwardly rectified chloride channel (ORCC) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) from bovine tracheal epithelium.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Immunoprecipitation of CFTR from this preparation prevented PKA activation of the ORCC, suggesting that CFTR regulated the ORCC and that this regulatory relationship was preserved throughout the purification procedure.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We now report the purification of CFTR from bovine tracheal epithelia and the purification of a CFTR conduction mutant (G551D CFTR) from retrovirally transduced mouse L cells using a combination of alkali stripping, Triton-X extraction, and immunoaffinity chromatography.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Immunopurified CFTR proteins were reconstituted in the absence and presence of ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	8	 To test the hypothesis that only functional CFTR can support activation of ORCC by PKA and ATP, we used an inhibitory anti-CFTR peptide antibody or G551D CFTR.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	9	 When anti-CFTR peptide antibodies were present prior to the addition of PKA and ATP, activation of both the ORCC and CFTR was prevented.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	10	 If the antibody was added after activation of the ORCC and CFTR Cl channels by PKA and ATP, only the CFTR Cl channel was inhibited.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	11	 When ORCC and G551D CFTR were co-incorporated into planar bilayers, only the ORCC was recorded and this channel could not be further activated by the addition of PKA and ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Thus, functional CFTR is required for activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	13	 We also tested the hypothesis that PKA activation of ORCC was dependent on the extracellular presence of ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	14	 We added ATP on the presumed extracellular side of the lipid bilayer under conditions where it was not possible to activate the ORCC, i.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	15	 in the presence of inhibitory anti-CFTR antibody or G551D CFTR.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In both cases the ORCC regained PKA sensitivity.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Moreover, the addition of hexokinase + glucose to the extracellular side prevented activation of the ORCCs by PKA and ATP in the presence of CFTR.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	18	 These experiments confirm that both the presence of CFTR as well as the presence of ATP on the extracellular side is required for activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	19	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ()and outwardly rectified chloride channels (ORCC) both contribute to cAMP-activated chloride conductance in normal, but not in cystic fibrosis (CF), airway cells (1, 2) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	20	 ORCCs are present in the apical membranes of CF airway epithelia, but they cannot be activated by protein kinase A (PKA) and ATP(3, 4, 5) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	21	 CFTR channels are regulated by PKA and ATP and are inhibited by the channel blocker diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC) but not by 4,4`-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2`-disulfonic acid (DIDS)(6, 7) , whereas ORCCs are DIDS-sensitive.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Although CFTR and ORCC channels are distinct proteins, they are linked through unknown regulatory pathways.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Different mechanisms by which CFTR might regulate the ORCC can be envisioned.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	24	 For example, CFTR could interact directly with the ORCC protein in the apical membrane, regulation could be a consequence of the channel function of CFTR, or both.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	25	 It has been shown that CFTR can act as both an ATP and a Cl channel(6) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Recently Guggino's group (7) demonstrated that ATP transported through CFTR acts as an autocrine stimulator of the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The proposed mechanism of regulation is via a P receptor that, either through a direct coupling to the ORCC or through a G protein-coupled signaling pathway, stimulates the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	28	Increasing evidence suggests heterogeneity in the molecular pathogenesis of CF.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Some mutations, such as the deletion of a phenylalanine at position 508 (Phe-508) of CFTR, cause CFTR to be processed improperly within epithelial cells, and disease may result because the mutant protein fails to traffic to the apical cell membrane.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Other mutations, such as the relatively common glycine aspartic acid replacement at CFTR position 551 (G551D, 3% of all mutations), appear to be processed and targeted normally to the plasma membrane, but lack responsiveness to stimulation by cAMP(8) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	31	 It is not known how different mutational forms of CFTR affect regulation of the ORCC by PKA.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	32	Amino acid sequence analysis suggests that CFTR is composed of two motifs, each containing a membrane-spanning domain (MSD) and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) linked by a regulatory R domain(9) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Recently, Welsh and colleagues (10) demonstrated that the amino-terminal portion of CFTR, which includes MSD1, NBD1, and the R domain, forms a regulated Cl channel.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	34	 It has been shown previously that an even smaller part of CFTR, namely NBD1 (amino acids 426-588), can form an anion channel when reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers(11) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	35	 It is not known if these portions of the CFTR molecule can also transport ATP or if they are sufficient to replace intact CFTR in the regulation of the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	36	We recently reported the simultaneous isolation and functional reconstitution of an ORCC and CFTR from bovine tracheal epithelia(12) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The regulatory relationship between these channel proteins was preserved throughout the purification procedure, as demonstrated by the activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Immunoprecipitation of CFTR from this preparation prevented the activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP, suggesting that the presence of CFTR is required for PKA-dependent activation of the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	39	 However, these experiments did not distinguish if functional CFTR was essential for conferring PKA sensitivity to the ORCC, if only the physical interaction of CFTR was required, or both.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	40	We thus tested the hypothesis that the functional form of CFTR is required for PKA activation of the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	41	 In order to achieve this goal, we used an inhibitory anti-CFTR peptide antibody (13, 14, 15) to block CFTR transport function or replaced functional CFTR with a nonfunctional mutant form of CFTR, namely G551D CFTR(8) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Our results indicate that only when CFTR is functional can the ORCC be activated by PKA and ATP.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	170	 However, it would be premature to draw any conclusions about the exact molar ratio of ORCC and CFTR necessary for interaction from these bilayer experiments, because in other comparable experiments two to five CFTR channels per single ORCC have been observed.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	171	 In contrast to these results obtained with anti-CFTR antibodies added after PKA + ATP activation of incorporated channels, addition of inhibitory anti-CFTR antibodies prior to addition of PKA and ATP prevented activation of both CFTR and ORCC by PKA + ATP (n = 11; Fig.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Notably, rectification of ORCC upon PKA-induced phosphorylation did not change.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The slope conductance of ORCC at positive voltages was not altered under any conditions.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	189	 These results support the hypothesis that the active form of CFTR is required for activation of ORCC by PKA and ATP.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Separation of ORCC from co-purified ORCC and CFTR was achieved by immunodepletion of CFTR from the preparation.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The removal of CFTR was confirmed by the absence of a 170-kDa phosphoprotein and lack of activation by PKA + ATP of reconstituted ORCC incorporated into planar lipid bilayers, as described earlier (12) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	193	 G551D CFTR was immunopurified as described under ``Methods'' and co-reconstituted with the preparation containing ORCC but devoid of CFTR.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	194	 For replacement of normal CFTR with G551D CFTR we used autoradiography/densitometry to estimate the intensity of the in vitro phosphorylated CFTR (170 kDa) band and replaced normal CFTR with a similar amount of G551D CFTR, as G551D CFTR can also be in vitro phosphorylated.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Under these conditions following incorporation into the bilayer, only the ORCC was recorded with no change in open probability upon addition of PKA and ATP to one (either cis or trans) side of the bilayer (P = 0.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	196	05; n = 9 in presence of PKA + ATP).
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Detailed analysis of the electrical properties of ORCC revealed a change in its rectification properties in the presence of G551D CFTR in the negative potential quadrant, similar to what was described for ORCC in the presence of normal CFTR (see Fig.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	198	 In three separate experiments, liposomes containing only G551D CFTR were fused with a bilayer already containing ORCC but not CFTR.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	199	 The presence of G551D CFTR, like incorporation of wild type CFTR, produced a change in the rectification properties of ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	200	 In only 2 experiments from a total 26 performed, ORCC incorporated from liposomes presumably containing both ORCC and G551D CFTR displayed properties identical to ORCC incorporated from CFTR-immunodepleted preparations.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	201	 These observations allowed us to conclude that the change of rectification was indicative of the presence of G551D CFTR in a bilayer containing ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Nonetheless, the ORCC was not activated by PKA + ATP in these experiments (n = 9), thus supporting the hypothesis that the conductive form of CFTR was required for the activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	203	 However, in three experiments in which PKA and ATP were added to both sides of a bilayer containing ORCC and G551D CFTR, the activity of ORCC was increased 2-fold (from 0.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	204	Effect of Extracellular ATP on Activation of ORCC by PKA and ATPIt has been shown that CFTR is both a Cl and an ATP channel(6) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	205	 To test if the transport of ATP by CFTR is required for activation of the ORCC, we added an ATP scavenging system, hexokinase (0.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	206	5 unit/ml) + glucose(5 mM), to the presumptive extracellular side of the bilayer containing incorporated ORCC and CFTR Cl channels.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The presence of hexokinase + glucose on the presumptive extracellular side did not influence activation of the CFTR channel by PKA + ATP added to the opposite side of the bilayer, but it did prevent the PKA-mediated activation of ORCC (n = 12).
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	208	 These results are in contrast to the PKA-mediated activation of ORCC and CFTR seen in the absence of hexokinase and glucose (cf.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	209	The aforementioned results suggested that ATP secretion through CFTR may be required for the PKA-induced activation of the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Addition of ATP by itself from the presumptive extracellular side did not have any effect on the channel activity of the incorporated ORCC + CFTR.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	211	 If transport of ATP through CFTR was the only requirement for PKA-mediated activation of the ORCC, it should be possible to activate ORCC by the addition of ATP to the extracellular solution and PKA + ATP to the cytoplasmic side of the system.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	212	 However, when ORCC alone was incorporated into a bilayer, this channel could not be activated by addition of 100  microM ATP to the ``outside'' and PKA + ATP to the ``inside'' or by PKA + ATP to both bathing solutions (see Fig.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	213	 These results suggest that transport of ATP through CFTR is not the only role that CFTR plays in the regulation of the ORCC.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	219	We therefore examined if the presence of ATP on the presumptive extracellular side of a bilayer containing ORCC and nonfunctional CFTR (i.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	220	 either blocked with the inhibitory antibody or nonfunctional G551D CFTR) could restore PKA sensitivity to the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Under both conditions, namely, in the presence of inhibitory antibodies (Fig.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	222	 7), the ORCC regained PKA sensitivity when 100  microM ATP was added to the extracellular bathing medium.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	223	 These findings also confirmed the hypothesis that transport of ATP is not the only role that CFTR plays in the regulation of ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	224	 These results also indicate that G551D CFTR, like wild-type CFTR, incorporated into the membrane with a specific orientation in the presence of ORCC.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	230	We also tested whether a portion of CFTR, namely the NBD1 domain, could interact with the ORCC in the presence of extracellular ATP and be sufficient for PKA-mediated activation of ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	231	 However, in four separate experiments, we found that NBD1 could not substitute for full-sized CFTR in the regulation of ORCC by PKA and ATP added from either or both sides of the membrane.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	232	Our results demonstrate that we have immunopurified and functionally reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers bovine CFTR and nonconductive G551D CFTR from transduced L cells.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	233	 A similar immunopurification procedure for the isolation and reconstitution of recombinant, and functionally competent, CFTR from Chinese hamster ovary and Sf9 cells was reported recently(24) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Our reconstituted proteins were used with purified and functionally reconstituted ORCC (as described previously) for further delineation of the mechanism of interaction between CFTR and the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	235	Immunopurified and reconstituted bovine CFTR Cl channel had the same ion selectivity, inhibitor specificity, and inhibition by anti-CFTR antibodies as reported previously in patch clamp studies or for reconstituted recombinant CFTR(7, 13, 25) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	236	 The main difference between the previously reported characteristics of the CFTR Cl channel and the bovine CFTR Cl channel was the single channel conductance.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	237	 In our experiments the conductance of bovine CFTR was 16 picosiemens, somewhat larger than that previously reported (8-13 picosiemens).
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	238	 The conductance of the CFTR channel in our hands was the same regardless of the antibody that was used for purification or the presence or absence of the ORCC in the reconstituted material.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	239	 The reason for this discrepancy is not apparent.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	240	Our study demonstrated that only when the transport function of CFTR was intact could the activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP occur.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Our results also support Guggino's (7) hypothesis that one function of CFTR in the activation of the ORCC is to transport ATP to the extracellular side of the cell membrane.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	242	 This hypothesis is consistent with the findings of Reisin et al.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	243	(6) who have demonstrated directly that ATP can traverse the CFTR channel.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	244	 We cannot at present exclude the co-purification of a purinergic receptor by our procedures.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	245	 However, it is unlikely that a receptor-coupled mechanism would be active in the bilayer system because of the absence of necessary signaling molecules.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	246	 However, the failure of ORCC to be activated by PKA + ATP in the presence of external ATP supports the idea that a purinergic receptor mediated pathway does not co-purify in our preparation.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The second finding revealed by our study is that a nonconductive form of CFTR (G551D) was able to support activation of the ORCC by PKA when ATP was present on the extracellular side of the incorporated channels.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	248	It has been shown previously that the portion of CFTR that includes MSD1, NBD1, and the R domain, or even smaller parts of CFTR (NBD1 amino acids 426-588), can form Cl channels(10, 11) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	249	 We tested whether NBD1 could substitute for CFTR in the regulation of the ORCC by PKA by ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Under the conditions used in these studies, NBD1 did not form a channel in the bilayer and therefore was not able to substitute for CFTR.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Furthermore, a recombinant NBD1 purified from prokaryotic cells was unable to support activation by PKA of the ORCC in the presence of exogenously added extracellular ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Taken together these results suggest that there is a minimal size requirement of CFTR necessary to subserve its regulatory role in the PKA-related activation of the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	253	In summary, we have immunopurified and functionally reconstituted CFTR from bovine trachea and nonconductive G551D CFTR from transduced L cells.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	254	 In combination with previously co-purified ORCC and CFTR from bovine tracheal epithelia, and inhibitory anti-CFTR antibodies, we were able to explore the regulatory relationship between the ORCC and CFTR.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	255	 We have shown that functional CFTR is required for activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	256	 CFTR is apparently required to transport ATP from the cytoplasm to the extracellular bathing solution, where it can then interact with some external domain of the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	257	 The observation that the ORCC cannot be activated by extracellular ATP and PKA + ATP added to the cytoplasmic side in the absence of the CFTR molecule also suggests that, in addition to the transport (ATP) function of CFTR, a direct interaction between CFTR and ORCC is essential to confer PKA sensitivity to the ORCC.

0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	13	 One of the major clinical manifestations of CFTR mutations is excessive airway inflammation (14-17), implying that CFTR affects the immune function of airway epithelial cells, particularly the expression of nuclear factor (NF)-B-dependent proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Several lines of experimental evidence suggest that CFTR dysfunction influences the exogenous activation of epithelial immune function (8, 30).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Bacteria persist in the respiratory tract of CF patients due to decreased antimicrobial activity in CF airway surface fluid and impair bacterial clearance due to mucus plugging (25).

0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The F508 mutant CFTR not only fails to transport Cl in response to cAMP but accumulates in the ER due to abnormal maturation and folding (1, 7, 32).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	28	 From experimental data generated with adenovirus mutants targeted for retention in the ER, Pahl and colleagues (18, 19) proposed that homozygous F508 mutations in CFTR would similarly cause Ca2+ release, activation of NF-B, and resultant transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Although these observations were consistent with the hypothesis that abnormal CFTR proteins cause endogenous activation of NF-B, they did not differentiate between two possible mechanisms: that "cell stress" associated with CFTR mistrafficking leads to changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and stimulation of NF-B translocation or that CFTR Cl channel dysfunction by itself is associated with endogenous activation of NF-B.

0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	42	In the experiments detailed in this report, several matched cell lines with CFTR dysfunction due to lack of Cl channel function, CFTR misfolding, mistrafficking, or both were tested for endogenous activation of NF-B and basal IL-8 expression.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Although CFTR mistrafficking typical of the common F508 mutation and associated cell stress may be responsible for the increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with CF cells, we sought to establish whether CFTR Cl channel function as well as the effects of CFTR mistrafficking contributes to endogenous activation of NF-B and the excessive inflammation that characterizes CF airway pathology.

0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	127	 To determine whether the activation of NF-B seen in the epithelial cell lines with dysfunctional CFTR is associated with an IL-8 response, IL-8 expression was assessed with RT-PCR (Fig.

0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Clinical studies have clearly established a direct correlation between infection, IL-8 secretion, and the accumulation of PMNs and their toxic products in the CF lung (14-17).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Bacterial stimulation of cells with CFTR mutations activates significantly greater cytokine expression than matched cells with normal CFTR function (5, 8, 29, 30).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Several reports (8, 28) suggest that cells with CFTR dysfunction have endogenously upregulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Young infants with CF, even without detectable evidence of prior infection, have PMNs and increased amounts of IL-8 in their airways (14), and proinflammatory cytokine expression is increased in cells cultured directly from uninfected CF tissues (28).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	162	 These findings are consistent with the in vitro studies demonstrating endogenous activation of NF-B in CF but not in corrected cell lines.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	163	 As indicated by the data in this report, lack of CFTR Cl channel function and the physiological consequences of mistrafficked mutant CFTR both appear to contribute to the endogenous activation of NF-B in CF airway cells, which is manifested by the increased expression of IL-8 in these cells, even in the absence of bacterial stimulation.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	164	There is evidence of endogenous activation of NF-B in cells with CFTR dysfunction due to several different mechanisms.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	165	 In previous studies, IB3 cells, which express the W1282X/F508 mutation associated with mistrafficked CFTR that accumulates in the ER, were found to have significant amounts of the p65 component of NF-B in nuclei under basal conditions in which there was no nuclear NF-B in the corrected C-38 cells (8).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Because the translocation of NF-B can be associated with many types of stimuli, additional consequences of accumulated mutant CFTR in the ER were also demonstrated in the mutant cell line.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The IB3 cells were found to have higher basal [Ca2+]i, a predicted consequence of "ER stress" (2, 18).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The presence of nuclear NF-B in the IB3 cells could be correlated with increased IL-8 expression as estimated by RT-PCR compared with that in the control C-38 cell line.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The concentration of IL-8 in the tissue culture supernatant was minimal in these cells after an 18-h incubation in serum-free medium; however, the relative amount of IL-8 message was consistent with a previous report by DiMango et al.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Not all investigators have found increased endogenous levels of IL-8 associated with CFTR mutations (30).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Cell culture conditions, effects of FCS, and handling of the monolayers all can affect the translocation of NF-B and endogenous expression of IL-8.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Thus it seems relevant to demonstrate that the presence of nuclear p65 appears to be associated with the expected biological response, namely IL-8 expression.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	173	The activation of other NF-B-dependent pathways is not necessarily increased in IB3 compared with C-38 cells.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Stimulation of NF-B translocation is associated with an antiapoptotic effect in many cell lines including respiratory epithelial cells.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Rates of apoptosis can be increased by proteasome inhibitors that inhibit IB degradation and block NF-B translocation (31).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	176	 In a study published recently (23), the rates of IB3 and C-38 cell apoptosis were equivalent both under control conditions and after bacterial stimulation despite the observed differences in endogenous nuclear NF-B.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Thus the association between CFTR dysfunction, activation of NF-B, and transcription of NF-B-dependent genes is somewhat selective and is not a global response.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	178	The consequences of CFTR mistrafficking and the activation of NF-B were further demonstrated in CHO cells that do not normally express CFTR.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The presence of the mistrafficked mutant F508 CFTR was a significant stimulus for NF-B activation in CHO cells.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The G551D CFTR, which does not function appropriately as a Cl channel but is trafficked normally to the apical surface of the respiratory epithelial cell (10), did not stimulate NF-B.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Expression of normal CFTR from the same plasmid construct did not cause NF-B activation in CHO cells nor did transfection with the empty vector or the luciferase reporter construct.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Although both the G551D and F508 CFTR mutations are associated with clinical disease and lack of Cl secretion in response to cAMP (10), the major difference between these mutants is the mistrafficking and accumulation of F508 CFTR within the ER.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Thus it appears that the consequences of mistrafficking of F508 are sufficient to activate NF-B in CHO cells.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	184	In epithelial cells, unlike CHO cells, there appears to be a requirement for normal CFTR function in regulating NF-B-dependent gene transcription.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The homozygous F508 or the compound F508/W1282X mutation could activate NF-B by two independent mechanisms: cell stress associated with mistrafficking or effects directly due to lack of CFTR Cl channel activity.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Cell lines that lack CFTR Cl function due to either the overproduction of the CFTR R-domain or the expression of CFTR antisense had activated NF-B and significant amounts of endogenous IL-8 production compared with the corresponding control cell lines.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The amount of IL-8 endogenously expressed by these cell lines was greater than that of the IB3 or C38 cells and could be quantified by a standard ELISA assay.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The presence of the p65 component of NF-B in nuclei of undisturbed cells grown on coverslips as well as the relative activation of an NF-B reporter construct compared with appropriate controls indicates that their activated state is unlikely to be an artifact of either cell transformation or manipulations occurring during cell culture.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Because neither the 9/HTEo/pCep-R or the 16HBE/cftr antisense cells have excessive CFTR accumulation in the ER, the lack of CFTR Cl channel function in these epithelial cells appears to be responsible for the observed increase in NF-B activation and IL-8 expression.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	190	Exactly how CFTR dysfunction contributes to the activation and nuclear localization of NF-B is unclear.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	191	 There are multiple mechanisms for NF-B activation that can be divided into signal-dependent and signal-independent pathways (20).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	192	 In airway epithelial cells, bacterial attachment to asialo-GM1 activates a Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway that results in NF-B activation and IL-8 transcription through a cascade that includes phosphorylation of both the p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase families of mitogen-activated protein kinases (23a).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	193	 A signal-independent pathway, perhaps involving IB or NF-B regulation directly, may be affected by mistrafficked CFTR.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	194	 IB- has been shown to be increased in IB3 cells under basal conditions and is hypophosphorylated, enabling nuclear NF-B with bound IB- complexes to direct transcription (30).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Hypophosphorylated IB- may be involved in either signal-dependent or the persistent activation of NF-B (26).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Diminished levels of cytosolic IB- was associated with CF (F508/F508) bronchial gland cells in primary culture and correlated with the presence of nuclear NF-B Rel A (27).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	197	 It is possible that CFTR function, perhaps by affecting pH in specific intracellular compartments (3), affects relevant kinase or phosphatase activity.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Abnormalities in signal transducer and activator of transduction-1 phosphorylation in the same 9/HTEo/pCep-R cells have been described recently (13), indicating that CFTR may have a role in multiple signaling pathways.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	199	 These observations reflect the complexities of CFTR involvement in the normal physiology of the epithelial cell.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Strategies such as gene therapy to correct CFTR Cl channel function alone, which do not ameliorate the effects of mutant CFTR mistrafficking in the majority of airway epithelial cells, may not be sufficient to control the inflammatory component of CF lung disease.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	201	These consequences of CFTR dysfunction in activating translocation of NF-B and stimulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines are important in not only understanding the many roles of CFTR in normal cell physiology but are also clinically relevant.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The majority of CF patients with the most common F508 CFTR alleles have multiple reasons for increased expression of inflammatory mediators in their airways.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	203	 The effects of CFTR mistrafficking and ER stress, lack of CFTR Cl channel function, and exogenous stimulation due to airway infection all act to increase epithelial NF-B translocation and the expression of proinflammatory genes.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	204	 This epithelial immune activation does provide multiple targets for therapy.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	205	 It may be possible to devise a therapy to modulate the endogenous upregulation of NF-B-dependent gene transcription without compromising the epithelial barrier function or the host inflammatory response to exogenous airway pathogens.

0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	1	Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15238.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	2	RESEARCH IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) remains at the leading edge of investigations employing human genetics and molecular and cellular biology.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	3	 In the 12 years since the discovery of the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl channel (14), translation of such efforts clinically has been remarkable and includes 1) identification of almost 1,000 different mutations (http://www.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	4	ca/cftr), including 70% with a phenylalanine deletion (F508) that has led to successful clinical detection of individuals with a family history (even before the completion of the human genome project) and 2) ~20 trials of human CF gene therapy involving dosing to the nose or airways (2, 22).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Such rapid progress, however, belies the complexity of the CFTR gene and the pathophysiology of CF.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	6	CFTR is a unique member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter gene family in that it 1) conducts Cl, 2) transports substrates across membranes in a nonconductive fashion (e.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	7	, facilitates ATP release), 3) regulates other ion channel proteins (e.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	8	, positive regulation of outwardly rectifying Cl channels or negative regulation of Na+ channels), and 4) regulates intracellular compartment acidification and protein processing (18).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Such complexity has led these authors to categorize defects in CF respiratory epithelium as primary (dehydration associated with dysfunctional Cl transport), secondary (hyperabsorption of Na+), or tertiary (enhanced binding of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; proinflammatory environment).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Fundamental to such diversity is the awareness that very minor mutations (e.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	11	, F508, a single-amino acid deletion within a 1,480-amino acid protein) result in the profound pathological phenotype of CF (23).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In the case of F508, the missense mutation results in a mutant CFTR that is believed to fold improperly, and such defects in its biosynthesis and trafficking result in little or no surface CFTR.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Other mutations in CFTR lead to genotypic or phenotypic changes that span the range from no CFTR in the membrane to CFTR that reaches the membrane but does not respond to appropriate stimuli or conduct Cl (6).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Adding to this complexity is a recent report describing tissue-specific changes in the impairment of F508 processing (10).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Some mutations overlap with PDZ-interacting domains on the COOH terminus of CFTR that are required for polarization of CFTR to the apical membrane of respiratory epithelium (13) and may underscore CFTR regulation of other ion channels by affecting the relationship between accessory proteins, linker proteins, and regulatory cofactors.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	16	Accordingly, research into the biosynthesis and trafficking of wild-type and mutated CFTR is at the forefront of CF investigations.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Although the defect in Cl conductance is critical to the pathology of CF respiratory epithelia, contributions of alterations in vesicle trafficking, protein processing, and immune function clearly contribute to the pathogenesis and maintenance of CF (18).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	18	 These efforts underlie the disparities between genotype and phenotype in CF and suggest that in addition to nucleotide repair (gene therapy, aminoglycoside-dependent restoration of readthrough of full-length CFTR), pharmacotherapy targeted toward improved biosynthesis of mutated CFTR may be a useful adjunct approach to the treatment of CF (24).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	19	The importance of providing mechanistic support for pharmacologically affecting the maturation of CF is placed in the context of our current molecular physiological understanding of the roles of various chaperones for CFTR by Brodsky (4) in this issue of the American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The steps in proper folding of CFTR, quality control mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum trafficking, and requisite association with various chaperones are outlined by Brodsky and reference is made to three original articles in the Special Topic.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The mechanisms by which sodium 4-phenylbutyrate may be a modulator of such chaperones are presented by Rubenstein and Lyons (17) and Choo-Kang and Zeitlin (5), and the in vivo efficacy of a chemical chaperone, trimethylamine oxide, in the restoration of defective Cl conductance in the critical target tissue (intestinal epithelium) of CFTR null mutant mice is presented by Fischer et al.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This collective work strongly supports the concept that small molecules are useful alternative or adjunct therapies for disorders of protein folding (23, 24).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	23	A critical aspect of CF is chronic airway inflammation, and several groups have provided support that dysregulation of the inflammatory response is an intrinsic component of such a phenotype.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	24	 An editorial by Blackwell et al.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	25	 (1) accompanies the manuscript by Weber et al.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	26	 (21) and highlights the central role of unregulated nuclear factor (NF)-B in the proinflammatory cytokine profile of cells expressing mutated CFTR.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In this regard, blocking the production of NF-B may be an alternative rational therapeutic approach in CF therapy.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In addition to enhanced cytokine (interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-) production, oxidative stress appears to be a component of CF epithelia.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Previous in vitro work (9, 11) showed that CFTR is associated with the transport of glutathione (GSH).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In the current Special Topic, Gao et al.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	31	 (8) show that the Cl channel-forming peptide N-K4-M2GlyR increased Cl secretion and GSH efflux in a human CF airway epithelial cell line, suggesting that apical Cl conductance (but not necessarily CFTR function per se) is coupled to GSH efflux.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	32	 (20) report in this issue that GSH was decreased in the epithelial lining fluid of CFTR-deficient mice and that an imbalance in antioxidant defense in CFTR-deficient mice was evident.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	33	 These data extend previous observations that GSH was decreased in the airway fluid of humans with CFTR (16) and that aerosol delivery of GSH may be a useful therapy for CF (15).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	34	 GSH and other cellular defense mechanisms may indeed represent a rational therapeutic strategy in CF.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	35	As noted above, Na+ hyperabsorption is a critical secondary-like phenomenon in CF epithelia.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Although the mechanism coupling such hyperabsorption to CFTR mutations remains unknown, an extracellular serine protease-mediated signaling pathway has been identified (19) that activates an amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In the Special Topic in this issue, Bridges et al.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	38	 (3) show that human bronchial epithelial cells are sensitive to aprotinin.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Using the Kunitz domain of aprotinin as a pharmacophore, they show that BAY 39-9437, a recombinant Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, decreased Na+ absorption in non-CF and CF human bronchial epithelia.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	40	This is the first of a series of special topics that will appear routinely in the American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The purpose of these special calls is to highlight areas of significant interest in respiratory biology by soliciting input from a broad research community, fast tracking the submitted manuscripts through the review process, and publishing them under their own separate heading.

0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	43	 This led to the seven manuscripts and two accompanying editorials that appear in the current issue.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	44	 This remarkable and timely turnaround in peer review is a testimony to the importance of the topic and the enthusiasm of the authors and reviewers to bring this information to our readership.

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	5	CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF), a common lethal genetic disease of Caucasians, results from mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a member of the ABC superfamily of transport proteins (28).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	6	 CFTR is a cAMP-activated anion channel and channel regulator that functions at the apical membrane of polarized epithelia to regulate secretion in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (37).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Previous studies have shown that CFTR is not a stable component of the plasma membrane but is rather efficiently endocytosed from the cell surface (18, 27, 35) through clathrin-coated pits (4, 5).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Furthermore, such entry of CFTR into the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway is mediated by binding of a tyrosine-based endocytic motif in the carboxyl terminus of CFTR (27, 35) to the medium subunit of the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex (36).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In addition to endocytic motifs, CFTR also interacts with PDZ-domain containing proteins (29, 32) and AMP kinase (10) at its carboxyl terminus and syntax-ins at its amino terminus (24, 25).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	10	 How all these interactions modulate cell surface expression of CFTR is not clear (2, 22), although morphological, biochemical, and functional data indicate that CFTR is present in cell surface and intracellular compartments in both heterologous expression systems and epithelial cells that natively express CFTR (1, 3, 33).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Although much is now known about the mechanisms of CFTR internalization, the fate of internalized CFTR is less well documented.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Previous studies have suggested that internalized CFTR is recycled (31), but the pathway and compartments through which CFTR traverses to undergo recycling are not known.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	13	Endocytosed material is directed initially to a sorting endosomal compartment from which it is directed to one of two destinations.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Some molecules such as the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are retained in the sorting endosome, which matures into and/or fuses with late endosomes (6).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Molecules that are destined to be recycled back to the cell surface are initially targeted to the endosomal recycling compartment (ERC) (9, 23).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	16	 While the ERC has been extensively characterized on the basis of studies of transferrin receptor recycling (39) and insulin-regulated recycling of GLUT-4 (14), there are no data concerning the entry of ion channels, such as CFTR, into this compartment for recycling back to the cell surface.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Rme-1 is an epsin homology (EH) domain containing protein (8) recently identified as a key element in controlling exit from the ERC (15).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	18	 A dominant negative Rme-1 (Rme-1 G429R), when expressed in mammalian cells, has no effect on the endocytosis of integral membrane proteins such as the transferrin receptor but dramatically inhibits the recycling of the transferrin receptor back to the cell surface, trapping the receptor in the ERC (15).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Endocytosed proteins such as LDL, which are targeted to lysosomes and do not enter the ERC, are unaffected.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	20	 We examined the fate of endocytosed CFTR by using dominant negative Rme-1 as a tool for probing transport of CFTR through the ERC.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Isogenic 293 cells stably expressing wild-type CFTR were generated as previously described (30) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and hygromycin (150  microg/ml).

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Experiments were performed 48 h later.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	27	 To monitor recycling of CFTR, we used a modified cell surface biotinylation assay (7, 31, 34).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Briefly, plasma membranes were biotinylated at 4 degrees C using a cleavable reagent (Sulpho-NHS-SS-biotin; Pierce, Rockford, IL) and then warmed up to 37 degrees C to load endocytic vesicles with biotinylated proteins (including CFTR).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Remaining cell surface biotin was removed using MESNA as previously described (34).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Subsequently, the cells were either lysed or rewarmed to 37 degrees C to allow internalized biotinylated CFTR to recycle to the cell surface.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The cells were again cooled to 4 degrees C, the disulphide bonds on recycled cell surface proteins were reduced with MESNA, and the cells were lysed.

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Having shown that internalized CFTR recycles efficiently back to the plasma membrane, we determined whether such recycling involved trafficking of CFTR through the ERC in a similar fashion to such molecules as transferrin.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	111	 In untransfected cells, CFTR was seen associated with the plasma membrane (Fig.

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	123	To confirm that CFTR was indeed trapped in the ERC in the presence of G429R Rme-1, we performed immunogold electron microscopy on cells expressing CFTR.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Such studies revealed the presence of both transferrin receptor [a marker for the ERC (Fig.

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	134	 While there was a slight reduction in the amount of cell surface CFTR in the presence of wild-type Rme-1, the expression of G429R Rme-1 caused a marked reduction in the amount of cell surface CFTR (Fig.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	135	 6, A and B), consistent with a redirection of CFTR to intracellular compartments.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	136	 The reduction in cell surface CFTR in the presence of G429R Rme-1 was not due to a global reduction in CFTR expression because the amount of total CFTR in cells expressing G429R Rme-1 was not significantly lower than that in untransfected cells (Fig.

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Because CFTR in ERC should be oriented such that the cytosolic domains of CFTR are facing the outside of the vesicle, we immunoprecipitated CFTR-containing vesicles from cells by using antibodies directed against the amino and carboxyl termini of CFTR.

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	157	 To show that CFTR enters the ERC from the clathrin-coated endocytic pathway, we monitored the traffic of internalized CFTR.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Because the steady-state level of cell surface CFTR in the presence of G429R Rme-1 is extremely low and there are no high-affinity extracellular antibodies or ligands for CFTR, we decided to utilize a CFTR/transferrin receptor chimera transiently coexpressed with G429R Rme-1.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	159	 TRVb1 cells lacking endogenous transferrin receptors were transiently transfected with a CFTR transferrin receptor (TfR) chimera in which the cytoplasmic domain of the transferrin receptor was replaced with the carboxyl terminal domain of CFTR.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Twenty-four hours after such transfection, some cells were also transfected with G429R Rme-1.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Traffic of the CFTR/TfR chimera was monitored by using Cy3-conjugated transferrin.

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Cy3 transferrin was efficiently taken up in both sets of cells.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	166	 After the hour pulse with labeled transferrin, cells were subject to an hour chase in the absence of labeled transferrin and 100-fold excess of unlabeled transferrin.

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Similar experiments were performed in cells expressing GFP-tagged G429R Rme-1 for cells incubated for 1 h in the presence of Cy3 transferrin (c), followed by a 1-h chase in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled transferrin (d).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	176	 For cells expressing GFP-tagged G429R Rme-1, the corresponding GFP signal is shown in green (e and f).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	177	Although the exit of material from the ERC and its reinsertion into the plasma membrane have been thought to be a constitutive pathway, such traffic nonetheless requires cellular machinery.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	178	 The role of Rme-1 in regulating aspects of the endocytic/recycling pathway has been established by using dominant negative mutants in CHO cells and C.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	179	 While Rme-1 has no effect on initial clathrin-mediated endocytic events, Rme-1 function is necessary for proteins to exit the ERC and travel back to the plasma membrane.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	180	 In contrast, Rme-1 plays no role in the traffic of proteins, such as LDL, to the late endosome/lysosome pathway.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Although there is only one Rme family member in C.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	182	 elegans, there are four related genes in humans (8, 21, 26).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	183	 As yet, the tissue distribution and expression overlap of CFTR with the different Rme-1 genes are not known.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	184	We show that internalized CFTR enters the endocytic recycling compartment on its traffic back to the cell surface in an identical fashion to the well-described marker for endosomal recycling, the transferrin receptor.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Expression of dominant negative Rme-1 has no effect on endocytosis, as shown by uptake of LDL, transferrin, and CFTR/transferrin chimeras, consistent with previously published data (8, 15).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	186	 In contrast to traffic of LDL to late endosomes/lysosomes, which is unaffected by dominant negative Rme-1 and shows no colocalization with GFP-tagged G429R Rme-1, transferrin (a marker for the recycling compartment) shows almost complete overlap with GFP-tagged G429R Rme-1.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	187	 CFTR localization in dominant negative Rme-1-expressing cells shows overlap with both transferrin and GFP, arguing that internalized CFTR enters the same recycling compartment that transferrin has access to.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The observation that expression of dominant negative Rme-1 caused a marked redistribution of CFTR away from the plasma membrane to being trapped in the ERC argues for a rapid endocytic rate for CFTR.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Indeed, several groups have shown that CFTR is efficiently endocytosed from the cell surface (12, 18, 27, 34).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Moreover, the redistribution of CFTR in the presence of G429R Rme-1 argues that maintenance of steady-state cell surface levels of CFTR is primarily due to recycling of internalized CFTR rather than insertion of newly synthesized CFTR.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The lack of high-affinity antibodies to extracellular domains of CFTR, and the low level of expression of cell surface CFTR in the presence of G429R Rme-1, precluded monitoring of CFTR from the cell surface to the ERC.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	192	 To confirm that entry of CFTR into the ERC was from the endocytic pathway, we monitored access of transferrin receptor/CFTR chimeras to the ERC.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Transferrin receptor constructs that lack a cytoplasmic tail are internalized inefficiently (13, 27).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Addition of the carboxyl tail of CFTR to tail-less transferrin receptors restores efficient internalization of the receptor and labeled transferrin reporters (27).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Transfection of cells with transferrin receptor/CFTR chimeras and dominant negative Rme-1 shows that labeled transferrin is trapped within the ERC, arguing that entry into the ERC is from the endocytic rather than the biosynthetic pathway.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Moreover, it argues that the carboxyl tail of CFTR does not contain any signals that direct traffic of CFTR away from recycling pathways to lysosomal degradative compartments.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	197	 While many endocytosed membrane proteins are thought to recycle to the cell surface via a juxtanuclear recycling compartment (23), this is not true for all proteins.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	198	 For example, Kir channels, a potassium channel family involved in regulating membrane excitability (38), do not recycle to the cell surface through Rme-1-regulated compartments (19).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Thus it is clear that different ion channels can traffic and recycle through diverse compartments.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	200	Many laboratories, both commercial and academic, are currently attempting to acquire pharmacological compounds to increase the efficiency with which mutant CFTR molecules fold, exit the endoplasmic reticulum, and get inserted into the plasma membrane.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The observation that even wild-type CFTR is rapidly removed from the cell surface argues for the necessity to understand recycling processes with the potential to increase the rate at which CFTR exits the recycling compartment and gets reinserted back into the plasma membrane.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	202	 This is particularly true for F508 CFTR, the most common mutation in CFTR, which even when "corrected" by growth of cells at reduced temperatures has a significantly shorter half-life in the plasma membrane the wild-type CFTR (11).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Thus a clear understanding of the molecular events governing the recycling of CFTR will provide inside into ways to augment the overall residence time of pharmacologically corrected mutant CFTR molecules at the cell surface.

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Department of Physiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, August 5, 2003 , and in revised form, October 6, 2003.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	3	Misfolded proteins are recognized by ER quality control system and are targeted for degradation in ER-associated degradation (8).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Immature, wild type CFTR is folded inefficiently in the ER with a large fraction degraded before reaching the plasma membrane (9).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	5	 That which is folded efficiently traffics to the Golgi and acquires complex glycosylation characteristic of the mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The most common mutation in CF, F508CFTR, is a misfolded protein and is recognized as such by the ER, translocated to the cytosol, and degraded by the 26 S proteasome (9).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Thus, the predominant majority of the F508 never matures and traffics to the plasma membrane.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	8	The degradation of mature CFTR is less well understood.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	9	 (10) found that both the lysosome and proteasome are involved.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	10	 They found that lysosomal inhibitors increase the half-life of mature wild type CFTR in baby hamster kidney cells transfected with CFTR and in the endogenous CFTR in Caco-2 and T84 cells.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Interestingly, C-terminal truncation mutants do not traffic to the lysosome.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Instead, they are degraded in the proteasome (10).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Thus, CFTR appears to enter different degradative pathways depending on signals within its C terminus.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	14	CFTR possesses a type I, C-terminal, PDZ (PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1)-binding motif.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Several PDZ domain proteins known to interact with CFTR include NHE-RF/EBP-50, CAP70, and CAL (CFTR-associated ligand) (11 to 15).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The C-terminal tail of CFTR plays a potential regulatory role in modulating its Cl to  channel activity.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Adding recombinant NHE-RF or CAP70 fusion proteins to the cytoplasmic side of CFTR in vitro increases the activity of CFTR (15, 16).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In addition, NHE-RF anchors CFTR to cytoskeleton stabilizing the cell surface CFTR (13, 17).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Both NHE-RF and its related protein, E3KARP, link cAMP-dependent protein kinase to CFTR (13, 18).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Moreover, NHE-RF was shown to link 2-adrenergic receptor to CFTR (19).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Formation of such macromolecular complexes facilitates the efficiency of activation CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	22	CAL (also known as PIST (PDZ domain protein interacting specifically with TC10), GOPC (Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif containing), and FIG (fused in glioblastoma)) (11, 20 to 22) is a CFTR-interacting PDZ domain protein that associates predominantly with the Golgi apparatus.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Overexpression of CAL reduces CFTR chloride currents in mammalian cells by decreasing the expression of CFTR in the plasma membrane (11).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This effect of CAL can be overcome by NHE-RF, which restores the plasma membrane expression of CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	25	 CAL favors the retention of CFTR within the cell, whereas NHE-RF favors surface expression by competing with CAL for the binding of CFTR (11).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Interestingly, overexpression of CAL also reduces the amount of CFTR (23).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These findings point to a role for CAL in the intracellular trafficking of CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Consistent with this notion, CAL interacts with proteins involved in membrane vesicle trafficking such as the SNARE protein, syntaxin 6, and the small GTPase, TC10 (20, 22).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Furthermore, CAL also interacts with and potentially regulates the intracellular trafficking of the Wnt receptors, frizzled 5 and 8, neural members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, CALEB/NGC (21, 24), and the chloride channel, CLC-3B (23).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	30	Recently, PDZ domain interactions were found to be involved in trafficking of other plasma membrane proteins both to and from the plasma membrane.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	31	 For example, synapse-associated protein 102 is involved in the delivery of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors to the cell surface (25).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In addition, NHE-RF regulates 2-adrenergic receptor recycling to plasma membrane (26).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	33	In addition to the PDZ domain, the C-tail of CFTR contains motifs for endocytosis.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	34	 A tyrosine motif at the C terminus of CFTR binds directly with the  micro light chain of the AP2 complex involved in sorting CFTR for endocytosis into clathrin-coated pits (27).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Surface CFTR is endocytosed rapidly.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	36	 For example, within 5 min, 50% CFTR at the plasma membrane is endocytosed via AP2 clathrin-coated pits.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	37	 CFTR contained within endosomes can be either recycled back to the plasma membrane or degraded in the lysosome.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Because surface CFTR has a long half-life (24 to 48h), the majority of CFTR must be recycled back to the cell surface instead of targeted to the lysosome for degradation.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	39	 It is not clear how this process is regulated.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In this study, we examined the role of CAL on the expression of mature CFTR protein.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	41	 We found that CAL regulates the expression of mature CFTR through mechanisms that are both bafilomycin A1- and dynamin 2-sensitive.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	42	Immunoblotting The cells were harvested and processed as described previously (11).

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	125	 These results strongly suggested that CAL plays a key role in regulating the bafilomycin A1-sensitive degradation of CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	126	 On the other hand, treating CAL-transfected cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 did not rescue mature GFP-CFTR (Fig.

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	128	 In contrast to bafilomycin A1 treatment, in the presence of CAL, MG132 actually reduced levels of mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	129	 It has been observed by several investigators that proteasome inhibition does not increase the maturation of CFTR (31, 32).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	130	 MG132 did not increase immature CFTR in the Nonidet P-40 lysates probably because blocking of proteosomal degradation leads to the accumulation of CFTR into a detergent-insoluble polyubiquitinated form of immature CFTR (32).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The failure of MG132 to inhibit CAL reduction of mature CFTR is further evidence that CAL can function downstream of the proteosome and influence the degradation of mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	132	What Is the Effect of CAL on CFTR Maturation? The steady state level of mature CFTR is determined by new protein synthesis and the trafficking and maturation of CFTR from ER to Golgi as well as post-Golgi degradation.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	133	 To eliminate the possibility that, in addition to enhancing the degradation of mature CFTR in the lysosome, CAL decreases CFTR synthesis and/or maturation, we examined the synthesis and maturation of CFTR by metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments.

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Not all newly synthesized CFTR is converted to mature CFTR (band C, upper band); because CFTR folds inefficiently, most of band B is degraded by ER-associated degradation (8).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	138	 3 shows that GFP-CFTR matures similarly whether transfected or not transfected with CAL.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Therefore, CAL exerts its effects on mature CFTR and does not affect the synthesis and trafficking to Golgi.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	140	 To test this hypothesis directly, the effect of CAL on mature CFTR was examined.

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	145	 On the other hand, if bafilomycin A1 was added at 4 h in the absence of CAL, followed by a 16-h chase, more labeled CFTR remains after 16 h compared with that remaining in the absence of both CAL and bafilomycin A1, suggesting that degradation was inhibited.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Of note is that there is more labeled CFTR remaining in CAL-transfected cells in the presence of bafilomycin than in CAL-transfected cells in the absence of bafilomycin.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Importantly, the fraction of mature CFTR sensitive to bafilomycin A1 is statistically larger in the presence of CAL versus the control (50.

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	205	 COS-7 cells grown on coverslips were transfected with HA-CAL, Dyn2-GFP, or Dyn2K44A-GFP.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	206	 We have reported previously and others have also shown that CAL is located in the perinuclear region of the cell (11, 20, 21).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	207	 6b shows that Dyn2-GFP is expressed uniformly in COS-7 cells.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Dyn2K44A-GFP, on the other hand, has a distinctly different punctuate expression pattern (Fig.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	209	 6c), consistent with previous report that this mutant blocks clathrin coat-mediated endocytosis and is arrested at the clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane (38).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Whereas co-expression of wild type Dyn2 has no effect on the distribution of CAL (Fig.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	211	 6, d to f), expression of Dyn2K44A redistributes CAL to the sites that co-localized with Dyn2K44A (Fig.

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	213	 These results are significant because they show that CAL traffics from Golgi and is arrested at the cell periphery, where further progression is blocked by Dyn2K44A.

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	217	 CAL was detected by a monoclonal antibody to HA epitope (red) and Dyn2 were visualized by green fluorescence (green) on confocal microscope.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	218	 CAL is typically expressed in the Golgi apparatus.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Wild type Dyn2 has no effect on its intracellular localization.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Dyn2K44A redistributes and co-localizes with CAL.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	221	Both intracellular retention and degradation of mature CFTR by CAL contributes to the CAL-mediated down-regulation of CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	222	 To date, no enzymatic activity has been identified in CAL.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Examining the protein domains and motifs suggests that CAL is a scaffolding protein with multiple protein-binding domains.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Like other scaffolding proteins, CAL operates as an adaptor to couple multiple proteins.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Other than the PDZ domain that binds to CFTR, the second coiled-coil domain binds to the small GTPase TC10 and the SNARE protein syntaxin 6 (20, 22).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Both TC10 and syntaxin 6 are known to be involved in intracellular trafficking.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	227	 TC10 is a member of the Rho-GTPase family.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	228	 In adipose tissues, TC10 is involved in regulating the trafficking of the insulin-stimulated glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the plasma membrane.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	229	 As an adaptor protein, CAL is likely to link CFTR to the intracellular trafficking processes carried out by TC10 or syntaxin 6 in CFTR-expressing epithelial tissues.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	230	At steady state, CAL is localized to the Golgi complex, particularly in the TGN and cytosol.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	231	 TC10 is localized at the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles; syntaxin 6 is primarily in Golgi and endosomes.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	232	 CFTR spans all of these compartments.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	233	 For these proteins to work in concert on CFTR, they must physically interact.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	234	 One possibility is that they interact at the interface of their respective compartments.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Alternatively, one or all of these proteins could cycle among different compartments.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	236	 For example, CAL may traffic from TGN/Golgi to the plasma membrane and then to endosomes and to the lysosome, or it may traffic directly from the TGN to the lysosome.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	237	 6 depicts evidence supporting this notion.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	238	 The data show that expression of a dominant-negative dynamin 2 mutant redistributes CAL to the cell periphery into punctuate structures that co-localize with the mutant dynamin 2.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	239	 In this circumstance CAL is arrested at the sites where dynamin regulates vesicle budding (Fig.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	240	 The dynamin 2 mutant Dyn2K44A is well known to inhibit endocytosis and to affect the Golgi (33, 35).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	241	 The observation that the dynamin 2 mutant Dyn2K44A enhances surface expression of mature CFTR and does not have a large effect on the total amount of mature CFTR supports the notion that the primary effect of Dyn2K44A is post-Golgi.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Thus, it is likely that CAL can traffic with CFTR past the Golgi and target CFTR for degradation either through endocytosis at the plasma membrane or via direct trafficking from a post-Golgi compartment to the lysosome.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	243	 However, it is important to note that our data do not exclude other ways of regulating mature protein and cell surface expression CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	244	The evidence that CAL is involved in trafficking in tissues other than epithelia was suggested by two recent papers.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Neuronal CAL contributes to the pathology of Lurcher mice (39).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Lurcher mutant mice are ataxic because of degeneration of the cortex of the cerebella.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Constitutive activation of the GluRd2Lc receptor causes an inward current and the death of Purkinje cells.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Neuronal CAL has an additional 8 amino acids at the beginning of the second coiled-coil domain.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	249	 CAL binds to GluRd2 and Beclin1 and links receptor activation to autophagy and cell death (39).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Autophagy involves trafficking membrane compartments to the lysosome for degradation.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Therefore, CAL maybe involved in lysosomal trafficking in autophagy.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	252	More information on the function of CAL came from knockout mouse experiments (40).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	253	 In CAL knockout mice, the males are infertile.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	254	 The mature sperm of male mice missing CAL lack acrosome, a specialized lysosomal structure derived from the Golgi that is required for oocyte activation.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In normal mice, CAL is located in the TGN and TGN-derived vesicles of the round spermatids.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	256	 These data suggest that CAL is involved in acrosome biogenesis, perhaps by facilitating protein cargo transport to this organelle.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	257	New therapies are under development to promote F508 CFTR maturation.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Interfering with the degradation of F508 CFTR in the post-Golgi compartments may be an attractive method to boost levels of mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Our current study suggests a method to accomplish this by inhibiting the degradation of mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	260	 More importantly, a more specific way of blocking the interaction between CAL and CFTR may potentially allow more CFTR to be trafficked to the plasma membrane.

0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	0	Evidence That Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-associated Degradation of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Is Linked to Retrograde Translocation from the ER Membrane* Ximing Xiong, Elaine Chong, and William R.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Department of Molecular and Cellular Engineering and Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	2	The rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 facilitates translocation, membrane integration, folding, and oligomeric assembly of most proteins found in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells (1-4).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	3	 The ER also functions to recognize misfolded or unassembled proteins and prevent their exit to the Golgi complex (5-7) through a process termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (8).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Substrates for ERAD, like other secretory and transmembrane proteins, are initially targeted to and translocated across the ER membrane via the Sec61 translocon complex (1, 2).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	5	 However, aberrantly folded proteins are selectively translocated back into the cytosol where they undergo ubiquitination and degradation by cytosolic proteases (9-11).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Certain ERAD substrates such as major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains (10, 12, 13) and unglycosylated prepro- factor undergo complete retrograde translocation into a soluble, cytosolic form prior to degradation (8).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In contrast, mutant forms of carboxypeptidase Y and unassembled T cell receptor  subunits translocate back to the cytosol but remain associated with cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane (14, 15).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In both cases the generation of cytosolic intermediates is thought to occur via retrograde transport through the Sec61 translocon complex (9-11).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	9	The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is also involved in the ER-associated degradation of polytopic proteins.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Yeast mutants with defective ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes or proteasome subunits show decreased degradation of mutant forms of Sec61p (16, 17), a resident ER protein with 10 predicted transmembrane segments (18).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	11	 ERAD may also play a role in ensuring proper protein levels in the ER as suggested by mevalonate-mediated regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (19-21).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	12	 For the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a plasma membrane protein, approximately 80% of wild type protein and 100% of common mutant forms are degraded prior to reaching the Golgi complex (22, 23).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Recent studies have demonstrated that ER-associated degradation of CFTR also requires an intact ubiquitin conjugation pathway and likely involves the 26 S proteasome (24, 25).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	14	 While the underlying reasons for CFTR degradation remain unknown, it has been proposed that the majority of wild type CFTR, like mutant CFTR, is recognized by ER quality control machinery, because it fails to fold properly (26-29).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	15	Degradation of polytopic proteins by cytosolic proteases poses a particular problem in that multiple transmembrane (TM) segments must be removed from the membrane.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	16	 It is unclear whether polytopic proteins, like secretory and bitopic transmembrane proteins, proceed through cytosolic intermediates prior to degradation.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	17	 One possibility is that the proteasome might degrade only cytosolic peptide loops, leaving lumenal and/or transmembrane segments to be degraded by other proteases (7, 30).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Alternatively, degradation might be coupled to the process of retrograde translocation.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	19	 To distinguish among these possibilities, it will be necessary to define the temporal relationship between recognition, retrograde translocation, and degradation events involved in polytopic protein ER degradation.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In this regard, a cell-free system that reconstitutes ERAD is attractive, because it is readily amenable to physical and pharmacological manipulation.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Using such a system, Sato et al.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	22	 (31) recently demonstrated that CFTR could be ubiquitinated cotranslationally, indicating that initial recognition events in ER degradation might occur very early in the lifetime of a polytopic protein.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In the current study we use a similar cell free system to demonstrate that CFTR ubiquitination can also occur after protein synthesis, N-linked glycosylation, and membrane integration have been completed.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	24	 We have also been able to separate the process of ubiquitination from that of degradation and now show that ubiquitinated CFTR remains tightly associated with the ER membrane until it is degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptide fragments.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	25	 CFTR degradation is therefore physically localized to the ER.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Our results are consistent with a model in which cytosolic degradation machinery is recruited to the ER membrane by polyubiquitinated substrates and suggest that degradation occurs coincident with polypeptide removal from the lipid bilayer.

0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Vesicles were isolated at sequential time points, reincubated in the presence or absence of fresh RRL, and degradation of CFTR was monitored by release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	221	 8A, 70% of total CFTR was degraded into trichloroacetic acid soluble counts following 3 h incubation in ATP-containing RRL.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	222	 When vesicles were collected after 20 min of preincubation in hemin-containing RRL and resuspended in fresh RRL lacking hemin, 56% of the total CFTR was subsequently degraded.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	223	 This degradation remained sensitive to both hemin and EDTA.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Incubation of CFTR in hemin-containing RRL for longer periods of time (i.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	225	 1-2 h) resulted in the near complete conversion (~90%) of full-length protein into the HMW complex as in prior experiments (data not shown).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Even after 2 h of preincubation, 57% of total CFTR protein was still able to be degraded upon removal of hemin.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	227	 In each of these experiments, the degradation of polyubiquitinated CFTR was thus 80% as efficient as the degradation of newly synthesized protein.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Furthermore, with longer preincubation times the reversible component of CFTR degradation became progressively more sensitive to inhibition such that after 2 h of preincubation, hemin and EDTA each blocked degradation of polyubiquitinated CFTR by approximately 90%.

0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	240	 For T = 20, 60, and 120 min graphs, the base line soluble counts reflect the percent of counts released from RRL in the presence of hemin.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Total trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts plotted therefore represent the counts released during initial incubation plus the counts released following resuspension and reincubation of microsomes.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	242	Together these results demonstrate that: (i) the inhibitory effects of hemin on CFTR degradation are reversible, (ii) most, but not all, of the membrane-bound ubiquitinated CFTR remains a substrate for degradation, (iii) CFTR degradation, like ubiquitination, requires the presence of both ATP and cytosolic factors, and (iv) degradation is physically localized to the ER membrane and likely occurs coincident with removal of at least a portion of CFTR from the lipid bilayer.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	243	The ER is a primary site of cellular quality control involved in the recognition and disposal of misfolded and unassembled proteins (5).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	244	 While it was initially proposed that ER proteases were responsible for degrading ER substrates, recent evidence indicates that ERAD is mediated largely by cytosolic proteases including the 26 S proteasome (6, 7).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	245	 This topologic disparity between substrate and degradation machinery has resulted in a reevaluation of protein movement into and out of the ER compartment (6).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	246	 It now appears that translocation across the ER membrane is a bidirectional process that is regulated, in part, by the folded state of a given protein substrate.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Whereas, nascent secretory and transmembrane proteins are targeted to, translocated across, and/or integrated into the ER membrane by ER translocation machinery (2, 42), proteins that fail to fold properly may also be recognized by ER quality control machinery and transported out of the ER and back to the cytosol (6, 9, 10, 15).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	248	 These observations have raised important questions regarding the process of retrograde transport across the ER membrane.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	249	 At what stage of biogenesis are protein substrates identified? How do recognition events target proteins back to the translocon and/or facilitate movement into the cytosol? And how is this retrograde transport coupled to the process of degradation? In the current study, we address these issues by developing an in vitro system that reconstitutes de novo synthesis and ER-associated degradation of the polytopic protein CFTR.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Full-length, glycosylated and membrane-integrated CFTR was a substrate for ATP-dependent ubiquitination.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	251	 In addition, polyubiquitinated CFTR remained tightly associated with the ER membrane until it was degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptide fragments.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Thus ubiquitination precedes retrograde translocation, and degradation of polytopic proteins such as CFTR is physically localized to the ER membrane rather than the cytosol as proposed for some secretory and transmembrane substrates (8, 10, 13).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	253	Our results are consistent with a model in which CFTR degradation is tightly coupled to removal of the polypeptide from the lipid bilayer.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	254	 At least 65% of [35S]methionine-labeled CFTR was degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments, consistent with proteasomal degradation in which the resulting polypeptides are 6-9 residues in length (43).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Because a small fraction of full-length CFTR (approximately 10-15%) remained intact in nearly all experiments, the extent of degradation for individual CFTR polypeptides actually approached 80%.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Thus CFTR degradation could not be limited to large cytosolic regions containing the N terminus, nucleotide binding domains, and R domain, which together comprise 61% of the total mass but only 47% of methionine residues (40).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	257	 If all cytosolic loops within 8-15 residues from the membrane were cleaved, then degradation of all full-length CFTR polypeptide chains would liberate only 60% total CFTR methionine into the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction (40).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	258	 It therefore seems likely that proteolytic machinery such as the proteasome might participate in removal of CFTR from the lipid bilayer to gain access to transmembrane segments and/or lumenal peptide regions.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	259	 This possibility is supported by the observation that: (i) proteasome-like particles are physically localized to the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane (44) and (ii) our results that CFTR degradation occurs via a membrane-bound, rather than cytosolic, intermediate.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	260	 If retrograde translocation of CFTR occurred through the Sec61 translocon, then extraction from the lipid bilayer could potentially involve the reverse process of membrane integration, namely lateral movement of TM segments from the membrane back into the translocation channel and into the cytosol (45, 46).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	261	While this study provides additional support that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in ER-associated degradation of CFTR, it is unclear why different proteasome inhibitors exhibited different effects on CFTR degradation.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Lactacystin and clasto-lactacystin -lactone, which covalently inactivate the active site threonine residue on the 5 subunit of the 20 S proteasome (subunit X of the mammalian proteasome) (47, 48), had relatively minor effects on CFTR degradation as determined either by disappearance of the CFTR HMW complex (Fig.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	263	 4) or generation of trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments (Fig.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	264	 It is interesting that clasto-lactacystin -lactone, the active form of lactacystin, is inactivated by glutathione in cells (49, 50).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Our observation that neither lactacystin nor its -lactone form inhibited the degradation of lysozyme, a known proteasome substrate, suggests that RRL is capable of rendering these agents inactive, even when preincubated in the absence of exogenous reducing agents.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	266	 We do not know why the results reported here differ from those of Qu et al.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	267	 (51) that demonstrated 20  microM lactacystin inhibited the degradation of both 1-antitrypsin and lysozyme in a similar RRL system.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	268	 However, our results were consistent for two different preparations of lactacystin and at multiple inhibitor concentrations up to 100  microM.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	269	 It is possible that these differences reflect varying amounts of proteasome in different RRL preparations.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	270	The most potent inhibitors of CFTR degradation were EDTA, apyrase, and hemin.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	271	 EDTA and hemin have been shown previously to inhibit the degradation of other proteasome substrates in RRL by stabilizing HMW ubiquitin conjugates (39, 52, 53).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Hemin, a heme precursor, exerts pleiotropic effects in RRL.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Its stimulatory effect on protein translation (38) is proposed to be mediated by inactivation of the translation factor eif-2, possibly by inhibiting an endogenous RRL kinase (54, 55).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	274	 In addition, hemin directly inhibits ATPase activities of the purified 19 S proteasome regulatory complex (PA700) as well as the 26 S proteasome itself (56).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Because the catalytic core of the 20 S proteasome cannot accommodate folded or ubiquitinated polypeptides, it has been proposed that ATPases contained within the 19 S regulatory subunit are required for substrate unfolding as well as deubiquitination (43, 48, 56-59).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	276	 It is therefore likely that hemin inhibits proteasome-mediated CFTR degradation by blocking ATPase activity and thereby preventing CFTR unfolding and/or deubiquitination.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	277	 If CFTR unfolding were required for removal from the bilayer, such a mechanism would explain the accumulation of membrane-bound, polyubiquitinated CFTR observed in the current study.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	278	Our results do not rule out the possibility that additional peptidase activities either in the ER lumen or within the membrane also participate in CFTR degradation as has been suggested previously (25, 60).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	279	 One such candidate is signal peptidase complex, an ER-localized protease that is capable of cleaving transmembrane proteins (61) and free signal peptides (30) at sites located within the plane of the lipid bilayer.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Interestingly, CFTR contains cryptic signal peptidase cleavage sites within or adjacent to TM segments of the N terminus hydrophobic domain (62, 63).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	281	 If similar proteases facilitated CFTR degradation, then TM segments and small peptide loops could potentially be released from the membrane.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Such a mechanism might explain why a significant amount of CFTR degradation was ATP-independent and hemin insensitive.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	283	 It is also possible that the membrane-bound HMW complex might actually consist of polyubiquitinated CFTR cleavage products that are then degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	2	THE STUDY by van Heeckeren and colleagues, one of the current articles in focus (Ref.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	3	 L717 in this issue), addresses the question of whether adenoviral delivery of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to the cystic fibrosis airways attenuates inflammation and mortality associated with a chronic bacterial infection.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	4	 This is an intriguing question because adenoviral vectors themselves can invoke a substantial immune response that prohibits their repeated administration to the lung (2).
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In their article, van Heeckeren and coworkers report that, within the infected cystic fibrosis lung, CFTR expression and/or adenoviral vector-induced inflammation yields a significant survival advantage.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This promising observation may have profound implications for the utility of adenoviral vectors in the gene therapy treatment of cystic fibrosis.

0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Cystic fibrosis is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population, with a frequency of 1 in 2,500 live births.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	9	 It is caused by defective function of the cftr gene product (14), which encodes a 170- to 180-kDa protein that functions as a cAMP-regulated chloride channel.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The CFTR protein is expressed normally in those tissues affected in cystic fibrosis, including airway submucosal glands and airway epithelial cells.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The cystic fibrosis respiratory disease phenotype includes thick mucus secretion and bacterial colonization of the lung with a select few bacterial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13).
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	12	 aeruginosa infections compounded by an inability to clear this organism result in a profound neutrophil migration into the airways and secretion of a variety of inflammatory mediators, including neutrophil elastase, reactive oxygen species, and inflammatory cytokines, which cause irreversible damage to the airways and gas-exchange components.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	13	Cystic fibrosis and adenoviral vector-mediated gene therapy.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Correction of the defective cftr gene in vivo has long been the holy grail of the cystic fibrosis research community.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The use of adenoviral vectors in this pursuit has been problematic (reviewed in Ref.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In early clinical trials, the administration of adenoviral vectors encoding CFTR demonstrated great promise, with transient correction of chloride transport defects.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Subsequent studies, however, failed to repeat this initial finding and, moreover, revealed that adenoviral vector-mediated delivery of CFTR to the cystic fibrosis airways was limited by the local immune response associated with multiple vector administrations.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Similarly, van Heeckeren and colleagues (19) reported previously that P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	19	 aeruginosa-induced bronchopulmonary inflammation also limited the efficacy of adenoviral vector-mediated gene transfer.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Despite this limitation, several studies suggest that the extent of CFTR correction required for a normal lung phenotype may be quite low (2), thereby validating the use of adenoviral vectors in cystic fibrosis gene therapy.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	21	Until the current study by van Heeckeren et al.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	22	 (20), the impact of adenoviral vector-mediated gene therapy had not been examined in the context of a cystic fibrosis lung chronically infected with bacteria (19).
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In this ambitious study by van Heeckeren and coworkers (20), the authors determined whether CFTR delivery improved the outcome of a cystic fibrosis murine model infected with P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Specifically, the authors reported that gut-corrected cystic fibrosis mice treated with an adenoviral vector encoding CFTR and inoculated with P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	25	 aeruginosa-laden agarose beads exhibited a significantly greater cumulative 10-day survival compared with sucrose controls; survival of empty vector controls, however, was not significantly different.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Importantly, these authors observed that there were no differences between mice receiving the CFTR vector or controls with regard to the extent of lung inflammation.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	27	 From these data, the authors concluded that the observed survival advantage in mice receiving adenoviral delivery of CFTR to the cystic fibrosis lung may be due to CFTR expression and/or proinflammatory effects of the adenoviral vector.

0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Because cumulative 10-day survival was not significantly different between mice receiving CFTR-encoding vectors vs.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	30	 empty vector controls, it is likely that CFTR expression plays a small role in this response.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	31	 As the authors note (20), it is possible that the administration of an adenoviral vector may have induced a protective immune response that improved cumulative survival.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In support of this possibility, the authors observed a persistent lung lymphocytosis in response to adenoviral vector administration; this response was further enhanced upon challenge with P.

0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Interestingly, the authors did not observe increased bacterial killing in mice treated with either the CFTR-encoding adenoviral vector or the empty vector control.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	35	Early studies by Markham and coworkers (8, 12) suggest that T cell-mediated immune responses are protective against P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	36	 For example, these authors have shown that adoptive transfer of T cells from mice immunized with P.

0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Similar findings have been reported by others (3).

0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	43	 aeruginosa infection induces a T helper type 2 (Th2)-like response.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Th2 responses are characterized by the production of IL-4 and IL-5 and are important in the generation of humoral immunity.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	45	 These results are further supported by their observation that chronic P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	46	 aeruginosa lung infection is more severe in a Th2 responding mouse strain (BALB/c) (10).
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	47	 With regard to protective T cell immunity, Hoiby and coworkers (4, 5, 9) have demonstrated that induction of a Th1-dominated cytokine response improves the outcome of chronic P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Th1 responses are characterized by the production of IFN- and are instrumental in the generation of cell-mediated immunity.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Interestingly, previous studies have shown that adenoviral vector administration can trigger a Th1 response in the lungs of mice (18, 21) and humans (1).
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In light of these findings, it is tempting to conclude that the improved cumulative survival observed in the van Heeckeren study (20) is a function of an adenovirus-induced Th1 response; however, this conclusion may be too simplistic.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	51	Several recent studies call into question the beneficial nature of a Th1 response in P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Reports examining the role of the virulence factor alginate (17) and the quorum-sensing molecule N-(3-oxododecanoyl)homoserine lactone (16) in P.

0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	60	 aeruginosa infections, it should be noted that these studies were performed in non-cystic fibrosis model systems.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Because recent evidence indicates that T cell responses may be dysregulated in cystic fibrosis (6, 7), such studies need to be performed in the context of the cystic fibrosis lung.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	62	 This is underscored by the van Heeckeren study (20), which suggests that adenoviral vector-induced inflammation may promote survival of cystic fibrosis mice during a chronic P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	63	 As with all well-conceived studies, this study precipitates a number of unanswered questions.

0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	3	Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects a number of epithelial tissues, including those in the gastrointestinal tract.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The goal of this review is to summarize data related to regulation of the protein product of the CF gene, CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), by a variety of small molecules.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	5	 There has been a surge of interest in discovering small molecules that could be exogenously added to cells and tissues to regulate CFTR and could potentially be used alone or in combination with genetic approaches for therapy in CF.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We will discuss the apparent mechanisms of action of genistein, milrinone, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, IBMX, and NS-004; several of which appear to interact directly with one or both nucleotide binding domains of CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We also discuss how HCO3 interacts with CFTR as both a permeating anion and a potential regulator of Cl permeation through the CFTR ion channel.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	8	 It is likely that there are complicated interactions between Cl and HCO3 in the secretion of both ions through the CFTR and the anion exchanger in intestinal cells, and these may yield a role of CFTR in regulation of intestinal HCO3 secretion as well as of intra- and extracellular pH.

0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	10	CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) is the most common fatal genetic disease of the Caucasian population, with an incidence of 1 in 2,500 live births and a carrier frequency of ~1 in 25.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The disease is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (30), which functions as a cAMP-activated Cl channel.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	12	 At the cellular level, CFTR dysfunction results in defective cAMP-regulated Cl conductance, primarily in cells of epithelial origin (27).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Although lung disease is the primary cause of mortality in CF patients, a significant proportion of the morbidity can be directly attributed to gastrointestinal complications.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon express high levels of CFTR mRNA (30).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Immunocytochemical analysis also demonstrated high CFTR protein expression at the luminal surfaces along the intestine (7).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The small intestine of CF patients exhibits decreased Cl and fluid secretion that results in meconium ileus (lower water content and higher viscosity compared with non-CF patients) in ~10% of all CF newborns and accumulation of mucus and intestinal obstructions [primarily in ileocecum and large intestine in  > 20% of adult patients (see Ref.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Intestinal pathophysiology appears to be the hallmark of recently developed transgenic CF mouse models.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The ileocecum and large intestine appear to be the most common sites of intestinal blockade, whereas jejunal obstructions occur less frequently (13).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	19	Thus CFTR plays an important role in intestinal secretion.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This secretion is controlled by multiple hormones and nerve cell transmitters, which will couple to the activation of CFTR as well as the other ion channels and transporters that are required to generate transepithelial secretion.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Phosphorylation of CFTR by protein kinases (PK) and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases (PP) is considered the major way by which CFTR Cl channel activity is physiologically regulated.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In addition, the normal gating cycle (both opening and closing) of CFTR requires ATP binding and hydrolysis at the two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) of CFTR (see Ref.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	23	 ATP concentration is likely maintained constant in cells and is therefore not a significant physiological regulator.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	24	In addition to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and ATP binding and hydrolysis, investigators have searched for exogenous compounds that are potential therapeutic activators of the mutant CFTR protein found in CF patients.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Figure 1 shows the chemical structures of several such small molecules that will be discussed in this review.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Some of these small molecules appear to bind directly to one or both of the NBDs of CFTR and, if CFTR has been prephosphorylated, increase the open probability of the channel.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In the first portion of this review, PHARMACOLOGICAL REGULATION OF CFTR BY SMALL MOLECULES, we will discuss work showing that genistein, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), IBMX and other xanthines, and NS-004 all seem to operate this way.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In addition, we will discuss the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor milrinone, which also stimulates CFTR but through a mechanism that is less well characterized.

0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	32	In the second portion of this review, HCO3 PERMEATION AND POSSIBLE REGULATION OF CFTR-MEDIATED CL CURRENTS, we will discuss the question of HCO3 permeation and potential regulation of CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This has been a controversial area of research.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Most secretory epithelia secrete both Cl and HCO3, and CFTR seems to be involved in a critical way that is still poorly understood.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	35	 We will discuss data relevant to the question of whether the key role of CFTR is to conduct HCO3 itself or to play some sort of permissive role in HCO3 secretion through an adjacent anion exchanger that requires Cl at the cell's luminal aspect to exchange for cellular HCO3.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Alternatively, CFTR could also be required to keep cellular Cl concentration low enough that Cl enters the cell on the exchanger and exchanges for cellular HCO3.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	37	 We will also discuss the possibility that HCO3 may regulate the activity of CFTR by altering the permeation of Cl due to the multi-ion pore behavior of CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	38	    PHARMACOLOGICAL REGULATION OF CFTR BY SMALL MOLECULES.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Genistein is a member of the large class of naturally occurring flavonoids.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Some flavonoids are more potent than genistein in activating CFTR (19), but we will focus on genistein because it has been investigated the most thoroughly.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Genistein is a potent activator of CFTR (e.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	42	 20, 22), but the activating mechanism has been debated.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Genistein did not seem to operate through activation of protein kinase A (PKA), PKC, or PKG, because there were no increases in intracellular cAMP, Ca2+, or cGMP concentrations (21, 32).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Genistein is a well-known tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor, and two other PTK inhibitors (tyrphostin 47 and tyrphostin B42) also stimulated CFTR, and genistein-stimulated channel activity was blocked by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate (21, 32).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	45	 However, several other PTK inhibitors (tyrphostin A23, tyrphostin A51, erbstatin analog, and herbimycin) failed to stimulate CFTR (20).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Genistein also stimulated CFTR equally well when GTP (a poor substrate for tyrosine kinases) was used as a replacement for ATP (10).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Some results suggested that genistein activated CFTR by blocking a PP: inactivation rates of CFTR currents on cAMP removal were markedly decreased by genistein (20), and CFTR was phosphorylated on the same amino acids by both genistein (which did not raise cAMP concentration) and forskolin (which did) (29).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	48	More recent data have indicated that the most likely explanation for the stimulatory effect of genistein was through direct binding to an NBD of phosphorylated CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Genistein did not directly open CFTR channels, because genistein did not stimulate CFTR in ATP- or cAMP-depleted monolayers (22).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Similarly, genistein activation of CFTR in excised patches required both ATP and prior phosphorylation by PKA (10).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	51	 In addition, genistein stimulated phosphatase-resistant, thiophosphorylated CFTR, even in the presence of PKI (to block PKA) or VO4 (to block PP) (10, 39).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Kinetic analysis indicated that a genistein concentration of  < 35  microM induced prolonged openings of CFTR (similar to the effect of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog), whereas a genistein concentration of  > 35  microM caused prolonged closed times (38).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	53	An attractive model for stimulatory and inhibitory effects of genistein on CFTR is that of Gadsby et al.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	54	 This model (11) proposes that ATP binding and hydrolysis at NBD1 control channel opening and closing at low phosphorylation levels, and once ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 has opened a highly phosphorylated CFTR channel, ATP binding to NBD2 can stabilize the open state.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Hydrolysis of the nucleotide at NBD2 terminates the stabilization.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Agents that interfere with ATP hydrolysis at NBD2 [e.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	57	, 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) or pyrophosphate] induce prolonged burst opening.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Genistein is a competitive inhibitor with ATP for binding to PTK (inhibitor constant, 13.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	59	7  microM) and to other ATP-binding proteins, and crystal structure analysis of the Src family tyrosine kinase Hck revealed that the structurally related flavone and CFTR activator quercetin (19) localized to the binding site for the adenine ring of AMP-PNP or ATP (34).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	60	 When considering the sequence homology shared by Walker A-type-binding motifs of PTK and NBDs of CFTR, it therefore seems possible that genistein competes for ATP-binding sites on CFTR, possibly at NBD2 (10), thereby slowing down ATP hydrolysis and preventing CFTR channel closure.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	61	 It is unlikely that genistein activates CFTR by binding to a Src kinase, because this would require activation of a tyrosine kinase and genistein blocks tyrosine kinases.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	62	 It might also be proposed that higher concentrations of genistein inhibit CFTR by competing with ATP at NBD1 (which may have a lower affinity for genistein binding) and prevent CFTR from opening.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The substituted benzimidazolone NS-004 has effects that are quite similar to those exhibited by genistein.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	64	1 to 1  microM) and F508-CFTR (at  > 10  microM) without raising cAMP concentration and also in the presence of a PKA inhibitor (12), but it was necessary to pretreat cells with forskolin before patch excision to observe CFTR channel activation by NS-004.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	65	 In addition, the drug caused active CFTR channels to increase their activity, but it had no effect when added after channel rundown, indicating that NS-004 required phosphorylated CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	66	 NS-004 did not inhibit in vitro PP activity.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Thus, although NS-004 was thought to operate by directly opening CFTR (12), the drug may use a mechanism similar to that of genistein to increase open probabilities of phosphorylated, active channels without affecting either PK or PP.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The cardiotonic drug milrinone is an inhibitor of cGMP-inhibited PDE (a class III PDE) and was selected from several drugs inhibiting PDE isozymes (23).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Because PDE inhibitors raise cellular cAMP concentration and CFTR is activated by increases in cAMP concentration, it has been assumed that milrinone (and also IBMX, see below) stimulate CFTR by raising cAMP.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	70	 However, the exact mechanisms have not been determined.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Milrinone activated both normal and F508-CFTR in transformed nasal epithelial cells (24), and a combination of forskolin and milrinone (but not milrinone alone) increased the potential difference across nasal epithelium of F508-CFTR mice in vivo but not in transgenic mice lacking CFTR (24).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Milrinone activated CFTR even when cells had been maximally stimulated with forskolin or some other cAMP agonist, indicating that the drug likely had other effects than to stimulate production of cAMP.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	73	IBMX, DPCPX, and other xanthine derivatives.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	74	 IBMX is an inhibitor of PDE with broad specificity.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Despite its broad use as a PDE inhibitor, it seems unlikely that IBMX works solely via this mechanism.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	76	 IBMX activated CFTR even when cells had been maximally stimulated with forskolin or some other cAMP agonist (23).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Although other substituted xanthine derivatives activated CFTR, there was no correlation between effects on CFTR and cellular cAMP and ATP concentrations (4).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	78	 We have also found, through use of a fluorescence assay for PKA activity (as opposed to measurements of cAMP concentration using RIA), that forskolin caused fibroblasts to raise cAMP concentration to such a high level that PKA activity was saturated (by maximally binding cAMP), and IBMX (which indeed raised cAMP concentration) had no further effect to increase PKA activity (B.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Machen, unpublished observations).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	80	 It therefore seems likely that the stimulatory effects of IBMX on CFTR are due to combined effects to raise cAMP (when PKA has not been saturated) and also to block PP or directly bind to CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	81	The xanthine derivative DPCPX is an adenosine A1 antagonist that may have some selectivity for F508-CFTR compared with effects on wild-type CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	82	 DPCPX stimulates F508-CFTR channels in a variety of epithelial and fibroblast cells (8, 15).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	83	 In some cells, correction of the CF defect by transfection with the CFTR gene rendered the transfected cells insensitive to DPCPX.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	84	 In contrast, DPCPX stimulated recombinant CFTR channels from HEK cell microsomal membranes incorporated into planar lipid layers (2).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	85	 The effects of DPCPX seemed not to be due to an effect on A1 receptors, because Northern analysis showed that a DPCPX-sensitive cell line (CFPAC-1) had no A1 receptor mRNA, and another xanthine analog 1,3-diallyl-8-cyclohexylxanthine (DAX) was a potent CFTR activator but a poor A1 adenosine receptor antagonist.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Using a rapid membrane filtration assay, Cohen et al.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	87	 (6) reported that DPCPX bound to NBD1 of F508-CFTR [dissociation constant (Kd) = 1.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	88	0 nM] with an affinity 17 times higher than that to NBD1 of wild-type CFTR (Kd = 17.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	89	0 nM) with a rank order among different xanthines of DAX  >  DPCPX  >  caffeine  >  DA-DPCPX  >  adenosine  >  >  IBMX  >  2-thio-DPCPX.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	90	 These results were consistent with a unique binding site for DPCPX and related xanthines on NBD1 of CFTR in the vicinity of F508 (2).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	91	 DPCPX was ~25-fold more potent than IBMX in potentiating F508-CFTR by a mechanism other than elevation of intracellular cAMP concentration (15).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Stimulation of CFTR by DPCPX or DAX required prephosphorylated CFTR (2).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Thus DPCPX (and likely all the other xanthines, including IBMX), genistein, and NS-004 all seemed to activate prephosphorylated CFTR by binding directly to CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	94	 DPCPX appeared to bind to NBD1 rather than to NBD2, and it also seemed to be more selective for F508-CFTR than wild-type CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	95	Pharmacological stimulation of mutant CFTR and therapeutic potential.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The most common mutation in CF, F508-CFTR, leads to a trafficking-impaired protein that gets degraded in the cell (40).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Some mutations lead to trafficking-competent, but misfunctional, proteins (e.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	98	 It appears that mutants with different misfunctions will need selective treatments.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	99	 For example, genistein failed to activate F508-CFTR in CF bronchial epithelial cells (22), but addition of genistein and cAMP agonists to NIH/3T3 cells overexpressing F508-CFTR caused a strong, synergistic activation (18).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Alternatively, when CF nasal epithelial cells were treated with 4-phenylbutyrate or low temperature to increase expression of F508-CFTR in the membrane (31, 40), genistein was a potent stimulant (9).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	101	 In addition, the trafficking-competent G551D-CFTR mutant expressed in fibroblasts was stimulated by the combination of genistein and forskolin when forskolin alone was ineffective (9).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	102	 These data indicate that genistein targets CFTR mutants present in the plasma membrane.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Both NS-004 and, especially, DPCPX have also been shown to activate F508-CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	104	 IBMX produced a small, CFTR-related secretory response in jejunum, cecum, and rectum from G551D mice but had no effect in the nasal epithelium (36).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	105	 NS-004 restored near normal channel activity from P574H-CFTR (a mild, trafficking-impaired mutation in NBD1) (3).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	106	 These results suggest that, in addition to their direct effects on CFTR, these drugs may also have other effects that increase the number of channel proteins found in the membrane.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	107	 It is also important to remember that there may be tissue-specific effects of the drugs, because epithelial cells will require concomitant activity of basolateral K+ channels to secrete fluid efficiently.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	108	    HCO3 PERMEATION AND POSSIBLE REGULATION OF CFTR-MEDIATED CL CURRENTS.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	109	Background: Role of CFTR in HCO3 secretion across intestine.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	110	 HCO3 secretion is a key function that occurs in the stomach, pancreas, and small and large intestine.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	111	 HCO3 secretion is particularly important in the duodenum to protect the intestinal mucosa against damage from large amounts of acid from the stomach (1).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Transepithelial secretion of HCO3 likely involves the concerted activities of an apical anion channel, Cl/HCO3 exchange, HCO3 uptake across the basolateral membrane, and/or production of HCO3 by intracellular carbonic anhydrase activity.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The paracellular pathway may also contribute, since a transepithelial gradient for HCO3 favoring secretion occurs.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Electrogenic HCO3 secretion is activated by secretagogues that increase intracellular cAMP, cGMP, or Ca2+ concentrations (1), and this HCO3 secretion required the presence of CFTR in all segments of the small intestine in mice (16, 17, 33).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	115	 However, the specific mechanism(s) involved remains a mystery.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	116	 With the use of the pH stat method in combination with inhibitors of anion exchange and CFTR, recent work (5) with duodenum from normal and CFTR knockout mice shows that CFTR may have contributed to HCO3 secretion in two ways: directly by conducting HCO3 into the lumen and also indirectly by conducting Cl into the lumen, which could be recycled back into the cell via anion exchange for HCO3.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Because CFTR is expressed at highest levels in the crypts (7), electrogenic HCO3 secretion is predicted to occur primarily in this region.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	118	 In contrast, CFTR is expressed at lower levels and carbonic anhydrase activity is expressed at higher levels in the villus epithelium, so CFTR-coupled Cl/HCO3 exchange activity may be primarily localized to the villus.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	119	Does CFTR conduct HCO3? Patch-clamp studies showed that HCO3 was conducted through CFTR in NIH/3T3 cells recombinantly expressing wild-type CFTR (26), with a permeability ratio of Cl to HCO3 of 0.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Similar measurements have also been presented recently by Linsdell et al.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	121	 (25), who found a permeability ratio of Cl to HCO3 of 0.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	122	 We also measured CFTR-mediated permeation of HCO3 across the apical membrane of Calu-3 monolayers, and conductance ratios of cAMP-stimulated HCO3 and Cl currents of 0.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Thus HCO3-to-Cl permeability or conductance ratios of CFTR ranged from 0.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	124	 A role of CFTR's function as a HCO3 conductor has also been suggested in CF models using a variety of methods comparing wild-type CFTR-expressing cells with F508-CFTR-expressing CF cells (22, 35) or wild-type with CFTR knockout mice (CFTR /) (5, 13, 17, 33).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	125	 These reports suggested the possibility that a defect in HCO3 secretion through CFTR may contribute to the pathophysiology of CF pulmonary disease (22, 35).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	126	 In contrast to these experiments that showed that CFTR conducts HCO3, Quinton and Reddy (28) (P.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Quinton, personal communication) showed using microelectrode methods that in intact sweat ducts HCO3 was equally impermeant through CFTR as gluconate.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	128	 This contradiction remains unresolved.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	129	Does CFTR contribute to cytosolic and/or extracellular pH regulation? If CFTR is permeant to HCO3, it is expected that it should contribute to movements of HCO3 into and out of the cell and thereby alter pH of the cell or extracellular fluids.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	130	 In NIH/3T3 cells expressing exogenous CFTR, we showed forskolin-stimulated changes of pH that were absent in cells expressing F508-CFTR (26).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Data have also been presented for biliary epithelial cells showing that CFTR may regulate the activity of the anion exchanger and alter cytosolic pH regulatory ability in these cells (14) In contrast, we have recently compared cytosolic pH regulation in CF and CFTR-corrected nasal cells and found no apparent differences (L.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	132	 A possible explanation was that these cells expressed Na+/H+ and Cl/HCO3 exchange and Na+-HCO3 cotransport, and these mechanisms were much more prominent than CFTR in regulating cytosolic pH.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Thus, in cells that express prominent activity of transporters that regulate cytosolic pH, the conductive pathway for HCO3 across CFTR might be of minor importance for cytosolic pH regulation.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	134	 However, CFTR might still contribute importantly to the accumulation of HCO3 in the poorly buffered apical/luminal fluid.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	135	Do anions regulate Cl permeation through CFTR? It has been well described that thiocyanate (SCN) is highly permeant across CFTR, but when mixtures of Cl and SCN are used, the conductance of CFTR decreases (37).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	136	 This effect has been interpreted in terms of multi-ion pore behavior of CFTR, i.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	137	, interactions of anions within the pore can lead to anomalous effects.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Also, the halide anion I both permeated and blocked CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	139	 We have similarly shown that both F and HCO3 added to the apical surface reduced Cl conductance of CFTR in Calu-3 cells (Illek and Machen, unpublished observations).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	140	 In vivo both Cl and HCO3 are present in the cytosol at similar concentrations, and both are driven by the membrane potential into the pore of CFTR, suggesting that both ions may compete for common binding sites in the permeation path, and thus affect the permeation of each other.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	141	 This could be particularly important for tissues that secrete large amounts of HCO3.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	142	Summary: Role of CFTR in HCO3 secretion.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The exact role of CFTR in HCO3 permeation under physiological conditions likely depends on the relative expression of CFTR and other HCO3 channels, HCO3 transporters and paracellular permeability of HCO3.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	144	 In addition, the cell-to-lumen electrochemical driving forces for Cl and HCO3 will determine ion movements across the luminal cell membrane and tight junctions.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	145	 CFTR appears to be important both as a HCO3 conductance and also in some way as a direct or indirect regulator of adjacent anion exchange, e.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	146	, as a source of luminal Cl that may exchange for cellular HCO3 and/or as a means of keeping cellular Cl concentration low enough that the anion exchanger operates as an HCO3 secretion mechanism.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Many CFTR-expressing epithelia, including the intestine, pancreas, and liver, exhibit different gradients of Cl and HCO3 along the length of the organ, so these relationships will also be affected by the anatomic structures.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	6	The exact pathway for degradation of transmembrane ERAD substrates from the ER is unclear, but there is evidence to suggest that at least some retained proteins are sorted into specialized ER subdomains before degradation (Kamhi-Nesher et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	7	 It is unknown what molecular mechanisms regulate sequestration of ERAD substrates, and whether such sequestration is required for ER retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	8	 To explore these questions, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mutant strains defective in the Sar1p/COPII sorting machinery and a known ERAD substrate, CFTR, as our model system.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	9	Sar1p/COPII-mediated selection of ER proteins for secretory traffic is one of the best understood mechanisms for selective recruitment of proteins in the ER (Antonny and Schekman, 2001).
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	10	 COPII sorting is initiated by Sar1p, a small GTPase (Veldhuisen et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	11	, 1997) that is activated by Sec12p-mediated guanine-nucleotide exchange.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Sar1p in its GTP-bound state associates with the ER membrane and recruits the Sec23p/Sec24p to COPII complex and subsequently the Sec13p/Sec31p to COPII complex to the membrane (for review see Barlowe, 2000).
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The assembly of the COPII coat on ER budding structures is coupled to the selection of transmembrane proteins into the nascent budding structures that will eventually bud from the ER as transport vesicles.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	14	 COPII function has been examined to date exclusively in the context of secretory traffic.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	15	CFTR is a chloride channel present on the apical surface of epithelial cells lining the respiratory, intestinal, and exocrine tissues (Kirk, 2000).
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In mammalian cells, only 20% of newly synthesized wild-type CFTR folds correctly and is transported from the ER to the plasma membrane through the secretory pathway, whereas the remaining 80% of CFTR is degraded from the ER through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Jensen et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In mammalian cells, CFTR is not sequestered into ER subdomains before degradation because inhibition of proteasomal activity by chemical inhibitors or overtaxing the proteolytic capacity by overexpressing CFTR leads to retrotranslocation of CFTR from the ER and its accumulation in cytosolic aggresomes (Johnston et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In yeast, the majority (if not all) of newly synthesized CFTR is also degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, but in contrast to mammalian cells, CFTR in yeast is not delivered to aggresomes, but appears sequestered in ER subdomains before degradation (Kiser et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	19	Here, we report that the Sar1p/COPII machinery functions in sorting CFTR into ER subdomains before proteasomal degradation, and that such sorting is required for CFTR entry into the degradative pathway.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This function of Sar1p/COPII does not involve ER-Golgi traffic.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Our results support a model in which the Sar1p/COPII machinery participates in sorting proteins to both the anterograde secretory pathway and the degradative pathway.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These findings raise the possibility that all newly synthesized proteins are subjected to a Sar1p/COPII sorting mechanism, irrespective of their ultimate secretory or degradative fate.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	38	 It is possible that yeast does not have sufficient machinery to efficiently fold overexpressed CFTR, or that even correctly folded CFTR is "read" by yeast as defective.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	62	 2 B, EGFP-CFTR is not detected in small punctate structures containing the late Golgi marker Kex2p (Preuss et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	63	 This result agrees with findings that CFTR expressed in yeast undergoes ER-type N-glycosylation, but does not undergo Golgi-type oligosaccharide modifications (Kiser et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	64	 EGFP-CFTR is not detected on the plasma membrane, and does not colocalize with the fluorescent dye FM 4 to 64 (Fig.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	66	 The lack of vacuolar localization is consistent with lack of degradation of CFTR via the Pep4p/Prb1p vacuolar proteases (Kiser et al.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The relative size of such clusters (average diameter 0.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	74	5 to 1  microm) corresponds to the approximate size of the fluorescent Kar2p/EGFP-CFTR puncta.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	76	, 2001) or EGFP-CFTR (this work) is distinct from multi-layered ER "karmellae" induced by expression of HMG-CoA reductase (Koning et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Together, the data suggest that EGFP-CFTR localizes to subdomains of the ER network that represent penultimate stations before degradation.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The results also imply that sequestration into the ER domains is more efficient than subsequent removal by degradation.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	79	Functional Sar1p/COPII machinery is required for sorting EGFP-CFTR to ER subdomains To determine if the Sar1p/COPII machinery participates in sorting EGFP-CFTR, we examined its localization when COPII function is disrupted.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	80	 First, we tested the localization of EGFP-CFTR in wild-type, ubc6, and sec18 to 1 yeast strains when grown at 24 degrees C (permissive temperature for strains defective in COPII components) and when grown at 39 degrees C (restrictive temperature for strains defective in COPII components).
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	81	 2 D, EGFP-CFTR in the wild-type strain remains as punctate spots at both temperatures.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Similarly, the pattern of EGFP-CFTR in the ubc6 strain defective for proteasomal degradation is analogous to that in the wild-type strain.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	83	 This strongly suggests that EGFP-CFTR is sorted into the punctate structure and maintained there before it is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Our data, together with the finding that CFTR remains sequestered in Kar2p-containing subdomains in yeast strain (pre1 to 1pre2 to 2) defective for proteasomal degradation (Zhang et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	85	, 2001), suggest that the catalytic activity of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc6p is not sufficient to remove EGFP-CFTR from ER subdomains, and that ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are tightly coupled.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The same punctate EGFP-CFTR pattern is observed in sec18 to 1 strain grown at either temperature, indicating that block in vesicular fusion during ER-Golgi protein transport does not significantly affect EGFP-CFTR sequestration.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In wild-type strain, EGFP-CFTR is degraded rapidly at both temperatures, with a half-life of 10 to 15 min (Fig.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	94	 EGFP-CFTR is degraded rapidly in the sec12 to 4ts strain at permissive temperature; with a half-life (10 min) analogous to that in wild-type strain (Fig.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The strain is defective in Sec18p function, as shown by a block in maturation of the vacuolar CPY at the restrictive temperature (Fig.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Together, the results indicate that ER-Golgi transport and recycling are not required for EGFP-CFTR degradation.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Our findings suggest a novel role for the Sar1p/COPII sorting machinery.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	118	 In addition to selecting correctly folded substrates into the forward secretory pathway (Schekman and Orci, 1996; Bannykh et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	119	, 2000) and selecting misfolded soluble ERAD substrates for the ER-Golgi recycling degradative pathway (Vashist et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	120	, 2001), Sar1p/COPII also sorts misfolded substrates into subdomains of the ER from which they are subsequently degraded.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	121	 How does the same machinery sort proteins into three distinct pathways? A common sorting mechanism for both correctly folded and misfolded membrane proteins presents a spatial problem because these classes must occupy distinct regions of the ER.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	122	 It is likely that additional targeting mechanisms coordinate with Sar1p/COPII to direct the proteins to ER exit or retention.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	123	 It appears that a primary distinction is made at the level of packaging into COPII vesicles; although correctly folded soluble and transmembrane proteins for secretory traffic and misfolded soluble ERAD substrates for ER-Golgi recycling degradative traffic are sorted into COPII vesicles, misfolded transmembrane ERAD substrates are excluded (Vashist et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	124	 There is evidence that transmembrane ERAD substrates are prevented from entry into COPII vesicles and are retained in the ER through the action of luminal ER proteins.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	125	 For example, mutants of the transmembrane ATPase Pma1p appear to be retained and degraded in the ER through the action of a protein disulfide isomerase to related protein, Eps1p (Wang and Chang, 1999).
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Similarly, the retention of a transmembrane H2a precursor in the ER is determined by a pentapeptide sequence present on the luminal side of the ER (Shenkman et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	127	 In addition, ERAD substrates can be retained by binding to calnexin.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	128	 It has been shown that calnexin binds to wild-type and folding compromised F508CFTR in the ER, but the association with F508CFTR is prolonged and might facilitate ER retention (Pind et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	129	 ERAD substrates can be also retained by association with the translocon (Loayza et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Cytoplasmic chaperones may also participate in ER retention (Brodsky et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The finding that strains inactivated in the cytosolic Hsp70 Ssa1p do not sort CFTR into ER subdomains supports the view that ER sequestration requires the coordinate action of Sar1p/COPII and accessory factors.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	132	That Sar1p/COPII is likely to participate in the secretory and the degradative pathways is supported by data obtained from whole genome microarray analysis where many genes involved in secretory traffic were found to be UPR targets (Travers et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Initially, the up-regulation was viewed as means to increase traffic in the ER-Golgi recycling degradative pathway for soluble ERAD substrates (Caldwell et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	134	 However, our work suggests that the up-regulation is also a means to increase components required for ER sequestration of transmembrane ERAD substrates.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Specifically relevant to our analysis is the up-regulation of SEC12, SEC13, and SEC24.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Thus, it may be that the UPR-mediated up-regulation of these genes may not be a cellular strategy to remove protein from the ER by exporting them, but additionally might promote sorting of retained proteins toward degradation.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	3	THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR (CFTR) is responsible for the cAMP-activated anion conductance of epithelial cell apical membranes.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	4	 As a principal apical conductance pathway, the CFTR anion channel is involved in cAMP-dependent Cl and bicarbonate secretion in airway and intestinal epithelia and exocrine glands.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	5	 It also influences the activity of other conductive pathways, through either linked regulatory interactions or electrochemical coupling that influences the driving forces for ion transport (49, 93).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Subsequent to the cloning of the CFTR gene, methods for in situ hybridization and the development of antibodies to CFTR permitted the characterization of its distribution in a variety of tissues (52, 104, 107).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The results generally correlated with the presence of cAMP/PKA-stimulated anion secretory processes in various epithelial tissues, identified in earlier studies using physiological methods.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Mutations in the gene encoding CFTR produce cystic fibrosis (CF), whereas hyperactivity of this transport pathway underlies secretory diarrheas.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	9	 CF disease arises from a reduced density and/or activity of CFTR in the apical membranes of secretory epithelial cells, such as those in the airways, exocrine pancreas, salivary glands, reproductive tissues, and intestines.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	10	 A regulated CFTR conductance pathway is also important for the normal functions of several absorptive cells, including epithelia lining the airway surface and sweat gland ducts (for a general review, see Ref.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	11	The subject of this review is CFTR trafficking in the distal portion of the protein secretory pathway, which lies between the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Historically, studies of this pathway were motivated by the question of whether it would be possible to explain all of the manifestations of CF disease on the basis of a missing anion conductance at the apical membranes of epithelial cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Accordingly, functional roles for CFTR other than its primary role as an apical membrane anion conductance pathway have been proposed to contribute to CF pathology.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These include disease-associated changes in regulated protein secretion (65), the chemistry of macromolecular secretions (22, 33, 90), and the properties of the airway microenvironment that lead to bacterial colonization of CF airways (89).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	15	Although the attention of numerous investigators has focused on CFTR trafficking through the distal protein secretory pathway as a possible contributor to the complexity of CF disease, a consensus regarding the importance of intracellular CFTR function and the process of regulated CFTR trafficking within this subcellular domain has yet to emerge.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	16	 As an integral membrane protein, CFTR will reside at least transiently in all compartments of the protein secretory pathway as it migrates toward the cell surface.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Thus one can expect to find CFTR in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and endosomal and lysosomal compartments of epithelial cells (Fig.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Although there is no question that CFTR channels function as a regulated conductance pathway when they are resident in the apical membrane, numerous studies (see CFTR LOCALIZATION IN CELLS) have also indicated that a significant quantity of mature (i.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	19	, post-Golgi) CFTR is contained within intracellular compartments, that CFTR within these compartments is functional (9, 78), and that cAMP stimulation can modulate the distribution of CFTR between these compartments and the plasma membrane (see REGULATED CFTR TRAFFIC).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Therefore, the issue is not whether apical Cl conductance is due to regulation of the gating of membrane-resident CFTR channels or whether it results from the insertion of CFTR channels into the membrane, because both processes occur.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	21	 We want to know to what extent these forms of CFTR regulation are linked mechanistically and how trafficking of CFTR contributes to the overall conductance response.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Properly folded, nascent CFTR leaves the rough endoplasmic reticulum and travels through the Golgi, where it undergoes glycosylation to mature (band C) protein.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Mature CFTR leaves the Golgi in vesicles that can travel directly to the apical plasma membrane or to the recycling endosome.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	26	 CFTR-containing vesicles continually traffic between recycling endosomes and plasma membrane, with rates of trafficking and protein distribution determined by cell type, differentiation, and phosphorylation conditions.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	27	 CFTR eventually follows the late endosome-to-lysosome pathway for degradation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Misfolded CFTR mutants and significant wild-type nascent CFTRs are degraded by the proteosome.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	29	This area of CFTR cell biology has been among the most contentious and unresolved subjects in CF research, and it continues to be so.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In a relatively recent review of this subject, Bradbury (10) argued that disparate conclusions regarding the regulation of the distribution of CFTR between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments might be reconciled if regulated CFTR trafficking was a property specific to epithelial cells, i.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	31	, studies showing a lack of CFTR trafficking were generally performed in fibroblasts.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Nevertheless, four years after the Bradbury review, the literature has not been clarified.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Accordingly, the task of bringing some synthesis to this conflicting data set is not an easy one.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Yet, we feel that it is possible to do so and that the attempt should add to our understanding of the control of plasma membrane CFTR density, a critical issue in CF disease.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	35	Location of mature CFTR (band C).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	36	 From a biochemical standpoint, the prevailing view is that core-glycosylated, immature (band B) CFTR is localized in the ER, whereas complex glycosylated, mature (band C) CFTR is present primarily in compartments distal to the Golgi, including the apical membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In contrast with many heterologous expression systems, relatively little band B is observed by immunoblot in most epithelial cells expressing CFTR endogenously at steady state.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	38	 For example, the ratio of band C to B in Calu-3 airway cells is 10 (100).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	39	 This indicates that most of the CFTR expressed endogenously in epithelial cells is located in distal compartments of the protein secretory pathway.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The first reported studies of CFTR localization, performed in COS-7 cells transiently expressing CFTR, showed a weak, diffuse plasma membrane staining pattern.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Most of the signal was intracellular, probably due to protein overexpression (23).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	42	 In polarized epithelial cells that express CFTR endogenously (T84, HT29, Caco-2, and airway epithelia), this signal was located unambiguously at the apical membrane domain (27, 28).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	43	 No staining was detected in the basolateral membrane, and little perinuclear staining of CFTR was observed in epithelial monolayers, implying that little CFTR is present in the ER at steady state (consistent with the low levels of band B).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	44	 (27) highlighted the importance of localizing CFTR within epithelial cells that express the protein endogenously.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	45	 In the same study, a mostly intracellular location of exogenously expressed CFTR was found in non-polar HeLa and 3T3 cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The central question concerning the issue of regulated CFTR trafficking is whether the protein that contributes to the plasma membrane anion conductance is present strictly in the apical plasma membranes of epithelial cells or whether it is present also in a subapical, post-Golgi compartment from which it is mobilized to the cell surface during stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	47	 A related issue is whether CFTR is stable in the plasma membrane or undergoes recycling to intracellular compartments.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	48	 In this regard, a rapid rate of CFTR endocytosis from the cell surface has been observed in both epithelial and nonepithelial systems (13, 61, 85).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	49	 These studies used biotinylation procedures to monitor the rate of CFTR internalization from the cell surface.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In T84 cells, it was estimated that 50% of cell surface CFTR is retrieved within a few minutes (85); in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells the internalization rate was 5% per minute (61).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	51	 These rates of endocytosis are not different from those of constitutively recycling receptors, such as those for transferrin or LDL.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	52	 These findings, together with the estimated 24- to 48-h half-life of mature, plasma membrane CFTR (7, 41), indicate that virtually all of the CFTR that is internalized by endocytosis must be returned to the plasma membrane by a recycling/exocytic pathway.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The presence of this rapid CFTR recycling pathway is a minimal requirement for a regulated insertion-retrieval model that controls cellular CFTR distribution.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Thus the question should not be whether CFTR undergoes trafficking at the plasma membrane but whether this process contributes to a change in the distribution of CFTR between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in response to cAMP/PKA regulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	55	In addition to these kinetic considerations, the presence of CFTR in endosomes under steady-state conditions has been established with the use of a combination of biochemical techniques and functional assays that rely on CFTR's anion channel activity.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	56	 (12) resolved CFTR in the early stages of endosomal retrieval within clathrin-coated vesicles from epithelial cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	57	 CFTR was demonstrated to be present in this compartment by immunoblot.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	58	 After removal of the clathrin lattice by uncoatase and fusion of the resulting membranes with planar lipid bilayers, currents with biophysical and regulatory properties characteristic of CFTR were observed.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Because clathrin removal was a necessary prerequisite for reconstitution, CFTR was definitely a component of this endocytic compartment.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Additional studies have demonstrated that the rapid endocytosis of CFTR from the cell surface depends on clathrin-mediated pathways and that CFTR is not significantly internalized into caveolae (11, 85).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Several transport and/or channel proteins have been found to internalize via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, including aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) (101), Na/H exchanger 3 (NHE3) (24), renal outer medulla K channels (ROMK) (114), and epithelial Na channels (ENaC) (96).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Recent studies of the mechanism of CFTR endocytosis (see Functional studies of endocytosis) indicate a direct physical interaction of CFTR with the plasma membrane adapter complex, making CFTR a specific target of this endocytic machinery.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	63	Other methods for demonstrating the presence of CFTR in endosomes have relied on the ability of CFTR to provide a pathway for anion transport that parallels the vacuolar H-ATPase.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	64	 (60) allowed CHO cells expressing CFTR to take up the pH-sensitive dye FITC-dextran into endosomes, where the rate of dissipation of a pH gradient across endosomal membranes was stimulated by addition of a proton ionophore.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	65	 In these intact cells, pH gradient dissipation was limited by the counterion.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Activation of cAMP production elicited a twofold increase in the rate of pH change in cells expressing CFTR but not in parental or mock-transfected cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The results were duplicated in microsomes isolated from these cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Biwersi and Verkman (9) used a similar method for monitoring endosomal pH in CFTR-transfected 3T3 cells and in T84 cells endogenously expressing CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Treatment of the cells with forskolin before microsome isolation produced an approximately twofold increase in the rate of subsequently measured pH gradient dissipation but had no effect on microsomes isolated from nontransfected or F508 CFTR-expressing 3T3 cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	70	 These data are also consistent with the presence of functional CFTR in endosomes that, in principle, could contribute to CFTR recycling.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy for detection of cellular CFTR, investigators have generated data that arrive at somewhat divergent conclusions with respect to the importance of regulated CFTR trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	72	 On one side of this issue is the study of Lehrich et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	73	 (55) in shark rectal gland, a tissue that expresses CFTR at high levels endogenously.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	74	 These investigators used quantitative confocal microscopy to show that CFTR immunofluorescence extended from the apical membrane into subapical, supernuclear regions of the cell and that during stimulation with secretagogues, the overall depth of this CFTR signal decreased by 50%.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Similar conclusions were reached when the histogram of CFTR fluorescence intensity as a function of distance from the apical membrane was quantitated.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	76	 These cAMP agonist effects on CFTR distribution, imposed in perfused, intact rectal glands before fixation, were reversible.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Whether this shift in fluorescence signal represents insertion of vesicles containing CFTR into the apical membrane remains unknown; however, the findings are consistent with the acute hormonal regulation of CFTR trafficking in an intact epithelial tissue.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	78	 (1, 2) used immunofluorescence microscopy to quantify the cellular location of CFTR in rat small intestine and the influence of cAMP-dependent agonists on its distribution.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) elicited a bicarbonate-rich fluid secretory response in isolated perfused intestinal loops and elicited, within the same time frame, a redistribution of CFTR to the apical membrane domain.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	80	 CFTR association with the apical membrane was quantified by colocalization of F-actin as a brush border marker.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	81	 In duodenal villus cells, VIP elicited a reversible, threefold increase in brush border associated CFTR, and it redistributed CFTR within the cell apex to the brush border within 30 min.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	82	 These studies were confirmed by immunoelectron microscopic methods (see Immunoelectron microscopy).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The results provide support for a physiological role for cAMP-induced CFTR-containing membrane traffic in the regulation of the apical anion conductance in a native, endogenously expressing epithelium.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	84	Other investigators have reached different conclusions with respect to regulated CFTR trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	85	 (70) expressed a GFP-CFTR fusion protein in MDCK type I epithelial cells and used quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy and cell surface biotinylation to determine the effect of cAMP stimulation on apical membrane CFTR localization.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Their findings showed that cAMP did not stimulate detectable GFP-CFTR translocation from intracellular compartments to the apical membrane, along an apical-to-basal GFP fluorescence gradient that extended throughout the cell.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	87	 In these cells, cAMP did not regulate GFP-CFTR endocytosis, determined by apical biotinylation and subsequent immunoprecipitation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Likewise, disruption of microtubules with colchicine did not affect cAMP-stimulation of Cl secretion or the expression of GFP-CFTR in the apical membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Thus the authors concluded that cAMP stimulates CFTR-mediated Cl secretion in MDCK type I cells by activating only the channels that are resident in the apical membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	90	 A regulated CFTR trafficking event may be lacking in this cell type; however, it is also reasonable to ask whether the exogenous expression of CFTR driven by the CMV promoter leads to saturation of regulated trafficking pathways (see Functional studies of exocytosis).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	91	A related study (58) involving measurements of cellular CFTR immunolocalization in endogenously expressing Calu-3 epithelia by fluorescence confocal microscopy detected no change in apical CFTR staining upon cAMP stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Surface biotinylation experiments reported in the same study (58) also showed no stimulation-dependent increase in apical membrane CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Two biotinylated proteins were detected by CFTR antibody precipitation following biotinylation; they were of equal intensity and 200 to 220 kDa in molecular size.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Yet, others have demonstrated by immunoblot that CFTR in Calu-3 cells shows the typical pattern of a predominant band C of 150 to 180 kDa and relatively little band B; the latter is presumably intracellular (c.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Thus it is not clear that the biotin-labeled proteins identified in these experiments were CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	96	It is possible that differences in the conclusions drawn from fluorescence measurements in native and cultured epithelial cells stem from variations in the distribution of CFTR in subapical compartments under nonstimulated conditions.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	97	 In the studies of native secretory tissues (shark rectal gland and rat intestine), the apical fluorescence signal extended into the cell sufficiently to detect a clear change in its distribution with stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In MDCK cells expressing GFP-CFTR (70), there was an even deeper distribution of expressed protein, but this may reflect its deposition in nonphysiological compartments, as described earlier in this article.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Given quantitative limitations of GFP visualization, 7 molecules/pixel (79), it may be necessary to express CFTR at nonphysiological levels to obtain a CFTR signal.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	100	 In Calu-3 cells (58), the CFTR signal was much more densely localized at the apical membrane domain.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Nevertheless, it is reasonable to ask whether a band of apical fluorescence detected in epithelial cross sections can resolve apical membrane CFTR from that present in a nearby subapical recycling pool.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Consideration of the point-spread function of fluorescence intensity variation with distance suggests that structures separated by  > 0.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Thus immunofluorescence, even coupled with confocal microscopy, may lack the ability to resolve fluorescence signals from membrane vesicles having a diameter of 0.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	106	 This vesicle size expectation is based on neurosecretory and other regulated trafficking vesicles (see APPENDIX).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	107	 For example, intracellular GLUT-4 staining by thin-section immunoelectron microscopy was localized to vesiculotubular structures 50 to 70 nm in diameter (62).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Thus it is possible that different conclusions at the light microscopic level may emerge from different cellular distributions of intracellular CFTR trafficking compartments and their constituents (see CONSEQUENCES OF REGULATED CFTR TRAFFICKING).

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Immunogold labeling of CFTR-expressing L cells and Sf9 cells also demonstrated the presence of CFTR beneath the plasma membrane as well as in the rough ER (26).

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Virally expressed, FLAG-tagged CFTR was functional and could be detected on the apical surface of forskolin-stimulated, polarized MDCK (type II) cells by immunofluorescence performed on nonpermeabilized epithelial monolayers.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	126	 At a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) (i.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	127	, lower CFTR expression level), forskolin stimulated the insertion of M2-901/CFTR into the apical membrane, but at higher MOI and M2-901/CFTR expression levels, no agonist-dependent increase in surface expression could be detected.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the redistribution of CFTR to the apical membrane upon forskolin stimulation at the lower CFTR expression levels and demonstrated that the apically inserted CFTR originated from a population of subapical vesicles.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Results similar to these have been obtained with the use of immunoelectron microscopy in Calu-3 cells endogenously expressing CFTR, where a two- to threefold increase in apical CFTR was observed in response to acute forskolin stimulation (Hug MJ and Frizzell RA, unpublished observation).

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	131	 (42) may reconcile at least some of the prior conflicting reports regarding the effect of cAMP stimulation on CFTR trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	132	 They show that a high level of CFTR expression, obtained by using strong promoters, for example (70), can saturate pathways for regulated CFTR trafficking, even in epithelial systems.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Also in oocytes, the CFTR trafficking signal (cAMP-induced increase in membrane capacitance) saturated as the CFTR expression level was elevated by injection of more RNA (102).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Inappropriate trafficking of AQP-2, in relation to the actions of dominant-negative AQP-2 mutants, has also been observed at high protein expression levels (51).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Later in this article, we discuss candidate protein interactions that may mediate regulated CFTR trafficking at the apical membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	136	 If cells express different levels of the relevant traffic regulatory proteins, then it is likely that the contribution of regulated CFTR trafficking to the total anion conductance (as opposed to regulated gating of membrane resident CFTR) will vary in different epithelial or nonepithelial systems.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	137	The first studies that implicated CFTR function in regulated endocytosis were performed in colonic and pancreatic epithelial cell lines, with the latter transduced to express CFTR using retrovirus vectors.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	139	 They found that cAMP significantly inhibited fluid-phase endocytosis, and in pancreatic cells, this depended on the expression of wild-type (wt) CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	140	 No cAMP inhibition of endocytic activity was observed in parental CFPAC-1 cells or those transduced by empty vector.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	141	 A similar 60% inhibition of endocytosis was observed during cAMP stimulation of endogenous CFTR-expressing T84 (13) and 9HTEo-cells (94).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In T84 cells, PKC stimulation did not affect either basal endocytosis or the inhibitory effect elicited by cAMP stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	143	Methods employing biotinylation of the cell surface have also demonstrated that CFTR internalization is inhibited by cAMP/PKA.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Subsequent immunoprecipitation and radioisotope labeling of CFTR with the use of [32P]ATP and PKA was performed to distinguish between CFTR at the cell surface and in intracellular compartments.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	146	 These workers found that apical membrane CFTR was rapidly internalized by T84 cells (half-time of 3 min), and they showed that cAMP decreased this internalization rate to an extent similar to that found in prior studies of fluid-phase endocytosis (60% inhibition).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	147	 They also showed that the internalization rate of G551D CFTR was similar to that of the wild-type protein but that, interestingly, its endocytosis was not affected by cAMP.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	148	 This finding suggested that either the channel activity of CFTR is related to its ability to be retrieved from the cell surface or the altered structure of the G551D mutant precludes regulation of both gating and trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	149	 It was difficult to detect a change in the total amount of CFTR at the cell surface using the method of Prince et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Even at short times (1 min), only a 12% increase in apical membrane CFTR was detected.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	151	 However, the use of in vitro phosphorylation to detect CFTR after its biotinylation and immunoprecipitation may be influenced by the existing phosphorylation status of the protein, thus compromising surface CFTR detection.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	152	 That is, if CFTR is already phosphorylated by agonist, the subsequent CFTR signal would be reduced because phosphorylation sites are already occupied.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	153	 A method that avoids this complication employs a second CFTR antibody to detect biotinylated CFTR, which avoids the potential for back-phosphorylation to reduce the signal.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	154	 This approach also demonstrates a forskolin-induced inhibition of CFTR endocytosis, a depletion of the protein from intracellular compartments, and a consequent increase in plasma membrane CFTR (61).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	155	Studies documenting the presence of functional CFTR in endosomes have been extended to show a role for CFTR in postendocytic membrane trafficking.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	157	 They labeled endosomes of CFTR-expressing and control 3T3 cells with fluorophores such that a fluorescence signal would be detected if endosomes from separately labeled cell populations fused with one another.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	158	 These investigators asked whether the presence of CFTR in these endosomes, and its stimulation by cAMP, influenced the fusion process.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Endosomes from nonstimulated CFTR-expressing cells fused with each other at a rate that did not differ from that observed in control cells not expressing CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The endosomes isolated from CFTR-expressing cells that were stimulated by forskolin, however, showed a 2.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	161	 This was abolished by endosomal Cl depletion, suggesting that a CFTR-mediated Cl flux, or the conformational changes in CFTR associated with Cl conduction, somehow contribute to this process.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	162	 These data are consistent with the concept that CFTR stimulation can alter membrane traffic in endosomal recycling pathways.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	163	Recent findings have been able to establish certain structural features of CFTR that govern its rapid removal from the cell surface.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	164	 (84) and Weixel and Bradbury (109) have demonstrated that the internalization of CFTR via clathrin-dependent mechanisms depends on the presence of a YXX motif (where is a bulky hydrophobic residue) at the CFTR COOH terminus.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Similar tyrosine-based endocytic motifs are present on other proteins that are rapidly retrieved from the cell surface (see Ref.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	166	 In vivo cross-linking and in vitro pull-down assays showed that CFTR binds to the plasma membrane endocytic adaptor complex AP-2.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Mutation of the tyrosine residue at position 1424 of CFTR significantly reduced the ability of an isolated CFTR COOH terminus to bind AP-2.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The YDSI sequence of CFTR interacts specifically with the  micro2 subunit of AP-2 (108), a site implicated in adapter binding to similar endocytic motifs (74).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Protein binding studies showed that the COOH terminus binds selectively to this adapter subunit.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Cells expressing either a dominant negative  micro2 or a CFTR lacking the tyrosine-based internalization motif at the COOH terminus (Y1424A) fail to endocytose CFTR efficiently.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	172	 These studies indicate that the interaction of CFTR's COOH terminus with AP-2 guides it into the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway, as observed for many cell surface receptors.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Although these studies provide compelling evidence for specific protein interactions that mediate CFTR retrieval at the cell surface, they do not yet provide an indication of how this process may be regulated by cAMP/PKA.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	174	 We have speculated on possible mechanisms for regulated CFTR endocytosis (see MECHANISMS OF REGULATED CFTR TRAFFICKING: PERPETRATOR OR BYSTANDER? and Fig.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	184	 (13) on CFTR-dependent endocytosis also examined CFTR-dependent exocytic recycling to the cell surface.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	185	 To monitor exocytosis, the plasma membranes were pulse-labeled with a biotinylated lectin (WGA), and after its removal from the bath, the cells were allowed to take up lectin into intracellular compartments.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Remaining cell surface WGA was blocked with unlabeled avidin, and at various times the recycling of internalized WGA to the cell surface was assayed using Texas Red-labeled avidin.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	187	 In cells expressing wt CFTR, recycling and exocytosis of internalized marker was increased approximately threefold by forskolin, whereas cAMP stimulation had no effect on WGA recycling in either the parental CFPAC-1 cell line or in empty vector controls.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Importantly, these studies showed that cAMP-responsive recycling/exocytosis required CFTR expression.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	189	Similar findings were obtained in human airway cell lines (94) where recycling/exocytosis was monitored as the release of previously internalized FITC-dextran (a fluid-phase marker of endocytosis) from human airway cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Treatment of cells expressing wt CFTR with a cAMP analog elicited increased release of FITC-dextran, and this was accompanied by increases in membrane capacitance monitored during whole cell patch-clamp measurements.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Again, trafficking was CFTR dependent; cAMP had no effect on membrane capacitance or recycling/exocytosis in airway cells derived from a CF patient.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The investigators concluded that cAMP stimulates exocytosis and the CFTR Cl conductance of normal but not CF cells and that it does so by stimulating the delivery of CFTR channels from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	193	Much of the effort to determine whether cAMP stimulates CFTR-dependent membrane trafficking has employed measurements of membrane capacitance in cells that express CFTR endogenously or cells in which CFTR expression was induced.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	194	 These studies are summarized in Table 1, which tabulates the methods, conditions, and experimental results of these studies.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	195	 As discussed below, the diversity of methods and conditions used may contribute to their variable outcome.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Measurement of stimulated capacitance in CFTR-expressing tissue.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	197	Previous work in nonepithelial cell lines (e.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	198	, CHO cells) failed to show CFTR- and cAMP-dependent membrane trafficking (29, 47), again suggesting that the machinery for regulated CFTR recycling may be expressed only in epithelial cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	199	 However, studies of Xenopus oocytes generally have shown a good correlation between cAMP stimulation of CFTR currents and increases in membrane capacitance (81, 102, 105).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	200	 In the studies of Takahashi et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	201	 (102), the apparent changes in cell surface area with stimulation, determined from membrane capacitance measurements, were confirmed by using blinded measurements of membrane morphometry in stimulated and nonstimulated cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	202	 In addition, recruitment of CFTR to the cell surface was demonstrated by using epitope-tagged M2-901/CFTR labeling of nonpermeabilized cells (81).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Together, these findings are consistent with the exocytic insertion of CFTR into the oocyte plasma membrane during cAMP stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The cell surface immunofluorescence studies of Peters et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	205	 (81) suggested a low level of CFTR expression in the plasma membrane of nonstimulated oocytes (i.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	206	, fluorescence levels were near background in the absence of stimulation).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	207	 These data suggested that recruitment of CFTR to the cell surface is a significant component of CFTR current stimulation in this system.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	208	 However, this conclusion assumes that the flag-CFTR labeling approach can detect low levels of cell surface CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Although technically difficult, it would be optimal to determine a dose-response relation between cAMP-dependent cell surface CFTR labeling and some independent parameter such as the corresponding change in membrane capacitance.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	210	 It is possible, for example, that some threshold level of CFTR residing in the plasma membrane cannot be detected by this method, underestimating levels of CFTR at the cell surface under basal conditions.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	211	 However, this concern does not compromise the data, obtained from three different methods, consistent with stimulation-dependent recruitment of CFTR to the surface of these cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	212	The electrophysiological aspects of these studies were confirmed by the work of Weber et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	213	 (105), who used impedance analysis to assess membrane conductance and capacitance and correlated the changes in these parameters induced by cAMP.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	214	 In agreement with prior reports (81, 102), cAMP stimulation of CFTR-expressing oocytes evoked significant increases in both current and capacitance that were not observed in noninjected or F508-expressing cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Injection of Rp-cAMP (a specific cAMP antagonist) abolished the effects of the cAMP stimulation on both current and capacitance.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Interestingly, the less specific PKA inhibitors, KT5720 and H8, after prolonged (overnight) exposure, primarily blocked the capacitance increases evoked by cAMP while having less effect on the corresponding current activation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	217	 However, these reagents have been shown to alter cytoskeletal properties.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	218	 For example, KT5720 induces microtubule rearrangement by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (76), and H8 has been shown to alter cytoskeletal protein phosphorylation through inhibition of PKC (63).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	219	 It would be interesting to explore these actions further, because both of these less selective kinase inhibitors produce cytoskeletal disruption, which may account for their inhibitory effects on membrane trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	220	 (106) showed that microtubule disruption markedly inhibits current and capacitance increases evoked by cAMP in CFTR-expressing oocytes, and similar conclusions have been reached in CFTR-expressing epithelial cells (103).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	221	Although two groups have independently demonstrated cAMP-dependent changes in membrane capacitance and other parameters indicative of regulated CFTR trafficking in Xenopus oocytes, using different analytic methods Liu et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	222	 (57) arrived at a different conclusion.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	223	 They employed a CFTR construct containing a cysteine substitution in the postulated CFTR conduction pathway to arrive at the conclusion that essentially all conductance activation by cAMP in oocytes was due to CFTR channels that are already present in the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	224	 This approach relied on changes in conductance induced by treatment of this CFTR mutant with cysteine-reactive methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents, whose effects have been attributed to altered charge shielding properties in the CFTR conduction pathway.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	225	 When oocytes were treated briefly with 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSET; a positively charged modifier) for as little as 20 s before cAMP activation, the activated channels behaved as if their properties were already modified.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Because MTSET has been demonstrated in other systems to be cell impermeant, the data suggest that the modified channels must have already been present at the cell surface.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	227	 These findings are consistent with a lack of regulated CFTR redistribution in oocytes, but they need not negate the results of prior studies for two reasons.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	228	 First, this study used CFTR expression levels (based on conductance) that are 5 to 10 times higher than the prior work in which capacitance measurements were made.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	229	 As discussed earlier in this article, overexpression of CFTR can saturate pathways available for regulated trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Consistent with this idea, Takahashi et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	231	 (102) observed that increasing CFTR expression levels increased CFTR currents, but the corresponding capacitance changes plateaued, as if regulated trafficking pathways had saturated.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Constitutive delivery of CFTR to the plasma membrane at high expression levels would limit one's ability to detect a population of trafficking channels.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	233	 (57) did not measure membrane capacitance, cell surface CFTR, or any other measure of CFTR trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Nevertheless, there is not a facile explanation for differences between these carefully performed studies and those cited above.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	235	 It should be determined, using MTS CFTR modification together with capacitance measurements or surface CFTR labeling, whether high CFTR expression levels would account for these results.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	236	Two recent studies, performed in mammalian epithelial cells that endogenously express CFTR, have reported negative findings with respect to changes in membrane capacitance during cAMP stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	237	 As an independent assay, both studies also employed FM 1-43 dye labeling in an attempt to monitor membrane addition to the plasma membrane that would result from exocytosis stimulated by cAMP.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	238	 (21), membrane capacitance was measured in Calu-3 airway cells by imposing alternating sinusoidal and square voltage waveforms and monitoring the resulting currents to assess membrane capacitance and conductance.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	239	 The calculated capacitance changes induced by cAMP were insignificant.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	240	 In addition, they found no increase in steady-state plasma membrane labeling by FM 1-43 when the cells were stimulated by cAMP during fluorescence measurements.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Enhanced dye labeling (fluorescence intensity) would be expected if additional membrane were exposed at the cell surface as a result of exocytosis.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Thus the authors concluded that cAMP does not stimulate CFTR currents by increasing CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane but stimulates only membrane-resident CFTR channels in Calu-3 cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	243	In a similar study, Chang et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	244	 (20) used sinusoidal voltage-current phase-lag analysis to estimate cell capacitance and fluorescence measurements of FM 1-43 membrane dye labeling in colonic HT29-Cl.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	246	 The outcome in the airway cell line was similar to that in study by Chen et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	247	, no detectable cAMP-induced changes in membrane capacitance or FM dye labeling.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	248	 In HT29 cells, increases in membrane capacitance with cAMP stimulation occurred only when endocytosis was blocked with the use of a dynamin antibody.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	249	 As the authors indicated, the absence of a change without dynamin inhibition may result from parallel increases in both exocytosis and endocytosis during stimulation, i.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	251	 (20), despite the sophisticated methodologies employed, have two significant shortcomings that preclude definitive conclusions regarding regulated CFTR trafficking in these systems.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	252	 First, both studies were performed at room temperature, a condition that is known to impair regulated membrane traffic in a variety of systems.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	253	 For example, the release of amylase from pancreatic exocrine cells is decreased 70% at 25 degrees C compared with normal temperature.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	254	 The release of insulin from rat pancreatic islets is markedly inhibited at 25 degrees C, with a 90% reduction in the membrane capacitance response to stimulation (the Q10 was 11.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In addition, cAMP-regulated AQP-2 recycling in renal cells is blocked at 20 degrees C (38).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Indeed, recent data collected in this laboratory (45) indicate that studies performed at 37 degrees C in Calu-3 cells using either sinusoidal waveform analysis or current transient analysis show a 1 pF increase in membrane capacitance (basal membrane capacitance averages 20 pF) in response to cAMP stimulation that parallels the increase in membrane conductance.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	257	 When identical recordings were made at room temperature with 5 or 10 mM EGTA in the pipette solution (conditions of the Chen and Chang studies), cAMP elicited no significant increase in membrane capacitance.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	258	 It is interesting that early recordings of capacitance changes in airway cells (94) showed cAMP-dependent increases at 23 degrees C (Table 1); however, these experiments employed low EGTA concentrations (Ca buffering at normal resting levels) in the recording pipette.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Thus the recording conditions have not been consistent.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	260	The assays of FM dye labeling (also performed at room temperature) were conducted by using a protocol that is insensitive to small increases in membrane area.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	261	 The cells were labeled to steady-state intensity with FM dye, and their fluorescence intensity was monitored during cAMP stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	262	 However, if the increase in plasma membrane area induced by cAMP is only 3% over the basal membrane area (suggested from capacitance measurements at 37 degrees C; Ref.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	263	 46), this signal would not be detected during steady-state dye labeling.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Rather, subsequent to stimulation, it is necessary to wash out dye and agonist from the membrane to minimize plasma membrane (background) staining.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	265	 This permits visualization of the dye retrieved by subsequent endocytosis of labeled plasma membrane, assuming that the cell recovers to its original area following reversal of stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	266	 As recent studies in this laboratory performed at 37 degrees C have demonstrated, measurements performed in this manner indicate that FM 1-43 labeling is increased by cAMP stimulation in Calu-3 (45).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The protocol used in the studies of Chen et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	268	 (20) is similar to methods employed to monitor secretory granule release in systems that incorporate large amounts of membrane into the cell surface during stimulation (e.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	269	, pancreatic acinar cells), generally in response to stimulation by a cellular calcium rise (36).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	270	 In these systems, the addition of membrane (and increase in FM dye signal) at steady state is easily demonstrated, as it is in HT29 to 16E cells during stimulation of mucin secretion by Ca-dependent agonists (Bertrand CA, Laboisse C, Hopfer U, Bridges RJ, and Frizzell RA, unpublished observations).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Estimates of the numbers of CFTR channels in intracellular vesicles obtained by using data derived from Calu-3 cell and oocyte measurements are provided in the APPENDIX.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Important assumptions in these calculations include the single-channel parameters and assumed vesicle radius (100 nm).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	273	 The calculations are based on reported values of membrane current and capacitance changes from patch-clamp studies of cAMP-stimulated cells (46, 102).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	274	 These calculations and assumptions yield estimates of 1 to 10 channels per vesicle in these systems; they are not likely to provide more than one order of magnitude estimate of channel density.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	275	 The mean oocyte current and capacitance changes reported by Weber et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	276	 (105) were both approximately fourfold smaller than those in the Takahashi study (102) so that the calculated outcome would be unaffected.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	277	 (110) estimated the number of Na-dependent glucose transporters per oocyte vesicle at 10 to 20, based on freeze-fracture scanning electron microscopy.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	278	 The size of the imaged oocyte vesicles was 100 to 120 nm.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	279	 The value of 1 to 10 CFTRs per vesicle is instructive when considering whether one should be able to visualize vesicular GFP-CFTR by light microscopic methods.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	280	 As discussed earlier in this article, the sensitivity of GFP detection (79), together with these considerations, suggests that CFTR density in a single transport vesicle is near the limit of detection.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	281	 It is worth emphasizing that the source of CFTR current generation, whether membrane-resident or inserted channels, need not be a black-and-white issue.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	282	 In most systems, plasma membrane CFTR currents are likely to arise from both stimulation of membrane-resident channels and acutely trafficked CFTR channels, and the proportions of these may differ among cell types or experimental conditions (see CONSEQUENCES OF REGULATED CFTR TRAFFICKING).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Data from studies of the regulated trafficking of GLUT-4 or AQP-2 indicate that they undergo recycling even under basal conditions (15, 17).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	284	 During stimulation, the rate coefficients of the steps involved in recycling these proteins are altered, changing their distribution to increase the number of transporters and/or channels in the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Presumably, regulated CFTR recycling behaves similarly.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	286	 As appears to be true of CFTR, the cellular background that can support regulated GLUT-4 or AQP-2 trafficking is very important.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Thus the expression of GLUT-4 in nonmuscle or nonadipose derived cells eliminates the insulin-regulated redistribution of GLUT-4 (40, 44).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Similarly for AQP-2, its endogenous expression in vas deferens results in a constitutive apical membrane localization; the channel is not found in a cAMP/PKA-regulated internal compartment as it is in renal epithelia, and there is no effect of stimulation on apical channel density (99).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	289	 A requirement for the proper cellular context is likely to also characterize the regulated trafficking of CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	290	 The AQP-2 data suggest that such differences can exist not only between epithelial and nonepithelial cells but also between epithelial systems.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	291	 This conclusion underscores the need to determine which cellular components provide the proper context.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	292	 The physical interaction between the CFTR COOH terminus and the  micro2 subunit of the AP-2 adapter complex, indicated by the results of recent studies (108), suggests a model like that shown in Fig.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	293	 2 for PKA-mediated regulation of endocytosis.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	294	 This scheme is based on observations concerning the inherently rapid rate of CFTR-dependent endocytosis and the inhibitory effect of cAMP on this process (13, 14, 61, 85).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	295	 It assumes that CFTR is normally endocytosed at a rapid rate because of its interaction with the AP-2 adapter complex at the YDSI motif of the COOH terminus.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Recent data indicate that this interaction requires also phosphorylation of the  micro2 subunit, which facilitates AP-2 interactions with membrane lipids (25).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	297	 2 implies that the PKA-mediated inhibition of CFTR endocytosis may result from occlusion or obstruction of the adapter protein binding site at the COOH terminus by a CFTR phosphorylation event.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	298	 For example, this could result from an as yet unidentified physical interaction of the phosphorylated R domain with the COOH-terminal tail where adapters bind, or it could be mediated by another interacting protein whose association with the COOH terminus is proportional to CFTR phosphorylation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	299	 The key feature of this model relies on phosphorylation-dependent accessibility of the COOH terminus site for adapter protein binding.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	300	A second possibility is that the YXX motif itself is altered by phosphorylation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	301	 In species where CFTR's sequence has been described, the YDSI motif is highly conserved (108).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Although it does not conform to a canonical PKA consensus sequence, it is possible that the Y+2 serine is phosphorylated by PKA or another kinase, which acts to disrupt the adapter binding motif.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	303	 The possibility that AMP kinase, implicated in binding to this region of CFTR (39), is involved in phosphorylation of the YDSI internalization motif requires evaluation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	304	 However, the function of this kinase is presumably to downregulate CFTR during metabolic stress, which would be expected to promote, not inhibit, CFTR retrieval.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Nevertheless, a phosphorylation event at or near this site could reduce the endocytic rate of CFTR in parallel with the activation of channel gating.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	306	 It remains to be determined whether such a mechanism can account for the finding, made in both epithelial and nonepithelial systems (13, 14, 85, 94), that PKA phosphorylation inhibits CFTR endocytosis, leading to retention of the channel on the cell surface.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	307	 What determines the ability of CFTR to enter a regulated (as opposed to constitutive; Fig.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	308	 1) secretory pathway during its progression to the cell surface? In Xenopus oocytes, a redistribution of CFTR between intracellular and plasma membrane compartments is demonstrable by immunofluorescence measurements, as discussed above.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	309	 These data can be interpreted to suggest that CFTR is stabilized, kinetically, in an intracellular compartment under nonstimulated conditions.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Therefore, it is reasonable to ask what structural feature(s) of CFTR provides for its entry into a regulated secretory pathway under basal conditions.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	311	 CFTR carries its own regulatory domain, and the phosphorylation of this domain stimulates both channel gating and trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Therefore, it is logical to ask whether the R domain is responsible for the entry of CFTR into a regulated pathway.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	313	 For this purpose, CFTR lacking the R domain has been expressed from two injected RNAs, each corresponding to a CFTR half molecule: N-TM1-NBD1 and TM2-NBD2-C (56).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Oocytes expressing these constructs showed spontaneous currents quantitatively similar to the stimulated currents of cells expressing wt CFTR, and they were not further augmented by cAMP stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	315	 In addition, there was no change in membrane capacitance during stimulation, indicating that regulated CFTR trafficking required the R domain.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	316	 The direct targeting of R-CFTR to the plasma membrane in these cells is consistent with the concept that the nonphosphorylated R domain may allow CFTR to access a regulated intracellular compartment and that CFTR within this compartment can be redistributed to the plasma membrane when the R domain is phosphorylated.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Therefore, it is reasonable to ask the following: What are the mediators of this process? Do protein interactions involving the R domain govern the movement of CFTR through this regulated trafficking pathway?.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	318	Although these questions cannot be answered with certainty at present, the relatively recent discovery by Kirk and colleagues (72, 73) that CFTR interacts physically and functionally with syntaxin 1A (S1A) suggests soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins as candidates for participation in this regulated trafficking process.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	319	 The interaction of S1A with the NH2 terminus of CFTR (73, 81) and the inhibition of CFTR currents during S1A overexpression (72) have been interpreted as the consequence of a direct interaction of S1A with CFTR that reduces its open probability (20).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	320	 However, in addition, Peters et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	321	 (81) showed that S1A overexpression decreased the density of CFTR channels in the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	322	 They concluded that disruption of SNARE complex formation by overexpressed S1A interfered with CFTR trafficking (presumably with exocytosis).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	323	 As regards the functional involvement of syntaxin with CFTR, there is no reason to discount one mechanism in favor of the other; that is, syntaxin may regulate CFTR gating and also function as a component of the machinery that brings CFTR into the plasma membrane, or it may act as a regulator of that process.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	324	How might SNARE proteins be involved in regulated CFTR exocytosis? To pose an answer to this question, we should recount several observations.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	325	 First, the Kirk laboratory has shown that the NH2 terminus of CFTR, to which S1A binds, also interacts with a proximal portion of the R domain in protein binding studies (71).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	326	 A series of basic amino acid residues at the NH2 terminus is thought to mediate this association.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Mutation of these residues altered the magnitude and kinetics of CFTR current stimulation in oocytes and decreased the open probability of single CFTR channels (34), perhaps by interfering with NH2 terminus-R domain interactions that influence CFTR gating.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	328	 The NH2 terminus is also the site of S1A binding (73).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Thus it is possible that NH2 terminus-R domain interactions influence the association of CFTR with S1A or that it affects the ability of S1A to interact with other proteins necessary for CFTR trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	330	In relation to another possible scenario, we recently reported physical and functional interactions of another synaptic terminal protein, the cysteine string protein (Csp), with CFTR (115).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Csp is a resident of synaptic vesicles, and its knockout interferes with regulated neurotransmitter release (116), as does a S1A knockout (111).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	332	 In protein binding studies, Csp interacted with both the CFTR NH2 terminus and R domain.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	333	 It seems likely that the interactions of S1A and Csp with the NH2 terminus and the additional interactions of the NH2 terminus and Csp with the R domain may provide a means for linking proteins involved in regulated membrane trafficking to the regulatory (phosphorylation) status of the R domain (similar in general concept to the proposal above for regulated CFTR endocytosis).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	334	 According to the model shown in Fig.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	335	 3, phosphorylation of the R domain would alter these protein interactions in a manner that would lead to SNARE protein associations appropriate for fusion of CFTR-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	336	 It is also of interest that Csp can bind to several SNARE proteins, including S1A, syntaxin 4, and vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP-2) and that Csp has been proposed as a modulator of SNARE protein interactions (19).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	337	 According to this concept, NH2 terminus-R domain interactions within CFTR can alter single-channel properties, but they may also couple the phosphorylation-dependent activation of CFTR channel gating to proteins that regulate CFTR trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	338	 It is possible that a protein such as Csp, through its ability to interact with SNARE proteins on one hand and with both the NH2 terminus and R-domain of CFTR on the other, provides a transduction mechanism for coupling CFTR channel activation to channel trafficking mediated by the SNARE machinery.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	342	 The NH2 terminus of CFTR binds to syntaxin 1A, which tethers vesicles close to the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	343	 The cysteine string protein (Csp), localized to CFTR-containing vesicles at the apical membrane domain, binds to the R domain.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	345	 B: stimulation by cAMP activates PKA, phosphorylating (asterisks) the R domain and Csp.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	346	 R domain phosphorylation may disrupt binding between syntaxin and the NH2 terminus, which also interacts with the R domain (see text).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	347	 Csp-R domain interactions may also be altered by phosphorylation; Csp may then act as a chaperone for SNARE protein interactions involving syntaxin 1A, which is now free to bind vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) and other members of the SNARE complex (not shown).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	348	 CFTR in the plasma membrane is active, and its gating is syntaxin sensitive.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	349	 C: the SNARE complex facilitates fusion of the CFTR vesicle to the plasma membrane, inserting active CFTR channels (D) and increasing CFTR channel density.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	350	In addition, the contribution of trafficking events to anion secretion may vary with the differentiation status of the epithelium (6, 37).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	351	 It has been found, for example, that CFTR in some epithelial cells does not find its way to the plasma membrane until the tight junctions have formed and the cells polarize (68).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	352	 As the epithelium is developing, cells may utilize regulated trafficking as a means to fine tune the apical Cl conductance until the expression levels of other transporters, metabolic or regulatory components, on which overall secretory or absorptive ion movements depend are expressed at appropriate levels.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	353	 At that stage, the mature cell may find it reasonable to better anchor CFTR in the plasma membrane by virtue of PDZ domain (69, 97) and other interactions, to shift the balance of channel distribution in favor of the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	354	 Yet, even in well-differentiated native epithelia, significant CFTR trafficking signals can be demonstrated (see REGULATED CFTR TRAFFIC).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	355	 Not until we know, from a mechanistic viewpoint, the protein interactions that mediate CFTR trafficking events will we be able to determine how such a balance is achieved or how it may be perturbed to counter the effects of disease.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	356	 Disease-related mutations that influence CFTR trafficking in distal compartments of the protein secretory pathway have been identified.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	357	 It is probably true that mutations in proteins that control general trafficking pathways would have a negative selective advantage and may be lethal; however, CFTR mutations that influence its trafficking have now been described.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	358	 Several reports have indicated that the half-life of F508 CFTR at the plasma membrane, and perhaps in other post-Golgi compartments, is markedly reduced relative to that of wt CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	359	 Using functional measurements of CFTR activity in CHO cells, Lukacs et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	360	 (59) found that the plasma membrane currents associated with F508 CFTR (recruited to the cell surface at low temperature) decayed with a half-time of  < 4 h, whereas the functional half-life of wt CFTR currents was  > 24 h.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	364	 They found that the half-life of plasma membrane F508 CFTR was 4 h, whereas the corresponding half-life of wt CFTR exceeded 48 h in these cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	365	 The cAMP-dependent iodide efflux correlated with CFTR expression at the cell surface.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	366	 These authors concluded that F508 CFTR is more rapidly internalized and perhaps targeted to a degradation pathway.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	367	 The parallel study of Sharma et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	368	 (95) reached a similar conclusion.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	369	 Mutant CFTR was encouraged to escape the ER with the use of a combination of reduced temperature and chemical chaperone (glycerol) treatment.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	370	 They observed also a rapid degradation rate of F508 CFTR, which they attribute to decreased conformational stability: the protein was more susceptible to aggregation and protease digestion.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	371	 These authors favor the concept that folding defects of this CFTR mutant persist in the mature, post-Golgi protein (most studies agree that it lacks normal channel gating kinetics and open probability; c.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	373	 It is also possible, in view of the model for regulated CFTR endocytosis illustrated in Fig.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	374	 2, that the rapid degradation of F508 CFTR reflects its more rapid endocytic rate (41, 95), increasing its exposure to degradation mechanisms.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	375	 It is evident from these findings that the altered stability of mutant CFTR in distal trafficking pathways will require attention should rescue of F508 CFTR from ER degradation pathways be an achievable therapeutic target for CF disease.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	376	Another interesting disease mutation that influences distal pathway CFTR trafficking has been identified by Silvis et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	377	 These investigators searched the mutation database for disease mutations that may lead to increased CFTR endocytosis through creation of an endocytic motif.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	378	 The N287Y mutant resides in the second intracellular loop of CFTR and results in mild disease when expressed in combination with F508 CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	379	 This mutant did not exhibit a folding defect, because the N287Y and wt CFTRs showed similar maturation kinetics.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	380	 However, there was roughly 50% of the mutant at the plasma membrane at steady state relative to wt CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	381	 An increased colocalization of the mutant with the endocytic marker EEA1 suggested that this mutation alters the distribution of CFTR between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	382	 Cl transport was reduced in proportion to altered cell surface CFTR, but the single-channel properties of N287Y were similar to those of wt CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	383	 Biotinylation experiments showed that N287Y CFTR was internalized approximately twice as fast as wt CFTR, which is expected to alter its distribution between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	384	 These findings provide evidence of disease mutations where the primary defect lies in altered kinetics of CFTR recycling at the plasma membrane, resulting in subnormal apical membrane CFTR levels.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	385	Intracellular CFTR channel function.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	386	 A second consequence of regulated CFTR trafficking is that intracellular CFTR distribution may vary with the secretory status of the epithelium.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	387	 Despite indications that intracellular CFTR channels can be activated by cAMP/PKA (9, 77), the model of Barasch et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	388	 (5), suggesting that vesicular CFTR activity alters internal compartment pH, cellular glycoprotein processing, and bacterial colonization, has not been supported by subsequent studies (32, 35, 60, 83).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	389	 Nevertheless, there is a fundamental need for resolving the causes for increased bacterial adherence to CF cells and their glycoprotein secretory products and for the preferential binding of P.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	391	 These findings argue that the deletion of CFTR from the distal secretory pathway influences epithelial cell surface chemistry.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	392	 These properties of CF cells and their secretions could be affected by CFTR-dependent membrane trafficking events in intracellular compartments as well as at the plasma membrane domain.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	393	 (8) demonstrated that CFTR promotes endosome-endosome fusion, and, as with plasma membrane CFTR redistribution, this required both CFTR expression and cAMP stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	394	 If the presence of CFTR in internal membranes alters patterns of posttranslational glycoprotein modification by changing the compartmentation of enzymes or substrates involved in these processes (78), the surface chemistry of CF cells may be affected.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	395	 An issue related to the above discussion concerns the role of CFTR in epithelial tissue protein secretory activity, which is largely suggested by the data of McPherson and colleagues (65, 67), who examined mucin and amylase secretion by salivary glands of control and CF patients.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	396	 Metabolic incorporation of isotopic label into the carbohydrate residues of mucins was used to quantitate secretory rates.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	397	 The results showed that the -adrenergic stimulation of mucin and amylase secretion was reduced 60% in submandibular salivary glands derived from CF subjects.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	398	 An extensive series of studies showed that alterations in signal transduction mechanisms were not responsible for this difference and that the mucin content of control and CF glands was similar.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	399	 Recently, similar results have been obtained by using the salivary glands of CFTR knockout mice (67).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	400	 Again, the cAMP-dependent secretory component of secretion was impaired.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	401	 (66) have performed experiments of this type in several human airway cell lines.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	402	 They demonstrated independent regulation of 14C-labeled glycoconjugate secretion by PKA and PKC pathways (i.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	403	 The PKA agonist isoproterenol increased mucin release by 40% in control cells, but this effect was virtually eliminated (reduced to 3% stimulation) in cells derived from CF subjects.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	404	 A difference in PKC-mediated secretion between control and CF cell lines was not detected, similar to the observations of Bradbury et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	405	 (13) on cAMP-regulated membrane trafficking in T84 cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	406	 Moreover, the attenuated PKA response in CF airway cells could be restored by adenovirus-mediated CFTR expression.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	407	 The results suggest that CFTR can play an important role in cAMP-mediated glycoconjugate secretion.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	408	 Although not explicitly implicating CFTR in mucin release, the studies of Kuver et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	409	 (54) have demonstrated cAMP-dependent regulation of protein or mucin secretion in CFTR-expressing canine gallbladder epithelial cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	410	 CFTR was detected by immunostaining on mucin granule membranes.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	411	In studies that may have implications for epithelial protein secretion, Yilla et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	412	 (112) examined the influence of vacuolar H-ATPase inhibition on the constitutive protein secretory pathway in HepG2 cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	413	 Although treatment with concanamycin B did not influence ER-to-Golgi transit, the kinetics of protein traffic between the Golgi and plasma membrane were significantly impaired.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	414	 The secretion of albumin, 1-antitrypsin, and transferrin was delayed, and processing of N-linked glycans by sialyltransferases was inhibited, resulting in the secretion of less extensively modified glycoproteins.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	415	 This study implicates intracellular compartment acidification in the sialylation and N-linked glycan modification of secreted glycoproteins and with the rate of protein secretion.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	416	 In a related study, Jilling and Kirk (50) demonstrated that cAMP increased the secretion of several proteins, including 1-antitrypsin, into the apical but not the basolateral compartment of T84 cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	417	 This effect was Cl dependent and resulted also in an increase in protein sialylation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	418	 An involvement of CFTR in regulated exocytosis could underlie the differences in protein secretion observed in studies of cells and/or tissues derived from normal and CF patients or CF knockout mice.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	419	 Once we understand the reasons for the ability of CFTR to alter membrane traffic, it may become apparent that the underlying mechanisms involved in the progression of CFTR between different compartments have certain features in common.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	420	 A critical question in this regard concerns the exit of CFTR protein from the ER.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	421	 Reasons for thinking along these lines include the common features controlling vesicle transit along compartments of the secretory pathway, e.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	422	, a combination of SNARE and coat protein associations, which often involve interactions with the cargo being conveyed (3).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	423	Our recent findings regarding Csp interactions with CFTR (115) also may provide an example of how common trafficking events may occur in the early and later components of the protein secretory pathway.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	424	 Csp regulates exocytosis in neurosecretory cells, and implications for a similar role in CFTR exocytosis were discussed above.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	425	 In addition, Csp plays a role in CFTR maturation in the ER.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	426	 Csp antibodies co-precipitate a large proportion of band B CFTR and localize Csp protein to the ER, in addition to its presence at the apical domain.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	427	 The major influence of Csp overexpression was a disruption of the biogenesis of mature CFTR (band C).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	428	 Because Csp is an Hsc70 binding protein, which also binds to CFTR, it is likely that Csp serves as a CFTR co-chaperone.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	429	 Csp overexpression may decrease CFTR biogenesis by prolonging its association with Hsc70, which can lead to CFTR degradation (88).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	430	 Much work needs to be done to determine the role of Csp in CFTR maturation, but it is interesting to speculate that the steps involved in the egress of nascent CFTR from the ER and from a regulated compartment of the distal secretory pathway to the plasma membrane may involve similar protein interactions.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	431	 Therefore, identifying the mechanisms underlying stage-specific CFTR trafficking events may also shed light on traffic occurring at other compartments of the cell.
