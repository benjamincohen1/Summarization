Export of wild-type CFTR from the ER requires the coat complex II (COPII) machinery, as it is sensitive to Sar1 mutants that disrupt normal coat assembly and disassembly. In contrast, COPII is not used to deliver CFTR to ER-associated degradation. We find that exit of wild-type CFTR from the ER is blocked by mutation of a consensus di-acidic ER exit motif present in the first nucleotide binding domain. Mutation of the code disrupts interaction with the COPII coat selection complex Sec23/Sec24. We propose that the di-acidic exit code plays a key role in linking CFTR to the COPII coat machinery and is the primary defect responsible for CF in F508-expressing patients..

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	7	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References   The cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel found in the apical membrane of polarized epithelia lining many tissues including the intestine, pancreas, and lung (for reviews see Kopito, 1999; Riordan, 1999; Bertrand and Frizzell, 2003). Although more than 1,000 mutations have been identified in the CFTR gene, F508 accounts for nearly 70% of CF alleles. In homozygous individuals, the F508-CFTR mutation leads to severe forms of CF. CFTR contains 12 transmembrane domains and three cytosolic oriented domains (nucleotide binding domain 1 [NBD1], R, and NBD2) involved in channel gating. Current evidence suggests that deletion of Phe508 in NBD1 prevents proper folding and trafficking of CFTR from the ER to the plasma membrane (Kopito, 1999; Riordan, 1999; Bertrand and Frizzell, 2003). F508-CFTR is a temperature-sensitive mutant, as transfer to the permissive temperature (27 to 30 degrees C) results in partial export from the ER (Denning et al., 1992; French et al., 1996). Misfolded F508-CFTR that fails to exit the ER is eliminated by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Xiong et al., 1999; Gelman et al., 2002; Lenk et al., 2002)..

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	9	Export from the ER now appears to involve specific exit codes that couple cargo to a common cytosolic budding machinery (Barlowe, 2003). A conserved di-acidic exit code found in the cytosolic tail of many type I transmembrane proteins was first identified in mammalian cells (Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Nishimura et al., 1999; Sevier et al., 2000) and subsequently in yeast (Votsmeier and Gallwitz, 2001; Malkus et al., 2002). The di-acidic code directs selective (Balch et al., 1994) and efficient (Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Nishimura et al., 1999) ER export by promoting interaction of cargo with the coat complex II (COPII) budding machinery. COPII (for review see Antonny and Schekman, 2001) consists of the Sar1 GTPase, the cargo selection protein complex Sec23/24 that is a Sar1-specific guanine nucleotide activating protein (GAP; Aridor et al., 1998; Miller et al., 2002), and a coat polymer assembly factor, Sec13/31 (Pryer et al., 1993; Antonny et al., 2001, 2003). The Sar1 GTPase is recruited and activated by the ER-localized transmembrane protein Sec12, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor specific for Sar1 (Barlowe and Schekman, 1993; Weissman et al., 2001). Sar1 activation is essential for recruitment of the Sec23/24 complex to the ER membrane to select cargo and to initiate COPII coat assembly..

Sar1[T39N] (referred to as Sar1-GDP) is restricted to the GDP-bound state and biochemically functions as a competitive inhibitor of wild-type Sar1 recruitment, thereby preventing Sec23/24 attachment to the ER membrane and coat assembly (Kuge et al., 1994; Weissman et al., 2001). Sar1[H79G] (referred to as Sar1-GTP) has a reduced rate of GAP-stimulated hydrolysis, remaining in the GTP-bound state after activation. Although efficiently recruited to the ER membrane where it promotes cargo recruitment and the assembly of coat polymers, its inability to undergo hydrolysis interferes with subsequent COPII coat disassembly, resulting in inhibition of ER to Golgi transport (Kuge et al., 1994; Aridor et al., 1998, 2001; Huang et al., 2001). In addition, we have demonstrated that the protein kinase inhibitor H89 blocks recruitment of COPII coat components and prevents vesicle formation from the ER (Aridor and Balch, 2000). These probes provide powerful approaches to dissect the role of COPII function in transport of cargo through the secretory pathway..

We have previously shown that CFTR exits the ER in a COPII-dependent fashion (Yoo et al., 2002). A recent paper (Fu and Sztul, 2003) proposed that COPII also regulates the delivery of wild-type CFTR to the ERAD pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Xiong et al., 1999; Gelman et al., 2002; Lenk et al., 2002). We have now examined in detail the contribution of COPII to the export of CFTR to the Golgi and its potential contribution to the ERAD pathway in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that although COPII is essential for export of wild-type CFTR from the ER, we found no evidence that COPII contributes to the targeting of either wild-type CFTR or the F508-CFTR mutant to ERAD pathway. Intriguingly, we report that export of CFTR is highly sensitive to mutation of a highly conserved, consensus di-acidic exit code (Nishimura and Balch, 1997) found in the NBD1 domain of CFTR. We find that coupling to the Sec23/24 cargo selection complex through the di-acidic code is critical for diverting CFTR from the ERAD pathway. We propose that the di-acidic exit code plays a key role in linking CFTR to the COPII coat machinery and is the primary defect leading to disease in F508-expressing patients..

In most tissue culture cell lines engineered to express CFTR, wild-type CFTR is inefficiently exported, resulting in processing of only 20 to 30% of the ER-associated band B to the Golgi-and post-Golgi mature band C form (Fig. 1 A, inset and bottom left panel; Riordan, 1999). CFTR failing to exit the ER is degraded by ERAD indicated by the loss of band B (Fig. 1 A, inset and top panel; Xiong et al., 1999; Gelman et al., 2002; Lenk et al., 2002)..

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	18	  We have previously reported (Yoo et al., 2002) that Golgi processing of band B to band C is inhibited by cotransfection with the Sar1-GTP mutant when overexpressed 5 to 10-fold, demonstrating that CFTR exits the ER by a COPII-dependent pathway (Fig. 1 A, inset and bottom panels). Inhibition is clearly evident in the ratio of band C to band B (C/B ratio). When compared with the mock control C/B value of 1.8 at the 3-h time point, the C/B ratio in the presence of Sar1-GTP was  < 0.2 (Fig. 1 A, bottom right panel). To pursue the possibility that COPII is required for ER export but not ERAD, we examined the effect of the Sar1-GDP mutant that is restricted to the GDP-bound form on CFTR glycosylation or proteolysis. As Sar1-GDP is a competitive inhibitor of recruitment of wild-type Sar1 to the Sec12 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Weissman et al., 2001) and Sar1 activation is essential for the recruitment of the cargo selection Sec23/24 complex to the ER membrane (Kuge et al., 1994; Weissman et al., 2001), Sar1-GDP competes with wild-type Sar1 to competitively reduce the efficiency of both COPII recruitment and coat assembly. Although cotransfection of wild-type CFTR with Sar1-GDP (5 to 10-fold overexpression; Kuge et al., 1994; Yoo et al., 2002) strongly inhibited export as measured by processing of band B to band C (Fig. 1 A, inset and bottom panels, C/B ratio is  < 0.7), wild-type CFTR continued to be degraded efficiently in the presence of the mutant (Fig. 1 A, inset and top panels). Identical results were observed at both early and late time points of transfection (unpublished data), indicating that the potential accumulation of other cargo in the ER in the presence of Sar1-GDP is unlikely to influence the effect of the Sar1-GDP on CFTR trafficking and degradation. In contrast to Sar1-GDP, Sar1-GTP is a dominant-negative mutant that promotes cargo collection into stable COPII-coated intermediates. As a consequence, targeting and fusion of these intermediates to the Golgi is blocked (Kuge et al., 1994; Aridor et al., 1998, 2001; Huang et al., 2001). Interestingly, cotransfection of wild-type CFTR with Sar1-GTP significantly (P  <  0.05) protected immature (band B) wild-type CFTR from degradation by the ERAD pathway when compared with degradation rate observed in the presence of the Sar1-GDP mutant (Fig. 1 A, inset and top panels). This result raises the possibility that recruitment of CFTR to the assembling COPII polymer at ER exit sites prevents access to ERAD..

Cotransfection of F508-CFTR with the Sar1-GTP to restricted mutant did not promote processing of band B to C (Fig. 1 B, inset and bottom panel), nor did it affect the kinetics of degradation by ERAD (Fig. 1 B, inset and top panel). An identical result was observed with the Sar1-GDP to restricted mutants (Fig. 1 B). These results are consistent with the idea that failure to export from the ER reflects the inability of F508 to link to COPII..

In contrast, at 40 degrees C, a condition that promotes destabilization of the mutant protein, inhibition of export is lost (Fig. 3 A).

Sar1ts had no apparent effect on stabilizing wild-type CFTR from degradation at 32 degrees C (Fig. 3 B, top panel), which is consistent with the interpretation that Sar1ts interferes with COPII coat assembly but does not affect ERAD pathways. Moreover, cotransfection of F508-CFTR with Sar1ts had no effect on either F508-CFTR export or degradation when compared with the controls expressing F508 alone at either 32 or 40 degrees C temperatures (unpublished data). Importantly, we used a two-stage incubation protocol to examine the ability of CFTR to be exported from the ER after accumulation in the presence of the Sar1ts mutant at 32 degrees C. Cells transfected for 14 h at 32 degrees C to prevent CFTR export were labeled for 30 min at 32 degrees C (stage 1). Subsequently, cells were transferred to 40 degrees C (stage 2) to inactivate Sar1ts. In contrast to incubation at 32 degrees C (Fig. 3 B, bottom right panel, C/B ratio is 0.5 at 3 h), upon transfer to 40 degrees C we observed normal processing of wild-type CFTR from band B to C (Fig. 3 B, bottom right panel, C/B ratio is >4 at 3 h). Thus, reversible inhibition of processing of wild-type CFTR to band C imposed by incubation at 32 degrees C in the presence of Sar1ts interferes with the normal physiological pathway required for COPII-dependent export but not degradation..

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	33	CFTR uses a di-acidic exit code for export from the ER To understand the requirement for COPII in the export of CFTR from the ER, we examined the CFTR sequence for the presence of the evolutionarily conserved tyrosine-based di-acidic code required for export of VSV-G (Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Nishimura et al., 1999; Sevier et al., 2000) and other transmembrane proteins from the ER in mammalian cells (Bannykh and Balch, 1998; Bannykh et al., 1998) and yeast (Votsmeier and Gallwitz, 2001; Malkus et al., 2002). Notably, CFTR contained a YKDAD motif (residues 563 to 567) in the first nucleotide binding motif (NBD1) that is evolutionarily conserved and similar to that found in VSV-G (YxDxE; Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Sevier et al., 2000). The structure of the NBD1 domain of CFTR (1ROZ.pdb) reveals that the YKDAD motif is located in a surface-exposed loop linking the NH2-terminal helical domain containing Phe508 to the COOH-terminal sheet domain (Lewis et al., 2004; Fig. 4 A). Strikingly, transient expression of CFTR mutants in which either one (DAA-CFTR; Fig. 4 B, inset and bottom panel) or both (AAA-CFTR; unpublished data) conserved Asp residues were mutated to Ala resulted in complete inhibition of export from the ER as measured by the inability of band B to be processed to band C and a morphological distribution consistent with localization to the ER (Bannykh et al., 2000; unpublished data). Like F508-CFTR, cotransfection with Sar1-GTP failed to promote export or stabilize DAA-CFTR from ERAD, suggesting that mutation of the di-acidic motif uncoupled CFTR from COPII (Fig. 4 B). We also examined whether or not, like F508-CFTR, the DAA-CFTR phenotype is temperature-sensitive by examining its rate of export at the lowered temperature (30 degrees C). Whereas transfer of F508-CFTR to 30 degrees C resulted in significant enhancement of transport to the cell surface reflecting its effect on conformational stability of NBD1 as observed previously (Denning et al., 1992; French et al., 1996), we did not observe a similar increase in DAA-CFTR export at 30 degrees C (unpublished data). These results suggest that the DAA mutation does not affect the fold of NBD1 in a similar fashion to the F508 mutation that can be stabilized by incubation at reduced temperature..

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	36	  To further characterize the biochemical properties of the DAA-CFTR mutant, we took advantage of the previous observation that treatment of CFTR-expressing cells with brefeldin A (BFA) reduces degradation of wild-type CFTR, but not F508-CFTR (Ostedgaard et al., 1999). BFA triggers the collapse of the Golgi to the ER by preventing the recruitment of coat complex I to Golgi membranes (for review see Chardin and McCormick, 1999). In contrast to its potent effect on coat complex I function in the Golgi, BFA has no effect on COPII function during ER export. As a consequence, in BFA-treated cells ER-associated cargo is collected in export intermediates that accumulate in the absence of functional Golgi compartments (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989). As expected, addition of BFA prevented processing of wild-type CFTR from band B to C and partially stabilized wild-type CFTR from ERAD, likely reflecting recruitment to COPII intermediates (Fig. 4 C; Lukacs et al., 1994; Ward and Kopito, 1994). In contrast, BFA did not prevent degradation of either the F508- or the DAA-CFTR mutant (Fig. 4 C). These results are consistent with the interpretation that both mutants fail to couple to the COPII machinery (Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Nishimura et al., 1999), resulting in their delivery to the ERAD pathway..

For this purpose, we first examined the ability of CFTR to bind the Sec23/Sec24 cargo selection complex in immunoprecipitates recovered from detergent lysates of HEK293 cell lines stably expressing either wild-type CFTR or F508-CFTR. As shown in Fig. 5 A, in cells expressing wild-type CFTR, the protein is largely in the band C mature form with  < 5% in the band B ER form, an expected result given that wild-type CFTR accumulates in post-Golgi compartments. In contrast, in F508-CFTR to expressing HEK293 cells, the only form is band B reflecting its ER localization, its level of expression reflecting continuous degradation by ERAD (Fig. 5 A). Despite the large difference in the steady-state level of CFTR in wild-type and F508-expressing cells, when we quantitated the recovery of Sec24 with respect to the total amount of wild-type CFTR or F508-CFTR in band B using immunoblotting, we observed that F508-CFTR bound  < 25% of that observed for wild-type CFTR (Fig. 5 A). Sec24 was not recovered from HEK293 cells that do not express CFTR (unpublished data). Because immunoprecipitations were performed on ice, it is likely that the temperature-sensitive phenotype of F508-CFTR resulted in partial folding after transfer to ice, accounting for the observed level of recovery of Sec24. Although the band B ER form would be expected to be the only form of CFTR that would bind the ER-specific COPII coat machinery, we examined whether or not immunoprecipitation of Sec24 would recover band C, the cell surface form. Despite the large excess of band C in the cell (Fig. 5 A), immunoprecipitation of Sec24 followed by immunoblotting for CFTR only recovered the band B forms of either wild type or F508 (Fig. 5 B)..

As shown in Fig. 5 D, with increasing incubation time at 30 degrees C, F508 showed a strong increase in its interaction with Sec24, approaching the value observed for wild-type CFTR at 37 degrees C at steady-state. These results suggest that reduced temperature promotes maturation of CFTR and presentation of the exit code for interaction with the COPII coat machinery for export from the ER..

This would be the expected result if wild-type CFTR, but not F508-CFTR, acquires the normal protein fold necessary for cargo selection by COPII. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, the Sar1-GTP mutant that stabilizes coat assembly markedly reduces the rate of ERAD through capture into COPII transport intermediates that accumulate in the presence of activated Sar1 (Aridor et al., 1995, 1998, 2001). Second, the Sar1-GDP mutant (that prevents COPII coat recruitment) inhibited export of wild-type CFTR, but did not stabilize the ER band B form. It is unlikely that the effects of the GDP mutant on CFTR export were influenced by build-up of other cargo in the ER during the transient expression protocol as we observed inhibition of transport at the earliest time points of transfection when the inhibitory properties of the Sar1-GDP mutant begin to take effect. This conclusion is supported by the ability of H89 to rapidly and efficiently uncouple CFTR from export in cells stably expressing wild-type CFTR. Furthermore, in the two-stage assay using the Sar1ts mutant, we found that accumulation of CFTR in the ER at 32 degrees C had no effect on export after inactivation of Sar1ts at 40 degrees C. Because we did not detect significant effects of Sar1-GDP (which uncouples CFTR from COPII) on degradation of CFTR, we suggest that the export and ERAD pathways operate independently..

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	46	COPII does not participate in ERAD A recent paper (Fu and Sztul, 2003) suggested that targeting of CFTR to the ERAD pathway in S. cerevisiae requires COPII because in the absence of COPII function CFTR accumulates in an ER-like subcompartment rather than being degraded (Kiser et al., 2001; Fu and Sztul, 2003; Sullivan et al., 2003). In contrast, we found that COPII does not participate in ERAD of either wild-type CFTR or F508-CFTR in mammalian cells. The reasons for this discrepancy are now apparent. First, CFTR will not exit the ER in yeast under any condition, limiting interpretation of the results (Kiser et al., 2001; Fu and Sztul, 2003; Sullivan et al., 2003). Second, all experiments used overexpression of a GFP-tagged variant of CFTR (GFP-CFTR). A similar GFP-CFTR construct, when expressed in mammalian cells, has a markedly reduced rate of export and accumulates in ER tubular elements at 30 degrees C (comparable to experiments in yeast where cells are incubated at 24 degrees C) that significantly overlaps with calnexin (Fig. S1, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401035/DC1). This overlap is consistent with the fact that folding of nascent CFTR in the ER is likely to involve calnexin (Pind et al., 1994). However, upon transfer to 37 degrees C, GFP-CFTR is efficiently exported to the cell surface of mammalian cells (Fig. S1). Thus, in mammalian cells, GFP-CFTR can accumulate transiently in a bona fide ER-like tubular network at reduced temperature that is unlikely to be a specialized COPII-regulated degradative subcompartment as suggested for yeast where export is blocked at all temperatures (Fu and Sztul, 2003; Sullivan et al., 2003)..
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	47	COPII does not participate in ERAD A recent paper (Fu and Sztul, 2003) suggested that targeting of CFTR to the ERAD pathway in S. cerevisiae requires COPII because in the absence of COPII function CFTR accumulates in an ER-like subcompartment rather than being degraded (Kiser et al., 2001; Fu and Sztul, 2003; Sullivan et al., 2003). In contrast, we found that COPII does not participate in ERAD of either wild-type CFTR or F508-CFTR in mammalian cells. The reasons for this discrepancy are now apparent. First, CFTR will not exit the ER in yeast under any condition, limiting interpretation of the results (Kiser et al., 2001; Fu and Sztul, 2003; Sullivan et al., 2003). Second, all experiments used overexpression of a GFP-tagged variant of CFTR (GFP-CFTR). A similar GFP-CFTR construct, when expressed in mammalian cells, has a markedly reduced rate of export and accumulates in ER tubular elements at 30 degrees C (comparable to experiments in yeast where cells are incubated at 24 degrees C) that significantly overlaps with calnexin (Fig. S1, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401035/DC1).

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	48	A third concern is that all experiments relied on temperature-sensitive COPII mutants to prevent degradation, leading to the interpretation that COPII is required for ERAD. These experiments required prolonged incubation of yeast at the restrictive temperature (40 degrees C) to assess the effect of the mutant COPII component on ERAD. It is well-established that elevated temperature (40 degrees ) in mammalian cells markedly stabilizes (approximately twofold) both wild-type CFTR and F508-CFTR from ERAD in response to induction of heat shock folding chaperones (Strickland et al., 1997; Loo et al., 1998; Meacham et al., 1999; Choo-Kang and Zeitlin, 2001; Farinha et al., 2002; unpublished data). Thus, the twofold effect of the temperature-sensitive Sec12 variant on preventing CFTR degradation in yeast can be largely explained by the twofold difference in stability observed upon shift from the permissive to the restrictive temperature in control incubations in the absence of the Sec12ts (Fu and Sztul, 2003)..

For example, both Sec13 and Sec23 temperature-sensitive variants may not be inactivated by shifting to the restrictive temperature as suggested (Fu and Sztul, 2003). Rather they may promote stable coat assembly leading to partial segregation of CFTR from ERAD as we have observed during COPII coat polymer assembly promoted by the Sar1-GTP mutant. We conclude that role of COPII is to direct CFTR selection into COPII vesicles, removing the protein from the ERAD COPII-independent targeted pool..

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	52	A di-acidic code mediates CFTR export An important finding that provides new insight into the role of COPII in export of CFTR from the ER was that processing of band B to C was sensitive to mutation of the conserved di-acidic code exit motif originally detected in the cytoplasmic tail of VSV-G (Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Nishimura et al., 1999). Consistent with this finding, a natural variant in the cystic fibrosis mutation database (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/) has a substitution of G for D at position 565 (565DAD to 565GAD) that results in a severe deficiency phenotype, although this allele is complex (Tzetis et al., 2001). The requirement for a di-acidic code in CFTR export is consistent with a similar requirement for a di-acidic motif for export of the multi-membrane-spanning K+ channel (Ma et al., 2001; Ma and Jan, 2002) and yeast GAP permease (Malkus et al., 2002) from the ER. Given that transfer of the di-acidic code to an ER-retained protein is sufficient to promote efficient export (Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Nishimura et al., 1999) and the fact that the di-acidic code recognizes the Sec24 subunit of the Sec23/24 complex (Miller et al., 2002), it is now evident that the di-acidic motif may be used by CFTR to engage the Sec24. Our CFTR coimmunoprecipitation results provide direct evidence that the DAD motif in NBD1 of CFTR serves as a functional ER exit code as loss of the code results in impaired binding to Sec23/24. In the case of the GAP permease, it has been suggested that the di-acidic code, although necessary for export, is not sufficient ((Miller et al., 2002). A similar constraint may apply to CFTR as the protein has a complicated cytosolic folding pathway involving numerous chaperones and cochaperones (Pind et al., 1994; Loo et al., 1998; Brodsky, 2001; Zhang et al., 2002) that may facilitate recognition of the Sec23/Sec24 complex (unpublished data)..

Structural alignment of the NBD1 domain of CFTR (Lewis et al., 2004) with the NBD1 domain of the ABC transporter BtuCD reveals that the di-acidic code is found in a solvent-exposed loop connecting the NH2-terminal helical domain containing Phe508 with the more COOH-terminal sheet domain (Fig. 4 A and Fig. 6). Given that the structure of Sar1 and the Sec23/24 complex containing a bound di-acidic peptide are available (Huang et al., 2001; Bi et al., 2002; Mossessova et al., 2003), we built a homology model with the NBD1 of CFTR replacing the similar structural fold of NBD1 of BtuCD (Fig. 6). This new structure (BtuCD-NBD1CFTR) was then combined with the structure of the Sec23/24 -Sar1 complex to illustrate the ability of the di-acidic code loop in NBD1CFTR to insert directly into the Sec23/24 di-acidic code binding pocket (Fig. 6, yellow residues; and Fig. S2 for a three-dimensional view, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401035/DC1). Docking reveals little steric interference between residues within the binding pocket, or between residues defining the tertiary structure of BtuCD-NBD1CFTR and the Sar1/Sec24/23 complex. Moreover, the orientation of the NH2 terminus of Sar1 (Fig. 6, red ss-strand; residues 25 to 34), which is linked to the flexible NH2-terminal tail involved in anchoring Sar1 to the membrane (Fig. 6, black dashed line; not observed in the crystal structure; Huang et al., 2001; Bi et al., 2002), is oriented correctly to facilitate recruitment of Sec23/24 by activated Sar1. It is apparent that Sar1 and BtuCD-NBD1CFTR interact with Sec23/Sec24 independently as shown for the holo cargo-selection complex. Thus, the general structural features of the CFTR-NBD1 domain presented within the structure of BtuCD are consistent with the role of the di-acidic code in directing interaction with COPII for exit from the ER..

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	57	  Given the likely importance of the aromatic side-chain of Phe508 in stabilizing the conserved structural fold of the NH2-terminal helical domain of NBD1 (Fig. 6, blue residue), deletion of Phe508 in the F508-CFTR mutant may alter the orientation of the di-acidic motif-containing loop, thereby compromising its interaction with Sec24. This notion was directly tested by the CFTR coimmunoprecipitation experiments where we found that binding of band B of F508 to Sec24 was much lower than that of wild-type CFTR. Consistent with this interpretation, F508-CFTR-Sec24 interaction and transport to cell surface can be rescued by promoting folding at 30 degrees C. Moreover, export of F508-CFTR from the ER can also be rescued in cis by additional point mutations in NBD1 that stabilize the structural fold (DeCarvalho et al., 2002). Given that over 1,000 mutants have been reported to affect CFTR export and function leading to varying degrees of disease, it is not surprising that residues flanking the di-acidic code have also been reported in the mutation database. Structural considerations strongly suggest that many of these flanking mutations, unlike the di-acidic code that is found in the solvent-exposed loop, are likely to affect the fold of the -helical and ss-strands that contribute to the structural organization of NBD1 and indirectly compromise presentation of the code (unpublished data).

The property of the erythrocyte that is responsible for the stimulation of NO synthesis was reported to be the ability to release ATP in response to physiological stimuli, including deformation. Moreover, a signal transduction pathway that relates mechanical deformation of erythrocytes to ATP release has been described, and the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a component, i.e., erythrocytes of individuals with CF do not release ATP in response to deformation. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that, in contrast to those of healthy humans, erythrocytes of humans with CF fail to stimulate endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated rabbit lung. We report that CFTR is a component of the membranes of both rabbit and human erythrocytes. The addition of the NO synthase inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100  microM) produced increases in vascular resistance in isolated rabbit lungs perfused with physiological salt solution (PSS) containing erythrocytes of healthy humans, but L-NAME was without effect when the lungs were perfused with PSS alone or PSS containing erythrocytes of CF patients. These results provide support for the hypothesis that, in CF, a defect in ATP release from erythrocytes could lead to decreased endogenous pulmonary NO synthesis and contribute to pulmonary hypertension..

We report that CFTR is a component of the membranes of both rabbit and human erythrocytes. The addition of the NO synthase inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100  microM) produced increases in vascular resistance in isolated rabbit lungs perfused with physiological salt solution (PSS) containing erythrocytes of healthy humans, but L-NAME was without effect when the lungs were perfused with PSS alone or PSS containing erythrocytes of CF patients. These results provide support for the hypothesis that, in CF, a defect in ATP release from erythrocytes could lead to decreased endogenous pulmonary NO synthesis and contribute to pulmonary hypertension..

Physiologically, an alteration in shear applied to the endothelium of blood vessels has been suggested to be a major stimulus for NO release (3, 22). However, in the pulmonary circulation, a reappraisal of this viewpoint was required when it was reported that, in isolated rabbit (31) and rat (36, 38) lungs perfused with a physiological salt solution (PSS), alterations in shear stress alone did not evoke release of NO. In contrast, when lungs of these species were perfused with either blood (36) or PSS containing washed erythrocytes (30, 38), inhibition of endogenous NO synthesis produced a shift in the slope of the pressure-flow relationship consistent with a decrease in vascular caliber, i.e., NO was a determinant of vascular resistance. The ability of the erythrocyte to stimulate NO synthesis in the pulmonary circulation of the rabbit and rat was reported to be independent of effects on viscosity or pressure (31, 36). The property of the erythrocyte that was associated with the stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis was shown to be the release of ATP (26, 28, 30). In support of the hypothesis that erythrocyte-derived ATP is a stimulus for endogenous NO synthesis in the lung, the addition of ATP to the perfusate of isolated rabbit lungs produces vasodilation that is, in large part, dependent on the stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis (30). Importantly, in addition to rabbit erythrocytes, human erythrocytes were reported both to release ATP in response to physiological stimuli, such as mechanical deformation, and to stimulate endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated perfused rabbit lung (26)..

This pathway includes the heterotrimeric G proteins Gs (17) and Gi (18), adenylyl cyclase (29), PKA (29), and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (27). The activity of CFTR was shown to be required for deformation-induced ATP release from erythrocytes of both rabbits and humans (27). Thus erythrocytes of humans with cystic fibrosis, a condition in which CFTR activity is absent or markedly reduced, and rabbit erythrocytes incubated with inhibitors of CFTR activity failed to release ATP in response to mechanical deformation (27). Here, we demonstrate that CFTR is expressed in the membrane of both rabbit and human erythrocytes and that, in contrast to those of healthy humans, erythrocytes from humans with cystic fibrosis fail to stimulate endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated rabbit pulmonary circulation..

The heart and lungs were removed en block during continuous ventilation. A catheter was placed in the main pulmonary artery through the right ventricle, and a second catheter was placed in the left atrium. The heart and lungs were suspended in a humidified chamber maintained at 37 degrees C and ventilated with gas containing 15% O2-6% CO2-balance N2. Residual blood present in the lungs was removed by perfusion with 200 ml PSS [118.3 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 25.0 mM NaHCO3, 0.026 mM Na-EDTA, 11.1 mM glucose, and 5% hetastarch (Baxter Healthcare; Deerfield, IL)] without recirculation. The lungs were then perfused with PSS at 80 ml/min with a recirculating volume of 100 ml. Pulmonary arterial pressure (PPA), left atrial pressure (PLA), and airway pressure (PAW) were recorded continuously. PLA was set to a pressure of 2 to 3 mmHg with a screw clamp, and lungs were perfused under zone III conditions (PPA  >  PLA  >  PAW). Pulmonary microvascular pressure (PMV) was determined by the double occlusion method (15). The arterial and venous cannulae were simultaneously occluded with electronically controlled solenoid pinch valves that cause minimal fluid displacement. Occlusions were maintained for 3 to 5 s, and the resulting equilibration pressures in the pulmonary arterial and venous catheters were recorded as an estimate of PMV. Samples of perfusate were analyzed for pH, PO2, and PCO2 under control and experimental conditions (pHOx blood gas analyzer, Nova Biomedical; Waltham, MA). After a minimum of 15 min of perfusion at 80 ml/min, the pressure-flow relationship was determined by measuring vascular pressures (PPA and PMV) at flow rates of 50, 100, 200, and 300 ml/min. Within 20 s of a change in flow rate, PLA was adjusted to 2 to 3 mmHg and PMV was determined. Finally, the flow rate was returned to 80 ml/min (recovery). N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; Calbiochem) was then added to the perfusate to achieve a final concentration of either 30, 100, or 300  microM. After 30 min, a second pressure-flow relationship was determined. In separate studies, the isolated lungs were perfused with either PSS alone or PSS to which washed erythrocytes obtained from healthy humans or humans with cystic fibrosis were added.

These observations, coupled with the findings that physiological stimuli, such as mechanical deformation (18, 26, 27, 29), stimulate ATP release from erythrocytes and that ATP is a stimulus for endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated rabbit lung (30), suggest a novel mechanism for the control of pulmonary vascular caliber. In this construct, as the erythrocyte is deformed by increments in the velocity of blood flow through a vessel and/or by reductions in vascular caliber, it releases ATP, which stimulates endothelial synthesis of NO resulting in relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and, thereby, an increase in vascular caliber. This vasodilation would then result in a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance as well as a decrease in the stimulus for additional erythrocyte deformation and ATP release. On the basis of this scheme, erythrocyte-derived ATP would contribute to the low vascular pressure in the healthy lung via stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis..

In this construct, as the erythrocyte is deformed by increments in the velocity of blood flow through a vessel and/or by reductions in vascular caliber, it releases ATP, which stimulates endothelial synthesis of NO resulting in relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and, thereby, an increase in vascular caliber. This vasodilation would then result in a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance as well as a decrease in the stimulus for additional erythrocyte deformation and ATP release. On the basis of this scheme, erythrocyte-derived ATP would contribute to the low vascular pressure in the healthy lung via stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis..
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	39	Recently, a signal transduction pathway that relates mechanical deformation to ATP release from erythrocytes of rabbits and humans has been described. Components of this pathway include the heterotrimeric G proteins Gs (17) and Gi (18), adenylyl cyclase (29), PKA (29) and CFTR (27). A role for CFTR in this pathway was suggested by reports that this member of the ATP binding cassette could facilitate the movement of ATP out of cells either by acting as an ATP conduit (21, 22) or by regulating another channel for ATP release (20, 23). The finding that CFTR activity is lost or markedly diminished in humans with cystic fibrosis (5, 6) provided a unique opportunity for investigation of the role of CFTR in the release of ATP from erythrocytes in response to the physiological stimulus of mechanical deformation. It was reported previously that erythrocytes of patients with cystic fibrosis as well as rabbit erythrocytes incubated with two chemically dissimilar inhibitors of CFTR, namely, glibenclamide (24, 25) and niflumic acid (7), failed to release ATP in response to mechanical deformation (27)..

0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	41	A necessary step in establishing that CFTR is a component of a signal transduction pathway for ATP release from erythrocytes is the demonstration of its presence in erythrocyte membranes. Recently, it was shown that CFTR protein is present in erythrocyte membranes of both healthy humans and humans with cystic fibrosis (1, 32). In addition, it was reported that human erythroblasts contain CFTR mRNA (37). However, it must be noted that neither CFTR protein in human erythrocytes nor mRNA in human erythroid progenitor cells were detected in another study (13). In the present work, we confirm the finding that CFTR protein is a component of human erythrocyte membranes (Fig. 1). In addition, we show that the membranes of rabbit erythrocytes also possess CFTR (Fig. 1). Thus CFTR, a necessary component of a proposed signal transduction pathway for ATP release from erythrocytes, is present in the membranes of both rabbit and human erythrocytes, cells that release ATP in response to mechanical deformation (26, 27, 29)..

It was reported that the concentration of ATP was increased in the blood of CFTR knockout mice as well as humans with cystic fibrosis compared with either wild-type controls or healthy humans, respectively (1). It is important to note that, in these studies, ATP release was studied under quiescent conditions, i.e., erythrocytes were not subjected to mechanical deformation. Thus it is possible that, although CFTR is required for deformation-induced ATP release from erythrocytes, another member of the ATP binding cassette, such as the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1, is involved in basal ATP release from these cells (1)..

0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	45	The hypothesis that ATP, released from erythrocytes of healthy humans in response to deformation, stimulates endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated rabbit lung is supported by previous studies. Erythrocytes of healthy humans release ATP in response to mechanical deformation as would be encountered as they pass through the pulmonary circulation. The amount of ATP released in response to deformation was shown to be stimulus dependent (26, 27, 29). In addition, the inclusion of human erythrocytes in the perfusate of isolated rabbit lungs resulted in the stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis (26). Finally, the addition of ATP to the perfusate of isolated rabbit lungs resulted in concentration-dependent decreases in total pulmonary vascular resistance that were inhibited by pretreatment with the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME (30)..

0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	47	In view of the findings that CFTR is expressed in human erythrocyte membranes, that it is a component of a signal transduction pathway that relates erythrocyte deformation to ATP release (27), and that ATP release from erythrocytes is a stimulus for endogenous NO synthesis in the rabbit pulmonary circulation (30), we hypothesized that erythrocytes of humans with cystic fibrosis, a condition in which the activity of CFTR is defective, would fail to stimulate NO synthesis in the isolated perfused rabbit lung. In the presence of washed erythrocytes from healthy humans, the administration of the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME to the perfusate of isolated lungs resulted in a shift in the pressure-flow relationship in a manner consistent with an increase in Ohmic resistance (Fig. 3) (15). This increase in vascular resistance was confined to the upstream vascular segment (PPA  to  PMV as a function of flow rate; Fig. 4A). In contrast, in the presence of erythrocytes of patients with cystic fibrosis, L-NAME was without effect on the pressure-flow relationship, i.e., NO was not a determinant of pulmonary vascular resistance (Fig. 5)..

0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	49	Several studies suggest that endogenous NO synthesis in the lung may be decreased in humans with cystic fibrosis. It was reported that amounts of NO detected in exhaled gas are decreased in humans with cystic fibrosis compared with healthy humans (2, 15, 35). It must be recognized that the source of NO that is measured in exhaled gas is unknown and could derive from the endothelium of blood vessels, the airways, or other resident cells. However, it was reported that exhaled NO is reduced in neonates with cystic fibrosis before the development of detectable respiratory symptoms, suggesting that the decrease in exhaled NO is not the result of increased mucus accumulation and/or inflammation (9). Thus the decrease in measurable NO in exhaled gas in cystic fibrosis patients compared with healthy controls could reflect, in part, the failure of erythrocyte-derived ATP to stimulate endogenous NO synthesis..

This response was shown to be endothelium dependent, although the nature of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor was not determined. Thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that if erythrocyte-derived ATP were released into the pulmonary circulation of humans with cystic fibrosis, endogenous NO synthesis could be stimulated..

Pulmonary hypertension is seen in humans with cystic fibrosis; however, this condition has most often been attributed to the destructive lung disease and the subsequent loss of pulmonary capillaries and/or hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (11, 34). The results presented here suggest that a defect in ATP release from erythrocytes of cystic fibrosis patients as they traverse the pulmonary circulation could be an additional factor leading to the development of pulmonary hypertension in these individuals..

Erythrocytes from humans in whom this protein is functional stimulate endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated rabbit lung. In contrast, erythrocytes of humans with cystic fibrosis, a condition in which CFTR activity is impaired, do not stimulate NO synthesis in this model. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that erythrocyte-derived ATP, released in response to a physiological stimulus, such as mechanical deformation, could serve to aid in the maintenance of normal pulmonary vascular resistance via the stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis..

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-activated chloride channel expressed at the apical surface of epithelia. Although the regulation of CFTR by protein kinases is well documented, channel deactivation by phosphatases is not well understood. We find that the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A can physically associate with the CFTR COOH terminus. PP2A is a heterotrimeric phosphatase composed of a catalytic subunit and two divergent regulatory subunits (A and B). The cellular localization and substrate specificity of PP2A is determined by the unique combination of A and B regulatory subunits, which can give rise to at least 75 different enzymes. By mass spectrometry, we identified the exact PP2A regulatory subunits associated with CFTR as A and B' and find that the B' subunit binds CFTR directly. PP2A subunits localize to the apical surface of airway epithelia and PP2A phosphatase activity co-purifies with CFTR in Calu-3 cells. In functional assays, inhibitors of PP2A block rundown of basal CFTR currents and increase channel activity in excised patches of airway epithelia and in intact mouse jejunum. Moreover, PP2A inhibition in well differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells results in a CFTR-dependent increase in the airway surface liquid. Our data demonstrate that PP2A is a relevant CFTR phosphatase in epithelial tissues. Our results may help reconcile differences in phosphatase-mediated channel regulation observed for different tissues and cells. Furthermore, PP2A may be a clinically relevant drug target for CF, which should be considered in future studies..

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	6	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Cystic fibrosis (CF)2 is an autosomal lethal disease characterized by abnormal ion transport in epithelial tissues. CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an apical membrane chloride channel. The regulation of CFTR by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and other protein kinases has been extensively documented. PKA can phosphorylate the CFTR regulatory domain (R domain) on at least 11 serine residues (1-3). In vivo, PKA phosphorylation increases CFTR open probability and the number of channels in the plasma membrane (4, 5). Work from our laboratory and others has demonstrated that PKA and other regulatory proteins are compartmentalized in close proximity to CFTR. The cellular machinery capable of generating cAMP, including the adenosine receptor and membrane-bound adenylate cyclase are present with CFTR in apical membrane patches (6). A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) target PKA to protein complexes with CFTR (7-9), and the disruption of the PKA/AKAP interaction abolishes the ability of PKA to activate CFTR in response to physiologic stimuli (9). In addition, the phosphodiesterase PDE4D is also present with CFTR in patch preparations and forms a cAMP diffusion barrier at the apical plasma membrane (10). Other CFTR regulatory molecules including protein kinase C and the AMP-activated protein kinase are found in protein complexes associated directly with CFTR (11, 12)..

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	8	Less is known about the ability of serine/threonine phosphatases to regulate CFTR activity or how they are compartmentalized with CFTR. Work from many laboratories suggests that multiple phosphatases, including PP2A, PP2B, PP2C, and alkaline phosphatase, are involved in the deactivation of CFTR (13-17). In vitro, PP2A and PP2C are most effective in dephosphorylating purified CFTR and recombinant R domain. Furthermore, exogenous PP2A and PP2C inactivate CFTR in excised membrane patches (13, 18). In human sweat ducts, cardiac myocytes, 3T3 fibroblasts, and Hi-5 insect cells, inhibitors of PP2A increase CFTR channel activity (14, 16, 18, 19). Likewise, PP2B inhibitors stimulate CFTR in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (17). However, the contribution of PP2A and PP2B to CFTR deactivation may vary in different cell types (15, 20). In baby hamster kidney cells, PP2C co-immunoprecipitates with exogenously expressed CFTR (20). Additionally, PP2C overexpression in Fischer rat thyroid cells decreases CFTR chloride conductance (15). However, the ability of endogenous PP2C to regulate CFTR in native epithelial tissues is unclear, since no PP2C inhibitors have been identified. To date, no single phosphatase has been demonstrated to be both necessary and sufficient to completely down-regulate CFTR channel activity, suggesting that CFTR is dephosphorylated by multiple phosphatases. Here, we present evidence for a direct interaction between CFTR and the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A. This interaction involves the COOH terminus of CFTR and the PP2A B' regulatory subunit. PP2A localizes to the apical cell surface, where it negatively regulates CFTR channel activity in Calu-3 cells and intact mouse jejunum. Furthermore, inhibition of PP2A increases the airway surface liquid in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells by a mechanism requiring CFTR channel activity. We conclude that PP2A is indeed a relevant CFTR phosphatase in epithelial tissues..

Lysates were prepared by incubating twenty 100-mm dishes of Calu-3 cells in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% CHAPS, and protease (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase (Sigma) inhibitor mixtures) at 4  degrees C for 1 h. Following ultracentrifugation, the soluble fraction was precleared over empty streptavidin beads and incubated with CFTR peptides conjugated to streptavidin beads for 1 h. The bound fractions were washed extensively in binding buffer, eluted with 5% formic acid, and lyophilized. Prior to MS analysis, the protein samples were reduced, alkylated, and digested with proteomics grade trypsin (Sigma). The peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-MS/MS on a Q-Tof micro (Waters, Manchester, UK). All data were acquired using Masslynx 4.0 software and than processed using Proteinlynx module. The processed data were searched against updated NCBInr and Sprot data bases using the Mascot search engine. Mascot probability-based Mowse individual ion scores of  > 46 were accepted as indicating identity or extensive homology (p  <  0.05). The MS/MS spectrum scores between 20 and 45 were examined individually, with the acceptance criteria being that the parent and fragment ion masses were within the calibrated tolerance limits and that the spectrum contained an extended series of consecutive y- or b- ions. Small scale experiments analyzed by Western blot were performed using lysates from two 100-mm dishes of Calu-3 cells and 2 nmol of CFTR peptide..

For all studies, perfluorocarbon was added mucosally to prevent evaporation of the PCL, and the culture was placed on the stage of the confocal microscope over a serosal reservoir (80  microl of TES-buffered Ringer). Okadaic acid was added to the apical surface as a dry powder in perfluorocarbon (5  microg of okadaic acid/25 ml of perfluorocarbon/cm2 of culture). Perfluorocarbon has no effect on PCL height or ion transport, as previously described (27)..

In the present study, we asked whether the highly conserved CFTR COOH terminus can interact with additional proteins that regulate channel function. We chose to focus on the last 25 amino acids of CFTR (encompassing residues 1451-1476), which precede, but do not include, the PDZ binding motif. Previous studies suggest that this region is important for CFTR trafficking and channel activity (32); however, no protein interactions have been reported. We immobilized biotinylated CFTR-(1451-1476) peptides on streptavidin-agarose beads, incubated the peptides in cell lysates prepared from Calu-3 cells, and eluted the bound proteins with formic acid. Using nanoliquid chromatography MS/MS, we identified the serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP2A associated with CFTR-(1451-1476). PP2A dephosphorylates CFTR in vitro and decreases channel activity in multiple cell systems (14, 16, 18, 19). Recently, Vastiau et al. (33) also identified an interaction between the regulatory domain of CFTR and PP2A, suggesting that PP2A anchoring to CFTR may involve multiple contacts..

PP2A functions as a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic subunit and two regulatory subunits, A and B (34). The specificity of PP2A is determined by the unique combination of regulatory subunits associated with the catalytic subunit. The A regulatory subunit is encoded by one of two genes and , which are 86% identical. The A regulatory subunit is tightly associated with the catalytic subunit and functions as a scaffold to recruit the B regulatory subunit. The B regulatory subunit is highly divergent in comparison with the other PP2A subunits. The B regulatory subunit is divided into the B, B', B'', and B''' families, which are encoded by at least 14 different genes, some of which produce as many as five splice variants. The diversity of regulatory subunits gives rise to over 75 distinct PP2A enzymes. By mass spectrometry, we observe peptides from all three PP2A subunits (Fig. 1A). Importantly, the MS/MS spectra provide amino acid sequence information that allowed us to precisely identify the PP2A regulatory subunits associated with CFTR-(1451-1476) as A and B' (Fig. 1B)..

Furthermore, these PP2A subunits also co-precipitate with endogenous CFTR from Calu-3 cell membranes (Fig. 2B), consistent with an interaction in vivo. The PP2A B subunit, which is structurally unrelated to the B' family, does not co-purify with CFTR-(1451-1476) or co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous CFTR. In addition, we asked whether PP2A phosphatase activity purified with full-length CFTR. CFTR immunoprecipitates were assayed for PP2A using a colorimetric phosphatase assay. We find that a PP2A-like activity specifically co-precipitates with CFTR, but not an IgG control (Fig. 2C). Characteristic of PP2A, the phosphatase activity was inhibited by 1  microM okadaic acid or 1  microM endothall, potent inhibitors of PP2A (IC50 = 0.1 and 90 nM, respectively). Although okadaic acid and endothall can also inhibit PP1 (IC50 = 10 nM and 5  microM, respectively), previous studies have found no evidence to support the ability of PP1 to physically associate with CFTR, to dephosphorylate CFTR in vitro, or regulate channel activity (13, 18, 20). Although PP2C has been shown to be associated with CFTR in baby hamster kidney cells, the assay buffer does not contain Mg2+, which is required for PP2C activity. Taken together, these data suggest that the phosphatase activity associated with CFTR is PP2A..

However, the degree to which PP2A contributes to this regulation varies in different functional assays and cell systems. Given the diversity of PP2A enzymes, we were intrigued by the possibility that the B regulatory subunit may, in part, account for these differences. Therefore, we asked whether the PP2A B' subunit could interact directly with CFTR. We find that PP2A B' subunit expressed and purified from reticulocyte lysates binds to CFTR-(1451-1476) but not other CFTR C-terminal peptides (Fig. 3A). NHERF-1, previously shown to interact with the extreme COOH terminus of CFTR, is enriched by the CFTR-(1471-1480) peptide, demonstrating the specificity of this assay (Fig. 3A). Although we do not find the catalytic or A subunit associated with the purified B' subunit from reticulocyte lysates (data not shown), we cannot rule out the possibility that these subunits are present at low levels and may be influencing binding to CFTR-(1451-1476). Using bacterially expressed, purified B' subunit, we observe direct and dose-dependent binding to CFTR-(1451-1476) (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we also find that the core PP2A dimer, composed of the catalytic and A regulatory subunit, do not bind to CFTR-(1451-1476) unless the B' subunit is present (Fig. 3C). Whereas it is not clear whether the B' subunit alone is necessary and sufficient for targeting PP2A to CFTR, these data suggest that the B' subunit may play a critical role in the binding specificity..

Given the large number of PP2A substrates, we expect the ubiquitously expressed catalytic and tightly coupled A regulatory subunits to have a broad cellular distribution. However, specific B regulatory subunits, which target the PP2A enzyme to distinct subcellular compartments, should have a more restricted localization. Using a pan-B' antibody, which recognizes all five gene products (, , , , and ), we examined the localization of PP2A in the human airway. The B' subunits exhibit a broad subcellular distribution in the human airway (Fig. 4). We find that B' staining strongly localizes to the apical membrane of ciliated cells in superficial epithelia and gland ducts, consistent with the localization of CFTR in these tissues. Although we cannot unambiguously attribute the apical localization to the B' subunit, it is likely that this staining reflects the distribution of one or a combination of the cytosolic B' subunits, B', B', B', and B' (35).

In excised membrane patches, endogenous PKA activity activates CFTR when exogenous cAMP is added in excess or when membrane-associated adenylate cyclase is activated by receptors (6, 9). In patch preparations, CFTR channel activity reflects the phosphorylation status of the channel, which is regulated by a balance between PKA and endogenous phosphatases (6, 18, 37). Consequently, CFTR channel gating is increased under conditions in which PKA activity is elevated, such as increased cAMP or the inhibition of phosphodiesterases (1, 10). We hypothesize that "rundown" of CFTR activity following excision results from a shift in the balance between endogenous PKA and phosphatase activities. Based on our biochemical analyses demonstrating a physical association between CFTR and PP2A, we tested this hypothesis by examining CFTR rundown in excised patches under control conditions and in the presence of PP2A inhibitors. We compared the average pipette current during the first 30 s of outside out recordings with the average pipette current measured from 270 to 300 s, as performed in previous studies (38). Under control conditions, the pipette solution contained ATP and GTP, conditions that allow CFTR gating to reflect the activity of endogenous PKA (6). Furthermore, current flow through the patch is mediated by Cl- traversing CFTR, since no channel events are observed, and pipette current is near zero with protein kinase A inhibitor (100 nM) in the pipette (0.10  plus or minus  0.10 at 0-30 s and 0.00  plus or minus  0.00 at 270-300 s, n = 5). Under these conditions, CFTR activity declines variably over 5 min (I = -0.66  plus or minus  0.21, n = 18) (Fig. 5, A and B). However, the presence of the PP2A inhibitors okadaic acid or endothall in the pipette prevented channel rundown (I = 0.51  plus or minus  0.24 and I = 01.81  plus or minus  0.88, respectively, n = 10 for each treatment) (Fig. 5, A and B). Although endothall and okadaic acid inhibit PP2A most potently, they can also inhibit other phosphatases such as PP1, PP4, and PP5 (39, 40). Therefore, we also tested the specific inhibitor I2PP2A, which does not inhibit PP1, PP2B, or PP2C (41, 42). Similar to endothall and okadaic acid, I2PP2A (1.7  microM) also prevented CFTR channel rundown (I = 1.13  plus or minus  0.85, n = 8) (Fig. 5, A and B)..

Furthermore, the inhibitor data demonstrate that endogenous PP2A can regulate CFTR channel activity. These results strongly suggest that PP2A functions as a relevant CFTR phosphatase in epithelial tissues. We also tested whether PP2A inhibitors altered basal CFTR activity in an intact epithelium. We measured basal short circuit chloride currents in freshly excised sections of mouse jejunum in Ussing chamber experiments. Previous studies demonstrated that CFTR constitutes the major chloride channel in these preparations, since jejunum from CFTR-/- mice do not exhibit significant chloride conductance (43). We find that over the course of control experiments, basal CFTR activity declined over time (Isc =-9.2  plus or minus  2.6, n = 4) (Fig. 5C). In agreement with our patch clamp data, we find that the PP2A inhibitor endothall (100  microM) prevented rundown of CFTR activity, resulting in increased chloride conductance during the course of the 90-min recording (Isc = 12.4  plus or minus  4.9, n = 4)..

In CF lung disease, PCL volume is depleted, reflecting an imbalance in solute transport across the epithelium (44-47). Ultimately, PCL depletion results in defective mucociliary clearance, which supports bacterial colonization and exposes individuals to life-threatening infections (27, 44-48). Previous studies have demonstrated that CFTR mediates the majority of PCL secretion and plays a fundamental role in maintaining basal PCL volume (36, 49). Therefore, we asked whether inhibition of PP2A would increase CFTR activity and thereby increase PCL levels in primary HBE cultures. The PCL was labeled with florescent dextran as previously described (27). PCL height was measured immediately before and 10 min after the indicated treatments. Vehicle treatment did not significantly change PCL height (Fig. 6). However, cultures treated with okadaic acid exhibited an 30% increase in PCL height (PCL =+2.61  plus or minus  0.7  microm, n = 6) (Fig. 6). Because PP2A inhibition is likely to influence the activities of many cellular proteins, we asked whether CFTR was required for the increase in PCL. Consistent with previous data demonstrating the importance of CFTR in PCL secretion, we find that the CFTR inhibitor, CFTRinh172, causes PCL height to decrease by 30% (PCL =-3.21  plus or minus  0.9  microm) (50). Furthermore, in the presence of CFTRinh172, okadaic acid was similar to the CFTRinh172 alone (PCL =-2.3  plus or minus  1.1  microm). Thus, the inhibition of PP2A with okadaic acid increases PCL height by a mechanism that requires CFTR. These results are consistent with our biochemical and electrophysiological studies demonstrating that CFTR is physically and functionally associated with PP2A in epithelial tissues..

The power of our approach is illustrated by the fact that we unambiguously identified the exact PP2A regulatory subunits associated with CFTR by mass spectrometry as A and B'. To date, at least 21 distinct PP2A regulatory subunits have been identified (2 A regulatory and 19 B regulatory subunits) (for a review, see Ref. 34).

These data suggest that the B' subunit may target the PP2A enzyme to CFTR. It is intriguing to speculate that the expression of the B' subunit may account for the differences in the ability of PP2A to regulate CFTR channel activity in different cell types and tissues. Many of the CFTR phosphatase studies have utilized heterologous expression systems such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (13), baby hamster kidney cells (20), and Hi-5 insect cells (19), which may or may not express relevant CFTR phosphatases and subunits (13, 19, 20). We are unable to ask whether the PP2A B' subunit is expressed in these cell types by reverse transcription-PCR, since there is insufficient sequence information available at this time. However, the expression of specific PP2A subunits in these cells should be an important consideration for future experiments. Recently, Vastiau et al. (33) reported an interaction between CFTR and PP2A, which involves the direct binding of the ubiquitously expressed PP2A A regulatory subunit to the CFTR regulatory domain. To demonstrate the specificity of the CFTR/A interaction, Vastiau et al. (33) showed that the overexpressed heat repeats 1-10 cause a decrease in CFTR rundown, presumably due to the disruption of the A/CFTR interaction. However, the PP2A B subunits also bind to heat repeats 1-10 of the A subunit and would have been dislodged from the phosphatase complex (52, 53). Thus, in these assays, the observed decrease in CFTR rundown could be attributed to the disruption of the interaction between CFTR and both the PP2A A and B regulatory subunits. Nonetheless, the anchoring of PP2A to the CFTR chloride channel may involve multiple sites of interaction mediated by the PP2A A and B' subunits..

However, the importance of PP2A in CFTR regulation in epithelial tissues seems variable. Thus, we chose to study the physical and functional association of CFTR and PP2A in airway epithelia. Indeed, we found that CFTR and PP2A interacted in Calu-3 cells as the PP2A catalytic, A regulatory, and B' regulatory subunits specifically co-precipitate with endogenous CFTR (Fig. 2B). Additionally, we examined the localization of PP2A subunits in the human airway. If, in fact, PP2A regulates CFTR channel activity in epithelial tissues, we would expect the phosphatase to be present at the apical cell surface, consistent with the localization of CFTR. The ubiquitously expressed PP2A catalytic subunit and A regulatory subunit had a diffuse staining pattern, which clearly included the apical membrane of the superficial epithelium (data not shown). Alternatively, staining with a pan-B' regulatory subunit antibody showed a more restricted distribution, including strong staining at the apical plasma membrane (Fig. 4). Thus, the PP2A subunits associated with CFTR are present at the apical cell surface where CFTR functions. Since the available B' antibodies detect all family members, we cannot rule out the possibility that other B' subunits other than B' may also associate with CFTR or localize to the apical surface of airway epithelia. Dozier et al. (54) identified an interaction between Chk2 and the PP2A B' subunit and found that the other highly similar B' family members, B', B', B', and B', were also able to bind to Chk2 in vitro. Consequently, other PP2A B' regulatory subunits may interact with CFTR. However, we did not find an association between CFTR and a structurally unrelated B regulatory family member, B (PR55a) by pull-down (Fig. 2A) or immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2B). Thus, the PP2A molecules associated with CFTR at least appear to be specific for the B' family..

In the presence of PP2A inhibitors, CFTR rundown was blocked in outside-out membrane patches from Calu-3 cells and intact mouse jejunum (Fig. 5). Consistent with our biochemical observations, the presence of PP2A in the membrane patches containing CFTR strongly suggests that these proteins are closely compartmentalized. Furthermore, our data suggest that PP2A is a relevant CFTR phosphatase in epithelial tissues, in agreement with Vastiau et al. (33), who found that the addition of okadaic acid in Caco-2 epithelial cells delayed channel rundown following forskolin treatment. In T84 and airway epithelial cells, PP2A inhibitors did not block the rundown of CFTR following maximal activation by forskolin (15, 20). A major difference between our data and data of other studies is that we chose to measure the effect of PP2A inhibitors on basal CFTR currents as opposed to CFTR currents following maximal activation with forskolin or PKA. It is possible that endogenous PP2A plays a role in regulating basal CFTR currents but that other phosphatases contribute to the deactivation of hyperphosphorylated CFTR. Future studies are needed to address the relative contribution of different phosphatases to the regulation of CFTR channel activity in epithelial tissues..

The underlying PCL provides a low viscosity fluid that facilitates ciliary beating and mucus clearance (12, 55, 56). Based on inhibitor studies, CFTR has been demonstrated to play a central role in the maintenance of basal PCL height (36, 49). Furthermore, the loss of CFTR function results in decreased PCL height and increased viscosity.

We find that the inhibition of PP2A by the addition of okadaic acid to primary HBE cultures produces a 30% increase in PCL height, consistent with an increase in CFTR activity (Fig. 6). Additionally, when CFTR channel activity is blocked by CFTRinh172, okadaic acid does not have a significant effect of the PCL.

Moreover, the direct interaction between CFTR and AMP-activated protein kinase has been mapped to CFTR residues 1420-1457, adjacent to the residues where we observe PP2A binding (residues 1451-1476) (12).

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	4	In order to gain a better insight into the structure and function of the regulatory domain (RD) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, 19 RD missense mutations that had been identified in patients were functionally characterized. Nine of these (I601F, L610S, A613T, D614G, I618T, L619S, H620P, G628R and L633P) resulted in aberrant processing. No or a very small number of functional CFTR proteins will therefore appear at the cell membrane in cells expressing these mutants. These mutations were clustered in the N-terminal part of the RD, suggesting that this subdomain has a folding pattern that is very sensitive to amino acid changes. Mutations that caused no aberrant processing were further characterized at the electrophysiological level. First, they were studied at the whole cell level in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Mutants that induced a whole cell current that was significantly different from wild-type CFTR were subsequently analysed at the single channel level in COS1 cells transiently expressing the different mutant and wild-type proteins. Three mutant chloride channels, G622D, R792G and E822K CFTR, were characterized by significantly lower intrinsic chloride channel activities compared with wild-type CFTR. Two mutations, H620Q and A800G, resulted in increased intrinsic chloride transport activities. Finally, T665S and E826K CFTR had single channel properties not significantly different from wild-type CFTR..

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	6	Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population. The disease is characterized by abnormal salt transport across the apical border of epithelial cells (1). The CFTR protein (2-4) is a transmembrane protein consisting of two repeated motifs, each composed of a transmembrane domain and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), separated by a highly charged regulatory domain (RD). The RD consists of alternating clusters of positively and negatively charged amino acids and harbours multiple consensus sequences for phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) (3)..

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	8	Reconstitution of the CFTR protein into proteoliposomes proved that it forms a linear low conductance chloride channel (5). Activation of CFTR is complex and occurs in different steps. First, the RD is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent PKA. This step is enhanced through pre-stimulation with PKC (6). In a second step, ATP binds to and is hydrolysed at the first NBD, thereby opening the channel and allowing chloride ions to flow down the electrochemical gradient. In a third step, ATP hydrolysis at NBD2 closes the channel (7). As long as the RD is phosphorylated, ATP can re-open the channel. Dephosphorylation of the RD by phosphatases (8) results in final closure of the channel..

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	10	The precise mechanisms by which the RD regulates anion flow is far from understood. Although the RD contains nine consensus sites for PKA, they all are redundant and phosphorylation at a single site is sufficient for channel activation (9). Given the fact that activation of CFTR can only occur through PKA phosphorylation, this degeneration of phosphorylation sites is very puzzling. On the other hand, the channel can be locked in the activated state through mutagenesis of Ser to Asp moieties at the PKA consensus sites (10). This observation indicates that negative charges introduced by PKA phosphorylation are important for channel activation. Deleting part of the RD (amino acids 708-835) will also yield a CFTR channel that escapes PKA regulation and that is constitutively active (11). It was therefore hypothesized that the RD closes the chloride channel pore and that it will be repulsed from the pore when negative charges are introduced. Although these [Delta]R-CFTR proteins are constitutively active, their open probability (Po) is only one third of that found for wild-type CFTR. Moreover, addition of an unphosphorylated RD to [Delta]R-CFTR has no effect on this channel activity, while addition of a phosphorylated RD doubles the Po. This increase in activity apparently results from a higher rate of channel opening because of a higher sensitivity of NBD1 for ATP. Based on these findings it was hypothesized that phosphorylation of the RD changes the sensitivity of NBD1 for ATP (12,13)..

In this regard, the known RD missense mutations found in patients could provide important information about the metabolism and the function of the RD. Our investigations of 19 missense mutations will show that some mutations affect protein maturation, others lead to decreased function or gain of function, while still others appear to have no effect in the assay systems used..

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	15	When exon 13 sequences of CFTR from nine different organisms were aligned (Fig. 1), a high conservation of the N-terminal part (RD1, up to amino acid 650) was observed. In the C-terminal two- thirds (RD2), only the PKA phosphorylation sites were conserved and they were all located in this subdomain. The RD is highly charged, in part due to the presence of PKA consensus sequences which are highly basic. Two acidic amino acid stretches were found. The first one (amino acids 725-730) is located in the first half of RD2 and, although this region is poorly conserved, its negative charge was found in all species studied. The second acid region (amino acids 822-828) was located at the end of the RD and was completely conserved..

Only R766M and R792G disrupted a PKA recognition site and might therefore interfere with CFTR regulation. The different RD mutations affected almost all, except D648V, V754M and A800G, amino acid moieties that were absolutely or highly conserved. The high conservation of these mutated amino acids highlights their importance for structure and function. Six of the 21 disease mutations affected the charge of the amino acid residue and two even resulted in an amino acid of opposite charge. The latter two were located in the highly conserved C-terminal acidic domain..

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	21	At the beginning of this study, 19 different RD mutations (Table 1) had been described in patients. Since then, it was found that the F693L mutation is a polymorphism (14,15) and that the I807M polymorphism is associated with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) (our unpublished data). Two additional disease mutations, which were not characterized at the functional level in this study, were identified [K698R and V754M (15)]. The nature by which all the RD mutations cause CFTR dysfunction is, however, unknown. It is known that some CFTR mutations, like F508, cause misfolding of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in retention and degradation by the quality control system that operates in this cell compartment (16). Therefore, we first determined the maturation pattern of the different mutant CFTR proteins listed in Table 1. The different mutations were introduced into wild-type CFTR cDNA, inserted in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 and the mutant constructs were transfected into COS1 cells. The corresponding proteins were analysed by means of pulse chase experiments. When CFTR translation products enter the ER, they become glycosylated through addition of two high-mannose glycosyl groups on the fourth extracellular loop. This event gives rise to the appearance of a 150 kDa protein, the most prominent form of wild-type CFTR after 30 min chase (Fig. 2, lane 1). As the protein leaves the ER and enters the Golgi apparatus, the glycosyl groups become modified to complex sugar groups and this gives rise to a protein with lower mobility (190 kDa), as can be seen in lanes 2 and 3 of Figure 2. Only the 190 kDa protein will move further to the plasma membrane and will contribute to chloride channel activity. This maturation pattern was found not only for wild-type CFTR but also for some of the mutants (Table 2), such as I807M CFTR (Fig. 2). Some of the mutants, however, presented an abnormal maturation pattern, as can be seen for L610S and D614G CFTR (Fig. 2). These mutant proteins only yielded the 150 kDa form, even after 210 min chase, indicating that they gave rise to misfolded proteins that were retained and degraded in the ER. In order to confirm that the 150 kDa form was indeed the ER form and the 190 kDa form was the complex glycosylated one, two enzymatic digestions were performed (results not shown). When the immunopurified proteins were incubated with endoglycosidase H, an enzyme that only recognizes and cleaves off high-mannose residues, only the 150 kDa forms of the maturing and non-maturing mutants were digested. N-glycosidase F, an enzyme that recognizes and degrades high-mannose and complex glycosyl groups, degraded the 150 kDa as well as the 190 kDa form. The mutations that gave rise to a protein that was not able to proceed to the 190 kDa form (I601F, L610S, A613T, D614G, I618T, L619S, H620P, G628R and L633P; Table 2) are therefore class two mutations (17), where the disease phenotype is caused by the absence of sufficient CFTR protein at the cell surface..

Since then, it was found that the F693L mutation is a polymorphism (14,15) and that the I807M polymorphism is associated with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) (our unpublished data). Two additional disease mutations, which were not characterized at the functional level in this study, were identified [K698R and V754M (15)]. The nature by which all the RD mutations cause CFTR dysfunction is, however, unknown. It is known that some CFTR mutations, like F508, cause misfolding of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in retention and degradation by the quality control system that operates in this cell compartment (16). Therefore, we first determined the maturation pattern of the different mutant CFTR proteins listed in Table 1.

Mutations that caused no arrest in protein maturation were therefore analysed at the electrophysiological level. To this end, CFTR RNA of the maturing mutants was prepared by in vitro transcription and injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes. The basal and cAMP-induced whole cell chloride currents were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The results are shown in Figure 3. Four mutations (T665S, R792G, E822K and E826K) caused a significant reduction in the cAMP-induced chloride current. Interestingly, two mutations (H620Q and A800G) gave rise to chloride channels with significantly higher chloride transport activities. The remainder (G622D, D648V, F693L, R766M and I807M) did not significantly affect chloride transport ability when compared with wild-type CFTR channels..

Mutants that affected whole cell currents were therefore studied at the single channel level. The different wild-type and mutant CFTR cDNAs were incorporated into a bicistronic vector such that, after transfection into COS1 cells, a bicistronic transcript of CFTR and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was formed. COS1 cells expressing GFP, and therefore also CFTR, were used for single channel measurements. The current was measured before and after addition of forskolin and IBMX to the extracellular side of the cell. Examples of tracings for the wild-type and H620Q CFTR proteins are shown in Figure 4A. Wild-type (Fig. 4B) and mutant CFTR chloride channels showed linear I-V relationships with single channel conductances not different from wild-type (Fig. 4C). The Po of the different CFTR variants were determined (Fig. 5). Single channel activities correlated well with the whole cell currents measured in oocytes for the majority of the CFTR proteins studied. G622D, R792G and E822K gave rise to a CFTR chloride channel with a significantly lower Po than wild-type CFTR; H620Q and A800G CFTR resulted in channels with significantly higher Po..

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	34	Since the discovery of the CFTR gene, 21 RD missense mutations have been identified in patients. We studied the effect of 19 of these mutations (Table 1) on the maturation and electrophysiological properties of CFTR. Nine mutations caused aberrant processing: I601F, L610S, A613T, D614G, I618T, L619S, H620P, G628R and L633P. A very striking observation was that all mutations that caused a processing defect were clustered in the N-terminal part (amino acids 601-619) of the RD, while those that showed a normal maturation pattern were clustered in the C-terminal end (amino acids 648-826). These effects were not caused by the different types of mutations that had been introduced, since similar amino acid changes were found in both subdomains. In the region linking these two parts the effect of a mutation depends on the amino acid change introduced. This is illustrated for amino acid 620, where two different mutations were detected in CF patients. When His620 was changed to Gln, no effect on maturation was observed. When His620 was changed to Pro, an amino acid that dramatically affects the secondary structure of the protein and therefore possibly its correct folding, a non-maturing protein was obtained. It should be noted, however, that the effects of mutations involving Pro are not that dramatic when they are located in the second subdomain of CFTR, since a recombinant protein in which three wild-type Pro residues were mutated still formed the mature 190 kDa form (18)..

Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that the RD can be divided into two subdomains. Cross-species analysis revealed that the N-terminal part of this domain has been highly conserved at the amino acid level during evolution, from shark to human, while in the C-terminal two-thirds only the phosphorylation sites are conserved (19). Moreover, all the RD phosphorylation sites are exclusively located in this second part. A new model for NBD1 was recently obtained by computational modelling, based on the X-ray structure of bovine mitochondrial F1 ATPase. According to this model, amino acids 453-650, which have so far been attributed to the exon 13 RD, are in fact predicted to be part of NBD1 (20).

Therefore, mutant proteins that have a wild-type or an increased channel activity may cause a CF phenotype due to abnormal regulatory properties.

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	50	An XhoI-KpnI fragment containing the CFTR coding region was isolated from the prokaryotic vector pTG5960 (Transgene SA, Strasbourg, France) and inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands). In order to remove a potential ATG start codon derived from the multiple cloning site of pTG5960, the construct was digested with KpnI and EcoRV and the resulting linear plasmid was blunt-end ligated after T4 DNA polymerase treatment. The CFTR coding region present in the resulting construct was characterized by dideoxy sequencing and one polymorphism, V470, was identified. The sequence also contained three neutral amino acid changes (t930c, a933g and t936c) that had been introduced in order to inactivate a cryptic prokaryotic promoter (36). All RD missense mutations that had been reported before May 23, 1996, to the Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Analysis Consortium (Table 1) were introduced using the Transformer Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The primers used for mutagenesis are listed in Table 1. The complete CFTR coding region of the 20 mutants was sequenced; no other mutations than the desired ones were found..

For this purpose, wild-type CFTR cDNA derived from pcDNA3-CFTR was ligated as a T4 DNA polymerase-treated XhoI-SacI fragment in pCINeo/IRES-GFP. The latter had first been linearized with NheI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and dephosphorylated with bovine alkaline phosphatase. The RD and its flanking sequences were subsequently removed from pCINeo/wtCFTR-IRES-GFP by complete digestion with XbaI and partial digestion with BstXI and was replaced by the corresponding mutant CFTR fragments that had been obtained by complete digestion of the different mutant pcDNA3-CFTR constructs with XbaI and BstXI..

The coverslips were mounted in a patch clamp set-up (EPC-7 amplifier; List, Darmstadt, Germany) containing a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope, a Xenon light source and epifluorescence optics (Zeiss, XBO 75 and Zeiss-EPI unit fluorescence condenser) 48-72 h after transfection. A band-pass filter (Zeiss BP 450-490) was used for excitation of GFP. Excitation was via a dichroic mirror (Zeiss FT 510). Light emitted by GFP-expressing cells passed through a 520 nm long-pass filter (Zeiss LP 520) and was visually detected. Only cells emitting green fluorescent light after excitation and, consequently, expressing GFP and CFTR proteins were used for single channel measurements. All electrophysiological measurements were performed at room temperature in the cell-attached configuration with a pipette resistance of ~10 M[Omega] and the currents were digitized at 1 kHz and filtered at 500 Hz. The data were collected continuously by the AXO Tape v.2.02 software package (Axon Instruments, Forster City, CA) and analysed with the ASCD software program (38). Only one patch per cell was studied; therefore, the number of patches is equal to the number of cells studied. The pipette and bath solutions contained 140 mM N-methyl-D-glucamine chloride, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CsCl, 1 mM Mg-ATP, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4. The channels were activated through addition of 1  microM IBMX and 0.1  microM forskolin to the bath (external) solution. The open probability Po was calculated from Po = I/i&middot;n, where I is the averaged current during the whole stimulation period, i is the single channel current obtained from amplitude histograms and n is the number of channels estimated from overlapping events. All data were analysed by Student's t-test. A value of P  <  0.05 was considered significant. Data are reported as means  plus or minus  SEM..

As such, its primary role is to facilitate the folding of nascent polypeptides. Thus plentiful among the ER resident proteins are 1) enzymes that catalyze conformational rearrangements, such as protein disulfide isomerase and peptidylprolyl isomerase; 2) enzymes that chemically modify the nascent polypeptide, such as signal sequence peptidase and oligosaccharyl transferase; and 3) molecules that retain the polypeptide in a soluble, aggregation-free state. The factors constituting this last group are molecular chaperones, many of which were first identified as heat shock proteins (HSPs) because their synthesis is induced when cells are exposed to high temperatures or other stresses. However, most HSPs have cellular homologs that are constitutively produced, and these are named heat shock cognate proteins (HSCs). HSC and HSP molecular chaperones are defined by their molecular masses (in kDa), and a plentiful class found in every cell type are those with a molecular mass of ~70 kDa (i.e., HSC70 and HSP70)..

In some cases, the HSP40 cochaperone delivers a polypeptide substrate to the HSP70 or HSC70 (17, 37). With the use of a variety of in vitro techniques, the HSC70 and HSP70 chaperones have been shown to bind preferentially to short stretches of amino acids with overall hydrophobic character (3, 13, 31). Such motifs are normally buried within the core of a native protein but may become solvent accessible during protein folding and upon protein denaturation. Thus HSC70 and HSP70 chaperones are ideally suited to aid unfolded proteins en route to their native conformations by limiting protein aggregation..

CFTR most likely functions as a chloride channel in the plasma membrane of airway and other epithelial cells, but cells containing only the F508 variant either lack or harbor variable amounts of the protein at the plasma membrane (7, 16). Both wild-type and the F508 mutant form of CFTR are translocated into the ER membrane, at which time protein folding should commence. However, in vitro studies by Qu and colleagues (25, 26) suggest that the efficiency of F508 CFTR folding is severely impaired compared with that of the wild-type protein. It has also been shown that the F508 mutant protein is unable to undergo an ATP-dependent conformational change in the ER (20, 40). Consistent with an inability of F508 CFTR to fold efficiently, incubation of cells expressing the mutant at lower temperatures, a condition that may favor protein folding and/or stability, permits some of this variant to traffic to the plasma membrane where it is active (10), albeit with a reduced open probability and half-life (9, 11, 19). In contrast, if CFTR folding is retarded in the ER, the protein becomes a substrate for ER-associated degradation, a quality control mechanism that degrades aberrant proteins in the secretory pathway (4). Degradation of CFTR, like most other ER-associated degradation substrates, requires ubiquitinylation and delivery to the multicatalytic cytoplasmic proteasome (14, 36, 38). Although a significant proportion of even wild-type CFTR is degraded, nearly all of the F508 mutant is destroyed; therefore, cells expressing only the mutant form of the protein are phenotypically null..

Specifically, cytoplasmic HSC70 and HSP90, the luminal Ca2+-binding chaperone calnexin, and a cytoplasmic HSP40 homolog Hdj2 can be coprecipitated with CFTR (18, 22, 24, 39). HSC70 and Hdj2 also prevent the in vitro aggregation of the first nucleotide-binding domain of CFTR (22, 34), the domain in which the phenylalanine at position 508 resides. Although wild-type, folded CFTR is released from the chaperones on its transit from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, HSC70 and calnexin remain bound to the mutant until degradation ensues (24, 39). A HSC70-interacting factor, CHIP, has recently been shown to facilitate the degradation of immature forms of CFTR (23). One interpretation of these combined data is that the chaperone-CFTR complexes represent folding intermediates..

0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	11	Because several human diseases arise from defects in protein folding (4, 35), because of the devastating effects and widespread occurrence of CF, and because a profound amount of information is available on the mechanisms of molecular chaperones, the modulation of protein folding and chaperone activity has been attempted with small molecules and genetic manipulations. For example, it was demonstrated by the Welch (5) and Kopito (32) laboratories that F508 CFTR-expressing cells incubated in glycerol, a polyol known to stabilize proteins in vitro, contain ER-matured forms of CFTR and display cAMP (forskolin)-activated plasma membrane chloride transport, a hallmark of functional CFTR. Glycerol also facilitates the in vitro folding of the first nucleotide-binding domain lacking the phenylalanine at position 508 by preventing off-pathway intermediates from forming (25). F508 CFTR-expressing cells incubated in trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), an osmotic stabilizer found in sharks to protect proteins from urea denaturation, exhibit similar properties (5).

0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	12	Because several human diseases arise from defects in protein folding (4, 35), because of the devastating effects and widespread occurrence of CF, and because a profound amount of information is available on the mechanisms of molecular chaperones, the modulation of protein folding and chaperone activity has been attempted with small molecules and genetic manipulations. For example, it was demonstrated by the Welch (5) and Kopito (32) laboratories that F508 CFTR-expressing cells incubated in glycerol, a polyol known to stabilize proteins in vitro, contain ER-matured forms of CFTR and display cAMP (forskolin)-activated plasma membrane chloride transport, a hallmark of functional CFTR.

0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	13	Another means to alter protein folding in vivo is through the modulation of intracellular chaperone concentration. For example, Rubenstein et al. (28) showed that sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA), an ammonia scavenger approved for the treatment of urea cycle disorders and a known transcriptional regulator, permits a fraction of F508 CFTR to mature in bronchial epithelial cell lines and primary nasal epithelial cells from patients with CF. Maturation of the mutant coincides with cAMP-stimulated plasma membrane Cl conductance in the treated cells. To determine the molecular basis of 4PBA-mediated rescue of the F508 CFTR phenotype, immunoprecipitations were performed to examine the amount of CFTR associated with HSC70, and a 4PBA dose-dependent decrease in the amount of CFTR-HSC70 complex was observed (30). Because HSC70 was shown to facilitate ubiquitination of several test proteins in vitro (2), the authors suggested that HSC70 targets CFTR for degradation and that 4PBA, through an unknown mechanism, reduces the amount of the complex by which CFTR is delivered to the proteasome..

Although HSC70 mRNA is known to be relatively unstable, 4PBA appears to further accelerate its degradation. Coincident with an acceleration of mRNA degradation, an ~40% reduction in the amount of HSC70 is evident. The mechanism by which this occurs is unknown, but it has been shown that inhibiting the initiation of yeast HSC70 translation leads to a rapid destruction of its message (1). Because a large number of translation poisons are known, many of which were first isolated as antibiotics, this hypothesis can be tested..

Although previous data (30) suggested that this was so, new work from Choo-Kang and Zeitlin (8) indicates that 4PBA raises HSP70 levels, leading to increased HSP70-F508 CFTR complex formation and F508 CFTR maturation. One concern is that this phenomenon may arise from a secondary effect of decreasing HSC70 levels (see above), which, in turn, could induce a general heat shock or stress response. However, the authors show that CFTR maturation is also facilitated by selectively increasing the intracellular levels of HSP70 by transient transfection with an HSP70 expression vector..

They also point to the complexity of HSP70 or HSC70 function in the cell. Whereas one isoform (i.e., HSP70) facilitates protein folding, its homolog (i.e., HSC70) targets a misfolded protein for degradation. Previous data suggest that multiple chaperones bind coordinately to nascent polypeptides. Although the functions of many of these chaperones are likely to be redundant, it seems logical that a subset is required for folding and another subset is necessary for protein degradation. If one group fails to fold the polypeptide, another is readily available to target the substrate for destruction. The activities of the unique sets of chaperones may be further defined by the action of the HSP40/DnaJ cochaperones that regulate HSP70 and HSC70 function. In other cases, the folding and degradation targeting activities may reside in one chaperone complex. For example, HSP90 has been proposed to facilitate both CFTR maturation and degradation (18)..

0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	22	Another means to catalyze CFTR folding is through the use of chemical chaperones, an attack that has shown promise in in vitro model systems as described above. To determine whether this approach is feasible in an animal system, Fischer et al. (12) examined whether TMAO corrects the F508 CFTR trafficking defect in mice. Because the severity of the defect associated with the F508 form of CFTR is most prevalent in the rodent intestine, measurements of rectal potential difference (RPD) were undertaken in control mice, those lacking CFTR, and F508 CFTR mice. Administration of TMAO over 24 h by subcutaneous injection reveals significant increases in forskolin-activated RPD hyperpolarization in the control and F508 CFTR mice, consistent with a partial rescue of the folding defects associated with the wild-type and mutant proteins. Most promising from a clinical perspective is the observation that administering the flavinoid apigenin, a CFTR activator, further increases the forskolin-activated RPD in the F508 CFTR-expressing mouse. This result supports the promise that combined therapeutic attacks may present the best option to lessen the pathophysiology of CF. Combining small-molecule activators of CFTR function is warranted, particularly in this case, because the concentrations of TMAO used for these studies are quite high and the physiological effects of prolonged administration of TMAO are unknown..

0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	24	Might chaperone-based therapies become clinically relevant and generalized to the spectrum of diseases that arise from protein misfolding? The corrective effects of glycerol and 4-PBA on the maturation and secretion of another "conformational disease"-causing protein, the Z variant of antitrypsin, have been recently reported by Burrows et al. (6). In addition, other chaperone modulators are currently being examined for their ability to correct misfolded proteins. 15-Deoxyspergualin, a known HSC70 effector and immunosuppressant, increases the cAMP-stimulated plasma membrane Cl channel activity of F508 CFTR-expressing cells (15). However, because an increase in ER-matured forms of F508 CFTR could not be observed with 15-deoxyspergualin treatment, only a small amount of the mutant had likely trafficked to the plasma membrane and yielded the desired activity. Nevertheless, with the advent of combinatorial chemistry and more defined methods to examine protein folding and chaperone action at the molecular level, I suspect that we will see a new convergence of chemical, cell biological, and biophysical tools geared to combat a variety of human diseases..

First, presenting two full-length cDNA sequences (termed sCFTR-I and sCFTR-II) from the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and an additional partial coding sequence from the eastern gray kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), this study went further to refine the boundaries of the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and the COOH-terminal tail (C-tail), wherein NBD1 was defined as going from P439 to G646, NBD2 as going from A1225 to E1417, and the C-tail as going from E1418 to L1480. This approach also provided further insights into the differential roles of the two halves of CFTR and highlighted several well-conserved motifs that may be involved in inter- or intramolecular interactions. Moreover, a serious concern that a certain fraction of missense mutations identified in the CFTR gene may not have functional consequences was raised.

The encoded 1,480-amino-acid protein functions mainly as a chloride selective ion channel and is composed of two structurally homologous halves, with each half consisting of a membrane-spanning domain (MSD) and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD); the two halves are linked by a unique regulatory or R domain. The MSDs contribute to the formation of the chloride selective pore, the NBDs bind and hydrolyze ATP to regulate channel gating, and R domain phosphorylation controls channel activity (for reviews, see Gadsby and Nairn 1999 ; Sheppard and Welsh 1999 ). In addition, there is increasing evidence that CFTR can affect the transport of other ions, including HCO-3 (Choi et al. 2001 and references therein)..

However, while screening for CFTR mutations has become a purely molecular pursuit (currently, nearly 1,000 DNA variants of the gene are deposited in the CF Mutation Data Base: http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr), the principal challenge is interpretation of these events in terms of their likely medical consequences. This is especially the case with the vast number of missense mutations (40%), most of which are rare or even "private." The formidable nature of this situation lies in the large size and complexity of the gene and, more importantly, in the complex multidomain structure of the protein..

In this regard, the impact of comparative sequence analysis has been tremendous. Even the originally proposed CFTR structure, which has proved to be remarkably prescient, was largely based on a comparison of human CFTR with a number of other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family members (Riordan et al. 1989 ). Furthermore, cross-species sequence comparisons between the small number of CFTR homologs available in the early 1990s highlighted that identified mutations had occurred in evolutionary conserved residues (Diamond et al. 1991 ; Tucker, Tannahill, and Higgins 1992 ). These early but necessarily limited analyses clearly demonstrated the importance of evolutionary information in interpreting the effects of mutations and have also frequently been taken into account in the design of functional studies. Therefore, such a large number of missense mutations identified in the human CFTR and the abundance of structural and functional analysis data accumulated over the past decade, if evaluated together in the context of a sequence comparison of all of the currently available CFTR orthologs, will allow a significantly improved refinement of the domain structure of CFTR. This will, in turn, facilitate interpretation of the identified mutations.

This is given wide support by recent in vivo expression data: although both sCFTR-I expression and sCFTR-II expression have been shown to increase in the gill following abrupt seawater exposure, the pattern of temporal expression for each gene is considerably different (Singer et al. 2000) . Moreover, the existence of two different genes encoding the same product is not entirely surprising, as many fish species, including salmonids (Hordvik 1998 ), have undergone tetraploidization events during their evolutionary histories, and duplication of certain hormone genes (e.g., Takeo and Yamashita 1999 ) or ion and water transporter genes (Cutler et al. 2000 ; unpublished data) in certain fishes has been reported.

These observations, taken together, strongly suggest that sCFTR-I and sCFTR-II represent different isoforms and that the presence of duplicate CFTR isoforms may be a more general phenomenon in teleost fish species.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	37	  Refinement of the Boundaries of NBD1 NBD1 was originally defined as going from amino acid F433 to amino acid I586 (human CFTR notation throughout the text) (Riordan et al. 1989 ; fig. 2). This definition has subsequently been modified by several structural models (Annereau et al. 1997 ; Bianchet et al. 1997 ; Hoedemaeker, Davidson, and Rose 1998 ), whose common feature is an extended COOH terminus of NBD1 beyond residue I586. Complementary to these observations, the originally defined R domain has also been challenged (Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000 and references therein). In particular, the boundaries of NBD1 were recently investigated with a carefully designed functional approach, where CFTR channel constructs were severed near the likely NH2- or COOH-terminal boundaries of NBD1, systematically along the primary sequence, and successful assembly of each pair of channel segments was measured by CFTR channel activity (Chan et al. 2000) . With each additional piece of information, the precise boundaries of NBD1 have begun to emerge, and here they are tentatively defined as going from P439 to G646 (fig. 2 )..
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	38	The new definition of the NH2 terminus of NBD1 combines the following considerations. The principal evidence comes from evolutionary data. As illustrated in figure 2 , there is a sharp increase in sequence conservation beginning at P439 in comparison with the immediately preceding sequence. The first six amino acids of the originally defined NBD1 (i.e., F433 to T438) are quite divergent (even to the extent of deletions having occurred in several species), and the upstream region is a divergent sequence track of 20 amino acids. In contrast, downstream of P439, not only is there a stringently conserved three-amino-acid motif (i.e., P439-V440-L441), but also most of the nonstringently conserved residues from K442 to A457 have changes mainly involving substitutions between conservative amino acids, and this region is then followed by the highly conserved Walker A motif (GSTGAGKT, amino acid 458 to amino acid 465). A similar transition from divergence to sequence conservation is also present in the equivalent location of the aligned sequences of other ABC transporter family members, as illustrated in a sequence comparison of the 17 bacterial membrane proteins that form the periplasmic permease gene family (Mimura, Holbrook, and Ames 1991 ). Second, this definition is consistent with most of the structural models of human CFTR, where the NH2 terminus of NBD1 was regarded as T438 (Higgins 1992 ), L441 (Bianchet et al. 1997 ), and around V440 (Hoedemaeker, Davidson, and Rose 1998 ), respectively. This definition also appears to correlate reasonably well with the three-dimensional crystal structure of HisP (the ATP-binding subunit of the bacterial histidine transporter), where P439 would be predicted to occur at the very beginning of the second ss strand of HisP (Hung et al. 1998 ). Third, this definition falls within amino acids N432 to E449 the functionally defined NH2 terminus of NBD1 (Chan et al. 2000) . Finally, this definition is given further support by the mutational pattern in this transitional region (fig. 2 )..

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	40	However, one may argue that the new definition of the NH2 terminus of NBD1 might have inappropriately excluded the sequences aligned to the first ss strand of HisP (Hung et al. 1998 ). Of particular relevance to this point is residue F433, an aromatic amino acid that corresponds to residue Y16 of the HisP. The structure of HisP has been considered a good model for the binding of ATP to an NBD, in which the aromatic Y16 was confirmed to play a critical role (as determined by mutational studies by Shyamala et al. [1991 ]). Moreover, the structures of the other two prokaryotic NBD proteins, LivF and the amino-terminal NBD of RbsA, show a very similar binding interaction between the NBD and ATP, that is, the side chain of an aromatic residue (analogous to Y16 in HisP) interacts with the adenine ring of ATP to stabilize nucleotide binding. Furthermore, an aromatic residue 20 to 30 amino acids upstream of the start of the Walker A motif (in a similar position relative to Y16 in HisP) is conserved in other ABC transporter NBDs (summarized in Berger and Welsh 2000) . By inference, F433 in the human CFTR may participate in ATP binding. However, a recent functional analysis has refuted such a possibility and highlighted the unique structure of CFTR NBD compared with other NBD structures (Berger and Welsh 2000) . Undoubtedly, this finding adds further weight to the newly defined NBD1..
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	41	We previously defined the NH2 terminus of the R domain as beginning at C647 (Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000) . Consequently, G646 could be considered the COOH terminus of NBD1. However, the concurrent functional approach defined the COOH terminus of NBD1 as occurring between G622 and Q634 (Chan et al. 2000) . Nevertheless, G646 seems to be a more logical positioning of the true boundary linking NBD1 and the R domain in CFTR. In addition to the previous arguments (Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000) , further supporting evidence also exists. Again, the principal evidence comes from evolutionary data. As indicated in figure 2 , the sequence from S623 to G646 is as well conserved as that from F587 to G622; the latter is the common part of the extended NBD1 in the two studies (Chan et al. 2000; Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000) . Perhaps a more important indication comes from a sequence alignment with other ABC transporter NBDs; for example, HisP ends exactly at residue G646 of the human CFTR homolog (see fig. 5 in Hung et al. 1998 ). Moreover, it is important to note that the functional assembly of paired CFTR segments severed at L633/Q634 is not as good as that of those cleaved at N432/F433 (Chan et al. 2000) . In this regard, it will be interesting to compare paired CFTR fragments cleaved at the newly defined NBD1/R domain boundary (i.e., G646/C647) with those cleaved at L633/Q634..
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	42	We previously defined the NH2 terminus of the R domain as beginning at C647 (Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000) . Consequently, G646 could be considered the COOH terminus of NBD1. However, the concurrent functional approach defined the COOH terminus of NBD1 as occurring between G622 and Q634 (Chan et al. 2000) . Nevertheless, G646 seems to be a more logical positioning of the true boundary linking NBD1 and the R domain in CFTR. In addition to the previous arguments (Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000) , further supporting evidence also exists. Again, the principal evidence comes from evolutionary data. As indicated in figure 2 , the sequence from S623 to G646 is as well conserved as that from F587 to G622; the latter is the common part of the extended NBD1 in the two studies (Chan et al. 2000; Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000) .

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	43	Refinement of the Boundaries of NBD2 The original location in the amino acid sequence of NBD2 is from Y1219 to R1386 (Riordan et al. 1989 ; fig. 2). Historically, NBD2 has received much less attention than NBD1. Now, with the boundaries of NBD1 redefined, those of NBD2 can be similarly refined. Accordingly, the NH2 terminus of NBD2 could be defined as going from A1225 by reference to the relative position of the highly conserved Walker A motif, and this also correlates fairly well with the mutational pattern (the appearance of missense mutations clustering around the Walker A motif: GRTGSGKS, at amino acid 1244 to amino acid 1251) in the transitional region in NBD2 (fig. 2 ). However, when the COOH terminus of NBD2 is extended to P1443 by reference to the redefined NBD1 (see also fig. 5 in Hung et al. 1998 ), the very COOH-terminal portion of this "new NBD2" shows poor sequence conservation. Yet, this is not so surprising if it is considered in the context of the ABC transporter family, where for example, its counterpart region in the 17 bacterial periplasmic permeases is similarly divergent (Mimura, Holbrook, and Ames 1991 ). Thus, it seems clear that the very COOH-terminal portions of NBDs are, in general, less functionally restrained throughout the ABC transporter family, although this is in stark contrast to the NBD1 of CFTR, where the very COOH-terminal portion is highly conserved (fig. 2 ). While it is not clear whether this sequence conservation is related to the immediately following R domain (which is unique to CFTR), it lends further weight to the unique structure of CFTR NBD1..
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	44	Although P1443 could represent the COOH terminus of a "new NBD2," this should not be accepted without any reservations. The significant sequence divergence of the very COOH-terminal portion of this "new NBD2," the different structural requirements of a CFTR NBD compared with other ABC transporter NBDs in general (Berger and Welsh 2000) , and the differential roles between the CFTR NBD1 and NBD2 in particular (discussed below) argue for an alternative definition. Here again, it is reassuring how well the evolutionary data, clinical observations, and functional studies concur. The initial location of sequence divergence in this transitional region was clearly situated at E1418 (fig. 2 ). In addition, the shortest truncation that is associated with CF disease (with pancreatic insufficiency and recurrent pulmonary infection) terminates at Q1412 (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr). Furthermore, a review of several functional studies clearly points to the fact that CFTR truncated at/or upstream of V1415 significantly affects the biogenesis, maturation, and stability of the protein, but those molecules truncated at or downstream of N1419 do not (Rich et al. 1993 ; Zhang et al. 1998 ; Haardt et al. 1999 ; Gentzsch and Riordan 2001 ). These three lines of observation, together with the mutational pattern in this region, strongly suggest that residue E1417 can be confidently assigned as the COOH terminus of NBD2. This new definition is also further validated by the analysis which has redefined the C-tail of the CFTR (discussed below)..

On the one hand, the newly defined C-tail is "nonessential," as the effects on the biogenesis, processing, and stability of the CFTR previously assigned to the original C-tail have now been relocated to within the newly defined NBD2. Moreover, even the two trafficking signals thought to reside in the newly defined C-terminal tail, at Y1424 and the dileucine pair at L1430-L1431, have been demonstrated not to alter the steady-state amount of nascent or mature CFTR in recent functional studies (Gentzsch and Riordan 2001) . On the other hand, the newly defined C-tail does appear to be "essential," as the well-conserved motif involving the final three amino acids (TRL) represents a PDZ-interacting domain which is required for the polarization of CFTR to the apical plasma membrane in epithelial cells (Moyer et al. 2000) . Even so, it is important to note that this PDZ-binding motif alone is not sufficient for the polarized distribution of CFTR (Milewski et al. 2001) . Therefore, the C-tail as a whole would play a minor role in the pathogenesis of CF disease. Indeed, neither S1455X (Mickle et al. 1998 ) nor Q1476X (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr) caused a severe CF phenotype. By inference, any single missense mutations identified in the C-tail may not have a significant functional consequence. Consistent with this hypothesis, none of the three missense mutations identified in this region (fig. 2 ) can be confidently assigned as causal for CF disease; for example, R1422W was identified in a CF patient who also carried the mutations F508del and D993Y, and R1453W was identified in a patient with diffuse panbronchiolitis (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr).

While there are 17 missense mutations clustered in the LSGGQ motif (LSGGQ, amino acids 548 to 552) and the Walker B motif (RAVYKDADLYLLD, amino acids 560 to 572) in NBD1, there are only four missense mutations in the equivalent regions (LSHGH [amino acids 1346 to 1350] and RSVLSKAKILLLD [amino acids 1358 to 1370]) of NBD2. Conversely, while there is only one missense mutation in the Walker A motif (GSTGAGKT, amino acids 458 to 465) in NBD1, there are five mutations in the corresponding motif (GRTGSGKS, amino acids 1244 to 1251) in NBD2. This finding is intriguing since, on the one hand, although Walker A and Walker B are presumably both involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, the exact mechanisms remain largely unknown. On the other hand, while it is generally believed that ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 and NBD2 may drive channel opening and closing, respectively (reviewed by Nagel 1999 ), recent biochemical analysis suggests that opening and closing may occur as a consequence of nucleotide binding and dissociation or hydrolysis at a functional unit involving both domains (Aleksandrov et al. 2001) . Therefore, it is tempting to ask whether the distinct mutational patterns in these important motifs are linked intrinsically to functional differences of the Walker A and Walker B sites within the two NBDs. Elucidation of this question would improve our understanding of the basic physiology of CFTR, as well as that of other ABC transporters.

While discrimination between different cations in certain cation channels is known to occur over a short region of the pore known as the selectivity filter, the existence of a discrete anion selectivity filter in the pores of Cl- channels is controversial (Linsdell, Evagelidis, and Hanrahan 2000) . Nevertheless, based on the above-mentioned evolutionary data, such a selectivity filter in the CFTR, if it indeed exists, would most likely be located in the most highly conserved TM TM6. Not surprisingly, the anion selectivity (Br-  >  Cl-  >  I-) of the CFTR pore was found to be mainly determined by the first half of the protein (Yue, Devidas, and Guggino 2000) , and mutations in several residues in TM6, including K335 (Anderson et al. 1991 ), F337 (Linsdell, Evagelidis, and Hanrahan 2000) , T338 (Linsdell, Zheng, and Hanrahan 1998 ), and R347 (Cheung and Akabas 1997 ), were shown to significantly affect anion selectivity. Moreover, the stringently conserved motif T351-R352-Q353 immediately downstream of TM6 has also been suggested to loop back into the channel, narrowing the lumen and thereby forming both the major resistance to current flow and the anion selectivity filter (Cheung and Akabas 1997 ). Assuming that an anion selectivity filter resides in the vicinity of TM6, it is interesting to note the presence of another highly conserved motif also in this vicinity (Q359-T360-W361-Y362-D363).

To date, most of the missense mutations identified in each ICL and a 19-amino-acid deletion concerning ICL2 have been investigated by functional analysis (reviewed in Sheppard and Welsh 1999 ). These studies strongly indicated that the ICLs were critical for correct protein processing. Among the four ICLs, ICL4 (amino acid Q1035 to amino acid R1102, with a sequence homology as high as 72% across the 15 CFTR species) turns out to be the most conserved subdomain in the entire CFTR sequence. This stringent sequence conservation, coupled with a cluster of missense mutations identified in this subdomain (among which two homozygosities, H1085R [Yoshimura et al. 1999 ] and R1066C [Casals et al. 1997 ], cause a severe CF phenotype), undoubtedly underlies its functional significance within CFTR. While a large fraction of the analyzed ICL4 missense mutations disrupted the biosynthetic processing of CFTR, this was not universally the case. Most importantly, those processed mutants had no discernible effect on the channel's pore properties, but they did alter gating behavior, the response to increasing concentrations of ATP, and stimulation in response to pyrophosphate (Cotten et al. 1996 ; Seibert et al. 1996 ). Thus, ICL4, and probably the other three ICLs, may actively participate in interdomain interactions; for example, they may link the NBDs to MSDs, thereby coupling the activity of NBDs to the gating of the channel..

Not surprisingly, this positive regulatory activity was mapped to a cluster of acidic residues, D47, E51, E54, and D58, within the highly charged and conserved motif D44 to E60 (fig. 2 ). Since no effects of any of the N-tail mutations on steady-state phosphorylation in vitro or in vivo were detected, the N-tail most likely modulates channel activity by controlling access of the phosphorylated R domain to inhibitory or stimulatory sites within the channel (Naren et al. 1999 )..

As illustrated in figure 2 , there are three highly conserved, positively charged motifs (K696-R697-K698, R709-K710, and R764-R765-R766) in this region. Although the conservation of these motifs may be explained by the fact that they potentially participate in phosphorylation of the R domain, the possibility that all, or at least some, of them serve as counterparts to the acidic residues in the N-tail cannot be excluded, particularly if the fact that none of them appear to be phosphyorylated by PKA in vivo is taken into account (Cheng et al. 1991 ). More recently, a relatively small portion of the R domain (residues 760 to 783) that encompasses the stringently conserved motif (R765-R766-Q767-S768-V769-L760) was found to be critical for the prevention of constitutive activity of the CFTR (Baldursson et al. 2001) . This further highlights the functional importance of these motifs when it is considered that they are conserved even within the most evolutionarily divergent R domain sequences. Future studies focusing on these motifs may result in the revelation of further novel molecular mechanisms..

Functional analysis provides important data, but extrapolation to clinical effects may not be straightforward. This can be seen in the conflicting results that often occur in some aspects of CF research, exemplified by the two different models for salt and water transport across epithelia (reviewed by Wine 1999 ), as well as the disparity among results on the intracellular localization of F508del-CFTR (reviewed by Drumm 1999 ).

This can be seen in the conflicting results that often occur in some aspects of CF research, exemplified by the two different models for salt and water transport across epithelia (reviewed by Wine 1999 ), as well as the disparity among results on the intracellular localization of F508del-CFTR (reviewed by Drumm 1999 ). There is ongoing effort to tackle this issue (e.g., the CF European Network: the Second Consensus Meeting Towards Validation of CFTR Gene Expression and Functional Assays, Estoril, March 30 to  April 1, 2001)..
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	63	We believe that a combined analysis of the currently available data can complement this effort and enhance our understanding of the identified mutations, particularly those that are missense. Taking advantage of the previously redefined R domain, a systemic evaluation of the missense mutations occurring in this region was produced, and as a result, some of these mutations, such as F693L, V754M, and T760M, were identified as being likely to represent neutral polymorphisms (Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000) . Similarly, the missense mutations occurring in evolutionarily divergent regions, for example, N418S, G424S, Q890R, and K1177R, may also represent neutral polymorphisms. At the other extreme, for example, the mutations I506M and F508C, which occur in stringently conserved residues in the functionally important NBD1, have also been confirmed to be nonfunctional variants (Kobayashi et al. 1990 ; Kalin, Dork, and Tummler 1992 ; Will et al. 1992 ). The assignment of mutations as in these two extreme cases would raise a serious concern that a certain fraction of the identified missense mutations in classic and atypical CF patients may in fact merely represent polymorphisms rather than mutations associated with the disease. If this assumption is correct, it is not unreasonable to infer that the truly causal mutation event may remain unidentified in a certain fraction of patients in whom the disease has been incorrectly assumed to be caused by identified "missense mutations.".

The large size of the CFTR gene makes it difficult to analyze the entire coding sequence, not to mention the intronic sequence. Consequently, initial identification of one DNA variant may discourage further screening efforts, thereby ignoring a second variant in cis in the gene. Even if the whole CFTR gene were analyzed, certain variants, such as large deletions within the gene (which are being detected at an increasing rate; http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr), are still not readily detected by common mutational screening techniques (Girodon-Boulandet, Cazeneuve, and Goossens 2000) . In addition, the promoter sequence (Romey et al. 1999 ) and the upstream regulatory region (Nuthall et al. 1999 ) of the CFTR gene may be targets for extended mutational screening. Moreover, mutations in other genes in certain CF-like disease subjects should be considered (Mekus et al. 1998 )..

It is even possible that some of them may turn out to be modifiers of another variant in the CFTR gene or even in another gene. An answer to this question will significantly improve our understanding of the disease, as well as that of the protein itself. Nevertheless, this vast number of missense mutations represents an invaluable resource for exploring the subtlety of the CFTR structure-function relationship, and figure 2 could serve as an important complement to ongoing mutation detection and functional analysis efforts in the CF field..

We had previously suggested that the rabbit could be a better CF model than the current murine model, mainly based on (1) anatomical and developmental data, (2) comparison of CFTR promotor sequences and partial coding sequences, and (3) phylogenetic analysis of those sequences (Vuillaumier et al. 1997 ). Although sequence comparisons clearly showed a higher similarity between rabbit and primate sequences than between murine and primate sequences or even between rabbit and murine sequences, the phylogenetic implications were ambiguous..

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	71	A long-branch attraction artifact (Felsenstein 1978 ) of the murine lineage toward the outgroup was suspected (Vuillaumier et al. 1997 ). This classical artifact of phylogenetics concerns all tree reconstruction methods. It occurs when rates of character change vary among lineages, provoking in trees the grouping of lineages sharing close rates, whatever the evolutionary relationships. To solve this ambiguity, additional sequence data (particularly from further species) were required for a successful analysis. When all of the full-length CFTR amino acid sequences were analyzed in this study (fig. 1 ), the murine lineage was the most basal of the placental mammals, a strange result possibly due to a long-branch attraction. Moreover, the position of the rabbit was ambiguous. In the most parsimonious tree (fig. 1 ) and in the neighbor-joining tree from corrected distances (data not shown), the rabbit is a sister group to the bovids + primates clade. In the neighbor-joining tree based on uncorrected distances, the rabbit is the sister group to the primates as in our previous report (Vuillaumier et al. 1997 ). When an extended set of exon 13 to coding sequences including a nonplacental mammal (the kangaroo) and another nonmurid rodent (guinea pig) were analyzed (fig. 3 ), the guinea pig represented a sister group to the rabbit corresponding to the Glires (node E), while the murids were still the most basal of the placental mammals. Assuming that rodents are a monophyletic group (Novacek and Wyss 1986 ; Luckett and Hartenberger 1993 ; Philippe 1997 ), it appears that the murids are artifactually basal in the placental tree, as they should be a sister group to the guinea pig within clade E. Thus, the high level of divergence of the mouse sequence not only makes the mouse an inappropriate model for CF studies, but also provokes a phylogenetic artifact. Unfortunately, the addition of the kangaroo sequence did not correct this artifact, as it was added as a taxon closer to placental mammals than the frog is, in order to break a long branch that could have reduced the possibility of the murid long-branch attraction. Nevertheless, the conclusions from the phylogenetic analysis do not challenge the proposition of the rabbit as a better CF model whose sequence is more closely related to humans (than murine species are). Additionally, the guinea pig appears to be an equally good model candidate..

The most parsimonious tree from the nucleotide sequences encoding CFTR exon 13 using the branch-and-bound search of PAUP* 4.0b4a (Swofford 1999 ). The sequence length is 618 positions, from which 75 positions have been removed because they corresponded to two independent insertions in the teleost sequences, yielding 543 positions, of which 397 were variable and 343 were informative for parsimony. Taking the above inserted/deleted regions into account produces an identical tree. The tree length is 1,134, with a consistency index of 0.665 and a retention index of 0.705. Branch lengths are given using ACCTRAN optimization. Numbers above the nodes are bootstrap proportions obtained from 1,000 replicates. The same tree was recovered with the neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei 1987 ) except for the position of the puffer fish, which is a sister group of the killifish in the neighbor-joining tree. When the exon 13 to encoding amino acids were analyzed (data not shown), sequence variability and phylogenetic information was lost. Consequently, nodes C, D, and E collapsed, preventing any conclusion about the interrelationships of placental mammals from the amino acid data set. The EMBL accession number for the sequence alignment is ALIGN_000079.

The availability of this newly expanded set of CFTR homologs has allowed the most comprehensive cross-species sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis ever to be performed. While the combined analysis of the current mutational, structural, and functional data in conjunction with the above sequence comparison has yielded tantalizing insights into the global CFTR structure-function relationship, the comprehensive phylogenetic analysis reinforces the idea that the rabbit may represent a better CF model than the mouse and strengthens the assertion that a long-branch attraction artifact separates the murine rodents from the rabbit and the guinea pig, the other Glires. Hopefully, the refined boundaries of the two NBDs and the C-tail and the proposed CF model animal will provide a framework for future investigations, and the stringently conserved motifs within CFTR may represent good candidates or targets for identifying sites participating in inter- or intramolecular interactions. Such knowledge will help to further resolve the diversity and complexity of CFTR defects and lead to a better treatment of the disease..

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	3	We investigated adenosine (Ado) activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in vitro and in vivo. A2B Ado receptors were identified in Calu-3, IB-3-1, COS-7, and primary human airway cells. Ado elevated cAMP in Calu-3, IB-3-1, and COS-7 cells and activated protein kinase A-dependent halide efflux in Calu-3 cells. Ado promoted arachidonic acid release from Calu-3 cells, and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibition blocked Ado-activated halide efflux in Calu-3 and COS-7 cells expressing CFTR. Forskolin- and 2-adrenergic receptor-stimulated efflux were not affected by the same treatment. Cytoplasmic PLA2 (cPLA2) was identified in Calu-3, IB-3-1, and COS-7 cells, but cPLA2 inhibition did not affect Ado-stimulated cAMP concentrations. In cftr(+) and cftr(/) mice, Ado stimulated nasal Cl secretion that was CFTR dependent and sensitive to A2 receptor and PLA2 blockade. In COS-7 cells transiently expressing F508 CFTR, Ado activated halide efflux. Ado also activated G551D CFTR-dependent halide efflux when combined with arachidonic acid and phosphodiesterase inhibition. In conclusion, PLA2 and protein kinase A both contribute to A2 receptor activation of CFTR, and components of this signaling pathway can augment wild-type and mutant CFTR activity..

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	7	THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated Cl channel and is responsible for regulating ion transport in many tissues where it is expressed, including the airways and airway submucosal glands, sweat glands, gastrointestinal tract, pancreatic and bile ducts, and the reproductive tract (58, 74). Defective CFTR function disrupts ion transport, which is believed to contribute to the clinical sequelae characteristic of cystic fibrosis (CF) (49, 58, 67, 74). CFTR regulation in vivo is accomplished through ATP binding and hydrolysis at nucleotide binding domain-1 and -2 and regulation of the phosphorylation status of the regulatory domain (10, 11, 36). This process is complex and depends on cAMP production through surface receptors that couple to adenylyl cyclase, cAMP degradation by phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity (40, 41), domain-domain interactions within the CFTR (55), protein-protein interactions between the CFTR and associated regulatory proteins (31, 32, 54, 64), and direct phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the regulatory domain by protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphatases (6, 11), respectively. Receptor-based pathways that signal through cAMP are therefore relatively accessible candidates for promoting activation of the CFTR in vivo. This has been established for 2-adrenergic receptors, which are commonly stimulated in assays to detect CFTR-dependent Cl secretion as measured by changes in the nasal potential difference (PD) in mice and in humans (44)..

In Calu-3 cells, part of this coupling is due to compartmentalized signaling of CFTR with adenylyl cyclase and PKAII through A kinase anchoring protein interactions (34, 71). T84 cells also express A2B-ARs, where they have been shown to mediate neutrophil-stimulated Cl secretion (48, 70). Studies (2-4) have also suggested a role for phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in Ado-activated Cl secretion in T84 cells. The nature of this role and whether similar signaling contributes to CFTR activation in other CFTR-expressing cells and tissues, however, are unknown..

To study polarized Calu-3 cells at an air-liquid interface, polyester Transwell-Clear Costar filters [0.4- microm pore diameter; 6-mm insert diameter for arachidonic acid (AA) release and Ussing chamber experiments and 24-mm insert diameter for immunocytochemistry experiments; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA] were coated with human placental collagen matrix (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at a concentration of 5  microg/cm2 overnight and then seeded at ~1  x  106 cells/cm2. Once the filters were confluent (~1 wk), the medium was removed from the apical surface and the cells were fed only on the basolateral surface. After 48 h, resistance was checked (~1,000-2,000    cm for the 6-mm filters and ~400-600    cm for the 24-mm filters), and at 72-96 h the cells were studied as described in Transepithelial short-circuit currents. The primary human nasal cells were isolated and grown as explant cultures on Vectabond-treated glass coverslips as previously described (15) and were studied  < 1 wk after being seeded..

Cells grown on Vectabond-treated glass coverslips were infected with vaccinia containing the T7 polymerase (generous gift of Dr. B. Moss, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for 30 min. Wild-type (WT), F508, or G551D CFTR under control of the T7 promoter in the pTM-1 vector was then introduced into the cells in complex with N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium (DOTAP)-propane-1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE; 20  microg DOTAP-DOPE and 5  microg pTM-1 CFTR/5  x  105 cells) for 4 h. These CFTR plasmids in the pTM-1 vector were the generous gift of Dr. S. Cheng (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). Cells were then washed in PBS, returned to DMEM plus 10% FBS, and studied 18-24 h postinfection (for WT CFTR and G551D CFTR) or after being grown at 29 degrees C for 48 h (F508 CFTR)..

To study CFTR activation, we measured halide efflux in COS-7 cells transiently expressing WT, F508, or G551D CFTR or in Calu-3 cells with the halide-quenched dye 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium (SPQ; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as previously described (16, 17). Briefly, COS-7 cells were seeded on Vectabond-treated glass coverslips, and Calu-3 cells were seeded on Vectabond-treated coverslips coated with 5  microg/cm2 of human placental extracellular matrix. Cells were grown until ~80% confluent. Immediately before study, the cells were hypotonically loaded with 10 mM SPQ for 10 min and placed in a quenching NaI buffer. The cells were then placed in a specially designed perfusion chamber and studied at 23 degrees C. The fluorescence of individual cells was measured with a Zeiss inverted microscope (excitation 340 nm, emission  > 410 nm), a PTI imaging system, and a Hamamatsu camera. Baseline fluorescence was measured in isotonic NaI buffer (16, 17), and cells were then perfused with isotonic dequench buffer (NaNO3 replaced NaI) at the indicated time point (generally 200 s). The perfusate was then switched to dequench buffer plus agonist and requenched at the end of the experiment. Fluorescence was normalized for each cell to its baseline value, and increases are shown as percent increase in fluorescence above basal (quenched) fluorescence. Unless otherwise specified, the means  plus or minus  SE of all cells were included in the curves shown..

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	18	Protein detection. To detect the A2B-AR, cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-Cl, and 10 mg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0). For the COS-7 cells, lysates were immunoprecipitated with an isoform-specific polyclonal rabbit anti-A2B-AR-antibody (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX) raised against a 16-amino acid sequence corresponding to the third extracellular domain of human brain A2B-AR cDNA as previously described (17). Briefly, anti-A2B-AR antibody was linked to protein A agarose beads and incubated with cell lysates for 2 h. Precleared cell lysates (beads without primary antibody) were used as the negative control. The beads were then washed three times with PBS plus 0.1% Tween, and the immunoprecipitates were released with sample buffer incubated at 37 degrees C for 10 min. For the Calu-3 and IB-3-1 cells, lysates were Western blotted without immunoprecipitation. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE with precast 12% gels (Novex gels; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and electrophoretically blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were then blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min, washed three times with PBS plus 0.1% Tween, and probed with anti-A2B-AR antibody (1:1,000 dilution) for 2 h. Negative control membranes were blotted with a fivefold excess (by weight) of A2B-AR-specific neutralizing peptide that was added with the primary antibody (Alpha Diagnostics). The membranes were washed three times and incubated with secondary antibody (1:1,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase; Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) for 2 h. Membranes were washed three times and developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) and 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) in carbonate buffer (pH 9.8). Similar techniques were used to identify cPLA2 in cell lysates using an affinity-purified mouse monoclonal IgG2b antibody raised against the amino-terminal domain of the human cPLA2 cDNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). This antibody was used to identify cPLA2 protein in cell lysate immunoprecipitates (Calu-3 and IB-3-1 cells; anti-cPLA2 linked to precleared protein G beads; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) or cell lysates alone (COS-7 cells). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE with 8% precast gels, and after being blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, the membranes were blocked and washed as above and probed with primary antibody (1:1,000). The secondary antibody was a goat anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:1,000 dilution; Southern Biotechnology Associates), and blots were developed with NBT-BCIP as above..
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	19	Immunofluorescence studies. Nasal explant cultures from human surgical specimens were grown on Vectabond-treated coverslips coated with 5  microg/cm2 of human placental extracellular matrix as previously described (15). At 5 days of age, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS (20 min; pH 7.4), washed twice with PBS, and then permeabilized with 0.05% surfactant Triton X-100 (Pierce Endogen, Rockford, IL). The slides were then pretreated with 1% BSA in PBS to block nonspecific protein-binding sites. A2B-AR antigen was detected with the polyclonal rabbit anti-A2B-AR antibody (1:25 dilution) in 1% BSA for 1 h. Cells were then washed three times with PBS over 15 min and incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit FITC conjugate, 1:100 dilution in 1% BSA) for 1 h. The cells were mounted with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole Vectashield mounting fluid (Vector Laboratories). For the studies of A2B-AR localization in polarized Calu-3 cells, the A2B-AR antigen was identified with the filter fold technique as previously described (7). Briefly, high-resistance monolayers were fixed with 3% transmission electron microscopy-grade formaldehyde (Touismis, Rockville, MD) for 45 min at room temperature and stained without detergent permeabilization. The fixed monolayers were washed three times with PBS over 15 min, blocked with nonimmune goat serum for 30 min (1:25 dilution; Vector Laboratories), and incubated with primary rabbit anti-A2B-AR antibody (1:100 dilution in nonimmune goat serum) for 1 h at room temperature. Neutralizing peptide at five times (by weight) the concentration of primary antibody was used for negative control filters. Goat anti-rabbit Alexa fluorochromes (1:80 dilution; Molecular Probes) were used to identify the primary antibody. Nuclei were identified with Hoechst 33258 staining (20  microg/ml for 4 min). The filters were folded with the apical side exposed and mounted in 0.1% p-phenylenediamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in PBS-glycerol (1:9 dilution). Digital confocal images were captured and analyzed with an Olympus IX70 inverted reflective fluorescent light microscope at 623 nm excitation with UplanAPO  x 100 or U-APO/340  x 40 objectives, a Photometric Sensys digital camera, and IPLab Spectrum software supplemented with Power Microtome extension software (Signalytics, Fairfax, VA)..

Calu-3 cells grown as monolayers at an air-liquid interface were mounted in modified Ussing chambers (Jim's Instruments, Iowa City, IA) and initially bathed on both sides with identical Ringer solutions containing (in mM) 115 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 2.4 KH2PO4, 1.24 K2HPO4, 1.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, and 10 D-glucose (pH 7.4). Bath solutions were vigorously stirred and gassed with 5% CO2. Solutions and chambers were maintained at 37 degrees C. Short-circuit current (Isc) measurements were obtained with an epithelial voltage clamp (University of Iowa Bioengineering, Iowa City, IA). A 3-mV pulse of 1 s duration was imposed every 100 s to monitor resistance, which was calculated with Ohm's law. To measure stimulated Isc, the mucosal bathing solution was changed to a low Cl solution containing (in mM) 1.2 NaCl, 115 sodium gluconate, and all other components as above plus 100  microM amiloride. Increasing concentrations of Ado were added to the mucosal or serosal bathing solutions (8 min of observation at each Ado concentration). After cells were stimulated with 100  microM Ado, 200  microM glibenclamide was added to the mucosal bathing solution, effectively blocking the stimulated Isc ( > 90%)..

The cftr(/) mice carried two copies of the human cftr cDNA, which contains a stop codon at position 489 (S489X). Cftr(+) mice included cftr(+/+) and cftr(+/) mice, which have been shown to have similar nasal ion transport characteristics (42). Genotypes were verified by PCR and dental enamel characteristics. Both male and female mice ~16-40 wk of age were studied. Mice were anesthetized with a cocktail consisting of ketamine (100 mg/ml, 82.5  microl), acepromazine (10 mg/ml, 30  microl), and xylazine (100 mg/ml, 15  microl) administered by intraperitoneal injection (0.1 ml/g body wt). The mouse tail was gently abraded, placed in lactated Ringer solution, and connected through a calomel cell to a high-impedance voltage follower (VF-1; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). An exploring bridge was established by connecting a Ag-AgCl electrode (wire) bridge to a syringe that pumped solutions at a rate of 180  microl/h. After ~5 min, mice were appropriately somnolent to permit cannulation of the nostril with a PE-10 cannula pulled to a tip diameter of ~0.15 mm. The solutions perfused included Ringer lactate plus amiloride (100  microM; solution 1); a low Cl concentration ([Cl]) solution containing 2.4 mM K2HPO4, 0.4 mM KH2PO4, 115 mM sodium gluconate, 25 mM NaHCO3, 1.24 mM calcium gluconate2, and 100  microM amiloride (solution 2); and solution 3 (solution 2 plus agonist as described in text). Each superperfused condition was studied for 6 min (total of ~18 min per protocol per mouse)..

Calu-3 cells, grown to confluence on 35-mm culture dishes coated with 5  microg/ml of human placental collagen or as high-resistance monolayers at an air-liquid interface were washed in PBS and loaded with 1  microCi/ml of [3H]AA overnight (Moravek Biochemical, La Brea, CA). The plates and filters were then washed five times with PBS and placed in MEM plus 10% FBS with and without 100  microM Ado (750- microl volume for the 35-mm plates; 150- microl apical volume and 300- microl basolateral volume for the cells on filters). AA release was quantified for 20 min (cells on plates) and for 20 and 40 min (cells on filters). The cells were lysed (1 N NaOH), and the effluxed AA from each plate was quantified by scintillation counting and normalized to the percent of total number of counts in a manner similar to that previously described (13)..

Briefly, cells grown on 35-mm dishes (~7  x  106 cells/dish) were stimulated with agonist for 10 min, and the cellular cAMP was extracted with ice-cold ethanol. The supernatants were vacuum dried and resuspended in phosphate buffer, and the cAMP levels were quantified per the manufacturer's directions. For all experiments, papaverine (100  microM; nonspecific nonxanthine PDE inhibitor) was included to improve cAMP detection. Xanthine-based inhibitors were avoided because these commonly interact with Ado receptors (39)..

With a polyclonal anti-A2B-AR antibody, Calu-3 and IB-3-1 cell lysates were probed for A2B receptor expression through Western blotting. As a positive control, COS-7 cells, which our laboratory previously demonstrated to endogenously express A2B-ARs (17), were also evaluated. Figure 1 shows that in all three cell types, a specific ~40-kDa band was identified. Using the same anti-A2B-AR antibody, we investigated A2B receptor localization in primary human nasal airway cells (Fig. 2A) and polarized Calu-3 cells (an airway cell line with a serous phenotype and high levels of CFTR expression; Fig. 2B) (37, 53). In both cell types, the antibody detected plasma membrane-localized A2B-AR. Staining was predominantly along the apical surface in Calu-3 cells. Functional studies in Ussing chambers demonstrated that Ado added to either the apical or basolateral surface briskly activated Isc (Fig. 2C, left). Ado was a more potent stimulus when added to the apical membrane than to the basolateral membrane, and Isc stimulated from either membrane was sensitive to apical glibenclamide blockade (~90% inhibition of stimulated Isc produced by 100  microM Ado; P  <  0.05). Although the range of concentrations capable of activating Isc was most consistent with A2 receptor stimulation, these experiments do not exclude the possibility that additional AR subtypes may contribute to Ado-stimulated Isc. Because HCO transport, in addition to Cl transport, may contribute to Isc in Calu-3 monolayers (22, 66), further functional studies of CFTR activity were performed with an SPQ-based halide efflux assay (15-17)..

In previous studies of CFTR regulation by A2B receptors in COS-7 cells, our laboratory (17) showed that A2B receptor signaling was a potent stimulus, accomplishing strong activation of CFTR despite only modest effects on cellular [cAMP] compared with forskolin. These results were similar to those reported by Barrett and colleagues (3, 4) in T84 cells. In subsequent studies by Barrett and Bigby (2), Ado-activated Isc in T84 monolayers was found to be associated with AA mobilization and sensitivity to PLA2 inhibition. To determine whether PLA2 signaling might contribute to A2 receptor activation of CFTR in airway and COS-7 cells, we evaluated cells for cPLA2 expression and cPLA2 activity after Ado stimulation.

To determine whether Ado activated PLA2 and stimulated the release of AA in airway cells that express both A2B receptors and CFTR, Calu-3 cells were grown on plastic and on permeable supports at an air-liquid interface, loaded with [3H]AA, and exposed to Ado (100  microM; Fig. 4). Ado stimulated AA release from Calu-3 cells grown in either condition. AA release is expressed as percent of counts released (basolateral or apical) over total counts; P  0.025 (Fig. 4, A and B). AA was released preferentially from the apical compartment, but a detectable amount (approximately [1/10] of apical release) was released from the basolateral surface (Fig. 4C). Studies of the effects of cPLA2 inhibition (with CPZ) or PKA inhibition (with H-89 Cl) on Ado-stimulated AA release were complicated by a mild (approximately twofold) increase in nonspecific AA release from Calu-3 cells after treatment with either inhibitor.

Ado alone activated halide efflux at 2  microM but not at 0.2  microM, consistent with signaling through lower-affinity A2 receptors rather than A1 receptors (Fig. 5A). Treatment of cells with the PLA2 inhibitor CPZ (50  microM) blocked Ado-activated efflux. In contrast, addition of the PLA2 product AA (25  microM) augmented the Ado stimulus, shifting activation of halide efflux to 0.2  microM. AA alone (25 and 100  microM), however, failed to activate halide efflux in CFTR-expressing COS-7 cells. These results suggest that cPLA2 signaling is part of the pathway by which A2 receptors activate CFTR in this model system. The cPLA2 product AA when used alone, however, was insufficient and unable to substitute for Ado. The results therefore suggest that for A2 receptors to activate CFTR, additional signaling pathways need to be stimulated. In control experiments (Fig. 5B), forskolin-activated halide efflux in COS-7 cells (+ CFTR) was not inhibited by CPZ..

High concentrations of Ado (100  microM) were able to partially overcome the CPZ blockade (Fig. 5E). The Ado response was also blocked by the PKA inhibitor H-89 Cl (5  microM), indicating that Ado also utilizes adenylyl cyclase and cAMP to activate halide efflux. In control experiments, 2-receptor activation of halide efflux with Alb was sensitive to H-89 Cl but not to cPLA2 inhibition with CPZ (Fig. 5D). These results are consistent with those in the COS-7 cells and indicate that distinct differences exist in the mechanisms by which A2 receptors and 2-receptors activate CFTR and halide transport in these in vitro systems..

A series of PDE inhibitors was also evaluated because previous reports (62, 63, 77) suggested that surface-localized mutant CFTRs might be partially responsive to stimulation with certain PDE inhibitors. Isotype-specific inhibitors (rolipram, PDE-4 specific; milrinone, PDE-3 specific; and zaprinast, PDE-5 and -6 specific) were used at concentrations ~20-fold above the inhibitor constant of their respective PDEs (72). Two nonspecific PDE inhibitors (papaverine and theophylline) were studied at 200  microM. PDE inhibitors such as milrinone have been evaluated in clinical trials for their ability to activate Cl conductance in normal subjects and in CF patients carrying the G551D CFTR mutation (68). At the concentrations used, none of the PDE inhibitors alone consistently elevated cAMP in COS-7 cells (10-min exposure; data not shown), and none of the stimuli (including Ado) activated G551D CFTR-specific halide efflux (Fig. 11A). WT CFTR-expressing cells stimulated with forskolin are shown for comparison. In Fig. 11B, G551D CFTR-expressing COS-7 cells were exposed to combinations of Ado (200  microM), AA (100  microM), and PDE inhibitors.

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	62	In this report, we investigated the cellular pathways utilized by Ado to activate CFTR-dependent ion transport. Using a series of experimental systems, including single cells, polarized cell monolayers, and in vivo measurements in cftr(+) and cftr(/) mice, we demonstrated that Ado, through A2-ARs, activates CFTR-dependent halide transport. These receptors are expressed in human airway cells and signal in part through cAMP and PKA. We also demonstrated the dependence of this signaling pathway on PLA2 activity in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we showed that the two most common disease-associated CFTR mutations can be activated by A2B receptors alone (F508 CFTR) or by using messenger pathways stimulated by A2B receptors (G551D CFTR). These results help to establish the physiological role of Ado-stimulated Cl secretion in vivo and may identify new targets for improving the function of mutant CFTR molecules..

Using a series of experimental systems, including single cells, polarized cell monolayers, and in vivo measurements in cftr(+) and cftr(/) mice, we demonstrated that Ado, through A2-ARs, activates CFTR-dependent halide transport.

Our results, together with those of other investigators, indicate an important role for Ado as a regulator of CFTR. Ado and A2 receptors are potent activators of Cl secretion in primary human airway cell monolayers, in addition to canine and gerbil airway cells and T84 intestinal cells (28, 46, 59, 70). In each of these systems, Cl secretion has been accomplished in the setting of low cAMP levels. Part of this high efficiency is due to compartmentalization of A2B receptors, transduction proteins, and CFTR (34, 71). Our results suggest that in addition to spatial compartmentalization, efficient transduction between A2 receptors and CFTR involves cPLA2 activation and AA signaling. A2 receptors, including A2A and A2B subtypes, classically signal through stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, cAMP, and, ultimately, PKA (56). Although A2A receptors appear to hold more strictly to this observation, A2B receptors have been shown to stimulate additional signaling pathways such as phospholipase C, direct regulation of calcium channels, and, in our experience, PLA2 (26). These observations are of particular interest because recent studies (27) have demonstrated abnormal lipid profiles, including elevated AA levels, in murine CF tissues. Our findings demonstrate that lipid signaling may be important to the regulation of CFTR activity by Ado in vitro and in vivo. The present results therefore set the stage for future studies designed to test the relationship between membrane lipid composition, A2 receptors, and CFTR activity..

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	66	There are two general classes of PLA2 enzymes: cPLA2 (three subtypes) and secretory PLA2 (seven subtypes) (33). Both are expressed in many tissues including the lung and leukocytes. cPLA2 translocates to cell membranes after activation and primarily releases AA from membrane lipids. cPLA2 has been shown to play an important immunologic role in human airway epithelial cells, governing AA release from epithelia after immunostimulation (76). Studies (50) have also observed dysregulation of PLA2 in the CF airway, with increased AA release seen after bradykinin exposure in F508 CFTR-expressing airway cells compared with normal control cells. AA is the parent molecule of two important inflammatory signaling cascades including 1) the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, which leads to the production of prostanoids and thromboxanes and 2) the lipoxygenase pathway in which AA is metabolized to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and the leukotrienes A4-E4. Clinical studies suggest that products of AA metabolism, including proinflammatory species, have direct relevance to CF-related inflammation. The COX-1 inhibitor ibuprofen is routinely used in the pediatric CF population to reduce lung inflammation and slow the progression of CF lung disease (45). Glucocorticoids, which suppress COX-2 expression, have also been studied in CF clinical trials, attenuating the decline in pulmonary function in pediatric CF patients (25). The relevance of AA signaling pathways to CFTR activity and ion transport, however, has not been previously demonstrated. Our results suggest that a buildup in AA may have beneficial effects on CFTR activity in the context of its activation by surface receptors..

CFTR activation by A2 receptors could be blocked by either PKA or cPLA2 inhibition (Fig. 5). Production of cAMP was not reduced by PLA2 inhibition in any of the three cell lines (Fig. 6). Although 10 min of high-dose (100  microM) AA exposure could stimulate some cAMP production in the two airway cell lines (primarily Calu-3 cells, likely through the actions of distal metabolites such as PGI, PGE2, PGF2 or PGD) (73), it failed to augment cAMP production by Ado or acutely activate CFTR when used alone (COS-7 or Calu-3 cells; Fig. 5). These results suggest that the additional effects of AA on CFTR-dependent halide transport were not through influences on total cellular cAMP. Rather, A2 receptors appear to activate both adenylyl cyclase and cPLA2 in parallel, with each signaling pathway contributing to the maximization of CFTR activity. PLA2 signaling was not necessary to activate CFTR through receptors, however, because 2-adrenergic stimulation activated CFTR-dependent Cl transport in vitro and in vivo despite cPLA2 inhibition (Figs. 5 and 9)..

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	70	Figure 12 is a summary model that provides three possible mechanisms by which cPLA2 and AA could contribute to A2 receptor activation of CFTR. It is possible that Ado and/or AA exerts its effects in part by activating K+ channels and increasing the driving force for halide efflux. AA has been shown to have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on epithelial K+ channels, and modulation of basolateral K+ channel activity can strongly influence transepithelial Cl transport (20, 21). In related experiments, Ado-activated halide efflux in CFTR-expressing COS-7 cells was not reduced by two K+ channel blockers, including barium and tetraethylammonium (10 mM each) (18, 19). These results suggest that the stimulatory effects of Ado on CFTR seen in our studies were independent of K+ channel activation. The observation that AA augmented the stimulation of CFTR by Ado and forskolin (Figs. 5 and 11), but failed to stimulate CFTR alone in vitro (Fig. 5), suggests that AA may exert a permissive effect on CFTR activation. Membrane-derived fatty acids, including AA and its metabolites, have been demonstrated to interact with ion channels and influence their activation by other signaling molecules, including nucleotide sensitivity of ATP-activated K+ channels (5, 65), light-sensitive transient receptor potential, and transient receptor potential-like channels (14), small Cl channels in rabbit parietal cells (61), the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (9), and calcium channels as part of oscillating calcium currents (51). AA does interact with CFTR and alter its Cl channel activity. Cytoplasmic AA produces a flickery block of CFTR in inside-out membrane patches after heterologous expression (1, 35, 47). Membrane lipids (including AA) can have differential effects on the function of other channels, stimulating channel activity on one surface and inhibiting channel activity on the other (52). We speculate that AA or one of its metabolites may interact with an external portion of the channel or with an unidentified regulatory factor that secondarily influences CFTR Cl channel function. Alternatively, products of AA metabolism could accelerate local cAMP production and, in this way, increase CFTR channel activity. This process would be difficult to detect with total cellular assays to quantitate [cAMP]. The effect would need to be quite dramatic, however, because G551D CFTR, which has previously been shown to be poorly responsive to powerful phosphorylating stimuli, appears to be activated by costimulation with AA (Fig. 11B, Refs. 38, 58, and 77). This occurs despite no detectable change in [cAMP] when combined with Ado (Fig. 6A) but is most pronounced when combined with PDE inhibition. Single-channel-based studies will be necessary to help clarify the mechanism by which cPLA2 and AA promote CFTR activity. Finally, our results do not exclude the possibility that additional processes may be involved because CPZ has been shown to have effects on other cell signaling pathways in addition to PLA2 (8, 12, 23, 43, 57)..

Ado stimulates A2 adenosine receptors (A2-AR), which activate cPLA2 and adenylyl cyclase. AA or products of AA metabolism, when combined with cAMP, helped maximize CFTR transport of Cl. The mechanism could involve effects on the electrochemical driving force for ion transport through CFTR (i.e., activation of K+ channels) through direct effects of lipid species with CFTR or associated factors (direct effects) or possibly by increasing the rate of cAMP production in the vicinity of CFTR (accelerated cAMP production).

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	73	The results shown in Figs. 7-9 indicate that Ado is a potent Cl secretagogue in vivo, activating CFTR-dependent Cl transport across the murine nasal mucosa more predictably than Iso (when studied at 100  microM). This is of relevance to human nasal PD protocols, which typically use 2-receptor stimulation with Iso to aid in the detection of CFTR-dependent Cl transport. Our results suggest that comparisons of these two receptor pathways in human subjects may improve the sensitivity of the nasal PD, which could have implications for clinical studies that use this assay to measure low-level CFTR function. The importance of PLA2 signaling to Ado activation of Cl transport was also demonstrated in vivo because Ado- but not Alb-stimulated Cl conductance was sensitive to PLA2 inhibition..
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	74	A2 receptor signaling may also be useful in improving the activity of disease-related CFTR mutations. Using an in vitro system, we have demonstrated that CFTR mutations from three subclasses (classes II, III, and IV) can be activated by A2B receptors (17) (Figs. 10 and 11). Although the expression levels of the mutant CFTRs were far higher than those found in vivo, the results shown in Figs. 10 and 11 support the notion that mutant CFTRs, when localized to the cell membrane, can be activated by endogenous receptor-based signaling pathways. Current approaches to increase mutant CFTR activity, including improvement of CFTR biosynthesis [e.g., suppression of premature stop mutations with aminoglycoside antibiotics (7, 15, 75)], increase in trafficking of F508 CFTR to the cell membrane [e.g., treatment with butyrate compounds (60)], or treatment of surface mutant CFTRs with activating compounds [e.g., genistein or PDE inhibitors (38, 68)] may be complemented by the use of A2 receptor signaling pathways. Our findings also suggest that common mutant CFTRs should be at least partially responsive to this signaling pathway when available at the cell membrane..

Under conditions predicted to stabilize protein folding, F508 CFTR is capable of trafficking to the plasma membrane and retains cAMP-regulated anion channel activity. Overexpression is one factor that increases CFTR trafficking; therefore, we hypothesized that expression of a domain mimic of the first nucleotide-binding fold (NBF1) of CFTR, i.e., the site of F508, may be sufficient to overwhelm the quality control process or otherwise stabilize F508 CFTR and thereby restore cAMP-stimulated anion secretion. In epithelial cells expressing recombinant F508 human (h)CFTR, expression of wild-type NBF1 increased the amount of both core-glycosylated and mature protein to a greater extent than expression of F508 NBF1. Expression of wild-type NBF1 in the F508 hCFTR cells increased whole cell Cl to  current density to 50% of that in cells expressing wild-type hCFTR. Expression of NBF1 in polarized epithelial monolayers from a F508/F508 cystic fibrosis mouse (MGEF) restored cAMP-stimulated transepithelial anion secretion but not in monolayers from a CFTR-null mouse (MGEN). Restoration of anion secretion was sustained in NBF1-expressing MGEF for  > 30 passages, whereas MGEN corrected with hCFTR progressively lost anion secretion capability. We conclude that expression of a NBF1 domain mimic may be useful for correction of the F508 CFTR protein trafficking defect in cystic fibrosis epithelia..

0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	6	THE MAJOR DISEASE-CAUSING mutation of the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508) in the predicted cytoplasmic domain known as the first nucleotide binding fold (NBF1). Approximately 70% of CF patients are homozygous for the F508 cftr, and  > 90% carry at least one F508 cftr allele (compound heterozygotes) (11). Nascent wild-type human (h)CFTR is translated and core-glycosylated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A fraction of the core-glycosylated hCFTR protein (25 to 40%; Refs. 36 and 48) is transported to the Golgi apparatus, where glycosylation is further modified to form mature hCFTR that is targeted to the plasma membrane (5). There, the wild-type hCFTR functions as a cyclic nucleotide-regulated anion channel and serves a number of transport functions, including regulation of other ion transport proteins and membrane recycling phenomena (2, 8). In contrast to wild-type hCFTR, nearly all of F508 hCFTR is retained in the ER in its core-glycosylated form and sorted to the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation pathway instead of the Golgi apparatus (5, 25). It is believed that improper folding of the mutant protein is recognized by proteins comprising a cellular "quality control" mechanism that retains misfolded proteins for degradation (44). Chaperone proteins are also involved in the processing of hCFTR and at least two proteins, HSP70 and calnexin, bind F508 hCFTR with greater avidity than wild-type hCFTR (39). The process of recognition by the quality control machinery and the conformation of the misfolded F508 hCFTR have not been elucidated. In epithelia homozygous for the F508 mutation, retention and degradation of the mutant hCFTR essentially eliminates the capacity for cyclic nucleotide-regulated anion secretion, and it is believed that this deficit is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the disease (38)..

There, the wild-type hCFTR functions as a cyclic nucleotide-regulated anion channel and serves a number of transport functions, including regulation of other ion transport proteins and membrane recycling phenomena (2, 8). In contrast to wild-type hCFTR, nearly all of F508 hCFTR is retained in the ER in its core-glycosylated form and sorted to the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation pathway instead of the Golgi apparatus (5, 25). It is believed that improper folding of the mutant protein is recognized by proteins comprising a cellular "quality control" mechanism that retains misfolded proteins for degradation (44). Chaperone proteins are also involved in the processing of hCFTR and at least two proteins, HSP70 and calnexin, bind F508 hCFTR with greater avidity than wild-type hCFTR (39). The process of recognition by the quality control machinery and the conformation of the misfolded F508 hCFTR have not been elucidated. In epithelia homozygous for the F508 mutation, retention and degradation of the mutant hCFTR essentially eliminates the capacity for cyclic nucleotide-regulated anion secretion, and it is believed that this deficit is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the disease (38)..

Studies in cells expressing recombinant F508 hCFTR and tissues cultured from transgenic F508 murine (m)CFTR mice have shown that a fraction of the mutant protein undergoes biosynthetic maturation when cells are grown at subphysiological temperatures (26 degrees C) (13). Studies in which F508 hCFTR-expressing cells were treated with "chemical chaperones" such as glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or organic cellular osmolytes such as myo-inositol and betaine have also found increased maturation of F508 hCFTR, a result that was attributed to stabilization of the mutant protein (1, 3, 22, 52). Overexpression of the mutant protein either by transfection or by treatment with butyrate results in trafficking of F508 hCFTR to the plasma membrane (4, 40). The above observations have important therapeutic implications because F508 hCFTR in the plasma membrane retains its capacity as a cyclic nucleotide-regulated anion channel (13). Studies in cell-free systems indicate that stimulated F508 hCFTR may have channel kinetics similar to wild-type hCFTR (23, 31, 42), whereas on-cell patch studies measure reduced channel kinetic activity compared with wild-type hCFTR (12, 20, 24). Even if F508 CFTR has reduced function and shorter membrane residence (32), previous studies suggest that only a small amount (10 to 15%) of F508 CFTR activity in the membrane is required to restore epithelial function and moderate disease (15, 26). Combined with recent pharmacological studies showing that F508 hCFTR channel activity can be significantly enhanced by treatment with compounds such as 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (CPX), genistein, or class III phosphodiesterase inhibitors (28), it is clear that correcting F508 hCFTR trafficking is a viable strategy for treating CF..

0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	10	Recent studies have shown that expression of polypeptides representing the structural domain of a protein (i.e., "domain mimics") can predictably alter posttranslational processing of the protein. Expression of a minigene encoding the carboxy terminus of human ether-a-go-go-related gene was shown to rescue a carboxy-terminal truncation mutant from misprocessing (29). In another study, a 6-mer peptide mimic of the reactive center loop of 1-antitrypsin was used to block pathological polymerization of the Z variant mutation of the protein (35). With regard to CFTR, expression of a polypeptide representing the NBF1 plus the regulatory "R" domain of hCFTR was shown to inhibit activity of ENaC, the epithelial Na+ channel reputedly regulated by CFTR (45). Because the NBF1 domain of hCFTR is the location of F508 as well as several other processing mutants (46), the NBF1 domain itself may serve as a "checkpoint" for recognition by the cellular quality control machinery or, alternatively, may function in a critical intramolecular interaction that stabilizes hCFTR structure within the ER. Therefore, we hypothesized that expression of the NBF1 domain may be sufficient to increase F508 CFTR activity in epithelial cells. The NBF1 domain of CFTR is well conserved among mammalian species (17), and in the mouse, deletion of F508 results in a mCFTR processing defect that recapitulates the fundamental cellular defect of F508 homozygous CF patients (16, 50). In the present study, both heterologous cell systems expressing recombinant F508 hCFTR and epithelial monolayers from a F508 CFTR homozygous mouse were used to test the hypothesis that expression of a NBF1 domain mimic increases trafficking F508 CFTR and restores cAMP-stimulated anion secretion..

After an extensive search, we were unable to identify a human F508/F508 CFTR epithelial cell line that retained the ability to both form polarized epithelial monolayers and express significant levels of the endogenous F508 hCFTR protein for the retroviral transfection studies. Because previous studies demonstrated that defects in processing and plasma membrane expression of the F508 mCFTR homolog in murine epithelia recapitulate the defects of F508 hCFTR (16), an epithelial cell line (MGEF) developed by transformation of gallbladder epithelia from a F508/F508 CFTR mutant mouse model was transfected with the NBF1 domain mimic (50)..

Subsequent treatment of the monolayer with the CFTR channel blocker NPPB inhibited both the cAMP-stimulated Isc and a large fraction of the basal Isc. Although the ionic basis of the residual Isc was not investigated, previous studies indicate the presence of a Ca2+-activated anion channel in the apical membrane of the MGE epithelial cells (9). As a negative control, the mCFTR-null cell line MGEN, developed by transformation of gallbladder epithelium from a CFTR knockout mouse, was also transfected with the NBF1 construct for comparison with the NBF1-expressing MGEF cells.

However, in contrast to cAMP-induced Isc responses in the NBF1-expressing MGEF cells, expression of the NBF1 domain mimic in the MGEN cells did not restore the Isc response to cAMP stimulation (see cumulative data in Fig. 2B).

0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	31	  Because the cAMP-stimulated Isc in the NBF1-expressing F508 homozygous MGEF monolayers could result from either electrogenic cation (Na+) absorption or electrogenic anion (Cl to  + HCO3 to ) secretion, ion substitution studies were used to investigate the ionic basis of the cAMP-stimulated Isc in the NBF1-expressing MGEF cell line. As shown in Fig. 2C, substitution of Na+ with the impermeant cation TMA+ in the mucosal bath did not significantly affect the cAMP-stimulated Isc response compared with the response in standard KBR solution. Subsequent addition of 10  microM amiloride to the mucosal solution of NBF1-expressing MGEF cells bathed in the standard KBR solution also did not affect the magnitude of the cAMP-stimulated Isc [change in ()Isc =  to 0.1  plus or minus  0.3  microA/cm2; n = 3]. These findings indicated that the cAMP-induced Isc response in the transduced cell line was not due to electrogenic Na+ absorption. In contrast, when both Cl to  and HCO3 to  were substituted with impermeant anions in the mucosal and serosal bathing solutions, the cAMP-stimulated Isc of the NBF1-expressing MGEF cell monolayers was nearly eliminated. Together with the evidence that the cAMP-stimulated Isc response in the NBF1-expressing MGEF cells is sensitive to NPPB (see Fig. 2A), the findings are consistent with the conclusion that the stimulated Isc represents F508 CFTR-mediated anion secretion..

In studies of F508 hCFTR cells expressing NBF1, genistein-forskolin treatment increased whole cell Cl to  currents to 50% of those exhibited by C127 cells stably expressing wild-type CFTR. This difference, whether due to reduced open probability or to numbers of membrane channels, is similar to that observed when F508 hCFTR cells are exposed to reduced ambient temperature or after increased expression of the mutant CFTR (4, 13, 16, 40). In studies of the polarized MGEF monolayers expressing NBF1, the macroscopic Isc response to forskolin treatment activated at a slower rate compared with MGEN cells expressing wild-type hCFTR (data not shown), which might reflect a characteristic of the F508 CFTR protein that attenuates its protein kinase A phosphorylation-dependent activation (47). However, in contrast to the C127 cells, the absolute magnitude of the cAMP-induced Isc in the NBF1-expressing MGEF monolayers was approximately the same as in the MGEN monolayers expressing recombinant hCFTR. This variance may reflect differences in the activities of the recombinant vs. the endogenous CFTR channel or result from inherent differences in F508 CFTR properties between the two species (30). Interestingly, the basal Isc of the NBF1-expressing MGEF and MGEN cells was elevated compared with the Zeocin-expressing control monolayers. This change is consistent with previous demonstrations that expression of NBF1 yields a transmembrane configuration of the peptide and an increase in the basal halide permeability in mammalian cell lines (7, 19). However, similar to our findings with the NBF1-expressing MGEN cells, expression of only the NBF1 domain did not result in cAMP-regulated anion permeability.

More recently, a domain mimic expressed via a minigene was used to rescue misprocessing of a carboxy-terminal truncation mutant of human ether-a-go-go-related protein (29) and a domain peptide was used to selectively mask portions of mutant 1-antitrypsin to prevent posttranslational polymerization within hepatocytes (35). With regard to CFTR, exogenous copies of the R domain have been shown to interact with full-length CFTR and modify gating behavior of its channel activity (34). Domain mimics of CFTR and the integral membrane protein syntaxin 1A were used to modify channel activity and demonstrate a direct protein-protein interaction (37).

0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	41	Given the findings of the present study and previous observations with expression of recombinant F508 CFTR (4, 40), at least two mechanisms can be postulated that would result in increased processing of F508 CFTR beyond the ER. First, expression of recombinant NBF1 may overwhelm the quality control system that is involved in retention and degradation of the mutant protein. A similar process could be postulated for the plasma membrane appearance of F508 hCFTR when the mutant protein is overexpressed in heterologous cell systems (4, 40). This mechanism would predict competitive binding for, perhaps specific, chaperone proteins or proteases, thereby allowing escape of mutant protein from the ER. However, some evidence weakens the case for this proposed mechanism. Our measures of protein expression in the C127 cells indicated that clones expressing wild-type NBF1 were more likely to have greater expression of the fully processed F508 CFTR compared with clones expressing the F508 NBF1 peptide (Fig. 1). This seems contrary to the prediction that F508 NBF1 would be more efficacious in competing for quality control proteins. Furthermore, although it is possible that the concentration of the recombinant NBF1 at the quality control binding site(s) far exceeds that needed to discern differences between the two domain mimics, our estimates of NBF1 peptide concentration ( < 5 ng/ microl in cell pellets, as based on detection of the flag epitope with M2 monoclonal antibody) are well below the millimolar concentrations that are typically necessary to inhibit proteases with chemical inhibitors (25, 49). The second potential mechanism by which NBF1 expression may lead to increased processing of F508 CFTR is that coexpression of additional NBF1 peptides may bind immature F508 CFTR and stabilize its structure in the ER. For example, peptide interaction with the R domain of F508 CFTR may mask a site on the misfolded protein that is recognized by the quality control machinery, or additional copies of NBF1 may temporarily interact with F508 CFTR to catalyze a folding reaction that results in properly folded protein. Given recent evidence that mature CFTR protein may dimerize in the plasma membrane (51), it seems plausible that cooperation between different CFTR monomers may be necessary for correct folding and that this interaction may be mimicked by the NBF1 domain peptides..

One major drawback to the use of viral vectors such as adeno-associated virus 2 for gene therapy is that the packaging capacity of the virus is limited, which, with a large gene like CFTR, leaves little capacity for promoter sequences (14). Thus modification of the strategy to instead transfect only the NBF1 domain is attractive because the small size of the construct (0.5 kb) would improve packaging efficiency. Furthermore, two biological advantages of using NBF1 domain transduction as therapy can be envisioned. First, the expression of F508 CFTR is driven by its endogenous promoter, which may avoid the consequences of CFTR overexpression on the epithelium, e.g., reduced cell proliferation potential (41). A second advantage is that the NBF1 peptide is less likely to be toxic than the full-length channel protein when inadvertently expressed in nontarget tissues. The NBF1 construct fused to a protein transduction domain (43) may also be useful for peptide therapy, especially if the smallest effective subunit of NBF1 can be defined.

In addition, an ATP-independent proteolytic system has been suggested to operate in parallel with this pathway and become up-regulated when proteasomes are inhibited (Jensen, T. J., Loo, M. A., Pind, S., Williams, D. B., Goldberg, A. L., and Riordan, J. R. (1995) Cell 83, 129-135). In this study, we use two independent techniques, pulse-chase labeling and a noninvasive fluorescence cell-based assay, to investigate the proteolytic pathways underlying the degradation of misfolded CFTR. Here we report that only inhibitors of the proteasome have a significant effect on preventing the degradation of CFTR, whereas cell-permeable inhibitors of lysosomal degradation, autophagy, and several classes of protease had no measurable effect on CFTR degradation, when used either alone or in combination with the specific proteasome inhibitor carbobenzoxy-L-leucyl-leucyl-L-leucinal (MG132). Our results suggest that ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation is the dominant pathway for disposal of misfolded CFTR in mammalian cells and provide new mechanistic insight into endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	6	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 is the site of synthesis of membrane and secretory proteins and the site of their conformational maturation and assembly into correctly folded functional molecules. "Quality control" refers to the system that monitors the folding and assembly of proteins in the ER, ensuring that only correctly folded proteins can mature to later compartments of the secretory pathway (1, 2). Nascent proteins that fail to fold or assemble in the ER are degraded by a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (3). Studies in mammalian cells and in yeast have led to the formulation of a general model for ERAD in which substrates are degraded by cytoplasmic proteasomes following retrotranslocation (i.e. "dislocation") across the ER membrane by a process that requires the Sec61 translocon and functional ubiquitylation machinery at the cytosolic face of the ER membrane (4-6). Dislocation of ERAD substrates across the ER membrane is kinetically coupled to their degradation by proteasomes, and in many cases, cytosolic intermediates of degradation are hard to detect (7, 8). Although a central role for proteasomes in ERAD is widely accepted, a number of studies have suggested that other, nonproteasomal, proteolytic systems may also contribute to the elimination of misfolded proteins from the ER (9-12)..

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	8	The polytopic membrane protein cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel expressed at the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells and one of the first integral membrane proteins demonstrated to be a substrate of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (9, 13). Mutations in the CFTR gene cause the recessively inherited fatal disease cystic fibrosis. Although nearly 1000 mutations have been linked to cystic fibrosis, the majority of Caucasian cystic fibrosis patients have at least one copy of the F508 mutation, a temperature-sensitive allele that is unable to fold correctly at physiological temperature. As a consequence, F508 CFTR (F508) is not deployed to the plasma membrane and is instead rapidly degraded without being processed in the Golgi apparatus (14, 15)..

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	10	Several lines of evidence support a role for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in F508 turnover. First, CFTR undergoes both co-translational and posttranslational ubiquitylation when expressed in a cell-free system (16, 17). Second, inhibition of proteasome function with chemical inhibitors or with a dominant negative form of ubiquitin leads to accumulation of multiubiquitylated, undegraded forms of CFTR and F508 (13). Third, degradation of F508 in a cell-free system is sensitive to inhibitors of both the 19 S and 20 S subunits of the proteasome (17, 18). Curiously, despite this compelling evidence in support of a role for proteasomes in the degradation of misfolded CFTR, the effect of proteasome inhibition on the disappearance of F508 from pulse-chase studies is minimal (9, 13). This observation has led some investigators to conclude that other proteolytic systems are primarily responsible for the ERAD of misfolded CFTR molecules (9). However, no other proteases or proteolytic systems have been convincingly demonstrated to contribute to the degradation of CFTR or other ERAD substrates. Therefore, the intracellular fate of F508 and the identity of the proteases that participate in its degradation remain unresolved..

Stanton (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH) and subsequently subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) using NheI and EcoRV. F508 mutation was introduced by replacing the [Pml1-Blp1] cassette within the CFTR sequence. For selection of stable CHO cell lines, GFP-F508/pcDNA3 plasmid was linearized and transfected into CHO cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. The cells were subjected to selection in G418-containing medium. Stable transfectants were expanded in culture and enriched for GFP-F508-expressing cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting of highly fluorescent cells after overnight incubation of these cells with the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-L-norleucinal. Cells were then cloned into 96-well dishes at a density of 1 cell/well.

This procedure reduces ATP content below 10% of the baseline value within 10 min and sustains this low level of ATP content (22).

Before use, the cells were treated with the transcriptional activator sodium butyrate to increase GFP-F508 expression. Under these conditions, aggregation of GFP-F508 was undetectable by either immunoblot or fluorescence microscopy (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled cell lysates with anti-GFP antibody revealed a major Mr ~170,000 band corresponding to core-glycosylated GFP-F508 and high molecular weight (HMW) species migrating near the top of the gel (Fig. 1A). During the chase, the Mr 170,000 band disappeared with first-order kinetics (t1/2 = 50 min), consistent with previous determinations of F508 (9, 24, 25) and GFP-F508 half-life (23). In the presence of MG132, a specific proteasome inhibitor (26), the half-life of this species was only modestly extended (t1/2 = 1.5 h) (Fig. 1B, top left panel). A minor band migrating at Mr ~50,000 probably corresponds to an amino-terminal fragment of the GFP-508 fusion protein comprising Mr ~20,000 of CFTR in addition to the GFP moiety because it reacted with antibody to GFP, but not with an antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of CFTR (data not shown). Disappearance of the Mr 50,000 fragment paralleled that of the Mr 170,000 band (t1/2 = 1.1 h) and was also only modestly inhibited by MG132 (t1/2 = 1.5 h) (Fig. 1B, bottom left panel). HMW forms of GFP-F508 were detected immediately after the pulse (top band in Fig. 1A). These complexes disappeared rapidly when the chase was conducted in the absence of proteasome inhibitor (t1/2 = 0.9 h), but in contrast to the core-glycosylated protein and the Mr 50,000 fragment, they were strongly stabilized by the presence of MG132 (t1/2 = 6.6 h) (Fig. 1B, top right panel)..

To distinguish between these possibilities, we sought to determine whether the HMW material that accumulated during the chase in the presence of MG132 could be degraded after washout of the inhibitor. Our results (data not shown) indicate that the HMW material was soluble in nonionic detergent and competent for degradation, strongly suggesting that the increase in molecular weight was due to covalent modification with Ub, as observed previously for CFTR in cell-free extracts (17)..

Even when the total amount of GFP-immunoreactive material is considered (the sum of all electrophoretic species, Fig. 1B, bottom right panel), only 40% of the initial amount of GFP-F508 was stable at the end of a 4-h chase, despite proteasome inhibition. This observation suggests several plausible explanations. First, as suggested by Jensen et al. (9), in addition to proteasomes, other proteolytic systems could also contribute to F508 ERAD. Alternatively, it is possible that some proteolytic activities within the proteasome remain uninhibited in the presence of MG132 and continue to degrade the substrate. Finally, immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled material from detergent extracts of pulse-labeled cells may underestimate the amount of stable F508 if some of the protein becomes insoluble, if the epitope used for immunoprecipitation becomes inaccessible, or if the increased molecular weight (due to polyubiquitylation and/or aggregation) of the protein prevents it from being well resolved by SDS-PAGE. We reasoned that a noninvasive method of monitoring the fluorescence of GFP-F508 in intact cells using fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis may be a more accurate way to measure protein stability because it does not rely upon efficient recovery of radiolabeled protein from cells or upon the detection of a resolvable electrophoretic species. This would in turn allow us to better evaluate the effect of protease inhibitors on prevention of CFTR degradation..

Inhibition of GFP-F508 synthesis in butyrate-treated cells with emetine, an inhibitor of translational elongation, caused a rapid decrease in mean fluorescence, as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained with other translation inhibitors including cycloheximide and puromycin (data not shown). Emetine does not affect the degradation kinetics of CFTR or F508 (13). The decrease in GFP-F508 fluorescence fitted a first-order exponential with a t1/2 = 60 min, in good agreement with the GFP-F508 half-life measured in pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 2). In a control experiment, CHO cells expressing GFP alone were incubated with emetine for up to 10 h without any loss of total fluorescence (data not shown), consistent with GFP being a stable protein (20) and indicating that emetine treatment does not cause detectable cell lysis during the course of the experiment. Together, these results suggest that the decline in the fluorescence of cl.2 cells upon exposure to protein synthesis inhibitor faithfully reflects the degradation of F508 and constitutes a valid and convenient method for characterization of this degradation process..

Among the inhibitors tested, only those that are known to inhibit the proteasome (N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-L-norleucinal, clasto-lactacystin -lactone, and MG132) significantly slowed the degradation of GFP-F508.

This increase probably reflects slow fluorogenesis of the GFP moiety (t1/2 = 30-90 min; 27, 28) in the absence of CFTR degradation. Indeed, this transient increase in fluorescence is also observed with GFPu, a GFP molecule that is targeted to the ubiquitin-proteasome system for degradation via a short carboxyl-terminal degron (20) (Fig. 3B). However, in contrast to GFPu, which was completely stabilized by 25  microM MG132, the fluorescence of GFP-F508 started to decline after the first hour and dropped to about 70% of initial fluorescence after 4 h of emetine chase. The half-time of the decline of GFP-F508 fluorescence in the presence of MG132 (25  microM) was 6.8 h, indicating that proteasome inhibition results in substantial stabilization of GFP-F508..

Like MG132, epoxomicin inhibited GFP-F508 fluorescence decay biphasically with a high-affinity component (IC50  <  1  microM) and a low-affinity component (Fig. 4B). Although epoxomicin can inhibit all three of the characterized activities of the proteasomes, it is 66- and 500- fold more effective at inhibiting the chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) activity than the trypsin-like or peptidyl-glutamyl hydrolyzing activities, respectively (30). To investigate whether the low-affinity component of the MG132 and epoxomicin titrations was due to non-CT-L activities, we performed a titration of epoxomicin in the presence of 500  microM YU102, an ','-epoxyketone inhibitor that is selective for the peptidyl-glutamyl hydrolyzing activity of the proteasome (30). This treatment resulted in a small (10-15%) but significant increase in the degree of inhibition of GFP-F508 fluorescence decay at all epoxomicin concentrations (Fig. 4C).

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	42	ER-associated degradation is a central element of the quality control pathways that ensure that only correctly folded and assembled proteins are deployed in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. Although many studies have confirmed a primary role of the Ub-proteasome system in ERAD, the apparently minimal effect of highly potent proteasome inhibitors on the degradation of CFTR has remained an enigma and has suggested that other ATP-independent proteolytic systems also contribute to ERAD. In this study, we have used a fluorescent substrate to re-evaluate the role of the UPS in ERAD. Our data establish the primacy of the UPS in the degradation of ER-associated misfolded CFTR and suggest that the different proteolytic functionalities of the proteasome, associated with the three active -subunits, may operate independently in the degradation of an ERAD substrate (GFP-F508), but apparently not in the degradation of a cytoplasmic substrate (GFPu). Three lines of evidence support our conclusion that the UPS is the principal pathway for degradation of misfolded CFTR. First, proteasome inhibitors, but not inhibitors of serine or cysteine proteases or inhibitors of lysosomal or autophagic pathways, strongly stabilize GFP-F508 fluorescence. Second, GFP-F508 degradation was inhibited by MG132 and epoxomicin in a dose-dependent fashion, with biphasic apparent IC50 values in the expected range for CT-L and non-CT-L activities (30). Third, GFP-F508 degradation was strictly dependent on ATP, a hallmark of UPS-mediated proteolysis (31, 32). The possibility that other proteases initiate the clipping of the CFTR molecule while it is situated in the ER membrane, followed by proteasome-mediated proteolysis, is also unlikely because simultaneous addition of protease and proteasome inhibitors did not protect CFTR from degradation. Although our results do not rule out participation in CFTR degradation of protease classes for which cell-permeable inhibitors are not available (i.e. aspartic proteases, aminopeptidases, and so forth) or of substrate-specific proteases (e.g. colligin is a specific inhibitor of procollagen degradation (33)), these data establish that inhibition of proteolytic activities of the proteasome alone is sufficient to prevent the degradation of the majority of F508 molecules in living cells..

Although many studies have confirmed a primary role of the Ub-proteasome system in ERAD, the apparently minimal effect of highly potent proteasome inhibitors on the degradation of CFTR has remained an enigma and has suggested that other ATP-independent proteolytic systems also contribute to ERAD. In this study, we have used a fluorescent substrate to re-evaluate the role of the UPS in ERAD. Our data establish the primacy of the UPS in the degradation of ER-associated misfolded CFTR and suggest that the different proteolytic functionalities of the proteasome, associated with the three active -subunits, may operate independently in the degradation of an ERAD substrate (GFP-F508), but apparently not in the degradation of a cytoplasmic substrate (GFPu). Three lines of evidence support our conclusion that the UPS is the principal pathway for degradation of misfolded CFTR. First, proteasome inhibitors, but not inhibitors of serine or cysteine proteases or inhibitors of lysosomal or autophagic pathways, strongly stabilize GFP-F508 fluorescence. Second, GFP-F508 degradation was inhibited by MG132 and epoxomicin in a dose-dependent fashion, with biphasic apparent IC50 values in the expected range for CT-L and non-CT-L activities (30).

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	44	In previous studies using metabolic pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation, proteasome inhibitors including MG132 and lactacystin had a very modest effect at inhibiting the decay of the electrophoretic species corresponding to core-glycosylated F508 degradation (9, 13). In the present work, we show that at least part of radiolabel lost from core-glycosylated GFP-F508 could be recovered as high molecular weight material. Because this HMW material remains competent for degradation, our data suggest that in the absence of proteasome function, a significant fraction of radiolabeled GFP-F508 molecules are converted to multiubiquitylated forms. Accumulation of HMW forms in the presence of proteasome inhibition is not observed for most other ERAD substrates such as the -subunit of the T-cell receptor (7, 34) and soluble proteins such as IgG light chains (8), which tend to accumulate as core-glycosylated detergent-soluble monomers in the ER after proteasome inhibition. It is likely that this difference is a consequence of the topology of CFTR, in which most of the mass of the protein is accessible to the cytoplasmic face of the ER and hence to components of the ubiquitin conjugation system. A recent study reported that inhibition of proteasome function leads to accumulation of a substantial fraction of CFTR in reconstituted cell-free extracts as high molecular weight multiubiquitylated protein (17)..

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	46	In our studies, no proteasome inhibitor or combination thereof was able to completely suppress the decay of GFP-F508 fluorescence. It is unlikely that this apparent degradation (a ~20-30% decrease of fluorescence after a 4-h chase in the presence of proteasome inhibitors) is the result of cell death due to toxic effects of simultaneous exposure to emetine and proteasome inhibitor because  > 98% of cells were able to exclude propidium iodide staining at the end of a 4-h chase. Alternatively, the decrease in GFP-F508 fluorescence could, in principle, be due to self-quenching of GFP fluorescence in closely packed aggregates of GFP-F508, which are known to form upon chronic exposure to proteasome inhibitors (23). Such self-quenching is a form of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fluorescence resonance energy transfer homotransfer). Because we do not observe heterotransfer between the compatible fluorescence resonance energy transfer heterotransfer pair CFP-F508 and YFP-F508, even under conditions designed to maximize aggregation,2 it is unlikely that homotransfer between adjacent GFP-F508 molecules could account for the observed decrease in fluorescence. It is also formally possible that the small decrease in GFP-F508 fluorescence could be due to partial unfolding of the GFP moiety by the ATPase activity of the 19 S proteasome cap, without actual degradation of CFTR itself. However, the simplest explanation may be that none of the proteasome inhibitors used, alone or in combination, are able to fully inhibit all of the three proteasomal -subunits. This explanation is consistent with conversion of a similar fraction (~30%) of labeled GFP-F508 as high molecular weight multiubiquitin conjugates in the presence of MG132 in both our pulse-labeling experiments (Fig. 1) and in the cell-free experiments of Oberdorf et al. (18). It is likely, therefore, that the proteolytic activities of the proteasome associated with individual -subunits do not act in a strictly cooperative fashion in ERAD. Our findings with GFP-F508 in vivo are consistent with those of Oberdorf et al. (18), who found that complete inhibition of the 5-subunit (associated with CT-L activity) led to only a 40% reduction in cell-free CFTR degradation, and with those of Myung et al. (30), who reported recently that selective peptidyl-glutamyl hydrolyzing inhibition is insufficient to inhibit protein degradation in vivo. These data all strongly indicate that the catalytic sites of the proteasome function independently. It is not clear why, in our studies, the degradation of GFPu, a small soluble substrate of the UPS, is completely inhibited by MG132, whereas degradation of GFP-F508 is not. Perhaps this discrepancy is a reflection of functional differences in the mechanisms by which proteasomes engage substrates delivered from the cytosol and those that are dislocated across the ER membrane.

0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	3	RAPID CHANGES IN salt and water movement occur in many epithelial tissues that respond quickly to alterations in overall salt and water balance. For example, the amount of Cl secreted by the shark rectal gland can vary greatly in response to changes in the external environment (4). To rapidly change the rate of transport, epithelial cells regulate the transport rates of specific ion channels, pumps, and carriers. This regulation commonly occurs by either affecting the activity of an individual transport process and/or the number of transport entities in the plasma membrane. The activity of many ion channels is regulated by voltage, by extracellular ligands, or by intracellular signal transduction mechanisms (6). Thus many ion channels can be easily switched on and off to match the needs of a rapidly changing physiological process. CFTR is an excellent example of a highly regulated Cl channel (2). The activity of CFTR is controlled by the coordination of two processes, phosphorylation of several sites primarily within the regulatory domain followed by ATP binding and hydrolysis by the nucleotide binding domains. These two processes act together to both switch on and regulate channel opening (3)..

In those cases, the most effective way to modulate transepithelial transport is to alter the number of transporters in the plasma membrane. For example, it is well known that mature aquaporin water channels move water in an unregulated fashion (1). To modulate overall transepithelial water transport such as in the renal collecting duct, vesicles containing aquaporin 2 water channels are rapidly inserted into the plasma membrane following activation by antidiuretic hormone (8). The specific question addressed by this article in focus is whether exocytosis is involved in the activation of Cl secretion via CFTR in the human airway serous cell line, Calu-3. Serous cells are located primarily in the submucosal glands of human airway and are known to express CFTR..

CFTR is expressed in a variety of tissues, including airway, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, heart, and kidney, where it participates in ion transport (5). Thus how much of CFTR-mediated transport is controlled by exocytosis may depend critically on which organ is being considered. Moreover, when cultured cells are being studied, it may also depend on the degree of differentiation of the cells..

0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	9	For example, in the current article in focus (Ref. 10; see p. C913 in this issue), Loffing and colleagues demonstrate that exocytosis of CFTR-containing vesicles is not involved in the activation of Cl secretion in Calu-3 cells. Similarly, exocytic delivery of CFTR does not occur in gallbladder epithelium (14). Presumably in these tissues, activation of resident CFTR is sufficient to regulate transport. In other tissues such as the shark rectal gland, bronchial epithelial cells, and in transporting cell lines such as Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II and A6, cAMP increases the amount of CFTR in the apical cell membrane (7, 9, 11, 13). In T84 cells (a colonic epithelial cell line), the results are conflicting, suggesting either that culture conditions may affect the machinery for cAMP-dependent exocytosis of CFTR (12, 15) or that methodological difficulties in localizing CFTR in the plasma membrane make it difficult to detect exocytosis of CFTR. Thus the question of how much of a role exocytosis plays in regulating the transport of CFTR in T84 cells is still unresolved..
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	10	Loffing and colleagues (10) speculate that serous cells in the airway have high basal rates of Cl and antibiotic secretion. This may require that high levels of CFTR be present at all times to support such a high level of transport. Given that CFTR is highly regulated both by phosphorylation and ATP binding and hydrolysis, then why do some tissues need to control its function further by rapidly moving CFTR to the plasma membrane via exocytosis? One may speculate that stimulation of transport via CFTR, by increasing the number of channels though exocytosis, may occur only in tissues such as the shark rectal gland, where very large and rapid changes in transport occur..

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	4	The F508 mutation leads to retention of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the endoplasmic reticulum and rapid degradation by the proteasome and other proteolytic systems. In stably transfected LLC-PK1 (porcine kidney) epithelial cells, F508 CFTR conforms to this paradigm and is not present at the plasma membrane. When LLC-PK1 cells or human nasal polyp cells derived from a F508 homozygous patient are grown on plastic dishes and treated with an epithelial differentiating agent (DMSO, 2% for 4 days) or when LLC-PK1 cells are grown as polarized monolayers on permeable supports, plasma membrane F508 CFTR is significantly increased. Moreover, when confluent LLC-PK1 cells expressing F508 CFTR were treated with DMSO and mounted in an Ussing chamber, a further increase in cAMP-activated short-circuit current (i.e., ~7  microA/cm2; P  <  0.00025 compared with untreated controls) was observed. No plasma membrane CFTR was detected after DMSO treatment in nonepithelial cells (mouse L cells) expressing F508 CFTR. The experiments describe a way to augment F508 CFTR maturation in epithelial cells that appears to act through a novel mechanism and allows insertion of functional F508 CFTR in the plasma membranes of transporting cell monolayers. The results raise the possibility that increased epithelial differentiation might increase the delivery of F508 CFTR from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where the F508 protein is shielded from degradative pathways such as the proteasome and allowed to mature..

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	8	APPROXIMATELY 90% of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients possess at least one cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) allele that lacks a phenylalanine residue at CFTR position 508 (F508). The findings of Cheng et al. (4) indicated that the F508 mutation causes retention of CFTR in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a failure to insert the protein in the plasma membrane. Butyrate, an epithelial differentiating agent, has been shown to augment F508 maturation in nonpolarized cells grown on plastic (3). Another report suggested the possibility that butyrate increases ion transport in CF nasal epithelia, although augmentation of F508 maturation was not directly shown (36). Improvements in F508 CFTR due to butyrate have not been attributed to differentiating effects per se but to increased CFTR mRNA and protein levels. The F508 folding defect is also temperature sensitive and influenced by high concentrations of glycerol (7, 37). CFTR normally functions as a Cl channel in the context of polarized epithelial monolayers. However, interventions that activate maturation and Cl secretion through F508 CFTR in physiologically important systems such as polarized epithelial cell monolayers have been difficult to establish..
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	9	An effort in many laboratories has been directed toward development of channel openers for the F508 CFTR. This strategy depends on at least some (e.g., small amounts of) F508 protein in the plasma membrane (19). Because studies of F508 processing have focused on undifferentiated cells, less information is available concerning CFTR maturation in polarized epithelia. Previous observations in other laboratories suggest that measurable amounts of F508 protein might be present in highly differentiated F508 human nasal epithelial cells (9), CF sweat ducts in situ (35), or in the nasal airways of F508 CFTR mice (22). In the present experiments, we adapted LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells transfected with CFTR cDNAs for measurement of transepithelial Cl transport. This cell line readily forms polarized cell monolayers (30, 34, 39) and may have advantages over primary CF airway epithelial cells (i.e., since lung or nasal tissue from F508 patients is limited or less frequently available) for use in screening drugs for effects on CFTR. Although the kidney-derived LLC-PK1 cell line does not endogenously express wild-type or F508 CFTR, the processing of wild-type and mutant CFTR in this cell type has been carefully studied and found to closely resemble the behavior of other epithelial cells that do endogenously express CFTR (28). Moreover, kidney-derived epithelia have been a useful model system for characterizing effects due to epithelial differentiation. For example, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells grown on filters have been used to study the distribution of membrane proteins in polarized cells (1) and the mechanisms underlying this distribution (12, 29). LLC-PK1 cells have been used to explore specific markers of differentiation (27), ion conductance and membrane voltage (24), chemical induction of differentiation (26), and the differentiation-dependent expression of the Na+-glucose cotransporter (8). We also studied the effect of DMSO on human nasal epithelial cells derived from F508 homozygous patients and on mouse L cells expressing F508 or wild-type CFTR (46). In our studies, we found that growth of epithelial cells under conditions designed to induce a more differentiated phenotype (treatment with an epithelial differentiating agent, DMSO, or growth of the cells as monolayers on permeable supports) led to improvements in F508 CFTR processing. Butyrate (5 mM for 24 h), glycerol (10% for 48 h), or growth at 27 degrees C (for 48 h) had no detectable effect on F508 maturation in these epithelial cell monolayers..

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	12	Cell culture. Parental LLC-PK1 cells were cultured in M199 media supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). LLC-PK1 cells with stable expression of the wild-type or F508 CFTR (generous gift of S. Cheng, Genzyme; Ref. 28) were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 500  microg/ml G418 (Sigma). DMSO (Sigma) was diluted in medium. Cells were treated with DMSO (2% vol/vol) for 4 days after confluency. Cd2+ was added to induce CFTR expression from the metallothionein promoter at 5  microM in experiments and controls. Mouse fibroblast cells expressing F508 or wild-type CFTR (46) were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS..
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	13	Human nasal polyp cells were isolated and cultured according to an earlier described protocol (47)..
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	14	Immunoprecipitation. LLC-PK1 cells grown on plastic were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.2, containing 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM CaCl2) on ice and then lysed in a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 100  microg/ml aprotinin, 100  microg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysate supernatant (300  microg protein) was immunoprecipitated at 4 degrees C for 2 h using an anti-CFTR COOH-terminal monoclonal antibody (Genzyme) and protein G agarose beads (Boehringer Mannheim). Immunoprecipitated proteins were phosphorylated in vitro as described previously (4, 33) and separated on a 7% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were placed on PhosphoScreen and analyzed with PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Images were further characterized with IPLab spectrum (Signal Analytics)..
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	15	RT-PCR. RT-PCR was carried out using Promega PolyATtract series 9600 mRNA isolation and cDNA synthesis system, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, mRNA was extracted from control and DMSO-treated samples (1  x  105 cells) and 50% of each mRNA sample was used to synthesize cDNA. The remainder of the sample was identically treated, but without RT, as a control to exclude DNA contamination. Samples were homogenized and diluted in 40  microl of prewarmed (70 degrees C) manufacturer's hybridization buffer, and mRNA was purified on oligo(dT) matrix. After samples were washed, 10- microl samples were processed to cDNA by adding 5  microl of reverse transcriptase. To ensure that PCR yield in these experiments was roughly dependent on the amount of mRNA starting material, pBluescript containing CFTR (gift of J. Rommens) was transcribed in vitro with T7 polymerase and mRNA added to cell lysates from parental LLC-PK1 cells at known concentrations. First-strand CFTR cDNA was then synthesized exactly as above and studied in parallel with cDNA from cells expressing wild-type or F508 CFTR. In all studies, cDNA synthesis was stopped after 30 min by incubating the samples at 95 degrees C for 5 min. Control experiments in which RT was omitted from the cDNA synthesis step led to no detectable PCR product under any conditions. Quantitation was by densitometry using IPLab spectrum (Signal Analytics)..

Coverslips were washed three times in PBS containing 1 mM Ca2+ and 0.5 mM Mg2+, fixed in 20 degrees C methanol for 20 min, and air dried at room temperature. The cells were rehydrated in PBS for 5 min. Nonspecific protein binding sites were blocked by incubating with 1% (wt /vol) porcine -globulin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibody [a polyclonal (rabbit) antibody raised against the CFTR NBD1] (17, 33) was applied and incubated at room temperature for 40 min. After subsequent washing (5  x  3-min washes in PBS), the cells were incubated with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 40 min and then washed, mounted, and visualized as described above. Controls in which the first antibody was replaced by nonimmune rabbit serum were negative in all cases. Cells were viewed with an Olympus IX70 inverted epifluorescence microscope at 623-nm light excitation using UPlanApo  x 100 or UApo/340  x 40 objectives. Digital confocal images were captured using a Photometrics SenSys digital camera and IPLab spectrum software with Power Microtome (Signal Analytics)..

DMSO-treated cells grown on plastic were studied in the cell-attached configuration by the patch-clamp technique. The bath and pipette solutions, electronics, pipette fabrication, and further details regarding the patch-clamp technique have been described previously (43). The pipette solution contained an impermeant cation (i.e., N-methyl-D-glutamine) so that inward current could only be due to Cl flow into the pipette. CFTR channels were activated after excision by 250 U/ml protein kinase A (PKA) plus 200  microM ATP in the bath..

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	25	DMSO treatment of LLC-PK1 cells expressing F508 CFTR. DMSO, like butyrate, displays potent activity as an epithelial differentiating agent (14, 23, 31, 40). Both drugs cause changes in the display of plasma membrane glycoproteins in epithelial cells, although the two compounds are believed to act by independent mechanisms (14, 23, 31, 40). Dose and time dependencies of DMSO treatment (0, 2, 5, and 10% DMSO for 1, 6, or 12 h and 1, 3, 4, and 5 days) were evaluated systematically in LLC-PK1 cells that express recombinant F508 CFTR. We found that treatment for 4 days with 2% DMSO led to maximal effects on F508 maturation and transepithelial Cl transport in these cells. This 2% DMSO schedule had no visible effect on cell viability, and, in a quantitative assay of cell growth (CellTiter 96, Promega), the well-known differentiating effects of DMSO (which slow cell proliferation) decreased cell proliferation in the LLC-PK1 cells by only ~15%. We therefore settled on this schedule for future studies. We studied LLC-PK1 cells expressing wild-type or F508 CFTR and the parental (non-CFTR expressing) LLC-PK1 cell line (28)..

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	27	DMSO treatment leads to a mature, band C form of F508 CFTR. Incomplete processing of CFTR can be identified by the absence of a mature, fully glycosylated (band C) form of the protein (4). Lower-molecular-weight forms of CFTR (e.g., band B) represent the high-mannose, endoglycosidase H-sensitive forms of the protein that are established cotranslationally in the ER. The maturation of CFTR from core to complex glycosylation reflects the transition of the protein from the ER to the Golgi, where attachment of carbohydrates and trimming are accomplished as CFTR proceeds to the trans-Golgi network. Immunoprecipitation of CFTR after a 4-day pretreatment with DMSO is shown in Fig. 1. The result shows the appearance of mature, fully glycosylated CFTR after DMSO treatment in F508 cells. This result supports the notion that F508 maturation is augmented by DMSO. Figure 1 also indicates a small increase in total CFTR protein in LLC-PK1 cells after DMSO treatment. To determine whether this increase was due to effects on steady-state levels of mRNA, we performed a semiquantitative RT-PCR from total cellular mRNA. DMSO did not appear to cause increases in CFTR mRNA levels as judged by this RT-PCR assay (Fig. 2). Unlike previous reports concerning butyrate treatment (3), the experiment suggests that increased F508 CFTR mRNA does not account for the modest increase in total F508 protein after DMSO treatment or the increase in band C. These results also suggest that DMSO promotes F508 maturation through a mechanism that is different from that observed with butyrate..

We used digital confocal fluorescent microscopy for CFTR localization that was detected by a polyclonal (rabbit) antibody raised against CFTR NBD1. The antibody used in these experiments has been validated previously by its ability to immunoprecipitate either truncated CFTR or full-length CFTR, immunolocalize CFTR to cells overexpressing the protein, and correctly identify the presence or absence of CFTR in vivo from salivary gland sections of CFTR wild-type or knockout mice of the same strain (5, 16, 17, 33). In LLC-PK1 cells expressing the wild-type CFTR, the protein localized mainly to the perinuclear ER compartment and to the region of the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A). DMSO treatment only slightly increased the membrane staining of wild-type CFTR. In contrast, F508 CFTR was detected in the perinuclear (ER) compartment in LLC-PK1 cells with no significant membrane staining. After DMSO treatment, staining in the region of the cell membrane (similar to that observed in wild-type CFTR-expressing cells) could be detected. F508 CFTR localizes to the perinuclear ER region of F508 homozygous human nasal epithelial cells (Fig. 3B). Treatment of these cells with DMSO (2% for 4 days) resulted in a more diffuse cytoplasmic staining that included staining of cells in the plasma membranes. In contrast, DMSO treatment had no significant effect on F508 CFTR staining in mouse fibroblast cells (mouse L cells, Fig. 3C). These studies suggest that the specificity of effects of DMSO on F508 CFTR processing occurs in epithelial cells but not in fibroblast cells..

We also examined F508 CFTR activity in the plasma membranes of LLC-PK1 cells following DMSO treatment (Fig. 4) using patch-clamp techniques. Cells grown on plastic were studied in the cell-attached and excised inside-out configurations. The pipette solution contained an impermeant cation (i.e., N-methyl-D-glucamine) so that inward current could only be due to Cl flow. The holding potential was approximately 60 mV. A current-voltage relationship and typical tracing are shown in Fig. 4, both consistent with the channel activity previously described for F508 CFTR (6, 21, 32). The conductance of the channel is ~8-10 pS, and the channel is activated after excision by 250 U/ml PKA plus 200  microM ATP in the bath, as expected for a functional CFTR protein. We observed CFTR channels in 2 of 27 seals in F508 LLC-PK1 cells and in 12 of 48 seals in the same cells treated with DMSO. The wild-type CFTR was observed in 8 of 25 seals. The open probability of the F508 channels was studied after stimulation by PKA and ATP. In the representative tracing shown in Fig. 4, open probability before activation was 2% (98% closed); open probability after activation was 97% (3% closed).

To extend our findings concerning F508 CFTR in LLC-PK1 cells grown in plastic dishes, we also grew cells on permeable supports to form epithelial monolayers. LLC-PK1 cells exhibit a more differentiated phenotype under these conditions, as indicated by tight junction formation, epithelial resistance measurements, and the capability to perform vectoral ion transport (11, 30, 38, 39). Under these conditions, F508 LLC-PK1 cells had low, but detectable, Cl transport that was absent in parental (non-CFTR expressing) cells (P  <  0.05, Figs. 5 and 6). Resistance in the cell monolayers was ~100    cm2. A 3-day DMSO treatment of F508 CFTR-expressing cells led to forskolin-activated currents in the direction of Cl secretion that were greatly increased compared with untreated F508 LLC-PK1 cells (P  <  0.00025). Transport was absent in parental LLC-PK1 cells with or without DMSO treatment, indicating specificity for F508 CFTR expression. When Cl was omitted from solutions bathing the monolayers, Isc was not detectable either in wild-type or F508 CFTR-expressing cells under any treatment conditions, indicating that the Isc observed in the presence of Cl was due to vectoral Cl transport. Studies of wild-type CFTR-expressing cells are shown for comparison. Modest increases in monolayer resistance (e.g., by 15-20%) were noted in most paired experiments as a result of DMSO treatment, a finding that suggests enhancement of tight junction formation in cells grown on permeable supports in the presence of DMSO. A summary of these studies is shown in Fig. 6..

These results are significant because they suggest that DMSO acts to potentiate F508 CFTR maturation through a mechanism that 1) is different from that observed with glycerol or butyrate, 2) is more potent than can be obtained with glycerol or butyrate, at least in the LLC-PK1 model, and 3) allows insertion of the F508 CFTR in the plasma membrane of a transporting cellular monolayer in vitro..

Organization and assembly of tight junctions is an additional, useful measurement of polarity and differentiation in epithelial cell monolayers. Well-organized tight junctions occurring in an ordered distribution indicate a higher level of polarity and differentiation, whereas tight junction antigens that are absent, poorly developed, or distributed throughout the cytoplasm or plasma membrane may be indicative of a less differentiated phenotype.

The maturation of F508 CFTR can be augmented further by treatment with nontoxic concentrations of a differentiation agent known to increase epithelial cell polarity, DMSO (14, 23, 31, 40).

We saw no evidence of increased CFTR mRNA in either wild-type or F508 LLC-PK1 cells under the same DMSO treatment conditions that partially corrected F508 protein processing. Moreover, butyrate treatment of F508 cells at 5 mM caused no improvement in Cl transport in an Ussing chamber protocol. These results suggest that DMSO augments the maturation of F508 CFTR by a mechanism that is different from the known effects of butyrate. DMSO has also recently been suggested to act as a "chemical chaperone" and to correct the folding and biogenesis of the pathogenic prion protein in vitro (W. J. Welch, personal communication). Although it is possible that DMSO has effects on CFTR folding, there is no direct evidence in our experiments that DMSO can reach cytoplasmic levels that alter the kinetics, efficiency, or other aspects of CFTR folding in living cells to augment F508 CFTR processing. Therefore, although an effect on CFTR folding remains an important consideration in our experiments, further studies will be necessary to test a direct role for DMSO as a chemical chaperone for CFTR..
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	50	In our experiments, interventions that increase epithelial cell polarity and differentiation also conferred increases in F508 CFTR maturation. Growth of epithelial cells on permeable supports is a well-established method of augmenting epithelial cell differentiation and has been described previously as leading to dome formation and a more differentiated phenotype in many cell types (13, 18, 25). LLC-PK1 cells have previously been reported to switch from an undifferentiated to a more differentiated phenotype when grown on filters (48). This method was therefore selected as one way to increase cell polarity in our experiments. We showed that growth on permeable supports also led to functionally detectable F508 CFTR in the plasma membrane by Isc measurements (Fig. 6). DMSO treatment is another well-described method for augmenting cell differentiation in epithelial cells derived from different tissues (14, 23, 31, 40). Accordingly, we tested the influence of DMSO on F508 CFTR maturational processing. DMSO treatment caused increased resistance in LLC-PK1 monolayers (presumably on the basis of greater organization of tight junctions), and the same treatment led to further increases in F508 CFTR activity at the cell surface (Figs. 5 and 6). Moreover, we observed that organization of tight junctions in LLC-PK1 cells increased under the same conditions that led to F508 maturation (Figs. 1, 3, and 7). Finally, vectoral chloride transport (Fig. 5) should only be detectable in a polarized epithelial monolayer and was observed in our studies of anion transport. Together, these experiments indicate that a more differentiated phenotype also confers an increase in F508 CFTR maturation. The effect of DMSO on F508 CFTR processing was also observed in primary human nasal polyp cells but not in nonepithelial cells (mouse fibroblast, L cells; Fig. 3). Experiments in these other cell types suggest the usefulness of the approach for activating F508 processing in human epithelial cells..

With the onset of differentiation and the development of adherens junctions, tight junctions, and cell matrix interactions, structural polarity is established. The process by which proteins target to the apical membrane appears to occur by a default mechanism (10). Our results may indicate that cellular polarity helps establish part of this default pathway. The possibility that F508 CFTR enters the apical targeting pathway specifically after an increase in cellular differentiation is suggested by results in Figs. 1, 3, and 5-7. Other contributors to F508 maturation, including stabilization of the folded structure of F508 protein, a change in F508 CFTR interactions with cellular chaperones, or a decrease in the rate of degradation of F508 CFTR in the ER (so as to allow more time to reach the Golgi), are among the alternative explanations for the findings shown here..

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	54	In summary, the ER in epithelial cells is a hostile environment, insofar as the CFTR is concerned. Wild-type and F508 molecules, even when folded into functional Cl channels, are polyubiquitinated and degraded in short order (half time of ~30 min) by the proteasome and possibly other proteolytic pathways (20, 44). CFTR that escapes the ER and enters the Golgi may reach a "safe haven," where half time increases to  > 12 h for the post-ER form. Our data suggest, after DMSO treatment in LLC-PK1 cells, an increased amount of the post-ER complex-glycosylated and membrane-localized F508 CFTR is observed. Because neither block of ubiquitination nor proteasome inhibition has been reported to enhance F508 maturation, it is less likely that the effects observed here are caused by blockade of the proteasome or of ubiquitination. Our results raise the possibility that induction of polarity in LLC-PK1 cells might increase a transition of F508 CFTR from the ER to the trans-Golgi network (Figs. 1, 3 and 7). If the F508 CFTR quality control mechanism becomes "leaky" in differentiated cells compared with the undifferentiated state, the findings could have important implications concerning the in vivo processing of F508 CFTR, which occurs in well-organized cells within tissues characterized by tight junctions and polarity. Further experiments are needed to test this possibility, as well as to test the effects of DMSO treatment in F508 CF mice..

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	3	The in vivo transcription start sites of the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) and its murine homologue (Cftr) have been mapped in a range of tissues using the technique of 5[prime] rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5[prime] RACE). These are the first in vivo transcription start sites for CFTR or Cftr to be reported. Distinct, tissue-specific patterns of CFTR start site usage were identified in both mouse and human. In particular, striking variation in the position of the murine Cftr transcription start site was seen along the length of the intestinal tract; different start sites being utilized in ileum and in duodenum. In humans, distinct transcription start sites are utilized in adult and foetal lungs.

These are the first in vivo transcription start sites for CFTR or Cftr to be reported. Distinct, tissue-specific patterns of CFTR start site usage were identified in both mouse and human. In particular, striking variation in the position of the murine Cftr transcription start site was seen along the length of the intestinal tract; different start sites being utilized in ileum and in duodenum. In humans, distinct transcription start sites are utilized in adult and foetal lungs. In addition, a novel 5[prime]-untranslated exon of murine Cftr, denoted exon -1, was identified and shown to be expressed exclusively in mouse testis. Expression of exon -1-containing Cftr transcripts was shown by mRNA in situ hybridization to be confined to the germ cells and to be regulated during spermatogenesis..

Although the patterns of regulated CFTR gene expression are well known, surprisingly little is known of the genetic elements and transcription factors that regulate the tissue-specific expression of CFTR. Both the mouse and human CFTR genes have promoters which resemble those of `housekeeping' genes (12-14), an observation that is inconsistent with the tissue and cell type specificity of CFTR expression..

Nevertheless, the existence of a human equivalent of the testis-specific murine Cftr exon -1 was investigated by performing 5[prime] RACE PCR in order to identify the CFTR transcription start site utilized in adult human testis. The 5[prime] RACE procedure was repeated a total of three times, but no CFTR-specific product bands could be amplified. As a positive control, CFTR expression in human testis was confirmed by RT-PCR using an internal CFTR primer set (not shown). It was concluded, therefore, that the level of CFTR expression in human testis is extremely low but detectable by RT-PCR, but that this low level expression is below the limit of detection by 5[prime] RACE due to the latter method's inherently lower sensitivity. Thus, the position of the CFTR start site utilized in adult human testis remains unknown, and no conclusions can be drawn regarding the expression of a human equivalent of murine Cftr exon -1 in human testis.

Thus, the position of the CFTR start site utilized in adult human testis remains unknown, and no conclusions can be drawn regarding the expression of a human equivalent of murine Cftr exon -1 in human testis. DISCUSSION.

Using a sensitive 5[prime] RACE technique, we were able to map CFTR start sites in a number of different mouse and human tissues.

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	41	In the case of murine Cftr, the use of distinct, tissue-specific transcription start sites leads to the production of Cftr transcripts which differ in the length of their 5[prime]-untranslated regions (5[prime] UTRs). The observation that distinct transcription start sites are used in different tissues suggests that the tissue-specific regulation of Cftr expression may, in part, operate at the level of transcription start site selection. Analysis of the primary sequence of the 5[prime]-flanking region of murine Cftr provides some clues as to how tissue-specific start site selection might be achieved. No sequence likely to correspond to a TATA box element could be found upstream of any of the in vivo transcription start sites identified for murine Cftr (Fig. 2). However, Table 4 illustrates that sequences surrounding three of the Cftr transcription start sites, the -82 site utilized in lung and the -60 and -19 sites utilized in duodenum, are similar to the consensus sequence for the mammalian initiator (Inr) element, PyPyA(+1)N(T/A)PyPy, that has been suggested to maintain the fidelity of transcription initiation in promoters devoid of TATA boxes (24). It is likely, therefore, that an Inr-dependent mechanism is responsible for directing the formation of a transcription pre-initiation complex in these tissues..

Most notably, distinct start sites appear to be used in adult and in foetal lungs. However, the exact position of the CFTR transcription start site relative to the translation initiation codon does not appear to be conserved between equivalent tissues of mice and humans, suggesting that the precise mechanisms responsible for correct start site selection are not conserved cross-species. This is perhaps not surprising given the apparent lack of primary nucleic acid sequence homology between the mouse and human proximal promoter regions (19,25)..

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	46	The identification of a testis-specific, untranslated exon of murine Cftr (exon -1) implies that Cftr expression in this tissue is under the control of a testis-specific alternative promoter. Murine Cftr falls into a group of genes demonstrating cell type-specific expression in the testis, with expression being regulated during spermatogenesis (22). Other genes in this group include many whose protein products are thought to play a particular role in the complex process of spermatogenesis (reviewed in 26), and a potential role for the Cftr chloride channel during spermatogenesis has been suggested (22). Genes such as Cftr that are expressed both post-meiotically in the testis and in other tissues often produce testis-specific transcripts, generated by the use of testis-specific promoters, altered polyadenylation and/or tissue-specific alternative exon splicing (26). We have shown that the testis-specific Cftr transcript is generated through the use of an alternative promoter and alternative splicing in the 5[prime] UTR, to include exon -1 at the extreme 5[prime] end of the transcript. The vast majority (95%) of Cftr transcripts in mouse testis contain this additional untranslated exon, implying an important role for exon -1 with regard to either the function of Cftr in testis or the regulation of Cftr expression in this tissue. The latter alternative would appear to be more plausible as a number of genes expressed post-meiotically in rodent testis exhibit negative translational regulation mediated by the binding of regulatory proteins to specific 5[prime] UTR sequences (reviewed in 27). One of the families of germ cell-specific proteins proposed to mediate translational regulation in the testis are the Y-box proteins (28). Y-box proteins may function both as DNA-binding transcription factors, which bind to specific, cis-acting Y-box promoter elements, and as RNA-binding proteins, which mediate translational regulation via mRNA masking in vertebrate gametes (29). In this context, it is interesting to note that a Y-box consensus sequence, previously suggested to act as a positive regulator of transcription in the murine Cftr promoter (14), is contained within exon -1 and thus will be present exclusively in the 5[prime] UTR of testis-specific Cftr transcripts..

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	48	Another feature of the murine Cftr 5[prime]-flanking region suggests that translational regulation may be a more general mechanism controlling Cftr expression. An additional AUG codon is present at position -58, upstream of the Cftr ORF (Fig. 2). This upstream AUG precedes a short upstream ORF (uORF) that, if recognized by the translation machinery, would produce a small peptide of five amino acids in length. This uORF will be present in the 5[prime] UTR of Cftr transcripts initiating upstream of position -58, including the major Cftr transcripts expressed in lung, foetal lung, ileum, kidney, uterus and testis. The upstream AUG occurs in a weak Kozak context, with neither the critical purine at position -3 nor the G at position +4 being present (30), whereas the AUG of the Cftr ORF occurs in a much stronger Kozak context (31). The scanning model predicts that translation will usually initiate at the first AUG in a favourable Kozak context (30). Nevertheless, interaction between the translation machinery and the upstream AUG may have the effect of reducing the translation efficiency of the Cftr ORF. The presence of the short uORF would therefore be predicted to reduce the translation efficiency of the major Cftr transcripts expressed in lungs, ileum and testis but not those expressed in duodenum, as the uORF is absent from the 5[prime] UTR of the duodenum transcript initiating at position -19 and is too close to the m7G cap site to exert an effect in the transcript initiating at position -60 (31). Thus, by the use of distinct transcription start sites, the expression of Cftr might also be modulated at the translational level..

However, controversy still exists as to whether this functional feature of CFTR is sufficient to explain the complete pathophysiology of this disease (7). The cellular epithelial cystic fibrosis (CF) phenotype, for example, is associated both with a dysfunctional phospholipase A2 activity and a deranged arachidonic acid metabolism (10, 24) and with an abnormally increased apical epithelial Na+ permeability (6), which is regulated by CFTR (26). Expression of CFTR is also associated with the recovery of outwardly rectifying Cl channel activity of CF cells (12) by an autocoid mechanism entailing the release of cellular ATP, which, in turn, helps modulate other cell responses (23). These disparate observations are unlikely to stem from an altered Cl conductance. Alternate paradigms to explain the various features of the CF phenotype are currently being sought..

Briefly, CFTR was purified with a small (2.6  x  6 cm, 30 ml) ceramic hydroxyapatite column and an equilibration buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, 0.15% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and was eluted with a linear gradient of 100-600 mM sodium phosphate, 0.15% SDS, and 5 mM DTT as originally described (3). A Superdex column and chromatography in 0.1% SDS, rather than 0.25% lithium dodecyl sulfate, were also used to facilitate purification of larger quantities (mg) of insect CFTR (14). In cases in which purified CFTR was obtained from CFTR-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, cells grown on microcarriers were harvested, washed with sodium phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed in buffer containing protease inhibitors (for more details, see Ref. 14). The supernatant was processed to obtain a membrane suspension, which was pelleted at 100,000 g for 60 min. The supernatant containing the solubilized CFTR was further purified by immunoaffinity resins prepared with monoclonal antibody (MAb) 13-1 and MAb 24-1 (Genzyme, Framingham, MA), activated with sodium periodate, and coupled to Hydrazide Avidgel (Unisyn Technologies) in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0. Immunoaffinity chromatography was performed by incubation of CFTR-containing membranes (25 ml) with 15 ml of resin for at least 3 h at 4 degrees C. After collection of the flow-through, the resin was rinsed with 100 ml of wash buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)   HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% sodium cholate to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. CFTR was further eluted from the resin using elution buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris   HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% sodium cholate) containing 5 mg/ml of the appropriate peptide antigen, synthesized by QCB (Hopkinton, MA). Fractions containing CFTR were pooled and concentrated using a Centricell 20 to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml (500  microl). CFTR was further purified using either gel filtration or ion exchange chromatography (14). Gel filtration chromatography was performed on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column preequilibrated with 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris   HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% sodium cholate, pH 7.5. Immunoaffinity-purified CFTR (200  microl) was applied to the column, fractions were collected, and CFTR was detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining. These fractions were pooled and concentrated, and CFTR was quantitated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (for details, see Ref. 14). In cases in which ion exchange chromatography was used, a 50-ml column of DEAE-Sepharose was equilibrated with 10 mM K2HPO4, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% -lysophosphatidylcholine, pH 7.5. Stripped membranes (100 mg) were solubilized in the above buffer, and the resulting 100,000-g supernatant was applied to the column. CFTR bound to DEAE-Sepharose under these conditions. After extensive washing of the resin with equilibration buffer, a linear gradient of 10-150 mM K2HPO4 was applied. CFTR eluted from the column at ~60-85 mM K2HPO4 (14)..

Purified CFTR obtained from insect Sf9 cells was subjected to 4-20% SDS gradient gel electrophoresis to identify potential protein contaminants ranging in size from  < 1 to 300 kDa. Electrophoresis was stopped before the bromophenol blue dye front reached the bottom of the gel. The gel was then overstained with silver to enhance sensitivity. Molecular size was estimated using markers obtained from GIBCO BRL (Grand Island, NY)..

Mouse mammary carcinoma (C127I) cells transfected with human epithelial CFTR (WT1 cells) were harvested by washing with ice-cold Ca2+-free PBS (5 ml), scraped with a rubber policeman, centrifuged, and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer [containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris   HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM sodium vanadate, 10  microg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10  microg/ml aprotinin] and then sonicated. Purified CFTR from Sf9 cells was prepared as indicated above. Protein determination was performed using the Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Briefly, each sample was mixed with dilution buffer (final concentrations 62.5 mM Tris   HCl, pH 6.5, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 50 mM DTT) and heated for 5 min at 60 degrees C. Proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes prewetted with methanol and soaked in transfer buffer for 15 min. Membranes were blocked with 5% dried milk and 0.5% nonimmune goat serum in TBST (50 mM Tris   HCl, pH 7.6, 141 mM NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) for 1 h. Blots were probed with one of two CFTR MAb (0.5-1  microg/ml; MAb 13-1 or MAb 24-1, Genzyme) in TBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 36-48 h at 4 degrees C. After three washings with TBST, membranes were incubated with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at 25 degrees C. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (Kirkegaard and Perry, Gaithersburg, MD)..

Immunoaffinity-purified CFTR was concentrated as described above and reconstituted using a modification of the procedure described by Bear et al. (3). An aliquot containing a known amount of CFTR (15-20  microg/ml) was added to 100  microl of a solution containing 15 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES; pH 7.4) and 0.5 mM EGTA and also containing 1 mg of a sonicated phospholipid mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and ergosterol (5:2:1:2 molar ratio) and 1% sodium cholate. After a 40-min incubation on ice, the mixture was dialyzed at 4 degrees C for 24 h against 15 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EGTA, pH 7.4, and 1.5% sodium cholate. Dialysis continued with daily changes of buffer for an additional 3 days against the same buffer without sodium cholate. The sample was further dialyzed against 15 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 150 mM sodium isethionate, pH 7.4, for 24 h. The resulting proteoliposomes were quickly frozen at 80 degrees C, thawed, and sonicated for 5 s in a bath sonicator (Lab Supplies, Hicksville, NY). In some cases, reconstitution of CFTR-containing proteoliposomes was conducted without freezing and thawing to avoid the potential denaturing of the protein..

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	18	Planar lipid bilayer studies. Purified CFTR from either transfected Sf9 or CHO cells was reconstituted into a lipid bilayer reconstitution system that has been previously used to assess CFTR-mediated Cl channel activity (3, 14). The reconstituted protein was either fused into the lipid bilayer by reconstitution of proteoliposomes with techniques previously described (3, 14) or applied directly to the lipid bilayer after elution through a Sephadex G-50 (fine) column to remove denaturing SDS. Reconstitution of CFTR under these conditions was conducted as follows. The glass rod used for painting the lipid bilayer was "dipped" consecutively in the CFTR-containing eluent and then into the lipid mixture used for forming the bilayer. This CFTR-containing mixture was used to break and repaint the lipid bilayer. To test the lack of detergent contamination as a potential source of "spurious" ion channel activity, equivalent samples of SDS were also eluted through a Sephadex G-50 column and/or incorporated into the bilayer as indicated above. None of the eluate SDS fractions tested showed a "nonspecific" leak conductance, either in the absence or presence of PKA. Thus reconstituted CFTR channel activity was only correlated with the presence of the protein and not with either contaminant SDS or protein degradation products that eluted before the protein. Experiments were also conducted with membrane preparations of CFTR-expressing WT1 cells (22) (data not shown). Either proteoliposomes containing purified CFTR or CFTR mixed with lipid components was fused to planar lipid bilayers by painting onto a 0.1-mm hole in a 13-mm polystyrene cuvette (Warner Instrument, Hamden, CT), as described by Alvarez (2). The phospholipid composition of the lipid bilayers was 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine (7:2:1, vol/vol/vol; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in n-decane (Aldrich Chemical, Milwaukee, WI) to a final concentration of 14, 6, and 0.5 mM, respectively. CFTR eluted through Sephadex G-50 (fine) was collected at a final concentration of 1.0  microg/ml in saline. The initial cis and trans solutions usually contained, respectively, 10 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS)-20  microM CaCl2 (pH 7.0) and 100 mM MgATP (pH 7.0). However, the solutions varied for the different experiments as indicated below..

To calculate the ATP-to-Cl perm-selectivity ratio (PATP/PCl) under asymmetrical conditions (ATP/Cl), single-channel conductances  [ = current (I) divided by holding potential (Vh)] were best fitted to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation, such that where i (species in trans compartment) and j (species in cis compartment) represent Cl or ATP, depending on their locations on either side of the membrane, Vh is in mV, zi and zj are the charges for species i and j, respectively, and Ci and Cj are the concentrations of i and j, respectively. Pi and Pj represent the permeability coefficients for the species i or j, respectively, and  = ziFVh/RT and  = zjFVh/RT, where F, R, and T are Faraday's constant, the gas constant, and absolute temperature, respectively.

The catalytic subunit of the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA; Sigma) was used at final concentrations ranging from 75 to 252 nM. The Cl channel blocker DPC (Fluka Chemical, Ronkonkoma, NY) was kept in a 100-fold stock solution (20 mM) in 50% water-ethanol. 4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (Sigma) and glibenclamide (RBI, Natick, MA) were kept in 10 mM stock solutions in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide. The MAb raised against amino acids 729-736 of the regulatory domain (R-domain) of CFTR (MAb 13-1, Genzyme) was directly diluted 1:100 in the intracellular or bathing solution from a stock solution (292  microg/ml). An inactive antibody was obtained by preheating the CFTR antibody for 30 min at 100 degrees C..

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	25	Cl and ATP currents of highly purified human epithelial CFTR. To assess the role of CFTR in electrodiffusional ATP transfer, human epithelial CFTR was expressed and purified from either Sf9 insect or mammalian CHO cells (14) and functionally reconstituted into a lipid bilayer system to measure ion channel activity as reported previously (3, 14). The summarized data of the various experimental conditions and preparations used are shown in Table 1. Purified material from either CHO (data not shown) or Sf9 cells (Fig. 1) (14) was reconstituted in a chamber containing either 50 mM KCl and 100 mM MgATP (data not shown) or 75 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM Tris ATP (Fig. 2A) in the cis and trans compartments, respectively. Both compartments contained 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, and the cis compartment also contained 200 nM PKA. Eight of nine experiments in KCl/MgATP and seven of nine experiments in MgCl2/Tris   ATP displayed anion-selective channel activity after PKA addition from the cis side of the chamber. Under the latter conditions, currents were observed in both directions (Fig. 2A), with at least two distinct (discernible) single-channel conductances of 8.57  plus or minus  0.16 pS (n = 10) and 34.3  plus or minus  0.32 pS (n = 7), respectively (Fig. 2B). The reversal potentials (Er ) were 2.17  plus or minus  1.83 mV (n = 10) and 0.35  plus or minus  0.29 mV (n = 7) and were thus consistent with a PATP/P Cl of 0.1 and 0.2, for the smaller and larger conductances, respectively. These values are in close agreement with the PATP/PCl values previously obtained from whole cell and single-channel currents of CFTR-expressing cells and calculated from the respective conductances with symmetrical concentrations of the two ions, in the range of 0.2-0.4 (22). A further indication that the CFTR molecule itself may be implicated in ATP transport is suggested by the observation that addition of the active, but not the heat-inactivated, anti-CFTR R-domain antibody 13-1 (Genzyme) inhibited simultaneously and almost completely both Cl and ATP currents of highly purified CFTR (Fig. 2C) in five of five experiments tested. These data further suggest that CFTR incorporation into the lipid reconstitution chamber was indeed functional and oriented as expected, with the PKA activation sites on the cis side of the membrane..

A: purified CFTR material from Sf9 cells, obtained as indicated in MATERIALS AND METHODS and used in reconstitution studies, was subjected to silver staining following electrophoresis on a 4-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Dye front was preserved to retain low-molecular-mass proteins. Presence of a band complex running at ~140 kDa was observed for 0.7  microg (lane 1) and 0.3  microg (lane 2) purified CFTR. This is in close agreement with previously reported data (14). Left lane, molecular mass markers. B: immunolabeling of CFTR was conducted with monoclonal antibody (MAb) 13-1 against CFTR on either purified material from Sf9 cells or membranes of either subconfluent or fully confluent CFTR-expressing WT1 cells. Top arrow indicates fully "mature" (i.e., glycosylated) CFTR. Lower arrow indicates nonglycosylated CFTR. Higher molecular mass CFTR complexes were also observed in Sf9 material..

CFTR was always incorporated from cis chamber, which also contained protein kinase A (PKA; 200 nM). Holding potentials (Vh), as indicated at top right of each tracing, were driven from trans chamber. c, Closed state. B: current-voltage (I-V) relationships of most common conductance states of channels observed in presence of 75 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM Tris ATP. Both Cl and ATP were readily permeable under these conditions. Solid lines, best fits to experimental points using Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation. Dashed lines, linear fits of experimental data, from the slopes of which single-channel conductances () were calculated (see Table 2). Smaller conductance represented 25% of larger one, and thus at least four levels could be recognized, in particular at 40 mV. C: both Cl (positive potentials; left) and ATP currents (negative potentials; right) were inhibited by addition to cis side of monoclonal antibody (MAb) 13-1 against regulatory domain of human epithelial CFTR. After antibody addition, open probability of single channels changed from 0.8 to 0.5 for positive potentials (left) and from 0.15 to 0.02 for negative potentials (right). Histograms beside tracings indicate increment in frequency of closed state (indicated with "c" and arrow) after antibody addition. Channels observed displayed characteristics remarkably similar to previously published data showing CFTR-associated channel activity under cell-attached conditions (9)..

Subconductance states of the ATP currents of purified human epithelial CFTR were observed (3 of 3 experiments) as indicated above, for currents driven by 100 mM Tris ATP. At least four identical current levels could be recognized, although the channel gated as a complex of the four levels. Expanded tracings indicated that channel levels "crept up" (Fig. 3B) from seemingly even smaller channel currents, which, as indicated in the third tracing, were consistent with a conductance of 4.5-5.6 pS (see dashed lines)..

CFTR was always incorporated from cis chamber, which also contained PKA (200 nM). Vh was 40 mV, thus indicating ATP currents. At least 4 identical current levels could be recognized, although channel gated as a complex of the 4 levels. B: expanded tracing of that indicated in A by solid bar. Channel levels "crept up" (asterisks) from seemingly even smaller channel currents, which, as indicated in third tracing, were consistent with a conductance of 4.5-5.6 pS (dashed lines).

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	33	Effect of low ATP on the Cl conductance of purified CFTR. To further determine the role of Cl in the single-channel permeability to ATP, experiments were also conducted in the presence of low cis (5-10 mM) MgATP and high N-methyl-D-glucamine chloride (300 mM) in the trans compartment (Fig. 4A). Both compartments also contained 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, and the cis compartment contained 200 nM PKA. Ion channel activity was observed with unitary conductances of 22.2  plus or minus  1.87 pS (n = 11) and 54.9  plus or minus  3.19 pS (n = 20; Fig. 4B). Interestingly, ion channel activity was also observed at positive potentials, indicating a sizable permeability to 10 mM MgATP (identical results were obtained either in the absence of cis MOPS or by its replacement with HEPES). The Er values of these two channel conductances were highly similar, 15.0  plus or minus  3.54 mV (n = 11) and 18.4  plus or minus  1.0 mV (n = 20, P  <  0.3), indicating a PATP/PCl on the order of 9.1-12.9, as obtained when fitting the data with the GHK equation (Fig. 4B). Under similar conditions, a higher conductance state of CFTR, 511  plus or minus  58.1 pS (n = 7), was also observed, albeit rarely, with similar Er and PATP/PCl of 15.6 mV and 12.6, respectively. In the presence of 300 mM cis Cl and only 6 mM trans MgATP, with the ionic gradients thus reversed, the single-channel conductance of purified CFTR was 26.6  plus or minus  3.50 pS (n = 16), with an Er of 16.2  plus or minus  3.98 mV (n = 16) and a PATP/PCl of 17.

To further determine the role of Cl in the single-channel permeability to ATP, experiments were also conducted in the presence of low cis (5-10 mM) MgATP and high N-methyl-D-glucamine chloride (300 mM) in the trans compartment (Fig. 4A). Both compartments also contained 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, and the cis compartment contained 200 nM PKA. Ion channel activity was observed with unitary conductances of 22.2  plus or minus  1.87 pS (n = 11) and 54.9  plus or minus  3.19 pS (n = 20; Fig. 4B).

With cis 10 mM MgATP and trans 100 mM MgATP (and similar buffer conditions as before), ATP channel currents were observed (Fig. 5, A and B), with single-channel conductance of 32.4  plus or minus  3.10 pS (n = 33; Fig. 5C). Addition of cis Cl, however, reduced the conductance of the ATP channel currents (Fig. 5D). Occasionally, a channel conductance of 235  plus or minus  40.8 pS (n = 5) was also observed. The Er ranged from 10.5  plus or minus  2.30 mV (n = 33) to 6.3  plus or minus  1.4 mV (n = 5), which was statistically different from the theoretical Er for MgATP2, (RT/zF)   ln([ATP]cis/[ATP]trans) = 29.1 mV (where [ATP]cis and [ATP]trans are the cis and trans concentrations of ATP, respectively; see Fig. 5C, bottom). Thus it is possible either that ATP4 (theoretical Er = 14 mV) makes a contribution to the ionic conductance of CFTR in the presence of MgATP or that CFTR is also permeable to Mg2+. In either case, the CFTR preparation was permeable to ATP, which was further determined by replacing ATP salts. In the presence of trans 100 mM Tris ATP (cis 10 mM MgATP), the single ATP channel conductance was 38.3  plus or minus  6.1 pS (n = 13), similar to that seen in the presence of MgATP. The Er shifted, however, to 52.6  plus or minus  14.0 mV (n = 13), consistent with a strong difference in the permeabilities of both free and Mg2+-complexed ATP. These findings indicate that, although CFTR is capable of Cl permeation, its ability to preferentially move Cl or ATP may depend not only on the driving force for the intracellular nucleotide ATP but also on the ATP species, the PATP/PCl, and the intracellular Cl concentration. Under physiological intracellular conditions (5 mM ATP and 30 mM Cl), ATP transport may be favored, however, as the electrochemical gradient for the multivalent ATP will be 1,000-fold higher than that for Cl (18, 22)..

This phenomenon has been observed by the cAMP-induced release of ATP from CFTR-expressing cells under physiological conditions (18), as well as by electrophysiological studies under highly nonphysiological conditions (22), which determined, nevertheless, the channellike nature of the PKA-induced ATP movement at the single-molecule level (17, 22, 23). This is in agreement with our observation that cAMP activation is associated with extrusion of ATP in wild-type (18) but not in 508 CFTR-expressing cells (8). The molecular steps associated with ATP movement in CFTR-expressing cells, however, have not been unequivocally determined. Although the simplest possible explanation for these findings is to implicate CFTR itself as the channel responsible for the ATP-permeable pathway, direct evidence to support this claim is still lacking..

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	42	ATP-permeable channels in CFTR-expressing cells may be a reflection of endogenous functional channel proteins that are regulated by, but are distinct from, CFTR. For example, expression of both mammalian (1) and Drosophila melanogaster (5) P-glycoproteins, CFTR congeners of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transport proteins, has been associated with the expression of ATP channel activity, thus raising the possibility that transport proteins other than CFTR are present in certain preparations. At least one recent report demonstrated an osmotically stimulated electrodiffusional ATP movement in human hepatoma cells seemingly devoid of CFTR (28). A direct role of CFTR in ATP movement has also been questioned by recent reports that failed to detect ATP-permeable channel activity in cells or preparations containing CFTR (13, 21). However, these studies also failed to detect "any" other ATP channel activity, which is inconsistent with the ATP release associated with CFTR expression (18, 23). This raises the possibility that the presence of putative ATP-permeable pathways in CFTR-expressing preparations may largely depend on the cellular (tissue) model under study and/or the nature of the ATP complexes driven. Alternate possibilities, however, may also entail more critical experimental conditions for determining ATP movement than previously expected. A previous study that failed to detect ATP release from CFTR-expressing cells (27), for example, may have simply failed to meet the technological parameters suitable for detecting the expected amounts of ATP released to the extracellular milieu (18). Furthermore, the possibility that under certain conditions, electroneutral ATP complexes are driven through channel structures cannot yet be ruled out..

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	44	In this report, we revisited the question as to whether CFTR is responsible for ATP movement. Reconstituted CFTR displayed ATP channel activity either in the absence or presence of Cl. Several (including large) conductance states were also observed (see summary of results in Table 2), in agreement with our original in vivo observations (9, 22). In those studies, both a 5-pS and a 50-pS ATP channel were observed. At least two other groups have observed single-channel ATP currents associated with CFTR expression with a similar "low" (5-pS) conductance (16, 17, 23). The issue of the single ATP channel conductance of CFTR may be confounded by the observation that both Cl and ATP modify each other's movement, thus changing the single-channel conductance of the ions in either direction (22). In the presence of extracellular 100 mM MgATP and 140 mM intracellular Cl, the single ATP channel conductances rectified with a limiting conductance of 24.8 pS (Fig. 9 of Ref. 22), which is different from the observed single-channel conductance for either ion alone (22). Furthermore, a recent study also detected Cl channel rectification by CFTR, which is a striking departure from the established paradigm of CFTR behavior (15). This report also summarizes previous data from the literature indicating that single-channel conductances from 7 to 13 pS have been previously attributed to CFTR (Ref. 15, see references within)..

This finding further suggests that both Cl and ATP may compete with each other for the conductance pore of the channel, as was originally reported in intact cells (22)..

The possibility that a functional CFTR is required to regulate ATP channels other than CFTR, however, cannot be easily ruled out, since, as indicated above, recent studies failed to detect any ATP-permeable channel activity in preparations containing CFTR (13, 21). At least one such study was conducted with a purified CFTR preparation similar to the one presented in this report (13). Thus a likely possibility is that activated CFTR, which is indeed permeable to Cl, may behave as an ATP-selective ion channel only under certain circumstances (see below). It should also be noted that these reports did not exactly mimic our present or previous studies. We have found that PKA activation of CFTR, for example, was readily observed (15 of 18 experiments) in experiments tested with daily fresh batches of PKA. However, under certain experimental conditions, namely the use of "older" PKA (prepared  > 24 h before the experiments), CFTR activation under Cl-free conditions also required the presence of sustained holding potentials (between +100 and +150 mV; 41 of 82 experiments). This finding may actually explain previous failed attempts to obtain single ATP channel currents from reconstituted CFTR in which PKA was absent (21) and further suggests the possibility that adjacent structures other than CFTR may also be required for proper channel activation in vivo (19)..

Concerning the electrodiffusional ATP movement by the murine mdr1 gene product, P-glycoprotein (1), for example, it was observed that a double mutation of this channel protein in either nucleotide-binding domain rendered the mutated P-glycoprotein completely unable to spontaneously release cellular ATP. However, voltage activation reestablished ATP transport and, interestingly, Cl channel activity associated with this protein as well (1). Similar findings have also been recently observed with the D. melanogaster mdr gene products Mdr65 and Mdr49 P-glycoprotein homologues, which were also voltage activated (5). Although it is unlikely that this activation process has any physiological significance, it raises the interesting possibility that other relevant intracellular factors that are absent in the purified CFTR preparation may be required for a proper PKA activation of CFTR. Under no circumstances, however, did voltage stimulation induce any ATP-permeable channel activity in the absence of PKA..

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	53	The present data also dispel a common misconception about the size of ATP as it is transported through this channel molecule. In solution, ATP takes various conformations by interacting with counterions other than Mg2+ (11). However, only one conformation has been observed for the MgATP2 complex, the relevant moiety associated with molecules that bind and/or hydrolyze ATP (4, 11). The average planar diameter of the MgATP complex under these conditions is  < 5 A (see Fig. 6), at least similar to, if not smaller than, the expected diameter of I, a CFTR-permeable anion (for details, see Fig. 6). Thus ATP "size" is not a constraint to movement through CFTR, provided that it is either free or complexed to Mg2+. Counterion-ATP complexes of larger sizes, however, may reflect different interactions with CFTR. A recent paper (13), reporting that purified CFTR was tested and failed to detect ATP transport, suggested that the K2ATP salt used in that study actually blocked Cl movement through CFTR. Because K+ is almost nine times larger than Mg2+, the larger K2ATP moiety is likely to be a blocking agent of CFTR channel activity. This is in agreement with an expected, undetectable, 0.14-pS K2ATP single-channel conductance (assuming a monovalent salt as the minimum size) calculated by extrapolating the single-channel conductance of 26.2 pS obtained in the present study, as a function of the counterionic radius of the MgATP complex..

Scaled color models of Mg2+-complexed ATP (MgATP2; B and D) and free ATP (A and C) were created with Chem3DPro molecular modeling system (version 3.0, 1990, Cambridge Scientific Computing, Cambridge, MA). C atoms, solid purple; O atoms, solid red; P atoms, striped red; H atoms, light blue. Mg atom is indicated as a green striped ball at bottom left center of B, and extreme left of D. A and B show phosphate groups covered by their respective oxygen atoms to left of molecule. C and D are 3-dimensional perspectives indicating pyridine ring toward front of molecule. Molecule (of either model) is largely oblong. Shorter diameter is drawn from steric distance between N1 and N3 of pyridine ring (2.46 A), and longer diameter is drawn from C2 and P17 (5.19 A). Thus phosphates "encircle" adenine moiety (using ribose as the hinge), such that their position is coordinated not only by nucleoside but also by their surrounding oxygens. In comparison, N1-N3 distance in MgATP2 was found to be identical to that of free ATP. However, arrangement of phosphates surrounding adenine moiety was completely different, as distance between C4 and O25, which is 0.719 A in ATP4, becomes 6.86 A in MgATP2. In addition, distance between C2 and P17, 5.19 A in free ATP, becomes 6.18 A (C2-P18) in MgATP2, thus suggesting that, although both models have similar diameters, MgATP seems to be "longer" than free ATP. Both structures were "minimized" for structural errors but not by their minimal energy conformations. Furthermore, it is also important to realize that ether bonds for either model were computed as 1.0, despite the fact that bond orders for high-energy phosphates are significantly shorter (on the order of 0.36-0.41), thus suggesting much smaller 3-dimensional structures (20). Model of free ATP, however, is almost identical (although without structural minimization) to that of Stryer's Biochemistry (Ref. 25, p. 329), although other possible conformations for MgATP2 (Ref. 25, p. 352) were not explored in above molecules..

Each ion seems to modify the permeability properties of the other, which may be due to either competition for one another at the conductance pore of the channel or the possibility that both ions have distinct, but mutually interactive, permeable pathways.

Each ion seems to modify the permeability properties of the other, which may be due to either competition for one another at the conductance pore of the channel or the possibility that both ions have distinct, but mutually interactive, permeable pathways. This is a phenomenon that will require further investigation. Interestingly, however, both the cis concentration of Cl and the trans concentration of ATP modified the single-channel conductance of CFTR..
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	58	In conclusion, the present data are consistent with the most likely, but not exclusive, possibility that CFTR permeates ATP. This is in close agreement with previous reports indicating that wild-type CFTR (9, 17, 22, 23), but not 508 CFTR (8), may be involved in ATP movement in vivo. "Contaminant" channels that are permeable to ATP but are distinct from CFTR cannot be ruled out, although the finding that preparations with different degrees of purification of CFTR, including the purified protein, show functional characteristics similar if not identical to those observed in vivo strongly suggest a direct role of this channel protein in ATP movement. Additional studies, including mutational analysis of this channel protein, will be required, however, to further assess the relevance of the CFTR-mediated ATP transport in the context of Cl vs. ATP transport and, most importantly, in the onset and reversal of the CF phenotype..

0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A-activated chloride channel that resides on the apical surface of epithelial cells. One unusual feature of this protein is that during biogenesis, 75% of wild type CFTR is degraded by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradative (ERAD) pathway. Examining the biogenesis and structural instability of the molecule has been technically challenging due to the limited amount of CFTR expressed in epithelia. Consequently, investigators have employed heterologous overexpression systems. Based on recent results that epithelial specific factors regulate both CFTR biogenesis and function, we hypothesized that CFTR biogenesis in endogenous CFTR expressing epithelial cells may be more efficient. To test this, we compared CFTR biogenesis in two epithelial cell lines endogenously expressing CFTR (Calu-3 and T84) with two heterologous expression systems (COS-7 and HeLa). Consistent with previous reports, 20 and 35% of the newly synthesized CFTR were converted to maturely glycosylated CFTR in COS-7 and HeLa cells, respectively. In contrast, CFTR maturation was virtually 100% efficient in Calu-3 and T84 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of the proteasome had no effect on CFTR biogenesis in Calu-3 cells, whereas it stabilized the immature form of CFTR in HeLa cells. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR indicated that CFTR message levels are 4-fold lower in Calu-3 than HeLa cells, yet steady-state protein levels are comparable. Our results question the structural instability model of wild type CFTR and indicate that epithelial cells endogenously expressing CFTR efficiently process this protein to post-Golgi compartments..

Misfolded membrane and secretory proteins are promptly recognized as such and degraded by the ER-associated degradation pathway (ERAD; reviewed in (1, 2). Understanding this process is critical, since a number of diseases, including cystic fibrosis, congenital hypothyrosis, and familial hypercholesterolemia are caused by protein folding defects that often arise from missense or deletion mutations (3, 4). Despite the fact that many of these mutations result in the production of proteins that retain some biological activity, they are rapidly degraded by ERAD, preventing proper targeting of the proteins to their biologically relevant destinations (reviewed in Ref. 5)..

Many of these proteins, including CFTR, are assembled in the cell membrane as part of a multiprotein complex (14, 15), suggesting that the molecular rationing of the components in these complexes might be regulated during biogenesis..

0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	9	CFTR is a large transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of two homologous halves, each containing six transmembrane segments (TMD1 and TMD2) and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1 and NBD2), that are connected by a regulatory domain (16). The 1480-amino acid protein is a member of the traffic ATPase or ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter family (17) and functions as a cAMP-regulated Cl- channel (18, 19) that regulates other ion conductive pathways including epithelial Cl-, Na+, and ATP transport (20-22). The most common mutation in CFTR, F508, results in the production of a protein that fails to exit the ER (13) and is rapidly degraded by ERAD (23-25). Interestingly, even the wild type protein is substrate for ERAD, with as much as 75% being degraded by the proteasome during biogenesis (13, 24, 25). Since only a small fraction of newly synthesized wild type CFTR reaches the cell surface where it performs its biological function, the question has often arisen as to why CFTR biogenesis so inefficient. A study by Tector and Hartl (26) suggested the possibility that transmembrane segment 6 in TMD1 is unstable due to 3 charged residues within this domain. Substitution of these residues with non-charged amino acids resulted in an increase in protein stability but a loss of chloride transport (26), suggesting that protein stability had been compromised for biological function. This hypothesis has not been evaluated in cells endogenously expressing CFTR..

0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	11	It has been suggested that an appropriate cellular context may be necessary to support proper membrane protein trafficking (reviewed in Refs. 27 and 28). In addition, it is possible that altered protein trafficking may result from the use of overexpression systems or non-physiological experimental conditions (reviewed in Bertrand et al. (28)). Given that the initial studies of CFTR biogenesis were performed primarily in transfected, heterologous overexpression systems, a careful analysis of endogenous CFTR biogenesis both in the early (ER) and post-Golgi pathways is warranted. Heterologous systems may lack CFTR binding partners such as EBP50, syntaxin 1A, and CAL (15, 29-33), and association of these and other proteins with CFTR may be required for proper maturation and/or trafficking..

Metabolic pulse-chase analysis of CFTR in these cells grown under both nonpolarizing and polarizing conditions indicated that core glycosylated (Band B) CFTR is very efficiently (100%) processed to a maturely glycosylated (Band C) protein that is extremely stable. Moreover, quantitative cell surface biotinylation assays revealed that the CFTR surface pool is substantially elevated in Calu-3 cells compared with heterologous expression systems. Thus, endogenous CFTR maturation differs fundamentally from the patterns reported in recombinant overexpression systems, and these differences extend across multiple cellular compartments. Our findings cast doubt upon the viewpoint that wild type CFTR protein maturation is inefficient..

One-step RT-PCR was performed on serial dilutions of RNA isolates using Master Mix Reagent kit and Assay-on-Demand Gene Expression Probes (Applied Biosystems, CFTR Assay ID: HS00357011_m1). 6-Carboxylfluorescein was chosen as reporter dye at the 5'-end of the probe and minor groove binder as the quencher at the 3'-end. The 5' nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase cleaves the probe and generates a fluorescent signal proportional to the amount of starting target template. Each reporter signal is then divided by the fluorescence of an internal reference dye 5-carboxy-X-rhodamine, to normalize for non-PCR-related fluorescence. The TaqMan RT-PCR reaction was performed in a final volume of 20  microl containing 0.5  microl of RNA, 10  microl of TaqMan One-step RT-PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.5  microl of Multiscribe/RNase inhibitor, and 1  microl of 20x primer/probe set for CFTR and/or 18 S rRNA as endogenous control. Six 10-fold serial dilutions (100-10-6) of RNA samples isolated from the models cell lines were amplified in duplicates using CFTR and/or 18 S endogenous control. Data were exported from the ABI Prism 7900SDS software into Microsoft Excel where relative standard curves were plotted. Using the Excel Trendline option, a line of best fit was plotted. Data from each cell line were analyzed based on these standard curves and relative quantities were extrapolated. CFTR values were normalized to 18 S by dividing the CFTR values by the corresponding 18 S values from the same sample according to the Applied Biosystems relative quantification method.

Relative amounts of CFTR expressed in each cell type were calculated based on densitometry and are shown in Fig. 1A. In COS-7 cells, CFTR expression levels are dependent upon transfection efficiency, while in HeLa and Calu-3 cells, the expression levels were consistently high. Since the relative expression level in Calu-3 cells was similar to HeLa cells stably expressing wild type CFTR, we selected Calu-3 cells for the initial analysis..

In transfected COS-7 cells, wild type CFTR expression levels were analyzed 48 h after transfection. HeLa cells stably expressing CFTR, and Calu-3 cells endogenously expressing the protein, were grown under standard conditions and tested at 80% confluence. CFTR was immunoprecipitated from 250  microg of total protein from each cell type using an anti-CFTR C-terminal monoclonal antibody, 24-1. Immunoprecipitated CFTR was in vitro phosphorylated with protein kinase A and [-32P]ATP and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. A representative gel of four is shown (upper panel). The relative amounts of wild type CFTR expressed in each of the cell lines were calculated based on densitometry (lower panel). The averages  plus or minus  S.D. were calculated from four independent experiments. B, CFTR mRNA levels are significantly lower in Calu-3 cells than in HeLa cells. CFTR message levels in HeLa and Calu-3 cells were tested using semiquantitative RT-PCR using GAPDH as control (upper panel, representative gel is shown) and TaqMan quantitative PCR using 18 S rRNA as control (lower panel). Results are plotted as CFTR mRNA levels relative to 18 S rRNA, mean and S.D. of four separate samples amplified under the same condition. In contrast to slightly lower CFTR protein levels, CFTR message levels are 4-fold higher in HeLa cells..
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	34	  The simplest explanation for high CFTR levels both in HeLa and Calu-3 cells is that they have similar CFTR mRNA levels, protein synthetic rates, and stability. To compare CFTR mRNA levels in HeLa and Calu-3 cells, we developed a semiquantitative RT-PCR using GAPDH as an internal control. As shown in Fig. 1B, while GAPDH message levels are similar, CFTR message levels are significantly higher in HeLa cells than in Calu-3 (in contrast to rather similar protein levels (Fig. 1A)). To further assess these differences, we also performed TaqMan Quantitative PCR (Fig. 1C). The results of the real-time experiments establish that CFTR message levels in HeLa cells are 3.5-fold higher than in Calu-3 cells. These findings imply that the high steady-state levels of CFTR in Calu-3 cells must be due to increased translational rate, increased maturation efficiency, extended protein half-life, or some combination of these effects..

In these experiments, we compared the amount of the newly synthesized Band B CFTR and its conversion to the fully glycosylated Band C CFTR in each cell type. The results indicate that significantly more CFTR was synthesized in COS-7 and HeLa cells than in Calu-3 cells, as was first described by Cheng et al. (13). The conversion of the immaturely glycosylated CFTR to the maturely glycosylated form was extremely inefficient, with 27  plus or minus  7.1% (mean  plus or minus  S.D.; n = 7) maturation efficiency in COS-7 cells and 39  plus or minus  5.1% (n = 11) in HeLa (Fig. 2A). In contrast, while the amount of the newly synthesized Band B form of CFTR was the lowest in Calu-3 cells, the maturation efficiency was 92.4  plus or minus  8% (n = 11) after 4 h (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that although less CFTR was being produced in Calu-3 cells, the protein was processed much more efficiently to the mature form. Furthermore, comparing the total densities of Band B and Band C CFTR over the 4-h chase indicated that the total densities remain constant. This suggests that there is no early degradation, and all newly synthesized Band B is converted into Band C, and that the maturation only reaches maximum after 4 h of the pulse..

COS-7, HeLa, and Calu-3 cells were pulse-labeled with 300 mCi/ml 35S-labeled amino acids (EasyTag Protein Labeling Mixture, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After the pulse, the [35S]methionine/cysteine-containing medium was replaced with complete medium. Cells were lysed at the time points specified, and CFTR was immunoprecipitated with anti-CFTR 24-1 antibody. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 6% gels and analyzed using a Phosphorimager (Amersham Biosciences). CFTR maturation efficiency was measured by comparing the density of labeled band B (100%) after a 30-min pulse to the density of Band C after 4 h of chase using IPLab software. A, average maturation efficiencies at the end of a 4-h chase in each cell line tested. Results are plotted as percent of newly synthesized Band B converted to Band C by the end of a 4-h chase (average + S.D., n = number of experiments). B, representative pulse-chase experiments are shown for each cell line (left panels). Arrows indicate the core (Band B) and fully glycosylated (Band C) CFTR. Average disappearance of Band B (maturation and/or degradation) and formation of Band C at each time point (right panels). Disappearance of Band B (diamonds) and formation of Band C (squares) were calculated based on densitometry at each chase time point. Results are plotted as percent of band B density at the 0 time point (average + S.D., n = 5)..

Using a more extended chase period in the metabolic labeling experiments, we found that CFTR half-lives were 10.8  plus or minus  2.5 h (mean  plus or minus  S.D.) in COS-7 cells, 12.3  plus or minus  1.7 h in HeLa cells, and 22.0  plus or minus  4.2 h in Calu-3 cells (Fig. 3). The results indicate that CFTR is more stable in Calu-3 cells compared with heterologous cells. Therefore, more efficient CFTR maturation and elongated protein half-lives contribute to the high steady state CFTR levels in these cells..

Because CFTR maturation approaches 100% efficiency in Calu-3 cells, we hypothesized that the disappearance of Band B CFTR in these cells is clearly the result of maturation and not degradation by the proteasome. To test this possibility, we compared the effects of two proteasome inhibitors (ALLN (50  microM) (48) and clasto-lactacystin--lactone (10  microM) (49)) on the half-lives of Band B CFTR in HeLa and Calu-3 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, while 50  microM ALLN caused a significant increase in the half-life of Band B CFTR in HeLa cells, it had no effect on the stability of the immature CFTR in Calu-3 cells, suggesting that the core-glycosylated protein is not a substrate for ERAD in Calu-3 cells. Similar results were seen when the proteasome was blocked using 10  microM clasto-lactacystin--lactone (data not shown). These results support our hypothesis that in Calu-3 cells all newly synthesized, core-glycosylated CFTR is processed to the fully glycosylated form, and therefore, there is no role for the proteasome in the early events of CFTR processing in Calu-3 cells..

The results shown in Fig. 5A indicate that the biotinylated CFTR pool in COS-7 cells was 11  plus or minus  2.2% (mean  plus or minus  S.D.), in HeLa was 9.7  plus or minus  1.5%, and in Calu-3 was 20  plus or minus  4.0%. Since Calu-3 cells were grown on plastic dishes under standard tissue culture conditions; we tested whether growing the cells on semipermeable supports as polarized monolayers affects CFTR surface expression. After growing the cells for 9-12 days on 12-mm filters, the cells formed tight monolayers as monitored by measuring transepithelial resistance ( > 800  cm2). Under these conditions, the biotinylated CFTR fraction was 17  plus or minus  5%, similar to non-polarized cells. These results demonstrate that the surface CFTR pool in Calu-3 cells is higher, but cell polarity does not affect the relative surface pool..

In these assays, the total CFTR from 50% of the lysates (T) was compared with the biotinylated fraction (B). Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and CFTR was immunoprecipitated using anti-CFTR C-terminal (24-1) monoclonal antibody. From the other 50% of the lysates, CFTR was immunoprecipitated as described above, eluted, and re-captured using avidin-Sepharose beads (biotinylated CFTR (B)). Total CFTR (T) and biotinylated CFTR (B) were in vitro phosphorylated with protein kinase A and [-32P]ATP, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Phosphorimaging and densitometry. Representative gels of seven or more experiments are shown. The average percentage of biotinylated CFTR for each cell type was calculated based on densitometry. B, CFTR distribution in Calu-3 monolayers. Calu-3 cells were grown on permeable supports and analyzed after 10-12 days of culture using indirect immunofluorescence. CFTR was labeled with 24-1 monoclonal antibody and anti-mouse IgG, Alexa-Fluor488 (green). Tight junctions were stained using a polyclonal (rabbit) anti-ZO1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and anti-rabbit IgG Alexa-Fluor596 (red).

To confirm that Calu-3 cells had formed polarized monolayers, we monitored the expression a ZO-1, a marker for tight junctions (red) (51), and CFTR (green) localization in the Calu-3 cells using immunocytochemistry (Fig. 5B). The results shown in Fig. 5B indicate that the Calu-3 cells have formed tight monolayers as evidenced by ZO-1 staining (red) close to the apical surface and that CFTR (green) is found both at the cell surface and in intracellular sites. Next, we tested whether the rate and efficiency of CFTR maturation was affected by cell polarity. The results shown in Fig. 5C confirm that similar to conventional tissue culture conditions (Fig. 2, A and B), CFTR maturation is also efficient under polarizing conditions ( > 90%). Interestingly, these experiments in Calu-3 monolayers suggested that the amount of radiolabeled CFTR dramatically decreased compared with non-polarized conditions and that rates of conversion of newly synthesized (Band B) CFTR to fully glycosylated (Band C) CFTR was slower than under standard conditions.

Fig. 6A indicates that steady state CFTR protein levels are highest in Calu-3 cells. In T84 and HT29 cells, CFTR levels are 3- and  > 10-fold lower than in Calu-3, respectively (Fig. 6A). TaqMan RT-PCR measurements demonstrated that CFTR message levels in T84 cells are 4-fold and in HT29 are 10-fold lower than in Calu-3 cells grown under the same conditions (Fig. 6B). Because of low transcription and consequent low translation of CFTR in HT29 cells, only T84 cells synthesized sufficient amounts of the protein to effectively follow maturation efficiency. As shown in Fig. 6C, although CFTR synthetic levels were quite low and maturation efficiency in the early chase periods was variable, by the end of the 4th h into the chase, the maturation of the newly synthesized protein was virtually 100% in T84 cells. These results indicate that efficient processing of endogenous wild type CFTR is not a unique feature of Calu-3 cells but also exists in a colonic epithelial cell line..

Therefore, it is now clear that disappearance of Band B could be due to both degradation and maturation. In our studies, proteasome blockade revealed that in Calu-3 cells disappearance of band B was not due to proteasomal degradation, whereas in HeLa cells it partially was..

This finding is supported by studies showing that CFTR half-life in heterologous systems is 8-12 h (38, 52), whereas in LLC-PK1 (54) and in MDCK cells (55), two kidney epithelial cells stably expressing the wild type CFTR, the half-life is significantly longer when the cells are grown under polarized conditions. Increased stability of the mature wild type CFTR in epithelial cells is also consistent with our previous findings that growing MDCK cells as polarized monolayers results in increased steady-state CFTR levels and function. Furthermore, possible cell type-specific differences in wild type CFTR biogenesis and stability are suggested by our findings that cellular polarization in Calu-3 cells did not have a significant effect on total and cell surface CFTR levels in contrast to our previous findings in MDCK cells (56)..

The dynamics and precise cellular localization of this pool remain unclear, but several studies (44, 57-61) have indicated that CFTR is found in endosomal and recycling endosomal compartments. How regulation of surface localized CFTR is accomplished in polarized epithelia and whether there is a physiological role for the intracellular pool remain open questions..

However, dramatic progress has been made recently in identifying tissue-specific factors that organize the delivery and function of transport proteins to their appropriate membrane domains (27, 62-64). These results suggest that both the cellular context and molecular rationing of transport components are important not only for proper function but also for intracellular trafficking (27, 64). Nevertheless, normal epithelial cell function depends on the accurate delivery of a large number of membrane components to a particular cell surface domain, and defects in this process often lead to disease (3, 4). Therefore, it is crucial to understand how different cell types organize the biogenesis and intracellular processing of key molecules (27, 28). Since CFTR plays a central role in the regulation of epithelial ion transport in multiple organ systems, understanding its biogenesis, cellular distribution, and stability in epithelia may be the first step toward identifying the molecular defects leading to early degradation of otherwise functional mutants, such as F508 CFTR..

0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	63	The importance of elucidating the biogenesis and intracellular journey of wild type CFTR is also underscored by two publications indicating that some F508 CFTR can be found at the cell surface in native epithelia (65, 66). These earlier reports raise the possibility that in the correct physiological milieu, even the mutant protein might traffic differently than reported in heterologous expression systems. Furthermore, a number of CFTR-associating proteins have been identified and shown to regulate either the function (32) or the intracellular journey of CFTR (33). Whether these or other yet to be identified proteins have any effect on the biogenesis and stability of the wild type protein in native epithelia remains to be determined. Although endogenous, wild type CFTR synthesis is quite low in many native tissues, our results suggest the usefulness of cell lines endogenously expressing CFTR as powerful tools for investigating cell type-specific differences in CFTR biogenesis and function..

0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	5	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) contains two membrane-spanning domains; each consists of six transmembrane segments joined by three extracellular and two intracellular loops of different length. To examine the role of intracellular loops in CFTR channel function, we studied a deletion mutant of CFTR (19 CFTR) in which 19 amino acids were removed from the intracellular loop joining transmembrane segments IV and V. This mutant protein was expressed in a human embryonic kidney cell line (293 HEK). Fully mature glycosylated CFTR (170 kDa) was immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with wild-type CFTR cDNA, while cells transfected with the mutant gene expressed only a core-glycosylated form (140 kDa). The chloride efflux rate (measured by 6-methoxyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl) quinolinium SPQ fluorescence) from cells expressing wild-type CFTR increased 600% in response to forskolin. In contrast, 19 CFTR-expressing cells had no significant response to forskolin. Western blotting performed on subcellular membrane fractions showed that 19 CFTR was located in the same fractions as F508 CFTR, a processing mutant of CFTR. These results suggest that 19 CFTR is located in the intracellular membranes, without reaching the cell surface. Upon reconstitution into lipid bilayer membranes, 19 CFTR formed a functional Cl channel with gating properties nearly identical to those of the wild-type CFTR channel. However, 19 CFTR channels exhibited frequent transitions to a 6-picosiemens subconductance state, whereas wild-type CFTR channels rarely exist in this subconductance state. These data suggest that the intracellular loop is involved in stabilizing the full conductance state of the CFTR Cl channel..

These results suggest that 19 CFTR is located in the intracellular membranes, without reaching the cell surface. Upon reconstitution into lipid bilayer membranes, 19 CFTR formed a functional Cl channel with gating properties nearly identical to those of the wild-type CFTR channel. However, 19 CFTR channels exhibited frequent transitions to a 6-picosiemens subconductance state, whereas wild-type CFTR channels rarely exist in this subconductance state. These data suggest that the intracellular loop is involved in stabilizing the full conductance state of the CFTR Cl channel..

Deletion of a portion of the putative cytosolic loops between two transmembrane repeats of the Na channel slows the rate of channel inactivation(16) . To investigate the role of the intracellular loops of CFTR in Cl channel function, we studied a deletion mutant of CFTR (19 CFTR) in which 19 amino acids were removed from the intracellular loop joining transmembrane segments IV and V in the first membrane-spanning domain. This is the largest and most hydrophilic loop in the first membrane-spanning domain, as one-third of the residues in this loop are charged. These features make this loop a candidate for electrostatic or allosteric interactions with other cytosolic domains of CFTR (nucleotide-binding folds, the regulatory domain, or other intracellular loops) and cellular proteins to contribute to channel function..

The glass coverslip was mounted in a chamber on a stage heated to 37  degrees C, which was arranged for continuous flow of warmed buffer solutions and studied one-by-one using an upright Zeiss epifluorescence microscope. Fluorescence was excited at 355 nm (Omega Optical Inc., Brattleboro, VT) by a 75-watt xenon lamp. Excitation light was reflected by a 400-nm fused silica dichroic mirror (Omega Optical Inc.) and illuminated the cells through a 20 objective (numerical aperature of 0.75, working distance of 0.66 mm; Nikon Inc., Garden City, NY). Emitted light was filtered by a 450-nm lens and detected by a microchannel plate image intensifier (Model KS-1381) in series with a CCD-200 solid-state video camera (Video Scope International, Ltd., Washington, D. C.). The images were quantified with a Model MVP-AT frame grabber board (Matrox, Quebec, Canada) mounted internally in a host 386 computer and processed with Image-1 Fl software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Every image taken (0.26 s) represents the average of 16 images. Successive images were recorded at a rate of 1 every 5 s. The ``blank field'' obtained by closing the camera shutter was used as background image and subtracted prior to acquisition of the images. SPQ fluorescence was calibrated by measuring the fluorescence in the absence of chloride (maximum fluorescence) and in the presence of a solution that quenched all the SPQ fluorescence (150 mM KSCN, 10  microM valinomycin). Photobleaching was corrected by subtracting a straight line that connects the two points at the beginning of the experiment and before KSCN + valinomycin application.

Microsomes were collected by centrifugation of the post-mitochondrial supernatant (6000 g, 20 min, 4  degrees C) at 100,000 g for 45 min and resuspended with either 600  microl of isotonic buffer (250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2) or prephosphorylation buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 5 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl, 100 units/ml cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit). Further separation of plasma and intracellular membranes was carried out in a discontinuous sucrose gradient (10,000 g, 6 h, 4  degrees C) in a swinging bucket rotor (SW 28). Each fraction (I-V) was collected at the interface of the two sucrose gradients. Subsequently, an abbreviated fractionation scheme was used that separated F508 CFTR from the wild type and ``intracellular membrane'' from ``plasma membrane.'' In this experiment, cells were washed and lysed in buffer as before, except that diisopropyl fluorophosphate was not included. The post-mitochondrial supernatant was spun at 12,000 g for 30 min to give intracellular membrane (Fig. 5C, IM), and the supernatant was spun at 100,000 g for 45 min to give plasma membrane (PM)..

To confirm CFTR expression, the immunoprecipitation/Western blot assay was performed on the transfected cells. Cells transfected with pCEP4(WT) expressed a readily detectable amount of a fully glycosylated form of the CFTR protein with a molecular mass of 170 kDa, while the untransfected cells did not (Fig. 2). Cells transfected with either pCEP4(F508) or pCEP4(19) showed a dominant band at 140 kDa (Fig. 2), which probably corresponds to the core-glycosylated form of CFTR. Consistent with other studies(22, 23) , F508 CFTR, which is incompletely glycosylated at 37  degrees C, displayed increased glycosylation when the culture temperature was lowered to 26  degrees C (Fig. 2, lane 5). However, incubation of pCEP4(19)-transfected cells at 26  degrees C for 2 days did not increase the amount of 19 CFTR protein in the fully glycosylated form (Fig. 2, lane 7). The amount of 140-kDa protein associated with both F508 CFTR and 19 CFTR increased significantly following the lower temperature incubation (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 7), probably due to the slower degradation of the abnormal protein in the intracellular organelles..

Cells transfected with either pCEP4(F508) or pCEP4(19) showed a dominant band at 140 kDa (Fig. 2), which probably corresponds to the core-glycosylated form of CFTR. Consistent with other studies(22, 23) , F508 CFTR, which is incompletely glycosylated at 37  degrees C, displayed increased glycosylation when the culture temperature was lowered to 26  degrees C (Fig. 2, lane 5). However, incubation of pCEP4(19)-transfected cells at 26  degrees C for 2 days did not increase the amount of 19 CFTR protein in the fully glycosylated form (Fig. 2, lane 7). The amount of 140-kDa protein associated with both F508 CFTR and 19 CFTR increased significantly following the lower temperature incubation (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 7), probably due to the slower degradation of the abnormal protein in the intracellular organelles..

However, other studies have shown that some CFTR mutants produce the fully glycosylated form in quantities too small to be detected by the above assay, but can nevertheless result in functional channels at the cell surface(23, 24) . To test the surface function of 19 CFTR, the SPQ assay was performed on pCEP4(19)-transfected cells using pCEP4(WT)-transfected cells as a positive control and untransfected cells as a negative control. Representative traces of chloride movement for five to six cells of each cell line in the absence and presence of 10  microM forskolin are depicted in Fig. 3. A decrease in SPQ fluorescence indicates Cl influx, and an increase in fluorescence indicates Cl efflux. Forskolin failed to elicit an increase in the rate of Cl efflux in untransfected 293 HEK cells (Fig. 3A). Wild-type CFTR-transfected cells, on the other hand, exhibited a significant increase in the rate of Cl efflux upon forskolin stimulation (Fig. 3B). In cells transfected with 19 CFTR, stimulation of the rate of Cl efflux by forskolin was not statistically different from that of untransfected cells (Fig. 3C). Data from multiple experiments are summarized in Fig. 4. Incubation of the 19 CFTR-expressing cells at 26  degrees C for 15-48 h did not increase the rate of Cl efflux following forskolin stimulation (Fig. 4). This result is consistent with the immunoprecipitation/Western blot studies (Fig. 2), which indicate that little or no 19 CFTR reaches the Golgi apparatus for final glycosylation and presumably does not transport to the plasma membrane..

However, this processing mutant maintained functional Cl channel activity, presumably in the intracellular organelles, when reconstituted into lipid bilayer membranes. The most notable difference between wild-type and 19 CFTR channels lies in the distribution of conductance states. The deletion mutation caused frequent occurrence of a subconductance state within the Cl channel..

Most of the F508 CFTR protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and fails to reach its intended site of action in the plasma membrane. With regard to processing at 37  degrees C, 19 CFTR appears to be similar to F508 CFTR. However, F508 CFTR appears in the fully mature glycosylated form and can traffic to the plasma membrane following incubation at lower temperature (26-30  degrees C) (Fig. 2)(22, 23) . Unlike F508 CFTR, the misprocessing of 19 CFTR is temperature-insensitive: the protein remained in the core-glycosylated state in intracellular organelles even at 26  degrees C. The F508 CFTR proteins, once at the plasma membrane, give rise to functional Cl channels similar to those of wild-type CFTR in terms of open probability (26) and conductance state(24, 26) ..

Maturation of CFTR from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane involves several processing and post-translational modifications (e.g. folding and glycosylation). The endoplasmic reticulum membrane contains other proteins, including various types of chaperons, that could interact with CFTR and alter the function of the Cl channel. However, the gating kinetics and open probability of the 19 CFTR channel in the intracellular membrane are similar to those of the wild-type CFTR channel in the plasma membrane, so the deletion of these 19 amino acids did not alter the essential function of the CFTR Cl channel. Moreover, the wild-type CFTR channel occasionally enters the O2 subconductance state characteristic of the 19 CFTR channel. These observations suggest that the subconductance state associated with the 19 CFTR Cl channel is probably an intrinsic property of the CFTR protein, but the deletion affects CFTR in such a way as to favor the O2 conductance state..

We have addressed the role of the  subunit (Sec61) during cotranslational protein translocation. With a reconstituted system, we show that a Sec61 complex lacking Sec61 is essentially inactive when elongation and membrane targeting of a nascent chain occur at the same time. The translocation process is perturbed at a step where the nascent chain would be inserted into the translocation channel. However, if sufficient time is given for the interaction of the nascent polypeptide with the mutant Sec61 complex, translocation is almost normal. Thus Sec61 kinetically facilitates cotranslational translocation, but is not essential for it..

The translating ribosome binds tightly to the ER membrane (Connolly et al., 1989; Crowley et al., 1993, 1994; Kalies et al., 1994), and the growing nascent polypeptide chain is transferred directly from the channel in the ribosome into a channel in the membrane (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975; Connolly et al., 1989; Simon and Blobel, 1991; Gorlich et al., 1992b; Gorlich and Rapoport, 1993)..

The signal recognition particle (SRP) receptor is required to target a ribosome- nascent chain complex to the ER membrane. The function of the TRAM protein is still unclear; it is only required for the translocation of a subset of proteins (Gorlich et al., 1992a; Voigt et al., 1996). The Sec61 complex represents the essential core of the translocation machinery in the ER membrane. It consists of three subunits, an  subunit (Sec61) that spans the membrane 10 times, and  and  subunits (Sec61 and Sec61, respectively) that each span the membrane a single time..

First, it is the major constituent of the protein conducting membrane channel. Cross-linking experiments have shown that its  subunit is in continuous proximity of nascent polypeptide chains passing through the membrane (Mothes et al., 1994). Recent electron microscopic data demonstrate that the Sec61 complex can form cylindrical oligomers that presumably represent the channels (Hanein et al., 1996; Beckmann et al., 1997). Second, the Sec61 complex is tightly associated with membrane-bound ribosomes and is likely to be the ribosome receptor (Gorlich et al., 1992b; Kalies et al., 1994; Jungnickel and Rapoport, 1995).

Whereas the presence of a multi-spanning  subunit in a channel-forming protein complex may not be surprising, the role of the two small single-spanning polypeptide chains remains mysterious. A particular enigma is the  subunit. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the simultaneous deletion of the  subunits of the two homologous Sec61 complexes (Sec61p and the Ssh1p complex) is not lethal; the cells only show a growth defect at elevated temperatures (Finke et al., 1996). Thus, despite the fact that the protein is evolutionarily highly conserved, it does not appear to be absolutely required in vivo. Posttranslational protein transport across yeast ER membranes in vitro is reduced, but not completely prevented, when the  subunits are lacking. At which point the transport process is inhibited, and whether the  subunits play any role in the cotranslational mode of protein transport has not yet been investigated..

The transport of proteins across the ER membrane must be intimately coupled to their modification and folding, and it seems possible that the  subunit could be involved in interactions between the translocation channel and modifying enzymes or chaperones. A physical association of these proteins with the channel may enhance the efficiency of their function. A good example is the signal peptidase, an abundant enzyme whose active site is in the lumen of the ER. Although it can cleave the signal peptide of even completed polypeptide chains, its efficiency is probably much higher when it can act on polypeptide chains that are just emerging from the translocation channel into the lumen of the ER. One may therefore predict its physical association with channel constituents. The signal peptidase complex is composed of five membrane protein subunits (Evans et al., 1986), two with an active site for enzymatic activity, one with a lumenal domain of unknown function, and two (12 and 25 kD) with cytosolic domains. The function of the latter is particularly unclear because they cannot contribute to the enzymatic activity on the lumenal side of the membrane, and are not essential for the viability of yeast cells (Lively and Walsh, 1983; Fang et al., 1996; Kalies and Hartmann, 1996; Mullins et al., 1996). They would be especially good candidates to serve as linkers to the translocation channel..

(A) To produce proteoliposomes lacking Sec61 ribosome-free membranes (PK-RM) were solubilized under conditions where the Sec61 complex dissociates into its subunits. The detergent extract was immunodepleted with an antibody column directed against Sec61 or was incubated with protein A-Sepharose to generate a mock-depleted extract. After reconstitution the proteoliposomes and PK-RM were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a radioactively labeled secondary antibody and a PhosphorImager system for quantitation. (B) The membranes and proteoliposomes analyzed in A were tested for their competence to translocate polypeptides. Preprolactin mRNA was translated in the wheat germ system in the presence of SRP and microsomes or proteoliposomes, respectively, at 26 degrees C (lanes 2-8). In a parallel experiment translation was started in the absence of microsomes. After addition of membranes or proteoliposomes, respectively, the targeting reaction was carried out at 0 degrees C followed by an elongation at 26 degrees C (lanes 10-16).

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	47	Since Sec61 is not essential in yeast, we wondered if the mammalian Sec61 complex lacking this component may show in vitro translocation activity under less stringent conditions than used before. We therefore performed the translocation reaction such that more time would be allowed for the membrane binding of the ribosome- nascent chain complex. Translation of the full-length transcript coding for preprolactin was initially carried out in the presence of SRP but absence of membranes. This leads to a translational arrest when the polypeptide chain reaches a length of ~70 residues. The membranes were then added at 0 degrees C, conditions that allow efficient membrane binding of the ribosome-nascent chain complexes but no chain elongation. The samples were then warmed up to 26 degrees C to continue translation and concomitant translocation. With this protocol, proteoliposomes lacking Sec61 were active in translocation, although their activity was lower by a factor of three compared with the wild-type complex (Fig. 1 B, lane 16 vs. lane 15). Thus, the depleted proteoliposomes are capable to translocate polypeptides if given enough time in the membrane targeting reaction. The results also indicate that the Sec61 complex lacking its  subunit has not been irreversibly denatured during the prolonged immunodepletion procedure. These data suggest that the ribosome-nascent chain complex was targeted to the membrane and thus brought in contact with the signal peptidase, but that a subsequent translocation step was perturbed. We also found that a fragment of preprolactin of 86 amino acids could be efficiently targeted to reconstituted proteoliposomes and reached a protease-protected state even if Sec61 was lacking (data not shown), supporting the conclusion that insertion of the nascent chain into the Sec61-depleted translocation site can occur if no chain elongation is going on..

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	52	Our data suggested that in the absence of Sec61, the binding of the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the ER membrane is less efficient. This could be due to either a defect in the interaction of the mutated Sec61 complex with the ribosome, or to a perturbed insertion of the nascent chain into the translocation site. We therefore analyzed whether the  subunit plays a role in ribosome binding. Depleted and mock-depleted proteoliposomes were incubated at physiological salt concentrations with radioactively labeled ribosomes and increasing amounts of unlabeled ribosomes, both lacking nascent polypeptide chains. Under these conditions, the ribosomes interact mainly with the Sec61 complex (Kalies et al., 1994). To separate the unbound from the bound fraction, the membranes were floated in a sucrose gradient. Scatchard plot analysis was used to estimate the number of binding sites and the apparent dissociation constants (Fig. 2). Both the depleted and mock-depleted proteoliposomes were found to bind ribosomes with approximately the same binding constant. Also, the number of binding sites was about the same. The measured parameters are in good agreement with published data for the binding of ribosomes to PK-RM and proteoliposomes (Kalies et al., 1994), although the dissociation constants seem to be somewhat higher at 26 degrees  than at 0 degrees C. Thus, steps other than the interaction between SRP and its membrane receptor or the binding of ribosomes to the Sec61 complex must be responsible for the less efficient insertion of the nascent polypeptide chains into proteoliposomes lacking Sec61..

When analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with Sec61 antibodies, a cross-linked product containing a 12-kD protein was again observed (Fig. 4 A, lanes 10-12), indicating that the cross-linking partner is indeed a constituent of the Sec61 complex. The smaller cross-linked product in Fig. 4 A, lanes 11 and 12 (marked with an asterisk) is probably generated by cross-linking between Sec61 and Sec61, the smallest subunit of the Sec61 complex.

Considering its size, we suspected that it may represent a product generated by cross-linking of two  subunits of the Sec61 complex. To test this assumption, purified Sec61 complex was reconstituted into proteoliposomes and subjected to cross-linking with BMH. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with Sec61 antibodies, a cross-linked product containing a 12-kD protein was again observed (Fig. 4 A, lanes 10-12), indicating that the cross-linking partner is indeed a constituent of the Sec61 complex. The smaller cross-linked product in Fig. 4 A, lanes 11 and 12 (marked with an asterisk) is probably generated by cross-linking between Sec61 and Sec61, the smallest subunit of the Sec61 complex. The appearance of this cross-linked product in native microsomes was variable among different experiments..

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	65	We were concerned that the membrane-bound ribosomes may prevent full access of the bifunctional cross-linker to Sec61 so that only a subset of its interacting partners could be detected. However, to our surprise, when PK-RM were used in cross-linking experiments, not only were no additional cross-links observed, but those between Sec61 and Sec61 and between Sec61 and SPC25 could no longer be seen (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4-6). Treatment of RM with high salt or puromycin alone did not change these cross-links (data not shown), suggesting that their disappearance requires the dissociation of the ribosomes into subunits. In agreement with this assumption, proteoliposomes reconstituted from a crude detergent extract of microsomes or proteoliposomes containing only the purified Sec61 complex, which both lack membrane-bound ribosomes, also did not give these cross-links (Fig. 4 A, lanes 7-12)..

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	67	A similar conclusion could be drawn when the cross-linking reaction was analyzed with SPC25 antibodies (Fig. 4 B). With RM two cross-linked products were seen, one of ~36 kD between SPC25 and Sec61, and another of ~46 kD (Fig. 4 B, lane 2 vs. lane 1). With PK-RM or with proteoliposomes reconstituted from a crude detergent extract, the adduct of SPC25 and Sec61 was no longer observed (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4-6 and lanes 7-9, respectively), whereas the 46-kD cross-linked product remained unchanged. The latter was also observed with proteoliposomes containing only the purified signal peptidase complex (Fig. 4 B, lane 11). Two SPC subunits, the nonglycosylated SPC25 and the glycoprotein SPC22/23 carry SH groups and have an appropriate molecular weight to produce this 46-kD cross-link with SPC25. As the molecular weight of the cross-linked product did not change after treatment with N-glycosidase F (data not shown), we conclude that it consists of two SPC25..

When the reaction with BMH was performed in the presence of 10 mM EDTA under low salt conditions, the cross-link between Sec61 and Sec61 and that between Sec61 and SPC25 could not be seen anymore (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 4 vs. lanes 2 and 3). However, the homotypic cross-link between two Sec61 remained unchanged, indicating that the EDTA did not interfere with the reactivity of the BMH. It should be noted that the extent to which the cross-linking intensity was reduced varied in different experiments..

Ribosome-nascent chain complexes were produced by an in vitro translation of truncated mRNA coding for the first 86 amino acids of preprolactin (86-mer). Ribosome-free membranes (PK-RM) were then added to the translation mix (Fig. 6 A, lanes 4-6). As controls PK-RM and RM were incubated with a translation mix that did not contain any preprolactin mRNA (Fig. 6 A, lanes 1-3 and lanes 7-9). After isolation of the membranes aliquots of each sample were treated with different amounts of BMH. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting with Sec61 antibodies using enhanced chemiluminescence as a detection system (Fig. 6 A) or by quantitative immunoblotting using radioactively labeled secondary antibodies and a PhosphorImager (Fig. 6 B). The quantitation (Fig. 6 B) shows that the incubation of PK-RM with ribosome-nascent chain complexes led to a clear restimulation of the cross-link intensity between Sec61 and Sec61 and between Sec61 and SPC25. Similar results were obtained if EDTA-treated membranes were analyzed (data not shown)..

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	76	In this paper, we have studied the role of the  subunit of the Sec61 complex during cotranslational protein translocation into the mammalian ER. We have found that the translocation competence of reconstituted proteoliposomes immunodepleted of Sec61 is greatly reduced when tested under conditions in which membrane targeting and translation occur at the same time. However, if ribosomes carrying short nascent chains are first targeted to the membrane before translation is continued, i.e., if enough time is given for their membrane insertion, the depleted proteoliposomes are only marginally reduced in their activity. These results can be explained by the assumption that elongation of a nascent chain and its insertion into the translocation channel are kinetically competing processes: if the membrane insertion is too slow, elongation of the nascent chain would continue in the cytosol and its folding would prevent a later interaction of the signal sequence with the translocation apparatus. We therefore infer that the  subunit is required for a rapid insertion of the ribosome-bound nascent chain into the translocation sites in the ER membrane. The observation that the  subunit is not essential is in agreement with the fact that the deletion of the two  subunits in yeast cells is not lethal and leads to a growth phenotype only at elevated temperatures. Since microsomes isolated from the mutant had a reduced activity for posttranslational protein transport, these and the present results indicate that the  subunit plays a role in both pathways, but is not absolutely required in either one..

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	78	As the cotranslational translocation process is known in much detail, we have been able to analyze the effect of Sec61 depletion on the various steps. One of the first steps is the interaction of the ribosome-nascent chain- SRP complex with the SRP receptor in the membrane that leads to the release of the translational arrest exerted by SRP. This reaction was not perturbed by the depletion of Sec61, although previous data showed that, for optimal release, both the SRP receptor and the Sec61 complex are required (Gorlich and Rapoport, 1993). We therefore conclude that the  subunit is not essential for this activity of the Sec61 complex. The binding of ribosomes to the ER membrane was also not affected by the absence of Sec61. Both the number of binding sites and the dissociation constant remained unchanged and were almost identical to the values determined for the reconstituted, purified wild-type Sec61 complex. These results are consistent with the observation that proteolytic degradation of the cytosolic domain of Sec61 in microsomes does not prevent the binding of ribosomes (Kalies et al., 1994). Taken together, our results indicate that even in the absence of Sec61, efficient release of the SRP arrest and binding of the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the Sec61 complex can occur. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that the membrane targeted nascent chains undergo signal peptide cleavage by signal peptidase located in the wrong orientation in the reconstituted membrane. It therefore appears that a step subsequent to membrane targeting, most likely the step in which the nascent chain is inserted into the Sec61 channel, is perturbed in the absence of the  subunit. Structural changes in the Sec61 channel, which may be required for its opening (Crowley et al., 1994; Jungnickel and Rapoport, 1995), may occur with a reduced rate..

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	80	To further analyze the function of Sec61, we have probed its molecular environment in ER membranes by cross-linking. A bifunctional cross-linker was used that reacts specifically with SH groups and therefore can be expected to give a relative simple cross-linking pattern. As predicted, in rough microsomes Sec61 was found in close proximity to the  subunit of the Sec61 complex. We also found a cross-linked product consisting of two Sec61 molecules, perhaps explained by the occurrence of oligomers of the trimeric Sec61 complex in microsomes (Hanein et al., 1996). Most interestingly, however, a specific cross-linked product containing SPC25 was observed. Conversely, when the cross-linking partners of SPC25 were analyzed, the only partner outside the signal peptidase complex was found to be Sec61. Remarkably, 70% of SPC25 could be cross-linked to Sec61. We therefore believe that the cross-link between the two proteins indicates their specific interaction. These data provide the first evidence that the signal peptidase physically contacts the protein conducting channel in the membrane. The cross-linking between Sec61 and SPC25 has likely occurred between their cytosolic domains since the only cysteine in Sec61 is in its NH2 terminus and two appropriately located cysteines exist in the NH2-terminal domain of SPC25 (Fig. 7), previously shown to be cytosolic (Kalies and Hartmann, 1996). SPC25 has almost no amino acid residues in the lumen of the ER where the active site of the signal peptidase resides (Fig. 7) and its function was therefore obscure. On the basis of our data, we propose that it is involved in an interaction with the Sec61 complex to bring the enzyme close to the translocating polypeptide substrate. However, sequestration in the translocation site may not be absolutely essential for its function because the signal peptidase complex is very abundant and can probably reach its substrates by mere diffusion in the plane of the membrane, explaining why neither SPC25 nor Sec61 are essential for the viability of yeast cells..

These membranes gave many cross-link-reduced cross-links between Sec61 and SPC25. After retargeting of ribosome-nascent chain complexes at almost ribosome-free membranes, the cross-linking between both proteins was increased, suggesting that their interaction is induced when translocation is initiated by ribosome binding. The cross-linking between Sec61 and Sec61 was also dependent on the presence of membrane-bound ribosomes. Both effects required the dissociation of the ribosome, and not merely the release of the nascent chain from the ribosome, since they occurred with puromycin at high but not at low salt concentrations. The changes in cross-linking pattern upon ribosome removal or retargeting of ribosome-nascent chain complexes could be caused by conformational alterations in an assembled complex or by dissociation of an assembly into subcomplexes. In any case, they provide first evidence for structural changes among known components of the translocation apparatus induced by the onset of cotranslational translocation..

0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	4	Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) cause cystic fibrosis. The most common disease-causing mutation, F508, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is unable to function as a plasma membrane chloride channel. To investigate whether the ER retention of F508-CFTR is caused by immobilization and/or aggregation, we have measured the diffusional mobility of green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras of wild type (wt)-CFTR and F508-CFTR by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. GFP-labeled F508-CFTR was localized in the ER and wt-CFTR in the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes in transfected COS7 and Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells. Both chimeras localized to the ER after brefeldin A treatment. Spot photobleaching showed that CFTR diffusion (diffusion coefficient ~109 cm2/s) was not significantly slowed by the F508 mutation and that nearly all wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR diffused throughout the ER without restriction. Stabilization of molecular chaperone interactions by ATP depletion produced remarkable F508-CFTR immobilization (~50%) and slowed diffusion (6.5  x  1010 cm2/s) but had little effect on wt-CFTR. Fluorescence depletion experiments revealed that the immobilized F508-CFTR in ATP-depleted cells remained in an ER pattern. The mobility of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR was reduced by maneuvers that alter CFTR processing or interactions with molecular chaperones, including tunicamycin, geldanamycin, and lactacystin. Photobleaching of the fluorescent ER lipid diOC4(3) showed that neither ER restructuring nor fragmentation during these maneuvers was responsible for the slowing and immobilization of CFTR. These results suggest that (a) the ER retention of F508-CFTR is not due to restricted ER mobility, (b) the majority of F508-CFTR is not aggregated or bound to slowly moving membrane proteins, and (c) F508-CFTR may interact to a greater extent with molecular chaperones than does wt-CFTR.

Some mutations in CFTR cause the lethal genetic disease cystic fibrosis, which produces chronic lung infection, progressively impaired pulmonary function, and pancreatic insufficiency. The most common CFTR mutant, F508-CFTR, is retained at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and consequently is unable to function as a plasma membrane chloride channel (1). Electrophysiological studies indicate that the ER-retained F508-CFTR is at least partially functional in excised ER membranes (2). Further, growth of F508-CFTR-expressing cells under non-physiological conditions (low temperature, Ref. 3 or with chemical chaperones, Ref. 4) indicates that under certain conditions F508-CFTR can be transported to the plasma membrane and restore cell chloride permeability..

Newly synthesized wild type (wt)-CFTR and F508-CFTR are folded into the ER membrane where they become core-glycosylated (5, 6). Only 20-30% of newly synthesized wt-CFTR is transported to the Golgi where complex glycosylation occurs, with the remaining protein ubiquinated and degraded by the proteasome (7, 8). Wild type CFTR exists initially in a protease-susceptible form (t1/2 ~30 min) that becomes more stable upon transport from ER to Golgi (t1/2 ~24 h), whereas F508-CFTR is rapidly degraded (t1/2 ~30 min) (5, 6). Inhibition of proteasome function results in the formation of aggresomes, which are detergent-insoluble, perinuclear protein aggregates common to many degenerative diseases (9-11)..

Wild type CFTR and F508-CFTR have been shown to interact with the molecular chaperones Hsc70, Hdj2, Hsp70, Hsp90, and calnexin but not with BiP or Grp94 (12-15). Recent data suggest that the Hsc70 co-chaperone CHIP (C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) targets immature CFTR for proteasome-mediated degradation (16). Biochemical data indicate that calnexin and Hsp70 bind F508-CFTR more avidly than wt-CFTR (12, 13). The differential processing of F508-CFTR and wt-CFTR, however, is probably not accounted for by gross structural differences. Proteolytic cleavage experiments have suggested that the conformation of F508-CFTR is similar to that of the early, relatively unstable form of wt-CFTR (17). In vitro folding studies of the isolated nucleotide binding domain 1 (containing the phenylalanine 508 residue) support the view that the F508 mutation does not affect structure (18, 19) but may affect folding kinetics..

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the failure of F508-CFTR to be exported from the ER: immobilization of F508-CFTR, potentially by association with chaperones or by self-aggregation; efficient F508-CFTR recycling from the Golgi; and/or failure of the ER export machinery to recognize F508-CFTR. Photobleaching measurements were done on cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR; a series of maneuvers was used to probe for interactions with CFTR processing machinery. It was shown previously that GFP fusion to the N terminus of CFTR did not effect CFTR localization, processing, or function (9, 20-22). We used photobleaching previously to quantify aqueous phase rheology in cellular and organellar compartments (23-25) and to investigate protein-protein interactions of aquaporin (AQP) water channels in the ER and plasma membranes (26, 27). We find here that the ER retention of F508-CFTR is not due to immobilization, aggregation, or binding to slow moving membrane components; however, a greater fraction of F508-CFTR than wild type CFTR interacted with molecular chaperones after ATP depletion, and inhibition of CFTR processing by a proteasome inhibitor resulted in CFTR aggregation and immobilization.

To visualize cells and to select cellular regions to be bleached, full-field epi-illumination was accomplished using the expanded zero-order laser beam directed onto the objective lens by a fiber optic. The beam was reflected onto the objective by a dichroic mirror (510 nm), and emitted fluorescence was filtered by serial 530  plus or minus  15 nm bandpass and 515 nm longpass filters. Emitted fluorescence was detected by a photomultiplier and digitized by a 14-bit analog-to-digital converter. The photomultiplier was transiently gated off during the bleach pulse. Fluorescence was sampled over 200 ms before the bleach pulse, then at rates of up to 1 MHz. For measurement of slow recoveries, an electronic shutter was used to collect fluorescence at 1 Hz, averaging 10,000 acquisitions during the shutter open time of 20 ms..

Briefly, recovery half-times (t1/2), the time for fluorescence to recover by 50% due to diffusion, were determined from fluorescence recovery curves, F(t), by non-linear regression. Fluorescence recovery curves were taken to be a combination of reversible (as determined from fixed cell analysis) and irreversible (due to diffusion) processes, F(t) = a1(F(t)reversible + a2(F(t)irreversible) where a1 + a2 = 1. The diffusion-mediated recovery was fitted using the semiempirical equation: F(t)irreversible = F0 + (F0 + R(Finf  F0))(t/t1/2)/(1 + (t/t1/2)) where F0 is prebleach fluorescence, Finf is fluorescence at infinite time, and R is the fractional fluorescence recovery. Absolute diffusion coefficients were calculated from t1/2 using a mathematical model of ER diffusion (25, 28).

A large region of the cell, ~5  microm in diameter (marked by cross-hairs), was bleached by the laser pulse, and fluorescence recovery was recorded by serial imaging. In each case a darkened region is seen immediately postbleach (t = 0 s). Recovery into this bleached region is diffusive in nature from the edges of the bleach spot inward and appears to be nearly complete. The kinetics of fluorescence recovery were qualitatively similar for cells expressing wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR and in both cell types.

To distinguish between processes that produce irreversible photobleaching (authentic GFP diffusion) from those that produce reversible photobleaching (from triplet-state relaxation or other photophysical phenomena), fluorescence recovery was measured in fixed cells (Fig. 3B) and using different spot sizes (Fig. 3C). As found in prior photobleaching studies (26, 27), the fluorescence recovery remaining after fixation represents reversible (diffusion-independent) photobleaching because fixation abolishes diffusion. Fig. 3B (top curve) shows a small component (5-10%) of reversible photobleaching with ~1-s exponential time constant. Similar recoveries were found under the same photobleaching conditions for unconjugated GFP in cytoplasm (middle curve) and aqueous phase (unconjugated) GFP in the ER lumen (bottom curve). As expected for reversible fluorescence recovery, the recovery rates did not depend on spot size (not shown). Fig. 3C shows that (in unfixed cells) the fluorescence recovery was spot size-dependent as expected for diffusive processes, because the recovery time for a larger spot increases approximately with the square of the spot diameter. Using a regression procedure to determine (t1/2) for irreversible fluorescence recovery (see "Experimental Procedures"), t1/2 values for GFP-wt-CFTR were 1040  plus or minus  60 ms (100 x ), 3.0  plus or minus  0.4 s (60 x ), and 4.9  plus or minus  0.2 s (40 x ) (n = 4-10 sets of measurements). The t1/2 values for GFP-F508-CFTR (in BFA-treated cells) were 1170  plus or minus  120 ms (100 x ), 3.3  plus or minus  0.5 s (60 x ), and 6.4  plus or minus  0.3 s (40 x ) (n = 4-10). The relative t1/2 are as expected for a diffusive process..

There was no significant effect of the F508 mutation on CFTR diffusion and/or of BFA treatment on F508-CFTR mobility. Fig. 3D (bottom) summarizes the percentage of mobile GFP, determined from the completeness of the fluorescence recovery at long times. GFP-wt-CFTR fluorescence recovered almost completely (92  plus or minus  2%, n = 10), whereas GFP-F508-CFTR recovery in BFA-treated and untreated cells was slightly though significantly smaller (85  plus or minus  2% and 82  plus or minus  1%)..
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	35	To investigate interactions of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR with elements of the ER quality control machinery, we used a series of maneuvers to modulate molecular chaperone interactions. Fig. 4A shows wt-CFTR mobility after ATP depletion (a maneuver that increases interactions between CFTR and chaperones in the ER), which was produced by 30 min of incubation with 6 mM 2-deoxyglucose and 0.02% sodium azide (top curve). The diffusion coefficient of GFP-wt-CFTR was similar to control conditions, (10.6  plus or minus  0.9)  x  1010 cm2/s (n = 7), and the percentage recovery was reduced significantly to 80  plus or minus  2%. The diffusion coefficient of GFP-F508-CFTR was reduced significantly after a 30-min ATP depletion to (6.6  plus or minus  0.5)  x  1010 cm2/s (n = 5) (Fig. 4A, bottom curve), and substantially more GFP-F508-CFTR became immobilized (mobile percentage, 55  plus or minus  5%). ATP depletion for 60 min had no further effect. Table I summarizes averaged diffusion coefficients and percentages of mobile GFP. To investigate whether the reduced F508-CFTR mobility in ATP-depleted cells was related to restructuring or fragmentation of the ER, the mobility of the fluorescent ER membrane marker diOC4(3) was measured. Fig. 4B shows that diffusion of diOC4(3) was essentially complete with a diffusion coefficient of (2.4  plus or minus  0.1)  x  108 cm2/s (n = 10). diOC4(3) diffusion was unaffected by BFA treatment ((2.4  plus or minus  0.1)  x  108 cm2/s, n = 5, middle curve) or ATP depletion ((2.7  plus or minus  0.3)  x  108 cm2/s, n = 4, bottom curve). Further, photobleaching of transfected cells expressing GFP-labeled wild type CFTR or F508-CFTR and subsequently labeled with diOC4(3) in situ showed that the expression of GFP-CFTR chimeras did not affect ER structure or fluidity (not shown). Image photobleaching experiments similar to those shown in Fig. 2 were also performed on diOC4(3)-labeled cells (not shown), and it was demonstrated that ATP depletion did not alter ER continuity or gross structure..

0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	38	To identify the cellular location of the immobilized GFP-F508-CFTR in ATP-depleted cells, fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) experiments were performed (Fig. 4C). A fixed spot in the cell was repetitively bleached with delays between each bleach pulse to permit diffusion of unbleached GFP-labeled CFTR into the location of the bleach spot. Under these conditions GFP-wt-CFTR freely diffused throughout the ER with ~10% of cell fluorescence remaining after 35 bleach pulses (top). In contrast, a substantial amount of fluorescence remained after bleaching of GFP-F508-CFTR in ATP-depleted cells (bottom) with the remaining fluorescence having an ER pattern. These findings suggest that ATP depletion does not alter ER continuity or gross structure and that the immobilization of F508-CFTR in ATP-depleted cells results from interactions with ER proteins..
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	39	Additional maneuvers were carried out to modulate putative CFTR interactions with molecular chaperones and elements of protein processing and degradation (Fig. 5 and Table I). Heat shock, which nonspecifically up-regulates the expression of molecular chaperones, produced small reductions in the diffusion coefficients and percentage mobilities of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR (Fig. 5, top curves). Proteasome inhibition by lactacystin resulted in mild slowing and immobilization of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR after 6 h of incubation (second curves), with complete immobilization after 14 h (third curves). GFP was seen in an ER pattern at 6 h but was concentrated in aggresomes at 14 h (not shown). The ansamysin compound geldanamycin, which disrupts associations with Hsp90, caused comparable slowing of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR with somewhat greater immobilization of F508-CFTR (fourth curves). Last, the role of glycosylation was investigated by incubation with tunicamycin (to inhibit addition of oligosaccharide chains), using a glycosylation-null mutant of wt-CFTR (asparagines 894 and 900 replaced by glutamines). Somewhat more immobilization of F508-CFTR than wt-CFTR was found with tunicamycin (fifth curves). Although the glycosylation-null mutant of wt-CFTR expressed poorly and a substantial proportion of fluorescence was associated with aggresomes, the mobility of ER-associated CFTR could be measured in some cells and was found to be similar to that produced by tunicamycin (sixth curve)..

Similar observations were made for the T126M mutant of AQP2 (a water channel that is partially misfolded and similarly retained in the ER, Ref. 27) and for a temperature-sensitive folding mutant of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (29). Therefore, slowed or restricted F508-CFTR mobility in the ER cannot account for its failure to be exported. Efficient recycling from the Golgi or failure to be recognized by the ER export machinery remain possible explanations for the ER localization of F508-CFTR.

Approximately 50% of F508-CFTR was immobile after ATP depletion, with only minor effects on the mobility of wt-CFTR.

Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation by tunicamycin resulted in significant slowing and immobilization of both wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR, similar to findings for the VSVG glycoprotein (29). Similar results were found with a glycosylation-null wt-CFTR mutant, which was poorly expressed in the plasma membrane as determined by biotinylation studies (not shown). Protein glycosylation can facilitate folding, sorting, and quality control (31). Our data are thus consistent with a role for glycosylation in CFTR folding. Proteasome inhibition causes the accumulation of deglycosylated wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR in detergent-insoluble, high molecular weight aggregates (9, 32). Consistent with the observations here, Bebok et al. (32) demonstrated an association between the Sec61 translocation system and CFTR that was enhanced by proteasome inhibition. After prolonged (14 h) incubation with lactacystin, wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR were found in aggresomes (9, 10). Aggresomes are vimentin-enclosed, pericentriolar, electron-dense structures that contain aggregates of misfolded, often ubiquinated proteins associated with molecular chaperones and proteasomes.

Geldanamycin has been shown to disrupt interactions of Hsp90 and CFTR, increasing the degradation rates of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR (14). Hsp90 has thus been proposed to have a potential role in protecting CFTR from rapid degradation. The relative immobilization of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR after geldanamycin treatment supports a role of Hsp90 for CFTR processing. As suggested for VSVG by Nehls et al. (29), we believe that the physical state of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR after perturbation of CFTR processing by tunicamycin or geldanamycin may be different from that produced by ATP depletion. The slowing and immobilization of CFTR by ATP depletion may represent CFTR interactions with molecular chaperones existing in large complexes (33), whereas the immobilization after tunicamycin and geldanamycin, or molecular deglycosylation, may represent CFTR self-aggregation. Because of the logarithmic relationship between molecular radius and diffusion rate for a protein in a bilayer, substantial aggregates (10-100 units) must be formed to significantly slow diffusion. The similar responses of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR to some of the pharmacological maneuvers are consistent with the intrinsically inefficient folding of wt-CFTR, which when compared with P-glycoprotein (another member of the ABC cassette family) is poorly folded..

To better understand mechanisms that regulate transcription of CFTR, we examined transcription factors that specifically bind a CFTR CArG-like motif we have previously shown to modulate CFTR expression. Gel mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated the CFTR CArG-like motif binds serum response factor both in vitro and in vivo. Transient co-transfections with various SRF expression vector, including dominant-negative forms and small interfering RNA, demonstrated that SRF significantly increases CFTR transcriptional activity in bronchial epithelial cells. Mutagenesis studies suggested that in addition to SRF other co-factors, such as Yin Yang 1 (YY1) previously shown to bind the CFTR promoter, are potentially involved in the CFTR regulation. Here, we show that functional interplay between SRF and YY1 might provide interesting perspectives to further characterize the underlying molecular mechanism of the basal CFTR transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the identification of multiple CArG binding sites in highly conserved CFTR untranslated regions, which form specific SRF complexes, provides direct evidence for a considerable role of SRF in the CFTR transcriptional regulation into specialized epithelial lung cells..

An intact CCAAT consensus is also required for accurate transcript initiation (9). Both basal and cAMP-mediated regulation of CFTR transcription involve a weak cAMP response element (CRE) nucleotide consensus (10,11) in tandem with a consensus inverted CCAAT element or Y box (9). In addition, CFTR transcription may be modulated by additional overlapping cis-acting elements, including a polymorphic YY1 site, located in the human minimal CFTR promoter (12). CFTR promoter activity may be enhanced by exogenous transfected NF-B via its binding to the  to 1103 B element (13). CFTR expression is also regulated through interactions with factors involved in remodeling of chromatin structure, such as CDP/cut and hGCN5 (14)..

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	12	Our current model for the regulation of human CFTR expression proposes that multiple transcription factors interact with previously reported polymorphic and composite cis-acting elements encompassing a CArG-like motif (12,20). The CArG box (CC(A/T)6GG), originally defined as the core component of the serum response element (SRE), is found in the 5' region of immediate early response genes, such as c-fos (21), and in many muscle-specific gene promoters (22). This DNA element binds serum response factor (SRF), highly regulated and interactive transcription factor, which is phylogenetically conserved and belongs to the MADS box family of proteins, with MCM1, Agamous, Deficiens and SRF (23). Although SRF is particularly enriched in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle lineages (24,25), it is also expressed in a variety of human cell lines from distinct tissue origins (26), and, to a lesser extent, in ectoderm-derived tissue such as gastric epithelium (27). Interestingly, it has been shown that Drosophila SRF homolog is expressed in a subset of tracheal cells and regulates cytoplasmic outgrowth during terminal branching of the tracheal system (28). Hence, it has been suggested that SRF plays an essential role in the formation of the respiratory system. Moreover, it has been recently shown that SRF is involved in myofibroblast differentiation during lung damage (29). Therefore, we hypothesized that trans-acting factors interacting with CArG-like motif, such as SRF, could be important in CFTR expression regulation. We provided evidence that SRF is expressed in bronchial epithelial cell expressing endogenous CFTR protein. Through the use of combined gel mobility shift to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we first demonstrated that SRF protein binds, both in vitro and in vivo, the CFTR minimal promoter region spanning the CArG-like motif. Mutagenic studies and transient co-transfections experiments showed that SRF alone is not sufficient to transactivate the CFTR gene. Upon some mutations of the CFTR-CArG-like element, promoter activity is severely decreased, potentially implying YY1 as a co-repressor. Given the YY1 well-defined role in the transcriptional regulation of some SRE-dependent promoters (30 to 33), we explored the putative role of YY1 on the CFTR promoter activity and demonstrated functional interplay between this factor and SRF. Finally, by stringent in silico structural analysis, we identified additional multiple near consensus CArG sites within the highly conserved promoter and intronic regions of the CFTR gene. We also documented the existence of SRF-containing protein complexes on numerous predicted CFTR CArG-like elements. Taken together, the data obtained classify CFTR as a novel SRF target gene, subject to modest but significant SRF activation, and open the gate to further investigate how SRF may be involved in the regulation of CFTR gene expression..

After a culturing period of 24 h, cells were transfected with PolyFect  transfection reagent (Qiagen Corporation, France) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For transient transfection, we used 1.8  microg of plasmid reporter and 0.2  microg of internal control pRL-SV40 containing Renilla luciferase (Promega Corporation). The pGL3-Basic vector lacking both eukaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences was used as a negative control. After 48 h, the luciferase activity was evaluated with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega Corporation), as described previously (12). Luminescence measurements were performed on a Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (ThermoLabsystem Corporation, France). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. All luciferase activities represent at least three independent experiments with each construct tested in triplicate per experiment. Luciferase activity data are expressed as the means  plus or minus  SD computed from the results obtained from each set of transfection experiments. To minimize the possibility of errors in DNA amplification, at least two independently constructed clones were tested. For co-transfection assays, unless otherwise indicated, 1.8  microgof luciferase reporter and 1 to 2  microg of each expression vector were used. Transfection with siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 2.5  microg of siRNA. The cells were transfected with CFTR promoter plasmid reporter, and luciferase activity was determined as described above. Aliquots of cell lysates were used for western blotting to confirm the specificity and level of SRF protein knockdown..

Comparison of human/species homologies was carried out using ClustalW multiple CFTR sequence alignments according to the numerous alignment parameters described previously (49). Consistent with previous studies (50,51), we showed that the human minimal CFTR promoter is remarkably conserved across the orders studied (Figure 1B, right panel). We found that the CFTR-CArG-like element is conserved within all the Primates species studied and also within the pig while, within the sheep, cow and rabbit species, some substitutions occur in the middle of the CArG-like motif (Figure 1B). These data are consistent with previous CFTR promoter phylogenetic work that identified two types of regulatory elements: some are conserved between species, such as a non-consensus CRE at positions  to 0.1 kb relative to ATG and some are species-specific elements, such as a 300 bp purine.pyrimidine (Pu.Py) stretch that is present only in rodents (50)..

To measure the expression levels of SRF mRNAs, we used a RT to PCR-based procedure previously described by Davis et al. (52). As reverse-transcribed control, the Hypoxanthine PhosphoRybosyl-Transferase (HPRT) housekeeping gene was amplified. Amplification of SRF from bronchial epithelial cells and myoblasts yielded a fragment of the same size, 651 bp (Figure 2A), as that of the full-length SRF transcript produced by RT to PCR from human hearts (52). The 453 bp band corresponding to SRF lacking exon 5 (SRF5) was only detected in the C2C12 myoblast line (Figure 2A). To ensure that these bands were not the result of a PCR artifact or genomic contamination of samples, negative controls such as exclusion of RT or RNA during cDNA synthesis were included in each assay. As expected, no PCR product appeared when either RT or the template was omitted (Figure 2A). Densitometric analysis revealed that bronchial epithelial cells contained an appreciable amount of SRF mRNA. Nuclear extracts from A549, Beas2B and C2C12 cells were electrophoresed and then assayed by western blotting with anti-SRF antibody reported to recognize all four isoforms of the protein (52). As shown in Figure 2B, we found that robust expression of a 67 kDa band, that based on molecular mass, corresponds to full-length SRF (SRF-FL) in all of the cell lines examined. Consistent wit RT to PCR analysis, a 57 kDa band corresponding to SRF5 was only detected in the C2C12 myoblast line. As a control, we checked the ss-actin levels (Figure 2B). Densitometric analysis of western blot revealed no apparent difference in the expression level of SRF proteins between the myoblasts and epithelial cells (Figure 2B). In subsequent western blot analyses in which parallel blots were probed with only the secondary antibody, no band was detected (data not shown), thus confirming that these bands are indeed specific for SRF. As further evidence, A549, Beas2B and C2C12 cells express relatively large amounts of SRF, the cell lines were assessed by indirect immunofluorescence labeling. A similar staining pattern was noted in the bronchial epithelial cells and myoblasts (Figure 2C, rows A to C). The nuclei have been stained blue with DAPI. As negative control, no staining was detected when the primary antibody was omitted (Figure 2C, row D). Consistent with other studies reporting that SRF is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of cell types (26,27,53), our SRF expression studies demonstrated that human SRF gene is expressed in bronchial epithelial cells..

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	48	  SRF binds the CFTR-CArG-like element Because the CArG box is not only found in the regulatory regions of many muscle-specific genes but also located at the center of other SREs (54) and forms the core binding site for SRF (55), we have attempted to determine whether or not SRF binds to the CFTR-CArG-like element sequence. We performed two series of bandshift experiments. First, we incubated the 32P-labelLed WT oligonucleotide corresponding to CFTR-CArG-like element sequence (as indicated in Table 2) with bacterially expressed SRF. As shown in Figure 3A (lane 3), EMSA revealed a recombinant SRF to WT duplex. As shown in Figure 3A (lane 5), bands defined as the CFTR-CArG-like-SRF complex disappeared when 100-fold molar excess of specific competitor containing the consensus SRE motif, derived from human c-fos promoter (56), was added. In contrast, competition by an irrelevant oligonucleotide (noted UC) did not appear to significantly alter the complex suggesting specificity of binding (lane 6). To confirm precisely the identity of protein binding in the minimal CFTR promoter (from  to 121 to  to 83 bp), bacterially expressed SRF was preincubated with anti-SRF antibody before incubation with 32P-labelled probe. As shown in Figure 3A (lane 4), bands corresponding to CFTR-CArG-like-SRF complex disappeared, and more slowly migrating bands appeared when anti-SRF antibody was added. To verify the antibody specificity, control experiments were performed either in the absence of the SRF protein (Figure 3A, lane 7) or in the presence of an irrelevant antibody (Figure 3A, lane 8). These results demonstrate that the CFTR-CArG-like element is a bona fide SRF-binding site. Second, we performed additional EMSA with the WT oligonucleotide, as main binding target, and nuclear extracts from both epithelial and muscle cells (Figure 3B). While three nucleoprotein complexes were formed from nuclear extracts of Beas2B and C2C12 cells on the WT probe, five complexes were detected from A549 cells. Each nuclear protein complex was designated by an upper case relative to nuclear lysate followed by a Roman numeral indicating its position into the gels. The binding specificity of the different complexes was examined by competition analyses with both specific and non-specific unlabeled oligonucleotides (Figure 3B, lanes 2 to 4). Although a few non-specific binding activities were observed, complexes BII, BIII, AIII, AV, CI, CII and CIII were efficiently competed with an excess of both WT and c-fos SRE unlabeled specific competitors indicating binding specificity (Figure 3B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Control experiments including an irrelevant oligonucleotide did not reveal any change in electrophoretic profiles (Figure 3B, lanes 4). To evaluate whether the SRF protein contributes to the formation of nucleoprotein complexes interacting with the CFTR-derived SRF site, we used a specific antibody against the SRF protein. Although the incubation with the anti-SRF antibody apparently failed to give any discrete supershift from various sources of nuclear proteins, a significant decrease of specific complexes was observed (Figure 3B, lanes 6). This effect seemed to be specific because none of these nuclear protein complexes was supershifted or abolished when a non-specific antibody was used (Figure 3B, lanes 7). Control experiments containing only the anti-SRF antiserum and the radiolabeled WT oligonucleotide did not reveal any binding activities (Figure 3B, lanes 8). In addition, supershift assays performed with the radiolabeled c-fos SRE oligonucleotide instead of the WT probe showed that bands corresponding to SRE to SRF complex disappeared and more slowly migrating bands appeared (Figure 3B, lane 10). The absence of supershift for specific WT binding complexes (Figure 3D, lanes 6) may be explained if the epitope recognized by the anti-SRF antibody is part of (or located near) the CFTR-CArG-like DNA-binding site. Antibody binding would compete DNA binding, resulting in a significant decrease or total disappearance of CArG-like complexes rather than in supershifted complexes. Alternatively, if the interaction between the CFTR-CArG-like DNA-binding site and the SRF protein is insufficiently strong, it could be not as stable as the one observed with the SRE probe (Figure 3B, lane 10) to be detected as a supershift in gel retardation assays. On the one hand, other DNA-binding proteins that are potentially part of this complex could interfere with the antibody's access to SRF protein. Taken together, these EMSA studies establish SRF-binding CArG-like box within the minimal promoter of the human CFTR gene..

To directly address whether SRF also binds in vivo, ChIP was carried out in bronchial epithelial cells. For this purpose, DNA-binding proteins of Beas2B epithelial cells were covalently linked to genomic DNA by treatment of the cells with formaldehyde. Cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with either specific or irrelevant antibodies, anti-SRF and anti-HA, respectively. The precipitated chromatin DNA was then purified and amplified by PCR with specific primers of the target sequences (Table 1). The promoter of ss-globin gene, which lacks CArG elements, was used as negative control (Figure 4, row A).

We therefore addressed the ability of the WT-pGL3 construct, previously described (12) to drive the expression in Beas2B, A549 and C2C12 cells. As shown in Figure 5A, an efficient transcription of the CFTR promoter could be readily observed in all three cell lines compared with monkey kidney fibroblasts (COS-7), which are negative for CFTR expression (36,37). Surprisingly, the activity of the minimal CFTR promoter in C2C12 cells was 4 to 5.5 times higher than that observed in Beas2B and A549 cells, respectively. Although the expression of the CFTR protein was previously evidenced in some muscle cells (57 to 59), it has never been investigated in mouse C2C12 myoblasts. Therefore, we investigated the CFTR expression at both mRNA and protein levels. To examine CFTR mRNA expression in mouse myoblasts (C2C12), total RNA isolated from epithelial and non-epithelial cells was analyzed via RT to PCR with CFTR-specific primers (Table 1). As shown in Figure 5B, while no PCR product for CFTR was seen with COS-7 cells, the expected CFTR amplified product was obtained for both epithelial (A549 and Beas2B) and muscular (C2C12) cell lines. No product was detected in the absence of reverse transcriptase or RNA (noted No RT or No RNA, respectively). Although the HPRT PCR control showed non-equivalent amounts of cDNA used in the different PCRs, densitometric analysis revealed that C2C12 cells contained an appreciable amount of CFTR mRNA. Further determination of CFTR expression in C2C12 myoblasts was conducted by western blot analysis (Figure 5C). Caco-2 cells were used as positive control and COS-7 as negative control. As shown in Figure 5C, while mature fully glycosylated band C CFTR was observed in A549, Beas2B and C2C12 cells, the core glycosylated band B CFTR occurred at the same molecular mass only in a subset of cell lines, indicative of potential variations in glycosylation process. To rule out the possibility of antibodies cross-reactivity or non-specific labeling, indirect immunofluorescence analysis was performed with another anti-CFTR antibody, L12B4 (Figure 5D). As expected, the Caco-2 cell line used as a positive control showed strong immunoreactivity for CFTR protein (Figure 5D, row D). In contrast, and as expected, COS-7 cells used as negative control did not stain with this anti-CFTR antibody (Figure 5D, row E). No staining was detected when the primary antibody was omitted (Figure 5D, row F). The comparison of immunofluorescence images between epithelial (Figure 5D, row A, B and D) and muscular (Figure 5D, row C) cells provides evidence that CFTR is significantly expressed in C2C12 myoblasts. However, because the indirect immunofluorescence experiments were performed in permeabilized cells, they do not distinguish between CFTR that is located in the apical membrane and CFTR that is located in a vesicular pool just beneath the apical membrane. These findings, together with the transcriptional activities presented above, suggest that the minimal CFTR promoter might contain tissue-specific enhancer(s) as well as repressive cis-regulatory elements that have the ability to mitigate the activity of the CFTR promoter between epithelial and non-epithelial lineages. Because CF affects mainly epithelial tissues and Beas2B consistently yielded higher enhancer activity than A549, we restricted subsequent studies to this bronchial epithelial cell line..

First, we co-transfected either exogenous full-length SRF or truncated SRF mutants with the wild-type CFTR minimal promoter. Second, we utilized a siRNA approach to ask whether a reduction in endogenous SRF levels could affect basal CFTR activation. Luciferase assays were carried out in Beas2B cells using the indicated SRF expression vectors and the WT-pGL3luciferase reporter construct (Figure 6B, left panel). The 3XSRE-fos TATA-Luciferase reporter gene was used as positive control because its transcriptional activity is highly dependent on SRF binding (Figure 6B, right panel). As expected, while this synthetic promoter containing several consensus SREs was markedly and significantly activated ( > 2-fold) by forced expression of full-length SRF protein (pHiv-SRF) (Figure 6B, right panel), truncated SRF mutants either containing only the amino acids 133 to 264 corresponding to DNA-binding domain of SRF (pHiv-DBD-SRF), or deleted of amino acids 153 to 165, an essential part for the DNA binding (pHiv-DN-SRF) induced modest but significant decrease of SRE activity (10% and 30%, respectively). When these SRF expression vectors were transiently co-transfected with the WT-pGL3 luciferase reporter construct, the trans-activator effect of SRF was notably reduced. Indeed, overexpression of full-length and dominant-negative (pHiv-DN-SRF) SRF proteins resulted in 50% increased and 30% decreased of luciferase activity, respectively (Figure 6B, left panel). Unexpectedly and inconsistent with previous study (60), the pHiv-DBD-SRF construct induced 40% increase of the WT-pGL3 luciferase activity. This results disparity may be explained by the fact that the c-fos promoter study (60) assessed the DBD to SRF domain activity via microinjection of corresponding truncated SRF polypeptide. Perhaps, the best explanation for this increased activity is that the DNA-binding domain of SRF, also called MADS box, is sufficient for transcriptional activation of some SRF-dependent genes because it mediates interactions with accessory co-activators (61). These results suggest that neither of the regions outside the MADS box, N- or C-terminal, appear essential for transactivation of the CFTR promoter by SRF..

We used the D upper-case and the C upper-case to designate the Degenerated CArG motifs and the Consensus CArG elements, respectively. To ensure the efficacy of mutations in abrogating transcription factor binding, we first performed a series of EMSA experiments with each CArG mutant and the WT probe (Table 2). As expected, based on the sequence analysis, the mutations resulting in more degenerated CArG motifs (D1, D2, D3 and D4 mutants) completely abolished SRF-binding activity (Figure 7A, lanes 1 to 4), when we compared with SRF-WT complexes (Figure 7A, lane 5). In addition, the probes containing more consensus CArG boxes (C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 mutants) bound SRF more strongly in nuclear extracts prepared from Beas2B (Figure 7A, lanes 6 to 10). Inclusion of an anti-SRF antibody partially abolished SRF-binding activity and resulted in a slower mobility band, confirming the identity of the binding protein (Figure 7A, lane 11). Then, minimal CFTR promoter constructs bearing the same consensus and disrupted CArG boxes were tested in a transient transfection assays in Beas2B cells (Figure 7B). Compared with luciferase activity resulting from the WT-pGL3 construct, variable increases in reporter activity are observed when D1, D2, D3 and D4 mutant constructs, with disrupted CArG motif, were transiently transfected. On the other hand, mutations that create more consensus CArG element result in either reducing or increasing in the transcriptional activity (Figure 7B). Consistent with the preceding gel-shift results revealing an uncharacterized protein/DNA complex with slightly slower mobility and variable intensity compared with the SRF to DNA complex, these finer mutagenesis studies suggest that both co-activators and co-repressors might interact with the studied promoter sequences.

These findings with previous work (12) have particularly evoked our interest to examine the role of YY1 in SRF-mediated CFTR transcriptional activity..

As shown in Figure 8A, incubation with specific anti-YY1 antibody resulted in either a significant decrease or total disappearance of some complexes normally formed between the CArG boxes and a component of Beas2B nuclear extracts, establishing DNA binding between YY1 and the sequences tested. As expected, control experiment performed with radiolabeled probe, D2, devoid of any YY1 binding site and the anti-YY1 antiserum did not reveal any change in electrophoretic profiles indicating specificity of the YY1 binding. Thus, these EMSAs demonstrated that the CFTR-CArG-like (WT probe) and more consensus CArG elements (C1  <  C3  <  C4) served as binding site for at least two distinct nuclear factors, namely SRF and YY1 from bronchial epithelial cells..

Since the minimal CFTR promoter is activated by SRF and knowing from previous studies (30 to 33) that YY1 negatively regulates some promoter containing CArG elements, it seemed logical to first assess whether YY1 could also repress the CFTR promoter. We asked whether CArG-like-binding site in the CFTR promoter acted as negative regulatory elements. Several CFTR promoter reporter constructs containing either CArG-like (namely, WT) or consensus CArG element (C1, C3 and C4) were co-transfected with SRF and/or YY1 expression vectors into Beas2B cells. As shown in Figure 8C, while co-transfections with SRF alone resulted in 1.5- to 2-fold luciferase activation, forced expression of YY1 protein caused a strong decrease in reporter activities (50 to 75% of the control luciferase value). Therefore, we wanted to determine the functional relationship of both factors in the CFTR activity regulation. Transient co-transfections analysis of combination of protein expression vectors showed that over-expression of SRF either did not restore (Figure 8C, panel with the WT and C4 reporter constructs) or only very slightly raised the YY1-repressed reporter activities (Figure 8C, panel with the C1 and C3 reporter constructs). These findings are consistent with results obtained from co-transfections performed with the YY1 expression vector alone and previous alpha-actin promoter studies (30 to 33), in which YY1 acted as a strong repressor.

Even though this motif occurs in only a subset of the input sequences, it does not necessarily mean that it is of no functional importance. Instances of cis-regulatory elements being species-specific have been already reported for the CFTR gene (50). More generally, it is well known that some transcription factors can tolerate more than one type of nucleotide at a given position of the binding site. Instances of substitutions in both the central core of the CArG element and the highly conserved contact points for SRF, at the terminal ends, not impairing SRF binding have been previously reported (48,65 to 68).

We have investigated the expression driven by the proximal human CFTR promoter in a pGL3 construct in both epithelial and myoblasts lines. Results of our transient transfections of 3XSRE-fos TATA and WT-pGL3 luciferase reporter genes showed that the human minimal CFTR promoter encompassing a CArG-like motif was sufficient to drive the expression in both cell types (Figure 5). Consistent with other studies showing CFTR expression in smooth muscle tissue (71,72), our results demonstrated that the human CFTR minimal promoter had the ability to drive the expression in muscle lineages. Our transient co-transfections analyses performed with full-length and dominant-negative SRF forms expression vectors, and also specific SRF siRNA constructs (Figure 6, panels B and C) provide the first evidence for a positive role of the SRF protein in the regulation of the human CFTR promoter. However, the SRF-induced CFTR transactivation, though significant, is relatively modest. These data with the results of finer mutagenesis studies presented in Figure 7 support the concept that SRF alone is not sufficient to drive the basal expression of the CFTR gene. As suggested by other previous studies (73 to 75), it is likely that additional factors might be required to optimally drive the CFTR promoter, as well as to specify the cell-type-restricted expression. Since YY1 was previously shown to bind the CFTR promoter (12) and a subset of SREs serve as binding sites for YY1 (30 to 33), we first evaluated this candidate in the SRF-mediated CFTR transcriptional activity. The data analysis suggests a functional antagonism between SRF and YY1 through binding competition for the CFTR-CArG-like box. However, the analysis of combinatorial co-transfection studies, presented in Figure 8C, suggests that the functional interplay between SRF and YY1, alone, is not sufficient to account for basal CFTR transcriptional activation. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether another player might be involved in this functional interplay and accounted for the basal transcriptional CFTR activity observed in the Beas2B bronchial epithelial cells..

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	99	A critical question is, thus, how might SRF contribute to orchestrating cell-restricted and context-dependent programs of CFTR gene expression? Our findings and investigations to date clearly indicate the presence of several different underlying mechanisms of SRF-dependent transcriptional activation, as represented in Figure 10. These might include association of SRF with a variety of cell-restricted co-factors (noted in gray bubbles, Figure 10), such as MRTF-A highly expressed in epithelial cells of the lung, kidney, colon and testis, and MRTF-B also expressed in smooth muscle cells (77), ternary complex factors, such as p62 and SAP-1 (25,78) and remodeling chromatin co-factors in an HAT-dependent manner, such as the CREB-binding protein (79). In addition, it is well known that binding of SRF to the CArG box induces an acute bend in the DNA and that this bending may vary with changing base compositions across the CArG box (80). Such bending can probably facilitate interactions with other proteins already involved in the CFTR expression regulation, such as NF-B (13) and C/EBP (9) and described as interacting with SRF (81). Finally, the Ras-related GTPases family (rac, RhoA and cdc42) might have a critical role in the activation of SRF (82). Indeed, it is reported that RhoA-induced SRF activation occurs through a phenomenon of  actin treadmilling  restricted to CArG-dependent genes that do not have adjacent ETS-binding sites (e.g. smooth muscle cell restricted CArG genes) (83,84). Moreover, it has been shown that the activation of SRF may be mediated by the NF-B and C/EBP transcription factors (81)..

These might include association of SRF with a variety of cell-restricted co-factors (noted in gray bubbles, Figure 10), such as MRTF-A highly expressed in epithelial cells of the lung, kidney, colon and testis, and MRTF-B also expressed in smooth muscle cells (77), ternary complex factors, such as p62 and SAP-1 (25,78) and remodeling chromatin co-factors in an HAT-dependent manner, such as the CREB-binding protein (79). In addition, it is well known that binding of SRF to the CArG box induces an acute bend in the DNA and that this bending may vary with changing base compositions across the CArG box (80). Such bending can probably facilitate interactions with other proteins already involved in the CFTR expression regulation, such as NF-B (13) and C/EBP (9) and described as interacting with SRF (81). Finally, the Ras-related GTPases family (rac, RhoA and cdc42) might have a critical role in the activation of SRF (82). Indeed, it is reported that RhoA-induced SRF activation occurs through a phenomenon of  actin treadmilling  restricted to CArG-dependent genes that do not have adjacent ETS-binding sites (e.g. smooth muscle cell restricted CArG genes) (83,84). Moreover, it has been shown that the activation of SRF may be mediated by the NF-B and C/EBP transcription factors (81)..

0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	6	Cystic fibrosis (CF)1 is the most common lethal, inherited pulmonary disorder and is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (1). More than 800 distinct mutations in the CFTR gene have been associated with clinical diseases characteristic of cystic fibrosis (2). Whereas many organs are affected in CF, morbidity and mortality in the disease is primarily related to mucus accumulation, recurrent infections, and excessive inflammation in the lung. Whereas the pathogenesis of CF is not fully understood, abnormalities in cyclic AMP-dependent chloride secretion and excessive sodium reuptake by epithelial cells related to CFTR deficiency are thought to alter fluid homeostasis at the airway surface liquid leading to its dehydration, impaired mucociliary clearance, and infection (see Ref. 3 for review). Because the elucidation of the primary structure of CFTR, a myriad of functions and numerous interactions with other cellular proteins have been ascribed to CFTR. Thus, in addition to the role of CFTR in the regulation of cAMP-dependent chloride transport, this protein may play pleotropic roles in many cellular processes by interacting with the cytoskeleton, membrane transport proteins, as well as receptors, protein routing and degradation machinery (2). A number of studies support the concept that the excessive inflammatory responses occur in the CF lung, but the mechanisms underlying these abnormalities have not been clarified. Changes in levels of IL-8 and other proteins mediating inflammatory signaling including NFB and iNOS have been associated with CF, in the presence or absence of infection, raising the possibility that abnormalities in CFTR may constitutively alter pathways mediating inflammation (4-6)..

Abundance and cellular sites of expression of CFTR are strongly influenced by developmental, spatial, and humoral factors, supporting the concept that the expression and function of CFTR are regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Despite extensive study, the precise role of CFTR in the pathogenesis of CF disease remains poorly understood. At the clinical level, severity of CF disease is highly variable even among individuals bearing identical mutations, supporting the concept that environmental and hereditary factors may influence the severity of the disorder (2). These clinical observations, and observations demonstrating strain differences in the severity of CF phenotype after CFTR gene targeting or mutation in mice (8), support the concept that the expression of CFTR and its function in cellular processes may be influenced by many genes or pathways intensifying or mollifying CF disease in various organs. Morbidity and mortality in patients with CF is strongly associated with pulmonary disease caused by mucous accumulation, inflammation, and infection; however, deletion of CFTR mice does not cause significant pulmonary disease suggesting that expression of alternative channels or other complementary genes maintains pulmonary homeostasis in the mouse. Whereas numerous in vitro and in vivo models have been developed for study of CFTR, analysis of genomic responses to the presence or absence of CFTR are complicated by heterogeneity of cell models, and culture conditions that may influence cell function and gene expression independently of CFTR. Direct RNA analysis of pulmonary tissue from humans with CF is complicated by the nearly ubiquitous, severe pulmonary infections that may secondarily modify cellular responses and gene expression, complicating identification of responses to CFTR in vivo..

The iFABP-hCFTR, mCFTR() mice have been maintained in a mixed FVB/N, C57BL/6 background without evidence of gastrointestinal or pulmonary disease for nearly a decade in our laboratory. Histological andbiochemical studies identified no overt pathology in lung tissue from these mice compared with CFTR expressing littermate controls (10, 11).

Hybridization data were normalized in a CCAAT enhancer-binding protein two-step process to remove or minimize systemic sources of variation at both chip and gene level. Specifically, each chip was normalized to the distribution of all genes on the chip to control for variation between samples. Each RNA from mCFTR() mice was normalized to its specific control (i.e. sex and age-matched mCFTR(+) littermates). Data were further transformed into log ratio for analysis and symmetry of distribution. Changes in mRNAs were identified by the combination of a distribution analysis (JMP4, SAS Institute, Inc.), and the Welch analysis of variance. Outlier box and quartile box plots were used to identify outliers with the definition of up-outlier  >  upper quartile + 1.5 (interquartile range), and the down-outlier  <  lower quartile  1.5 (interquartile range). Significant changes were calculated by the Welch t test at p  <  0.05. Adjusted p values were calculated by Westfall and Young permutation for correction of false positives (GeneSpring 4.2.1, Silicon Genetics). Comparisons between genotype and age groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance. To identify genes that were differentially expressed because of CFTR genotype regardless of age, hierarchical, and k-means clustering were used to identify consistent changes in gene expression in response to the lack of CFTR at all three time points. Candidate RNAs were further filtered on the basis of reproducibility and absolute intensity. Mean, standard deviation, and coefficient variation were calculated for each replicate. Replicates with coefficient variations  >  50% were deleted from analysis. Genes whose expression was below the level of detection were eliminated as experimental noise..

The log-ratio distribution and outlier plot of the combined data set are represented by Fig. 2. A total of 1977 outliers were identified from 12442 genes/expressed sequence tags analyzed. The abundance of 848 RNAs was increased; 1129 were decreased. Welch t test together with the Westfall and Young step-down permutation further narrowed the number of differentially expressed RNAs to 315. Hierarchical clustering was used to visualize and classify the data set (Fig. 3). Data are shown in a two-dimensional matrix to identify groups of genes with similar expression patterns and show remarkably ordered gene expression profiles of 315 selected genes. On the chip level (top dendrogram) RNAs influenced by CFTR formed two distinct groups. Within each group, the samples collected from age-matched pairs were more closely related than those from different ages, suggesting that age also influenced gene expression.

Genes were further filtered for the consistency of differences in expression levels across all time points (coefficient variation  <  50%) and for their absolute intensity above 243 (90% of genes called absent by Affymetrix software,  < 243 for this data set).

0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	50	Expression of Genes Modulating CFTR-- Expression of a number of genes known to influence CFTR expression was enhanced in the lungs of CFTR() mice, including CEBP and IL-1 suggesting that CFTR cells responded by enhancing levels of RNAs encoding transcription factors or pathways that may compensate for the lack of CFTR. IL-1 increased CFTR gene transcription in epithelial cells in vitro (15) and cis-acting elements binding CEBP (to CCAAT enhancer sites) and c-Fos (to AP-1 elements) are present in the promoter-enhancer regions of the mouse CFTR gene (16, 17). Previous studies demonstrated that CEBP directly enhanced CFTR gene transcription in vitro (18), thus, the increased CEBP expression may represent a potential compensatory response to CFTR deficiency that, in turn, may influence expression of genes unrelated to CFTR. Expression of c-fos was also increased in the mCFTR() mice. Whereas AP-1 sites have been identified in the hCFTR promoter, the precise role of c-fos in regulation of CFTR has not been clarified; although treatment of various cell types with phorbol esters decreased CFTR gene transcription in vitro (18). Because CEBP and c-fos activate or inhibit the expression of numerous genes that share cis-active elements with the CFTR gene, changes in their activity may broadly influence gene expression, perhaps inadvertently linking CFTR deficiency to the expression of genes whose activities are not directly related to CFTR protein function. RNA encoding TNF-AIP-3, a zinc finger transcription factor, was also increased in the CFTR() mice, further linking transcription responses to the lack of CFTR. Of considerable interest, TNF-AIP-3 RNA was induced by either IL-1 or TNF. TNF-AIP-3 inhibited NFB translocation in vitro, and may represent a compensatory response to the increased expression of IL-1 seen in the CFTR() mice (19). JAK-3, nuclear receptor subfamily 2, and interferon regulatory factor-1 RNAs were decreased in CFTR() mice. These RNAs encode transcription factors that regulate various pathways involved in inflammation and may, therefore, represent responses to the proinflammatory proteins induced in the CFTR() mice, in essence, being secondarily responsive to initial compensatory changes..

Most prominent among genes whose expression was increased were a family of calcium-binding proteins termed the calgranulins (S100A8, S100A9, and calbindin D9K). S100A8 is expressed primarily by macrophages and monocytes and its expression is enhanced by various cytokines including TNF-, IL-1, and interferon  (20, 21). This family of peptides is expressed by various cell types and share potent chemoattractant activities, stimulating inflammatory cell trafficking. Increased expression of S100A8 (calgranulin A) was previously demonstrated in alveolar macrophages from CFTR mutant mice, the authors suggesting that increased S100A8 may contribute to the enhanced inflammatory responses seen in the absence of CFTR (22). Expression of S100A8 by alveolar macrophages was induced by TNF-, interferon  and IL-1, mediated at least in part by AP-1-dependent pathways (20). Chitinase A mRNA was also consistently increased in the lungs of CFTR() mice. The acidic chitinase A is a small peptide containing a mammalian lectin domain that binds complex carbohydrates on surfaces of microbial pathogens including fungi. Like the S100 family of proteins, chitinase family members are also expressed by alveolar macrophages in the lung (23). Thus, decreased mCFTR initiated changes in expression of gene expressed primarily in alveolar macrophages. It remains unclear whether these responses are mediated by direct effects of CFTR in alveolar macrophages or by altered cellular signaling initiated by the lack of CFTR in epithelial or other pulmonary cells that secondarily alters macrophage activity..

Increased IL-8 and neutrophilic infiltrates were observed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from CF patients in the absence of documented pulmonary infection (4). Although it remains possible that antecedent, but resolved, infections may have contributed to the increased inflammation observed in the CF, these observations support the concept that CF is associated with increased susceptibility to pulmonary inflammation. In the present study, IL-1, IL-4, and CSF-1 receptor RNAs were increased and each may contribute to the proinflammatory milieu. IL-1 enhances CFTR gene transcription, induces inflammation, and is known to stimulate production of the S100-calgranulins, perhaps indicating a network of genes influenced by CFTR through IL-1. IL-4 is a potent inflammatory mediator that enhances inflammation and mucous production in airway epithelia. Transgenic animals expressing IL-4 or animal models in which IL-4 is induced developed severe goblet cell hyperplasia, increased mucous production, and inflammatory cell infiltrates (24), findings typically found in patients with cystic fibrosis. CSF-3r RNA encoding a receptor that mediates monocytic cell migration, proliferation, and activity in response to CSF-3 (G-CSF) was increased 3-4-fold in the CFTR() mice (25).

0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	56	Despite the increased expression of proinflammatory molecules, there is no evidence of inflammation in the lung of the CFTR() mice perhaps indicating that normal homeostasis is maintained by the complex responses of the lung to the lack of CFTR. The presence of stereotypic changes in expression of many genes suggests that the presence of a single ameliorating gene, for example, an alternative chloride channel, does not fully explain the physiologic adjustment of the lung the CFTR() mice. At present, it is unclear whether these proinflammatory responses are secondary to changes in the expression and function of CFTR in the epithelial cells that, in turn, modulate cell signaling and cytokine production in the lung. Alternatively, the absence of CFTR in the alveolar macrophages may alter expression of genes mediating inflammation in those cells. It is of considerable interest that changes in RNAs modifying inflammation were altered in the lungs of mCFTR() mice in the absence of detectable bacterial infection or inflammation, supporting the concept that the transcriptional adjustment to CFTR deficiency suffices to maintain normal pulmonary homeostasis in the mouse in vivo. Alternatively, the levels of expression of the proinflammatory molecules may not be adequate to cause histologically detectable inflammation. It remains unclear whether these adjustments in gene expression may, in turn, render the CFTR() mice susceptible to inflammation following infection or injury..
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	57	Despite the increased expression of proinflammatory molecules, there is no evidence of inflammation in the lung of the CFTR() mice perhaps indicating that normal homeostasis is maintained by the complex responses of the lung to the lack of CFTR. The presence of stereotypic changes in expression of many genes suggests that the presence of a single ameliorating gene, for example, an alternative chloride channel, does not fully explain the physiologic adjustment of the lung the CFTR() mice. At present, it is unclear whether these proinflammatory responses are secondary to changes in the expression and function of CFTR in the epithelial cells that, in turn, modulate cell signaling and cytokine production in the lung. Alternatively, the absence of CFTR in the alveolar macrophages may alter expression of genes mediating inflammation in those cells. It is of considerable interest that changes in RNAs modifying inflammation were altered in the lungs of mCFTR() mice in the absence of detectable bacterial infection or inflammation, supporting the concept that the transcriptional adjustment to CFTR deficiency suffices to maintain normal pulmonary homeostasis in the mouse in vivo. Alternatively, the levels of expression of the proinflammatory molecules may not be adequate to cause histologically detectable inflammation. It remains unclear whether these adjustments in gene expression may, in turn, render the CFTR() mice susceptible to inflammation following infection or injury..

The abundance of TNF-AIP-3 mRNA, a zinc finger transcription protein, a protein whose expression is induced by both TNF- and IL-1, was increased in the CFTR() mice. TNF-AIP-3 inhibits NFB activity at target genes (19) and may represent a response to the proinflammatory milieu established in the CFTR() lung. PEG-3, a protein that regulates the induction of NFB following TNF stimulation, was also increased, providing for the support for transcriptional relationships between CFTR deficiency and activity of NFB (26). Recent studies of Schroeder et al. (27) support the concept that the CFTR is required for regulation of NFB, serving as a pattern-associated molecular recognition molecule, following pulmonary exposure to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In that study, NFB activation and its nuclear trafficking were deficient in CF cells. Taken together with the observation that IL-1-mediated transcription of CFTR gene transcription is dependent upon NFB, this important pathway mediating inflammation appears to be influenced by CFTR..

Decreased expression of gap junction proteins (Cx43, 40, -37, and -32) and decreased gap junction communication were observed in various in vitro cell systems after exposure to proinflammatory cytokines (28). The observed changes in RNAs mediating cell adhesion and increased expression of IL-1 seen in the CFTR() mice are consistent with findings that in the absence of CFTR, IL-1 and TNF- failed to inhibit cell communication via gap junctions. Previous studies demonstrated that CFTR is required for the uncoupling of gap functions between epithelial cells during inflammation, a process that may restrict the spread of pathogens or signaling among adjacent cells. It will be of interest to test whether cell adhesion mediated by the claudins is also linked to the pathogenesis of CF..

0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	62	Changes in Protein Degradation Pathways-- Several genes involved in protein degradation were altered in the absence of CFTR compared with normal. Proteosome 26 S subunit (PSMC3) is the major proteolytic component of the ubiquitin-dependent proteosome. Proteosome 26 S regulates degradation of proteins influencing cell cycle, oncogenesis, transcription, and immunity, including CFTR itself (29, 30). The proteosome is composed of two subcomplexes, the 20 S proteosome and PA700. PSMC3 expression was modestly, but significantly increased (1.5-fold) in the absence of CFTR. In contrast, PA28 (PSME3), an activator of the 20 S proteosome, was decreased 1.6-fold. These observations are consistent with previous findings that proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF- or interferon- increased expression of the 26 S proteosome and its activators PA28  and  (31), whereas expression of PA28  was decreased by interferon- (32). RNA encoding adaptor protein complex AP-2, 1 subunit (Ap2a1), a protein involved in the formation of intracellular transport vesicles was also decreased in the absence of CFTR. CFTR co-precipitates with -adaptin (33). Recent studies demonstrated that a C-terminal domain of CFTR binds to the AP-2 adaptor complex to form clathrin-coated vesicles that mediates CFTR internalization (34). ADP-ribosylation factor 5 belongs to a family of GTP-binding proteins that play important roles in the control of membrane trafficking, including formation of secretory vesicles at the trans-Golgi network, endosomal and vesicle-plasma membrane fusion (35). Recent studies support the concept that CFTR regulates endosomal fusion and vesicular trafficking (36, 37) indicating potential relationships between CFTR and the actions of ADP-ribosylation factor 5. Another gene in this functional category is represented by kinesin3, an mRNA that was decreased in the lungs of CFTR() mice..

0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	64	Transport Proteins Influenced by CFTR-- RNAs encoding several transmembrane transport proteins and receptors were also altered in the lungs of CFTR() mice, including solute carrier 38 (member 4), the potassium inwardly rectifying channel (Kir 4.2 or Kcnj 15), the glutamate receptor (Grin 2d), the naturietic peptide receptor 3 (Npr-3), and the 3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB-3). Thus, expression of a number of membrane transport proteins was influenced by CFTR, perhaps representing compensatory responses to defects in CFTR-mediated transport activity. Kir 4.2 and Grin 2d RNAs were increased 2-3-fold in CFTR() mice. Kir 4.2 is expressed in respiratory epithelial cells at sites similar to that of CFTR (38). Kir 4.2 regulates cation transport upon which chloride transport via CFTR or other chloride channels may be influenced. Surprisingly, there is evidence for interactions between CFTR and Kir family members because they are both known to bind via PDZ binding domains through interactions with channel interacting PDZ domain protein (39). Likewise, there is precedence for PDZ-dependent interactions among glutamate receptors, CFTR, and Kir family members (40). Thus, the lack of CFTR enhanced the expression of a number of membrane proteins that may interact with CFTR via PDZ domains, perhaps indicating that CFTR-protein complexes may initiate changes in gene expression. These findings support the concept that CFTR interacts with numerous membrane transport proteins and do not support a model in which activity of an alternative Cl transporter alone suffices to compensate for the lack of CFTR in pulmonary cells in the CFTR() mice..

Natriuretic peptides comprise a family of 3 structurally related molecules: atrial (ANP), brain (BNP), and C-type (CNP) whose functions are cGMP-dependent (41, 42). Among them, CNP increased ciliary beat, mucociliary clearance in airway epithelial cells, and activated CFTR-dependent chloride transport (42). Natriuretic peptides regulate cytokine-stimulated NO production via the binding of Npr-3 (43). Because deficient NO production was observed in respiratory epithelial cells of the iFABP-hCFTR, CFTR() mice, the increased expression of Npr-3 in CFTR() mice may represent a compensatory response influencing airway clearance and nitric oxide production via cGMP (44). In contrast to the transport/receptors that were induced, ADRB3, a G protein-coupled transmembrane protein mediating cAMP production was decreased in CFTR() mice. ADRB3 is co-expressed with CFTR in airway epithelium (45) and may be functionally coupled to CFTR via cAMP-independent pathways (46). 2-Adrenergic receptors directly interact with CFTR via the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor to form a signal transduction complex (47). Co-regulation of ADRB3 and CFTR may indicate that these proteins interact closely at both structural and functional levels, a finding that may be linked to the important role of -adrenergic stimulation and cAMP in the activation of chloride transport mediated by CFTR..

Alterations in cytokine production or changes in transcription factor activity caused by the absence of CFTR may secondarily change the behavior of numerous cell types, that may, in turn, contribute to the pathogenesis of CF lung disease by processes that are not direct functions of CFTR. Because CFTR is known to form a membrane-associated cyclic nucleotide-activated Cl channel and interacts with numerous other cellular proteins, changes in gene expression may indicate that cells sense the CFTR protein, CFTR-dependent activity, or CFTR-protein complexes that initiate transcriptional responses related to or unrelated to CFTR function. At present, it is unclear whether the "sensor" is chloride ion, the presence of CFTR, or CFTR-protein complexes in intracellular and membrane compartments or to other functions of CFTR. Likewise, the hierarchy and interrelatedness of the networks of RNA responses to CFTR deficiency remain to be unraveled..

CFTR influenced RNAs encoding transcription factors, ion channels, membrane receptors, cytokines, and intracellular trafficking proteins. Finally, CFTR altered the expression of a number of proteins that interact with CFTR via protein-protein interactions perhaps representing transcriptional responses to functions mediated by CFTR() protein complexes (Fig. 6). The diversity of genes whose expression was altered by CFTR support the concept that, in addition to regulation of Cl transport, CFTR plays diverse roles in multiple cellular functions. The present findings support the hypothesis that pulmonary homeostasis in the CFTR() mouse is maintained by complex genomic responses to the lack of CFTR rather than by the action of a single alternative Cl channel.

A model is proposed by which the lack of CFTR initiates expression of genes that are known to enhance CFTR expression IL-1 and CEBP, secondarily modulating inflammation (1, 2). Increased expression of cytokines, IL-4 and IL-1, and the cytokine receptor, CSF-3R, may influence inflammation (2) as well as expression of genes modulating protein trafficking, degradation, and cell-cell communication (3-5). Abundance of RNA of chemoattractant peptides of the calgranulin family were enhanced, perhaps contributing to a proinflammatory environment within the lung (2). CFTR altered the expression of RNAs encoding transport proteins and membrane receptors that likely interact with CFTR via PDZ domains (6, 7) supporting the concept that pulmonary cells respond to the lack of CFTR or CFTR complexes by regulating the expression of CFTR partners. Alterations in pathways regulating second messengers, including cAMP, via the 3-adrenergic receptor (Adrb3), were observed (7). Absence of CFTR also influenced expression of genes mediating endocytosis, membrane recycling, and regulated secretion (4, 8, 9).     ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	5	We identified a novel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-associating, PDZ domain-containing protein, CAL (CFTR associated ligand) containing two predicted coiled-coiled domains and one PDZ domain. The PDZ domain of CAL binds to the C terminus of CFTR. Although CAL does not have any predicted transmembrane domains, CAL is associated with membranes mediated by a region containing the coiled-coil domains. CAL is located primarily at the Golgi apparatus, co-localizing with trans-Golgi markers and is sensitive to Brefeldin A treatment. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that CAL exists as a multimer. Overexpression of CAL reduces CFTR chloride currents in mammalian cells and decreases expression, rate of insertion and half-life of CFTR in the plasma membrane. The Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor, NHE-RF, a subplasma membrane PDZ domain protein, restores cell surface expression of CFTR and chloride currents. In addition, NHE-RF inhibits the binding of CAL to CFTR. CAL modulates the surface expression of CFTR. CAL favors retention of CFTR within the cell, whereas NHE-RF favors surface expression by competing with CAL for the binding of CFTR. Thus, the regulation of CFTR in the plasma membrane involves the dynamic interaction between at least two PDZ domain proteins.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	7	Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)1 (1-3). CFTR is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel and channel regulator (4) that mediates salt and water balance in a number of tissues, including the airways, intestines, pancreatic and sweat ducts, and kidney tubules (5). In many polarized epithelial tissues, CFTR functions in the apical cell membrane but in the sweat duct CFTR is localized to both the apical and basolateral cell membranes. Because a common mutation in CFTR, F508, is degraded through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated processes, many studies have focused on the trafficking of CFTR through this compartment (6). Much less attention has been devoted to how CFTR is processed through the post-ER pathways..

These data suggested that the C-terminal domain plays a role either in the trafficking to and/or stability within the plasma membrane. The last three amino acids of CFTR (Thr-Arg-Leu) comprise a consensus sequence known to bind to PDZ domain proteins, a family of proteins containing a 80- to 90-amino acid motif that binds to the C terminus of a variety of ion channels and receptors (9-11)..

NHE-RF is a submembranous phosphoprotein that regulates the apical membrane Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 (14). Because NHE-RF associates with ezrin, which itself binds to the regulatory subunit of PKA (15), it was hypothesized that NHE-RF anchors CFTR to the cytoskeleton at a subapical compartment targeting protein kinase A near CFTR (12). E3KARP, an NHE-RF-related protein, was also shown to interact with CFTR (16, 17). CAP70, a subapical protein with four PDZ domains, binds to at least two CFTR molecules simultaneously via PDZ3 and PDZ4 (18). CAP70 and NHE-RF enhance CFTR Cl channel activity in excised patches probably by cross-linking CFTR dimers (18, 19). NHE-RF, E3KARP, and CAP70 are localized to subplasma membrane regions reflecting their proposed roles in anchoring and/or regulating CFTR..

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	13	Although there is growing evidence of a functional interaction between CFTR and PDZ domain proteins at the plasma membrane, little is known about whether PDZ domain proteins play a role in intracellular trafficking of CFTR along the ER, the Golgi, and the plasma membrane. The post-ER secretory pathway involved in the trafficking of wild type and mutant CFTR to the plasma membrane is poorly characterized. A recent study has demonstrated that CFTR has an unusually low distribution in cis-Golgi compartments compared with most membrane proteins (20), raising the possibility that CFTR may utilize novel modes of anterograde and retrograde trafficking mechanisms..

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	15	To learn more about the role of the C terminus of CFTR in processing and trafficking, we used a yeast-two hybrid assay to identify proteins that bind to CFTR. We identified a novel PDZ domain protein, CAL, that interacts with CFTR in the post-ER secretory pathway. The PDZ domain of CAL binds directly to the C terminus of CFTR. Native CFTR and CAL localize with Golgi markers in lung tissue in vivo. Overexpression of CAL suppresses CFTR expression at the cell surface and reduces CFTR currents both in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells. This suppression can be overcome by NHE-RF. Our data demonstrate that CAL modulates the surface expression of CFTR. Although NHE-RF alone does not enhance surface expression of CFTR, it competes with CAL for the binding of CFTR and indirectly enhances expression in the plasma membrane. Thus, the expression of CFTR in the plasma membrane involves the dynamic interaction between at least two PDZ domain proteins.

The bait consisted of the C-terminal 51 amino acids of rat CFTR (aa 1428-1478 of rCFTR), amplified by PCR from a rat lung MATCHMAKER cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The PCR products were subcloned into the BamHI/PstI sites of a pAS2-1 vector, in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Approximately 1  x  107 recombinants of a rat lung MATCHMAKER cDNA library fused to the Gal4 activation domain (CLONTECH) were screened for interaction with the bait protein in Y190 yeast cells on triple-minus plates supplemented with 35 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) (Leu, Trp, His, 3-AT). A rat CAL (rCAL) fragment identified in yeast two-hybrid screening was used to screen a human lung cDNA library (CLONTECH) to obtain the full-length human CAL (hCAL). Cloned inserts were sequenced in both directions by automated fluorescent sequencing (Johns Hopkins University Biosynthesis  and  Sequencing Facility). A partial rat CAL truncated at the extreme N terminus was also obtained by hybridization screening of a rat hippocampus library (gift from Drs. A. A. Lanahan and P. F. Worley)..

Cells were treated with 0.5 mg/ml sodium butyrate for 16 h the day before the experiments as described (23). Transfected cells expressing GFP-CFTR were identified under a fluorescence microscope (TE200, Nikon). Coverslips were perfused with an extracellular solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 20 sucrose, 0.1 DIDS, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Sucrose and DIDS were used to prevent the activation of endogenous chloride currents. Pipette resistance, with a pipette solution (PS) containing (in mM) 150 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 Na2ATP, 1 EGTA, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with Tris), ranged between 5 and 8 M. The input capacitance ranged from 11 to 64 picofarads. pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments) was used to sample and analyze data. Current-voltage (I-V) relationships were obtained at 100 ms of each voltage step from a holding potential of 0 mV. Junction potentials between extracellular solution and PS were measured using a 3 M KCl bridge and were  < 2 mV. Therefore no correction for these potentials was made. Extracellular membrane-permeant cAMP analogue 8-chlorophenyl-thio-cAMP (cpt-cAMP, 250  microM) was applied using a nearby pipette of 30- to 35- microm diameter.

Approximately 1  x  107 recombinants of a lung cDNA library fused to the Gal4 DNA activation domain were screened. A novel protein designated as CAL (CFTR-Associated Ligand) was identified in this screening. Fifty-six clones were isolated that encoded overlapping, partial sequences of CAL. Each contained the consensus sequence for a complete PDZ domain. The interaction between CFTR and CAL was confirmed by re-transforming the cloned cDNA into yeast. The interaction was bait-dependent, because it did not occur with the vector alone. The interaction was also dependent upon the terminal amino acids of CFTR, because it did not occur with CFTR C-terminal constructs missing the terminal 4 or 7 amino acids (data not shown)..

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	44	To obtain the full-length CAL, we screened a human lung cDNA library (CLONTECH) with rat CAL cDNA. Seven independent and overlapping clones were identified. The largest fragment contained a 1362-bp open reading frame, preceded 132 bp upstream by an in-frame stop codon. A start codon consistent with a Kozak consensus sequence (27) was identified. Translation in this reading frame predicts a 454-amino acid polypeptide with an estimated molecular mass of 50 kDa (Fig. 1A). Hydropathy analysis did not detect any putative membrane-spanning regions (28). No targeting signal sequence was detected. The carboxyl half of CAL is identical to the amino half of an aberrant clone Homo sapiens RNA for ros1 oncogene (29). This aberrant clone very likely results from the rearrangement of CAL to the human ros1 oncogene. CAL mapped to chromosome 6q21A by aligning to a finished human genomic sequence (PAC 94G16) in GenBankTM (30). A rat CAL cDNA that is highly homologous to the human CAL (91% identity, 94% conserved) was obtained in a hybridization screen (Fig. 1A). Human CAL is also highly homologous (56% identity, 71% homology) to a protein identified in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome project (ZK849.2) suggesting an evolutionarily conserved function (Fig. 1A), as well as to a recently described protein (31). In addition to a PDZ domain, CAL is predicted to have two coiled-coil domains. Coiled-coil domains are also involved in protein-protein interactions (32). The co-existence of coiled-coil domains and a PDZ domain suggests that CAL can potentially interact with multiple proteins..

Consistent with the wide pattern of expression of CAL mRNA, CAL protein is endogenously expressed in several cell lines, including human bronchial epithelial cells, 16HBE14o (Fig. 2A), the colonic carcinoma T84 cell line (see related data in Fig. 3D) and in the cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cell line, IB3-1 (data not shown). In Western blots, 16HBE14o cells display native CAL at two molecular masses, ~50-kDa and ~100-kDa bands (Fig. 2A, Lysate), when analyzed under non-reducing conditions, but only a single ~50-kDa band (Fig. 2A, +ME and +DTT) when analyzed under reducing conditions. This raises the possibility that CAL can form a homo-multimer. To test this further, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with HA-tagged full-length CAL (HA-CAL) and with each one of the following myc-tagged CAL constructs: full-length (myc-CAL), a construct containing only the C-terminal portion, including the PDZ domain (myc-CAL-PDZ-C), or a construct containing only the N-terminal amino acids, including the coiled-coil domains but minus the PDZ domain (myc-CAL-N-CC). Only in cells containing the myc-tagged full-length CAL (first lane) and the N-terminal portion of CAL (third lane) was it possible to immunoprecipitate HA-tagged full-length CAL with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 2C).

GFP-CFTR has single-channel and whole-cell current properties indistinguishable from wild type CFTR (23). As shown in Fig. 3, HA-CAL and GFP-CFTR were co-immunoprecipitated by a GFP polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Removal of the last 3 amino acid residues of the full-length CFTR (GFP-CFTRTRL) substantially reduced the ability of the truncated CFTR to interact with CAL (Fig. 3A, lane 3), suggesting the importance of the extreme C-terminal PDZ binding motif. The faint band in lane 3 suggests that other weak binding sites for CAL may exist in CFTR..
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	55	To test further whether the PDZ-interacting domain of CFTR is important for the CAL CFTR interaction, we conducted studies using the C terminus of CFTR and the PDZ domain of CAL (Fig. 3B). COS-7 cells were transfected with the HA-tagged PDZ domain of CAL (HA-CAL-PDZ, aa 216-404) and the myc-tagged C terminus of CFTR (myc-CFTR-C, aa 1387-1480). HA-CAL-PDZ was co-immunoprecipitated with myc-CFTR-C using an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3B, lane 3). As a control, HA-CAL-PDZ was not immunoprecipitated by the Myc antibody in the absence of myc-CFTR-C (Fig. 3B, lane 2). Because truncation of C-terminal CFTR residues (TRL) abolishes the binding (Fig. 3A), and binding can occur between portions containing only the PDZ domain of CAL and the C terminus of CFTR (Fig. 3B), the PDZ domain-mediated interaction is both necessary and sufficient for the CAL CFTR interaction..

The bound fractions were examined by Western blot using CAL antisera. Endogenous CAL bound to the immobilized CFTR peptides (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 2) but not to a control peptide (Fig. 3C, lane 3). Because the last 8 residues of CFTR bind to CAL, the interaction is likely to be direct and not mediated through other proteins..

Fig. 6 shows whole cell recordings and summary data measured using the whole cell patch clamp technique. CFTR expressing cells were identified using GFP fluorescence. Expression of CFTR alone (Fig. 6, A and B) produced cAMP-activated Cl currents typical of those we have shown previously for CFTR (23). CFTR Cl currents were not observed in non-transfected or mock-transfected cells (data not shown). Co-transfection of CFTR and CAL resulted in greatly reduced currents despite the expression of CFTR (Fig. 6, C and D). In parallel experiments, the presence of both GFP-CFTR and HA-CAL was verified to prove that green-fluorescing cells were co-transfected with both CFTR and CAL. To test this outcome further, CFTR and CAL mRNA were injected into Xenopus oocytes. In the absence of CAL, expression of CFTR mRNA resulted in cAMP-activated currents typical of CFTR. No such currents were present in non-injected oocytes. Co-expression of CAL clearly inhibited CFTR-mediated cAMP-activated Cl currents (data not shown). These data show that CAL inhibits CFTR currents in both mammalian and Xenopus oocyte expression systems..

First, we co-expressed HA-CAL and GFP-CFTR in COS-7 cells and examined how CAL affects plasma membrane expression of CFTR.

Approximately 10% of CFTR was expressed at the cell surface 40-48 h post-transfection. Overexpression of HA-CAL reduced the expression of GFP-CFTR at the cell surface (Fig. 8A, upper panel). The reduction becomes more pronounced with increasing amounts of HA-CAL (Fig. 8, A and B). In contrast, overexpression of HA-CAL had no effect on plasma membrane expression of GFP-CFTRTRL (data not shown). To test whether overexpression of CAL causes a generalized suppression of membrane protein trafficking, we co-transfected COS-7 cells with HA-CAL and the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG), known to traffic to the plasma membrane through the cis-, medial, and trans-Golgi (34). Overexpression of HA-CAL (Fig. 8C) had no effect in VSVG surface expression. Likewise, CAL has no effect on P-glycoprotein surface expression, which like CFTR is an apical membrane protein (data not shown).

Overexpression of HA-NHE-RF did not change the plasma membrane expression of GFP-CFTR (Fig. 8, A and B, lane 5). Co-expression of HA-NHE-RF with HA-CAL, however, restored cell surface GFP-CFTR expression (Fig. 8, A and B, lane 6).

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	81	We identified a Golgi CFTR-interacting protein, CAL, that plays a role in regulating the plasma membrane expression of CFTR. CAL is the first PDZ domain protein identified that regulates the trafficking of CFTR. Biochemical evidence suggests that CAL can exist as a multimer that is mediated by domains in the N-terminal region. CAL can form clusters of CFTR within the cell when overexpressed, suggesting that multimers of CAL may tether more than one CFTR within the cell as a mechanism to regulate export to the plasma membrane. This is consistent with data that overexpression of CAL suppresses CFTR expression at the cell surface. In contrast to its effect on CFTR, CAL does not affect VSVG surface expression (see Fig. 8C) or of P-glycoprotein expression, proteins that sort to the plasma membrane but do not have C-terminal PDZ interacting domains. CAL also does not affect surface expression of CFTRTRL, eliminating the possibility that the inhibition of surface expression is due simply to the nonspecific effect of protein overexpression. Thus, the role of CAL is restricted to proteins such as CFTR with C-terminal, PDZ domains capable of binding CAL. Given the wide distribution of CAL in many tissues, it is likely that CAL can regulate the surface expression of molecules other than CFTR as long as they have a C-terminal domain capable of binding to CAL. Although CAL is located primarily located within the Golgi, it is also found at the plasma membrane where it may also function (Fig. 7A)..

CAL is the first PDZ domain protein identified that regulates the trafficking of CFTR. Biochemical evidence suggests that CAL can exist as a multimer that is mediated by domains in the N-terminal region. CAL can form clusters of CFTR within the cell when overexpressed, suggesting that multimers of CAL may tether more than one CFTR within the cell as a mechanism to regulate export to the plasma membrane. This is consistent with data that overexpression of CAL suppresses CFTR expression at the cell surface. In contrast to its effect on CFTR, CAL does not affect VSVG surface expression (see Fig. 8C) or of P-glycoprotein expression, proteins that sort to the plasma membrane but do not have C-terminal PDZ interacting domains. CAL also does not affect surface expression of CFTRTRL, eliminating the possibility that the inhibition of surface expression is due simply to the nonspecific effect of protein overexpression. Thus, the role of CAL is restricted to proteins such as CFTR with C-terminal, PDZ domains capable of binding CAL. Given the wide distribution of CAL in many tissues, it is likely that CAL can regulate the surface expression of molecules other than CFTR as long as they have a C-terminal domain capable of binding to CAL. Although CAL is located primarily located within the Golgi, it is also found at the plasma membrane where it may also function (Fig. 7A)..

Coiled-coil domains are found in SNARE proteins and a large number of Golgi resident proteins. Recently, it has been shown that CAL can bind to the Q-SNARE protein syntaxin 6, a protein whose primary function is unknown (31). It is likely that the coiled-coil domains of CAL may mediate interactions with multiple Golgi proteins..

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	85	CAL overexpression also reduces the rate of appearance of CFTR in the plasma membrane suggesting that CAL may reduce the anterograde trafficking of CFTR to the plasma membrane. CAL also reduces the half-life of CFTR in the plasma membrane. There are at least two possible scenarios to explain how CAL may interact with CFTR. First, CAL may be part of an anterograde trafficking complex that controls CFTR movement from ER to Golgi and to the plasma membrane. CAL with two coiled-coil domains may tether CFTR to the Golgi as a requisite step in moving CFTR to the cell surface. The overexpression of CAL may disrupt the stoichiometry of such an anterograde trafficking complex and favor retention of the CAL CFTR complex in the Golgi. Second, CAL may also regulate the retrograde trafficking of CFTR from the Golgi to ER and perhaps promote the recycling of CFTR to the ER for degradation. Thus CAL, like the PDZ protein GRASP 55/65, may play a role in vesicle budding and cargo selection in ER to Golgi and Golgi to membrane transport (35, 36). As shown in Fig. 8a, overexpression of CAL enhances the ER-localized, immature, and core-glycosylated form of CFTR (band B), which is localized to the ER..

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	87	If the role of CAL is to tether CFTR to the Golgi, then what promotes CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane? Clearly, the majority of CAL is located within the Golgi, yet some is also found near the plasma membrane (Fig. 7a). Also, membrane-biotinylated CFTR can be co-immunoprecipitated with CAL (data not shown) indicating that some CAL CFTR complexes do travel to the plasma membrane. Unlike CAL, other PDZ domain proteins such as NHE-RF and E3KARP are associated with the plasma membrane (12), suggesting that they play a key role in the function of CFTR at the plasma membrane. Our data show that, when CAL is overexpressed, CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane is reduced but that suppression can be reversed by NHE-RF. We hypothesize that, because CAL is more abundant in the Golgi, binding of CFTR to CAL may be favored. As a CAL CFTR complex traffics to the plasma membrane where NHE-RF is abundant, CFTR may then bind to NHE-RF, which tethers CFTR to the actin-based cytoskeleton. This tethering of CFTR to the plasma membrane increases the half-life of CFTR in the plasma membrane resulting in the apical polarization of CFTR.2 Overexpression of CAL increases its expression both in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane (data not shown), shifting the stoichiometry of the interaction of the CFTR with NHE-RF toward CAL and decreasing the half-life of CFTR in the plasma membrane. Our data answer a critical question as to why more than one PDZ domain protein interacts with CFTR. At least for CAL and NHE-RF, we show that both are concentrated in different locations within the cell and only transiently interact, most likely within the plasma membrane, to regulate the surface expression of CFTR. Thus, this regulation by two or more PDZ domain proteins may allow for the precise regulation of CFTR surface expression..
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	88	Other membrane proteins are found to bind to multiple PDZ domain proteins. For example, the C termini of the GluR2/3 subunits of AMPA receptors bind to both GRIP/ABP, which contains 7 PDZ domains (37), and to PICK1, which contains a single PDZ domain as well as a domain that interacts with protein kinase C (38). Phosphorylation of the C terminus of GluR2 by protein kinase C prevents its binding to GRIP but not to PICK1, which may contribute to the protein kinase C-induced rapid internalization of surface GluR2 subunits (39). Likewise, the C terminus of the 1-adrenergic receptor binds to a pair of PDZ proteins, PSD-95 and MAGI-2 (40, 41). Although the agonist-induced internalization of the 1-adrenergic receptor is attenuated by PSD-95 co-expression, it is markedly increased by co-expression with MAGI-2 (41). These reports, as well as our present findings, support the notion that multiple PDZ domain proteins interact with the same short C terminus of a membrane protein to regulate its function..

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	90	The precise mechanism of how CAL may hand off CFTR to NHE-RF remains unknown. It is not clear whether it is driven strictly by mass balance, by affinity, or by a combination of these two. In our co-expression system, NHE-RF expression is ~4.3-fold that of CAL (Fig. 8D). Under these conditions, NHE-RF may sufficiently compete with CAL for CFTR binding strictly by mass action. Immunofluorescence localization studies suggested that CFTR is present in both the apical membrane and in the subapical vesicles (42). These findings were confirmed by cryoimmunogold electron microscopy (43). The translocation of CFTR from the intracellular pool to the plasma membrane may be regulated by protein kinase A as observed by some investigators (44, 45) but not by others (23, 46). It is possible that CAL may pass CFTR off to NHE-RF in the subapical vesicles. If so, it is important to determine the endogenous levels of CAL, NHE-RF and other CFTR binding proteins in these locations, as well as their relative affinity to CFTR in native tissues that express CFTR. It is likely that these data, together with their regulation by protein kinase A and/or other physiological and pathophysiological stimuli, will provide a more comprehensive understanding of CFTR trafficking and its regulation in different native tissues..

Recent evidence suggests that some F508 CFTR escapes from the ER and into the early secretory pathway. Understanding the role of interacting proteins such as CAL in CFTR trafficking may prove useful in devising strategies to increase the plasma membrane expression of F508 CFTR. The wide tissue distribution of CAL suggests that it may be important for trafficking of other ion channels and receptors with C-terminal sequences similar to that of CFTR.     ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	2	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   When excised inside-out membrane patches are bathed in symmetrical Cl--rich solutions, the current-voltage (I-V) relationship of macroscopic cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- currents inwardly rectifies at large positive voltages. To investigate the mechanism of inward rectification, we studied CFTR Cl- channels in excised inside-out membrane patches from cells expressing wild-type human and murine CFTR using voltage-ramp and -step protocols. Using a voltage-ramp protocol, the magnitude of human CFTR Cl- current at +100 mV was 74  plus or minus  2% (n = 10) of that at -100 mV. This rectification of macroscopic CFTR Cl- current was reproduced in full by ensemble currents generated by averaging single-channel currents elicited by an identical voltage-ramp protocol. However, using a voltage-step protocol the single-channel current amplitude (i) of human CFTR at +100 mV was 88  plus or minus  2% (n = 10) of that at -100 mV. Based on these data, we hypothesized that voltage might alter the gating behavior of human CFTR. Using linear three-state kinetic schemes, we demonstrated that voltage has marked effects on channel gating. Membrane depolarization decreased both the duration of bursts and the interburst interval, but increased the duration of gaps within bursts. However, because the voltage dependencies of the different rate constants were in opposite directions, voltage was without large effect on the open probability (Po) of human CFTR. In contrast, the Po of murine CFTR was decreased markedly at positive voltages, suggesting that the rectification of murine CFTR is stronger than that of human CFTR. We conclude that inward rectification of CFTR is caused by a reduction in i and changes in gating kinetics. We suggest that inward rectification is an intrinsic property of the CFTR Cl- channel and not the result of pore block..

To investigate the mechanism of inward rectification, we studied CFTR Cl- channels in excised inside-out membrane patches from cells expressing wild-type human and murine CFTR using voltage-ramp and -step protocols. Using a voltage-ramp protocol, the magnitude of human CFTR Cl- current at +100 mV was 74  plus or minus  2% (n = 10) of that at -100 mV. This rectification of macroscopic CFTR Cl- current was reproduced in full by ensemble currents generated by averaging single-channel currents elicited by an identical voltage-ramp protocol. However, using a voltage-step protocol the single-channel current amplitude (i) of human CFTR at +100 mV was 88  plus or minus  2% (n = 10) of that at -100 mV. Based on these data, we hypothesized that voltage might alter the gating behavior of human CFTR. Using linear three-state kinetic schemes, we demonstrated that voltage has marked effects on channel gating. Membrane depolarization decreased both the duration of bursts and the interburst interval, but increased the duration of gaps within bursts. However, because the voltage dependencies of the different rate constants were in opposite directions, voltage was without large effect on the open probability (Po) of human CFTR. In contrast, the Po of murine CFTR was decreased markedly at positive voltages, suggesting that the rectification of murine CFTR is stronger than that of human CFTR. We conclude that inward rectification of CFTR is caused by a reduction in i and changes in gating kinetics. We suggest that inward rectification is an intrinsic property of the CFTR Cl- channel and not the result of pore block..

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; Riordan et al., 1989) is a phosphorylation-regulated Cl- channel that plays a central role in transepithelial fluid and electrolyte transport (Gadsby and Nairn, 1999; Sheppard and Welsh, 1999). The characteristic behavior of CFTR is determined by the function of the different domains from which CFTR is assembled. These include the two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) that are each composed of six transmembrane segments, the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that each contain motifs which interact with ATP, and the unique R (regulatory) domain that contains multiple consensus phosphorylation sites and many charged amino acids. The MSDs assemble to form the Cl--selective pore while the NBDs and R domain control CFTR channel gating (Gadsby and Nairn, 1999; Sheppard and Welsh, 1999)..

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	7	In cell-attached membrane patch recordings, the single-channel current-voltage (I-V) relationship of CFTR outwardly rectifies (Berger et al., 1991; Tabcharani et al., 1991). Berger et al. (1991) attributed this outward rectification to Goldman-type rectification caused by the Cl- concentration gradient. However, subsequent studies have offered alternative explanations. First, Overholt et al. (1993) proposed that rectification is a function of the concentration and permeability of anions within the cell. Second, Fischer and Machen (1994) attributed rectification to high frequency gating of the CFTR Cl- channel at negative voltages. Third, studies by a number of investigators have demonstrated that large anions cause a voltage-dependent block of the CFTR Cl- channel when they are present in the intracellular solution (McDonough et al., 1994; Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1996; Sheppard and Robinson, 1997; Zhou et al., 2002). These anions bind within a deep wide vestibule at the intracellular end of the CFTR pore to prevent Cl- permeation (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1996; Sheppard and Robinson, 1997; Hwang and Sheppard, 1999; Zhou et al., 2002). This block of the CFTR Cl- channel by large intracellular anions is reminiscent of the effect of intracellular cations on inward-rectifier K+ channels (Kir channels; Hille, 2001). Inward rectification of these K+ channels is caused by voltage-dependent block by Mg2+ and polyamines found in the cytoplasm of the cell (Vandenberg, 1987; Lopatin et al., 1994). Thus, as first proposed by Tabcharani et al. (1991), the outward rectification of CFTR Cl- channels observed in cell-attached membrane patches is likely caused by voltage-dependent block by large anions found in the cytoplasm of the cell (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998a, 1999)..
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	8	When inside-out membrane patches excised from cells expressing wild-type human CFTR are bathed in symmetrical Cl--rich solutions, the single-channel I-V relationship of CFTR is linear (e.g., Berger et al., 1991). However, we previously observed inward rectification of wild-type CFTR Cl- currents in excised membrane patches from C127 cells expressing wild-type human CFTR (Lansdell et al., 2000; Cai and Sheppard, 2002). At negative voltages, the I-V relationship was linear, whereas at positive voltages, the I-V relationship exhibited inward rectification that was most marked at voltages above +50 mV (Lansdell et al., 2000; Cai and Sheppard, 2002). Using excised membrane patches from baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing wild-type human CFTR, Linsdell and colleagues observed similar results in some studies (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1999; Linsdell and Gong, 2002), but not in others (e.g., Linsdell et al., 1998; Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998b). Moreover, Zhao et al. (1996) reported inward rectification of CFTR Cl- channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of inward rectification of the CFTR Cl- channel. We employ voltage-ramp and -step protocols to study macroscopic and single-channel currents in excised inside-out membrane patches from cells expressing wild-type human and murine CFTR and kinetic modeling to analyze channel gating..

The number of channels in a membrane patch was determined from the maximum number of simultaneous channel openings observed during the course of an experiment, as previously described (Lansdell et al., 1998a). Using multichannel patches, we generated macroscopic I-V relationships by averaging currents generated by 15 to 30 ramps of voltage each of 2-s duration; holding voltage was -50 mV. Basal currents with no active CFTR Cl- channels recorded in the absence of PKA (75 nM) and ATP (1 mM) were subtracted from those recorded in the presence of PKA and ATP to generate the I-V relationship of CFTR Cl- currents. To generate ensemble currents, we applied the same voltage protocol used with multichannel patches to membrane patches containing five or less active channels 50 to 100 times. We subtracted basal currents recorded in the absence of PKA (75 nM) and ATP (1 mM) from currents recorded in the presence of PKA and ATP before averaging subtracted currents to generate the ensemble current. For single-channel studies of the voltage dependence of CFTR, voltage was stepped from -100 to +100 mV in 20-mV increments of 30 to 60 s duration. Alternatively, voltage was clamped at a single voltage for 2 to 4-min periods to acquire sufficient data for analyses of gating kinetics..

To determine whether a sampling rate of 1 kHz was suitable for the construction of I-V relationships, we compared the effects of acquiring voltage-ramp protocols at sampling rates of 1 and 5 kHz. Fig. 1 B demonstrates that identical I-V relationships were obtained using the two different sampling rates..

The basal recording is the current in response to a single ramp of voltage with no active CFTR Cl- channels, whereas the recording in the presence of PKA + ATP is the average current of 30 ramps of voltage. Holding voltage was -50 mV and the membrane patch was bathed in symmetrical 147 mM NMDGCl solutions. The voltage ramp protocol used is shown and currents were acquired at a sampling rate of 1 kHz as described in the MATERIALS AND METHODS.

We reasoned that if the I-V relationship of individual CFTR Cl- channels exhibits inward rectification, summation of single-channel currents should reproduce the rectification of macroscopic CFTR Cl- currents. To test this hypothesis, we applied the same voltage protocol used to study macroscopic CFTR Cl- currents to membrane patches containing five or less active channels. Fig. 2 A shows the activity of a single CFTR Cl- channel evoked by five ramps of voltage from -100 to +100 mV. Visual inspection of these single-channel records suggests that current amplitude at negative voltages is larger than that at positive voltages. Consistent with this idea, the ensemble current generated by averaging the single-channel currents elicited by 70 voltage ramps inwardly rectifies (Fig. 2 B). Importantly, the extent of the inward rectification observed for the ensemble current agrees closely with that of macroscopic CFTR Cl- currents (Figs. 1 C and 2 C). For example, at +100 mV the magnitude of the macroscopic CFTR Cl- current was 74  plus or minus  2% (n = 10) of that at -100 mV while that of the ensemble current was 79  plus or minus  3% (n = 5) of that at -100 mV (P > 0.1).

To discriminate between these different possibilities, we investigated the effect of voltage on the single-channel activity of CFTR. Fig. 3 compares the activity of a single CFTR Cl- channel phosphorylated by PKA and ATP at -75 and +75 mV. These single-channel records suggest that inward rectification was not caused by a decrease in the number of active channels present at positive voltages (n = 6; Fig. 3). On the contrary, the single-channel data suggest that inward rectification is caused by both a reduction in i and changes in gating behavior at positive voltages (Fig. 3)..

For example, at +100 mV single-channel current amplitude (i) = 88  plus or minus  2% of that at -100 mV (n = 10), whereas at +100 mV macroscopic current (I) = 74  plus or minus  2% of that at -100 mV (n = 10; P  <  0.001). In agreement with these data, Fig. 3 demonstrates that the pattern of channel gating at +75 mV differs strikingly from that observed at -75 mV. At negative voltages the gating behavior of CFTR was characterized by bursts of channel activity, interrupted by brief flickery closures, separated by longer closures between bursts (Fig. 3, top). In contrast, at positive voltages both the duration of bursts as well as the long closed periods separating bursts were decreased in length (Fig. 3, bottom)..

Using this approach, Winter et al. (1994) demonstrated that the gating kinetics of single phosphorylated wild-type CFTR Cl- channels are described equally well by the linear three-state schemes shown in Figs. 6 A and 7 A. In these schemes, C1 represents the long duration closed state separating channel openings, C2 the brief flickery closures that interrupt channel openings, and O the open state. Transitions between the three states are described by the rate constants ss1, ss2, 1 and 2. Using the C1C2O kinetic scheme, intracellular ATP regulates CFTR at the transition between C1 and C2: as the ATP concentration is raised, ss1 increases (Winter et al., 1994). In contrast, none of the other transition rates were altered significantly by ATP (Winter et al., 1994). Similar analyses of our own data support this model of ATP-dependent regulation of CFTR channel gating (Cai and Sheppard, 2002). They also suggest that using the C1OC2 kinetic scheme, intracellular ATP regulates CFTR at the transition between C1 and O with ss1 increasing at elevated ATP concentrations while the other rate constants remain unchanged (unpublished data).

When compared with the -75 mV data, 1 was decreased by 53% at +75 mV, 2 was increased by 88%, ss2 was decreased by 24%, but ss1 was unchanged. The duration of bursts is influenced first by 1, the rate constant that determines the velocity with which the channel leaves the bursting state, and second by 2 and ss2, the rate constants that control opening and closing transitions within the bursting state (see Eq. 4). The decrease in 1 delays the exit from the bursting state and hence, increases the duration of bursts at +75 mV. In contrast, the decrease in ss2 and particularly the increase in 2 both act to decrease the duration of bursts at +75 mV. Thus, the data suggest that depolarized voltages produce reciprocal changes in 1 and the rate constants within the bursting state (i.e., 2 and ss2) that tend to offset each other..

When compared with the -75 mV data, 1 was increased by 27% at +75 mV, ss1 was increased by 29%, ss2 was increased by 118% and 2 was decreased by 34%. As with the C1C2O kinetic scheme, the duration of bursts in the C1OC2 model is influenced by 1, 2, and ss2 (see Eq. (5)). However, unlike the C1C2O kinetic scheme, the changes in 2 and ss2 have little effect on burst duration at +75 mV while the increase in 1 accelerates the rate of exit from the bursting state and hence, decreases the duration of bursts at +75 mV. Similarly, the increase in ss1, the rate constant that determines the velocity with which the channel enters the bursting state, causes a reduction in the interburst interval at +75 mV..

These data are in very good agreement with the values of Po calculated using rate constant data for the C1C2O kinetic scheme and good agreement with values determined using pClamp software (5% decrease; Fig. 5 C). However, the decrease in Po calculated using rate constant data was not statistically significant, unlike that calculated using pClamp software. We attribute this subtle effect of voltage on Po to the changes in mean burst duration and interburst interval counterbalancing each other..
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	84	To understand better the voltage dependence of CFTR channel gating, we calculated rate constants for both kinetic schemes at -50, -20, +20, and +50 mV and fitted the data using the single exponential function k=k0Pexp (Eq. 2; Figs. 6 C and 7 C). To determine whether rate constants changed with voltage, we performed one-way ANOVAs. Considering first the C1C2O kinetic scheme, this test indicated that ss1 and ss2 did not change significantly with voltage (Fig. 6 C; P > 0.05).2 In contrast, a significant difference was found between voltage and 2 and 1 (Fig. 6 C; P  <  0.05).2 Considering next the C1OC2 kinetic scheme, one-way ANOVAs indicated that 1 and ss2 did not change significantly with voltage (Fig. 7 C; P > 0.05). In contrast, a significant difference was found between voltage and ss1 and 2 (Fig. 7 C; P  <  0.05). Thus, in both kinetic schemes voltage has profound effects on the gating behavior of the CFTR Cl- channel. However, because in both kinetic schemes the effects of voltage on the rate constants tend to oppose one another, CFTR Cl- currents exhibit only weak voltage-dependence..

For the C1C2O kinetic scheme, the total equivalent gating charge for CFTR is 0.32e (Table III) while for the C1OC2 kinetic scheme it is 0.28e (Table IV). These values of gating charge are threefold lower than that of ClC-0, the voltage-dependent Cl- channel of Torpedo electric organ (Hanke and Miller, 1983; Pusch et al., 1995; Chen and Miller, 1996) and about fortyfold lower than those of voltage-gated Na+, K+ and Ca2+ channels (Hille, 2001)..

Previous work indicates that ADP inhibits the activity of CFTR by antagonizing ATP-dependent channel opening to prolong greatly the duration of long closures separating channel openings (Winter et al., 1994). Conversely, the inorganic phosphate analogue, pyrophosphate (PPi) stimulates the activity of CFTR by increasing the frequency and prolonging dramatically the duration of channel openings (Carson et al., 1995b). We were especially interested in the effects of PPi on the voltage dependence of CFTR channel gating, because PPi abolished the asymmetric permeability of CFTR to large organic anions (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998b). We speculated that PPi might convert CFTR from an inwardly rectifying channel to a linear channel. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of PPi on the inward rectification of CFTR Cl- currents using voltage ramp protocols. As a control, we tested the effect of ADP, which is without effect on the asymmetric permeability of CFTR to large organic anions (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998b)..

To explore further the voltage dependence of CFTR, we investigated the effect of voltage on the activity of wild-type murine CFTR Cl- channels in excised inside-out membrane patches. Fig. 10 A demonstrates that at -80 mV the pattern of gating of murine CFTR is characterized by transitions between a closed state and two open states: sustained openings to a subconductance state and brief openings to a full open state (Lansdell et al., 1998b). At +80 mV, the gating behavior of CFTR was also characterized by prolonged openings to a subconductance state and brief openings to a full open state (Fig. 10 A). However, the frequency and duration of openings to the full open state appeared to be reduced compared with those at -80 mV (Fig. 10 A)..

These data demonstrate two important differences between human and murine CFTR: first, the Po of the full open state of murine CFTR is much reduced compared with that of human CFTR (Fig. 10 D). Second, the Po of murine CFTR is greatly decreased at positive voltages, whereas that of human CFTR is little changed (Fig. 10 D).

Studies of other ion channels provide strong support for both hypotheses. For example, the inward rectification of Kir channels, NMDA receptors, and cyclic nucleotide to gated channels is caused by voltage-dependent block of outward current flow by extrinsic cations. In the case of Kir channels the blocking cations are intracellular Mg2+ and polyamines (Vandenberg, 1987; Lopatin et al., 1994), whereas for NMDA receptors and cyclic nucleotide to gated channels the blocking cations are extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Nowak et al., 1984; Zimmerman and Baylor, 1986). In contrast, inward rectification of KAT1, an inward-rectifier K+ channel from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, results from an intrinsic gating mechanism (Zei and Aldrich, 1998). Like voltage-gated K+ channels (Hille, 2001), KAT1 possesses a voltage-sensor, the S4 segment that uses the energy of voltage to control channel gating (Zei and Aldrich, 1998)..

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	106	Several lines of evidence suggest that channel block is not likely to account for inward rectification of the CFTR Cl- channel in excised inside-out membrane patches. First, changes in the composition of the intra- and extracellular solutions did not abolish inward rectification (for data and discussion, see the online supplemental material, available at http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200308921/DC1). Second, inward rectification has been observed using cells expressing either native or recombinant wild-type human CFTR (e.g., Quinton and Reddy, 2000; Lansdell et al., 2000; Linsdell and Gong, 2002; this study), indicating that inward rectification is independent of the expression system used to investigate CFTR. Third, inward rectification of CFTR Cl- channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers was unaffected by changes in the composition of the lipid bilayer (Zhao et al., 1996), suggesting that the surface charge of the membrane lipid does not affect inward rectification. Fourth, the effects of voltage on the function of the murine CFTR Cl- channel (present study) indicate that inward rectification is a common characteristic of human and murine CFTR. Fifth, mutation of several residues within the MSDs alters the shape of the I-V relationship of CFTR. Inward rectification of CFTR Cl- currents is accentuated by mutation of R334, T338, T339, and S341 (sixth transmembrane segment (M6); Gong and Linsdell, 2003; Linsdell et al., 1998; Gong et al., 2002), S1118 (M11; Zhang et al., 2000), and T1134 and N1138 (M12; Gupta et al., 2001). In contrast, mutation of V317 (M5; Zhang et al., 2002) causes outward rectification of CFTR Cl- currents. Based on these data, we speculate that inward rectification is an intrinsic property of the CFTR Cl- channel. Because ADP and PPi, two agents that interact with the NBDs, are without effect on inward rectification and because site-directed mutations in the MSDs enhance inward rectification, we propose that the CFTR pore determines this property of the CFTR Cl- channel..
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	107	Several lines of evidence suggest that channel block is not likely to account for inward rectification of the CFTR Cl- channel in excised inside-out membrane patches. First, changes in the composition of the intra- and extracellular solutions did not abolish inward rectification (for data and discussion, see the online supplemental material, available at http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200308921/DC1). Second, inward rectification has been observed using cells expressing either native or recombinant wild-type human CFTR (e.g., Quinton and Reddy, 2000; Lansdell et al., 2000; Linsdell and Gong, 2002; this study), indicating that inward rectification is independent of the expression system used to investigate CFTR. Third, inward rectification of CFTR Cl- channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers was unaffected by changes in the composition of the lipid bilayer (Zhao et al., 1996), suggesting that the surface charge of the membrane lipid does not affect inward rectification.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	108	For the CFTR pore, itself, to be responsible for inward rectification, the architecture of the pore should facilitate the flow of Cl- from the intra- to the extracellular side of the membrane, but hinder Cl- flow in the opposite direction. To transport ions at maximal translocation rates, ion channels have evolved charged lined vestibules that concentrate and funnel ions toward the selectivity filter (Green and Andersen, 1991; Dutzler et al., 2002, 2003). Based on these considerations, inward rectification of current flow through the CFTR pore might be achieved by asymmetries in the geometry of the intra- and extracellular vestibules, differences in the distribution of Cl--binding sites between the two vestibules or a combination of these factors..

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	110	Evidence for asymmetries in the topology of the intra- and extracellular vestibules is provided by studies of anion permeation and channel block. Anion permeation studies indicate that the narrowest part of the CFTR pore is 0.53 to 0.60 nm in diameter (Cheung and Akabas, 1996; Linsdell et al., 1997), widening under certain circumstances to a diameter of 1.3 nm (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998b). This constriction, which likely represents the selectivity filter, occurs in the region of F337 and T338 in M6 because mutation of these residues altered dramatically the anion permeability sequence of CFTR, whereas mutation of other residues in M6 had less marked effects on anion permeation (Linsdell et al., 1998, 2000; McCarty and Zhang, 2001; Gong et al., 2002; Gupta and Linsdell, 2003). On the intra- and extracellular sides of this constriction, the pore enlarges. The voltage dependence of channel block by large organic anions suggests that the CFTR pore contains a wide intracellular vestibule that funnels blocking anions deep into the pore where they bind, occlude the pore, and block Cl- permeation (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1996; Sheppard and Robinson, 1997; Hwang and Sheppard, 1999; Zhou et al., 2002). Less is known about the topology of the extracellular end of the CFTR pore. Based on the ability of methanethiosulphonate reagents in the extracellular solution to react with M6 residues toward the cytosolic side of the membrane (Cheung and Akabas, 1996), there might also be a wide extracellular vestibule. However, the inability of open-channel blockers to reach their binding sites when added to the extracellular solution and the short length of extracellular loops 3 and 6 led McCarty (2000) to propose that CFTR has a small extracellular vestibule. Consistent with this idea, Linsdell and Hanrahan (1998a)(b) demonstrated that CFTR exhibits an asymmetric permeability to large organic anions (e.g., galacturonate, glutathione, and lactobionate). During the normal gating cycle, flow of large organic anions through the CFTR pore is only permitted in the intra- to extracellular direction (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998a,b)..

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	112	The sixth transmembrane segment plays a crucial role in determining the pore properties of CFTR (Sheppard and Welsh, 1999; McCarty, 2000; Gong et al., 2002). Within M6, the residues R334 (Smith et al., 2001; Gong and Linsdell, 2003), K335 (Anderson et al., 1991), F337 (Linsdell et al., 2000), T338 (Linsdell et al., 1998), S341 (McDonough et al., 1994), I344 (Gong et al., 2002), and possibly R352 (Guinamard and Akabas, 1999; Gong et al., 2002) contribute to Cl--binding sites. Assuming that the narrowest part of the CFTR pore occurs in the region of F337 and T338 (see above and Linsdell et al., 1998, 2000; McCarty and Zhang, 2001; Gong et al., 2002; Gupta and Linsdell, 2003), the data suggest that three Cl--binding sites (S341, I344, and R352) might be located in a spacious intracellular vestibule, whereas two Cl--binding sites (R334 and K335) might be located in a more confined extracellular vestibule. This simple model suggests that current flow through the CFTR pore might inwardly rectify. However, an important caveat of this model is that present knowledge of the mechanism of anion permeation by the CFTR Cl- channel is incomplete and it is quite likely that residues in other transmembrane segments contribute to Cl--binding sites. Nevertheless, asymmetries in the size of the intra- and extracellular vestibules and/or the distribution of Cl--binding sites within the CFTR pore are plausible explanations for the inward rectification of CFTR Cl- currents..
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	113	Besides the architecture of the CFTR pore, voltage-dependent gating might make some contribution to the observed inward rectification of current flow through the CFTR Cl- channel. Work by other investigators and ourselves demonstrate that CFTR channel gating exhibits voltage dependence despite the lack of a marked effect of voltage on Po. First, using cell-attached membrane patches from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing wild-type human CFTR, Fischer and Machen (1994) demonstrated that slow (ATP dependent) gating is voltage independent, whereas fast (flickery intraburst) gating is voltage dependent, becoming the dominant gating mode at strong negative voltages. Second, using excised membrane patches from Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type human CFTR, Zhang et al. (2002) demonstrated that burst duration increases at negative voltages, whereas interburst interval is unaffected by voltage. Third, to investigate the flickery closures that interrupt bursts of channel openings, Zhou et al. (2001) analyzed the gating kinetics of the CFTR variant K1250A whose prolonged openings facilitate the discrimination of fast and slow gating events. Zhou et al. (2001) found that the rate of transition from the short-lived closed state to the open state exhibits voltage dependence and is sensitive to permeant anions in the extracellular solution, suggesting that brief flickery closures represent the voltage-dependent occupancy of an anion-binding site within the CFTR pore by unknown intracellular anions..

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	115	To elucidate the effects of voltage on CFTR channel gating, we adopted a different strategy to other investigators. We employed kinetic modeling to analyze the gating behavior of single wild-type human CFTR Cl- channels in excised membrane patches bathed in symmetrical Cl--rich solutions at 37 degrees C and lightly filtered our data. Using this approach, we determined the effect of voltage on both fast and slow gating events. Our data indicate that voltage has significant effects on CFTR channel gating. Membrane depolarization decreased both the duration of bursts and the interburst interval, but increased the duration of gaps within bursts. However, because the voltage dependencies of the different rate constants were in opposite directions, Po was largely unaffected by voltage. The voltage independence of Po and the lack of effect of ADP and PPi on the inward rectification of CFTR Cl- currents argue that changes in CFTR channel gating do not contribute to the rectification of macroscopic CFTR Cl- currents. However, other data suggest the contrary. First, the predicted CFTR Cl- current (N x i x Po) at +100 mV, which is accounted for by reductions in both i and Po, agrees closely with the measured CFTR Cl- current at this voltage. Second, the Po of murine CFTR is decreased markedly at positive voltages. Third, comparison of the data of Smith et al. (2001) and Gong and Linsdell (2003) suggests that the strong inward rectification of the CFTR variant R334C is not accounted for by voltage-dependent changes in i. Based on these data, we argue that voltage-dependent changes in CFTR channel gating contribute to the inward rectification of macroscopic CFTR Cl- currents..

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	117	Our data indicate that the total equivalent gating charge for CFTR is only 0.30e. The small size of the gating charge of CFTR is consistent with the lack of marked voltage dependence of CFTR channel gating. The data suggest that residues with charged and uncharged polar side chains move only a very small distance within the transmembrane electric field. These residues might be located either along the full-length of the CFTR pore or restricted to a specific region of the permeation pathway. Alternatively, linear three-state kinetic schemes might be too simple to describe the voltage dependence of CFTR channel gating. Because the total equivalent gating charge of CFTR is comparable to the amount of charge movement intrinsic to the voltage-dependent Cl- channel ClC-0 (Chen and Miller, 1996), we favor the former idea. The amino acid sequence of ClC-0 lacks a motif equivalent to the S4 segment, the voltage sensor of voltage-gated cation channels (Hille, 2001). Instead, permeant anions in the extracellular solution act as the source of the gating charge (Pusch et al., 1995; Chen and Miller, 1996). The binding of Cl- ions to a Cl--binding site located at the extracellular end of the ClC-0 pore causes a conformational change that precedes channel opening and inward Cl- flow (Chen and Miller, 1996). Because bound Cl- ions traverse the transmembrane electric field, gating is both voltage and Cl- concentration dependent (Pusch et al., 1995; Chen and Miller, 1996). Excitingly, the structural basis of this gating mechanism has been elucidated following the determination of high-resolution crystal structures of bacterial CLC proteins (Dutzler et al., 2002, 2003). In these bacterial CLC channels, the Cl--binding site closest to the extracellular end of the selectivity filter is gated by the carboxyl group of glutamate (E)148 that protrudes into the CLC channel pore: when the carboxyl group of E148 is bound to the Cl--binding site the pore is closed, but when a Cl- ion binds the pore opens to allow Cl- permeation (Dutzler et al., 2002, 2003)..
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	118	The regulation of CLC channel gating by localized motions of an amino acid side chain (Dutzler et al., 2003) raises the question as to whether a similar mechanism might operate in the CFTR Cl- channel. However, anion permeation through the CFTR pore is tightly linked to the function of the NBDs that power channel gating. For example, Kogan et al. (2003) recently demonstrated that glutathione permeation through the CFTR pore is controlled by ATP binding rather than ATP binding and hydrolysis as in the case of Cl- permeation. These data suggest that global conformation changes in the structure of the CFTR protein control Cl- permeation, not local changes in the orientation of amino acid side-chains. If this idea were correct, it would suggest that CFTR channel gating shares similarities with activation gating in K+ channels that involves the reorientation of transmembrane -helices (Jiang et al., 2003). Future studies should test this possibility..

In this paper, we describe the CFTR regulation by syntaxin 8, a t-SNARE protein (target soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) involved in the SNARE endosomal complex. Syntaxin family members are key molecules implicated in diverse vesicle docking and membrane fusion events. We found that syntaxin 8 physically interacts with CFTR: recombinant syntaxin 8 binds CFTR in vitro and both proteins co-immunoprecipitate in HT29 cells. Syntaxin 8 regulates CFTR-mediated currents in chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing CFTR and syntaxin 8. Iodide efflux and whole-cell patch-clamp experiments on these cells indicate a strong inhibition of CFTR chloride current by syntaxin 8 overexpression. At the cellular level, we observed that syntaxin 8 overexpression disturbs CFTR trafficking. Confocal microscopy shows a dramatic decrease in green fluorescent protein-tagged CFTR plasma membrane staining, when syntaxin 8 is coexpressed in COS-7 cells. Using antibodies against Lamp-1, TfR or Rab11 we determined by immunofluorescence assays that both proteins are mainly accumulated in recycling endosomes. Our results evidence that syntaxin 8 contributes to the regulation of CFTR trafficking and chloride channel activity by the SNARE machinery..

It is characterized by mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene that encodes a cAMP-activated chloride channel expressed at the apical membrane of epithelial cells (Rommens et al., 1989; Riordan et al., 1989). The CFTR protein is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter with a specific cytoplasmic regulator domain (R) whose phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) activates the CFTR chloride conductance (reviewed by Ostedgaard et al., 2001)..

Indeed, CFTR expression has been linked to the regulation of numerous ionic channels and it is now assumed that CFTR is a key member of a complex network of ionic channels (Gabriel et al., 1993; Stutts et al., 1995; Sugita et al., 1998; Ji et al., 2000) and cytoplasmic proteins in epithelia. For example, CFTR interacts with several proteins containing PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domains. Most of these proteins are localized in a subplasma membrane region (Short et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2000; Raghuram et al., 2001), and one was found in the Golgi apparatus (Cheng et al., 2002). Interactions were also detected between CFTR and proteins involved in the intracellular vesicle trafficking. Notably, the C-terminus of CFTR binds to the endocytic clathrin adaptator complex AP-2 (Weixel and Bradbury, 2000), presumably during the internalization of CFTR from the plasma membrane. Several studies are now focusing on the relationships between CFTR and proteins of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) family. These proteins are involved in the membrane fusion events happening during the different steps of vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells (reviewed by Chen and Scheller, 2001)..

The region of syntaxins upstream of this transmembrane domain protrudes at the cytoplasmic side of vesicle or plasma membrane. Remarkably, a direct interaction between the SNARE homology domain of syntaxin 1A and the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CFTR is thought to be responsible for inhibiting CFTR chloride channel activity (Naren et al., 1997; Naren et al., 1998; Naren et al., 2000; Cormet-Boyaka et al., 2002)..

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	12	We have previously described the cloning of human syntaxin 8 cDNA (STX8 gene), using the R domain of CFTR as a bait in the two-hybrid screening of a human fetal lung library (Thoreau et al., 1999). Subsequently, syntaxin 8 has been localized in different endosomal compartments: it has been involved in trafficking from early endosome (EE) to late endosome (LE), or in homotypic fusion events in LE (Prekeris et al., 1999; Subramaniam et al., 2000; Antonin et al., 2000). In the present study, we establish that syntaxin 8 overexpression inhibits CFTR channel activity and trafficking to the plasma membrane. A direct regulation can also be suggested as we show evidence for the existence of a physical interaction between CFTR and syntaxin 8, either directly or within a protein complex. Thus, we propose that syntaxin 8 is a member of the CFTR interaction network. Our results strengthen the idea that the SNARE machinery directly regulates CFTR trafficking and activity..

All experiments were performed at 37 degrees C. The loss of intracellular 125I was determined by removing the medium with efflux buffer every 1 minute for up to 10 minutes. The fraction of initial intracellular 125I lost during each interval time was determined and time-dependent rates of 125I efflux were calculated from ln(125It1 / 125It2)/(t1  to  t2) where 125It is the intracellular 125I at time t, and t1 and t2 are successive time-points (Venglarik et al., 1990)..

GFP-CFTR is known to be functional and the GFP tag does not affect its trafficking and localization (Moyer et al., 1998). Moreover, we have observed, in COS-7 cells, that two cystic fibrosis widespread mutants, GFP-(F508del)CFTR and GFP-(G551D)CFTR, exhibited a pharmacological response and a trafficking consistent with the physiological data (data not shown). Immunofluorescence study showed that in both cases (endogenous or overexpressed), syntaxin 8 was concentrated in a structure close to nuclear envelope, and a cytoplasm punctuated staining indicated the presence of syntaxin 8 in vesicle-like structures..

Cells were transfected with GFP-CFTR alone (A,D), cotransfected with GFP-CFTR and Syn8 (B,E) and cotransfected with GFP-CFTR and the cytosoluble form of syntaxin 8: Syn8TM (C,F). Green fluorescence resulting from GFP-CFTR expression shows strong and continuous localization of GFP-CFTR concentrated in plasma membrane of control cells (A,D). In doubly transfected cells, overexpression of Syn8 (as revealed by red fluorescence) is associated with a strong reduction of GFP-CFTR plasma membrane localization, while a partial colocalization is visualized in a juxtanuclear region as revealed by yellow fluorescence. By contrast, experiments using Syn8TM exhibit a large cytosolic staining of syntaxin 8 soluble form and a plasma membrane staining for GFP-CFTR (C,F).

This result evidenced that double transfection did not affect the expression level of exogenous proteins such Syn8TM or GFP-CFTR as compared with cells transfected with only one of these cDNAs.

However, accumulation of GFP-CFTR or syntaxin 8 in this region did not seem to be linked to the coexpression of both proteins, as GFP-CFTR or syntaxin 8 alone also had a strong staining of this organelle near the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, syntaxin 8 often appeared as dot-like structures corresponding presumably to endosome/lysosome structures, whereas GFP-CFTR appeared more homogenous in the entire cytosol. So, apart from juxtanuclear organelles, wild-type syntaxin 8 and GFP-CFTR did not seem to be colocalized in the distal part of cytosol. By contrast, the Syn8TM immunostaining pattern colocalized with GFP-CFTR not only in the juxtanuclear area but also in a large part of the cytosol. A colocalization between the two proteins was also observed at the plasma membrane in several focal planes (Fig. 5C,F and Fig. 6B)..

Overexpressed (Aa) syntaxin 8 shows a predominantly perinuclear staining and also appears in a cytoplasm punctuated pattern.

As expected, cells overexpressing GFP-CFTR and syntaxin 8 exhibited a strong staining for both proteins in a juxtanuclear area, a compartment where the two proteins highly colocalize (Fig. 7Ad,Bd,Cd). Each fluorogram showed that most syntaxin 8 and CFTR fluorescent plots were placed on the bisector line (Fig. 7Ae,Be,Ce). This indicated a high degree of colocalization of both proteins. In each immunostaining experiment, the highest intensity of merged fluorescence corresponded to the juxtanuclear region (data not shown). Syntaxin 8 immunostaining, whether using the rabbit polyclonal antibody (Fig. 7Aa,Ba) or the mouse monoclonal antibody (Fig. 7Ca), gave a classical tubular/vesicular-like pattern. GFP-CFTR, as described above, was not localized on plasma membrane but on punctuated and tubular-like structures in the cytosol, and a strong signal was seen on the juxtanuclear area (Fig. 7Ab,Bb,Cb). Lamp-1 (an LE/lysosomal marker) staining was observed as a strong vesicular and perinuclear pattern (Fig. 7Ac), but its distribution did not colocalize with Syn8 and GFP-CFTR cellular staining (Fig. 7Ad). These data were confirmed by fluorograms showing that Lamp-1 fluorescence distribution was clearly separated from CFTR and Syn8 fluorescences (Fig. 7Af,g). By contrast, TfR immunostaining (endocytosis-recycling pathway) revealed a dot-like vesicular pattern more extensive in the cytosol than Lamp-1 staining (Fig. 7Bc). Intracellular distribution between TfR and CFTR on the one hand (noted TfR/CFTR) and between TfR and Syn8 on the other hand (noted TfR/Syn8) was mostly in distinct compartments within the cell (Fig. 7Bd). These results were supported by data from fluorograms, which showed two distinct fluorescences in each case. Several plots with high intensity of overlapping fluorescence suggested a colocalization between TfR and CFTR on the one hand, and between TfR and Syn8 on the other, in vesicular structures near the nucleus (Fig. 7Bf',g'). When we compared the TfR/CFTR and TfR/Syn8 vesicular pattern in this region (insert), we observed many similarities suggesting that TfR, CFTR and Syn8 were present in the same vesicles. As the juxtanuclear colocalization between CFTR and Syn8 partially matched to TfR localization, we could identify these vesicles as recycling or post-Golgi endosomes. To test our hypothesis, we have used a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Rab11, a protein that has been found associated with trans-Golgi network (TGN) membranes, post-Golgi vesicles and recycling endosomes (Urbe et al., 1993; Ullrich et al., 1996). In COS-7 cells, endogenous Rab11 displayed a punctuated vesicular pattern scattered throughout the cytoplasm and seemed to accumulate in a tubulo-vesicular structure near the nucleus (Fig. 7Cc). In wild-type cells, a partial colocalization was found between Rab11 and TfR stainings (Fig. 7Db), but no overlap was detected between Rab11 and Lamp-1 stainings (Fig. 7Da). Finally, in COS-7 cells transfected with GFP-CFTR and Syn8, the Rab11 immunostaining profile matched exactly with CFTR and Syn8 stainings (Fig. 7Ca-d). These results were sustained by fluorogram data showing Rab11/Syn8 and Rab11/CFTR fluorescent plots only on bisector line (Fig. 7Ce-g). This clearly showed that these proteins had the same localization. In conclusion, when syntaxin 8 inhibits CFTR trafficking in COS-7 transfected cells, CFTR appears to be restricted to a compartment including at least the recycling endosomes and possibly other post-Golgi vesicles..

All cell images present the projection of the entire Z series sections acquired by fluorescent confocal microscopy. Fluorograms were obtained as described in Materials and Methods. In each experiment, protein colocalizations were analyzed with three fluorograms. Syntaxin 8 (a in A-C) and GFP-CFTR (b in A-C) exhibit perinuclear staining as expected. These two proteins colocalize in the perinuclear region as shown in the merged images (d in A-C) and fluorograms (e in A-C). Lamp-1 immunostaining pattern (Ac) exhibits no colocalization with GFP-CFTR and syntaxin 8 both on merged image (Ad) and fluorograms (Af,g), whereas the immunostaining profile obtained with TfR (Bc) presents a partial colocalization on merged picture (Bd) and fluorograms (Bf,g). To further analyze colocalization compartments, we selected plots with high fluorescence intensity and placed them on the fluorogram bisector line (square in Bf,g) to generate images showing the colocalization patterns between CFTR and TfR (Bf') or Syn8 and TfR (Bg'). The vesicular pattern obtained in each case is very similar and shows a colocalization between the three proteins within these vesicles.

Recombinant GST protein was used as a negative control. Bead-bound recombinant proteins were incubated with COS-7+GFP-CFTR cell lysate, and retained proteins were analyzed by western blot using an anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 9A). A COS-7+GFP-CFTR cell lysate was used as a GFP-CFTR control. The N-terminal tagging of CFTR by GFP did not affect the in vitro binding of syntaxin 1A, which has been shown to interact with the N-terminus of CFTR (Naren et al., 1998). GFP-CFTR was pulled down with syntaxin 8 either with the full-length cytosolic domain of syntaxin 8 or with each of its truncated domain but predominantly with its N-terminal half upstream of its t-SNARE domain. However, this interaction was far weaker compared with GFP-CFTR binding to syntaxin 1A. Nevertheless, these results were significant as CFTR was not retained by GST alone. Because pull-down experiments revealed a weak physical interaction between syntaxin 8 and CFTR, we hypothesized that intermediary proteins could be involved in CFTR/syntaxin 8 complexes. The best candidates were the other components of the endosomal SNARE complex: VAMP8, vti1b and syntaxin 7. Similarly, we produced these recombinant SNARE proteins to test their interaction with CFTR. GFP-CFTR was pulled down either with VAMP8 or vti1b but not with syntaxin 7 (Fig. 9B).

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	73	Regulation of CFTR channel activity by syntaxin 8 We have observed that syntaxin 8 overexpression is responsible for a strong inhibition of CFTR channel, activated either by the cAMP pathway (forskolin stimulation) or by a cAMP-independent pathway through the CFTR activator MPB-91 (Derand et al., 2001; Dormer et al., 2001). Such regulation of ionic channels by SNARE proteins has already been described. For example, physical interactions have been assessed between syntaxin 1A and P/Q-type calcium channels, N-type calcium channels (Bezprozvanny et al., 1995; Sheng et al., 1996; Jarvis et al., 2000) and amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (Saxena et al., 1999). Interestingly, syntaxin 1A inhibits CFTR chloride current by direct protein-protein interaction between the t-SNARE homology domain of syntaxin 1A and the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CFTR (Naren et al., 1997; Naren et al., 1998). In another study (Peters et al., 1999), cAMP-induced delivery to plasma membrane of CFTR present in peripheral vesicles was inhibited by syntaxin 1A in Xenopus oocytes. As in the case of syntaxin 1A, our electrophysiological data indeed showed an inhibition of the CFTR activity due to syntaxin 8 overexpression. This regulation is protein specific, as when we performed the same experiment with syntaxin 3, a SNARE protein that does not bind CFTR, we obtained a normal CFTR activation. Moreover, CFTR modulation required syntaxin 8 to be anchored in membrane, as we showed that its soluble form has no effect on CFTR activity. Thus, CFTR may directly be regulated by a protein-protein interaction, or alternatively, syntaxin 8 overexpression may disturb the vesicular transport machinery. This could affect CFTR recycling or cellular targeting towards the plasma membrane and consequently inhibit the chloride channel activity measured at the cell level..
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	74	Physical interactions between syntaxin 8 and CFTR We have shown a direct protein-protein interaction, given that CFTR was pulled down using immobilized GST-syntaxin 8 recombinant proteins. Moreover, CFTR and syntaxin 8 could be co-immunoprecipitated with each other from CHO-2T or HT29-CL19A cell extracts. These data suggest that syntaxin 8 interacts with CFTR either directly, or as a component of a CFTR-containing complex. However, this interaction is different from the one observed between syntaxin 1A and CFTR. Recombinant GST-syntaxin 1A binds CFTR with a high affinity (Naren et al., 1997), whereas the interaction between syntaxin 8 and CFTR appears to be weaker. Moreover, unlike syntaxin 1A in which only the t-SNARE domain interacts with CFTR, each moiety of syntaxin 8 binds CFTR. Despite the fact that it will be necessary to test the in vitro binding between the different domains of CFTR and syntaxin 8 to ascertain a direct physical interaction, the immunoprecipitation results confirm that syntaxin 8 and CFTR are part of the same complex. As we have precipitated both proteins with the same efficiency in CHO transfected cells and in HT29-CL19A cells (endogenously expressing both CFTR and syntaxin 8), we conclude that this interaction was not induced solely by overexpression. As the affinity between syntaxin 8 and CFTR is weak, syntaxin 8 may not be the major partner of CFTR. Tierce proteins may be necessary to establish a protein complex containing syntaxin 8 and CFTR. This hypothesis is consistent with the pull-down and immunoprecipitation experiments, and could explain the small amount of CFTR retained by GST-syntaxin 8. Possible candidates partner are the different components of the heterotetrameric endosomal SNARE core complex: vti1b, syntaxin 7 and VAMP8 (Antonin et al., 2000; Antonin et al., 2002). Our pull-down experiments suggest that VAMP8 and vti1b, which strongly and directly interact with CFTR, could be partner proteins involved in a CFTR/syntaxin 8 multimeric protein complex. This result strengthens the idea that an entire SNARE complex could regulate ion channel delivery/insertion, retrieval or recycling to the plasma membrane..

GFP fluorescence analysis on COS-7+GFP-CFTR cells showed a strong plasma membrane staining characteristic of mature CFTR cellular localization. However, when syntaxin 8 was cotransfected with GFP-CFTR, a dramatic decrease or a disappearance of CFTR plasma membrane staining was observed and both proteins colocalized in a perinuclear region. Syntaxin 8 impact on CFTR trafficking does not apply to any channel as, when we overexpressed syntaxin 8, the plasma membrane localization of endogenous Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was not affected..

Furthermore, a plasma membrane colocalization between Syn8TM and GFP-CFTR was observed and, interestingly, Syn8TM was seen in the plasma membrane only if CFTR was present too. More generally, Syn8TM is located mainly in cellular structures where GFP-CFTR is abundant. So, when syntaxin 8 is soluble, it may physically bind CFTR and follow its trafficking, but when syntaxin 8 is anchored in vesicle membrane, it binds CFTR too, but only in the cellular compartment where syntaxin 8 assumes its function (i.e. endosome compartments). As Syn8TM had no or little effect on CFTR trafficking, inhibition of CFTR trafficking by syntaxin 8 overexpression could not be related to an excess of protein synthesis in endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, syntaxin 8 must be anchored in vesicle membranes to impair CFTR trafficking, which means that the t-SNARE function of syntaxin 8 can be engaged. These results reinforce the physiological relevance of a putative regulator role of syntaxin 8 on CFTR channel activity..

Our results exhibited no colocalization between Lamp-1 staining and the juxtanuclear compartment where CFTR and syntaxin 8 were accumulated. TfR vesicular pattern partially matched with this region, and CFTR, syntaxin 8 and TfR seemed to be located together in thin perinuclear vesicles. By contrast, Rab11 staining was highly similar to syntaxin 8 and CFTR juxtanuclear staining and we observed a high degree of colocalization both on fluorograms and on the merged image. These results indicate that when syntaxin 8 is overexpressed with GFP-CFTR, both proteins are mainly localized in the same compartment, which could be identified as recycling endosomes and/or TGN membranes. Because we have colocalized CFTR and syntaxin 8 with TfR and Rab11 proteins, we favour the recycling endosome hypothesis..

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	82	Syntaxin 8 is a t-SNARE protein that belongs at least to the endosomal SNARE complex (Antonin et al., 2000), and is consequently involved in the endosomal pathway like syntaxins 7, 11 and 12/13 (Prekeris et al., 1998; Tang et al., 1998; Wong et al., 1998; Valdez et al., 1999; Mullock et al., 2000). Its cellular localization was determined mainly in the early endosome, but syntaxin 8 was also detected in the late endosome and lysosome organelles. The early endosome is a dynamic compartment displaying a highly complex and pleiomorphic organization that contains clearly two functionally distinct subcompartments without real physical boundaries: plasma membrane proteins are recycled via the recycling endosomes or degraded via the endosomal carrier vesicles/multivesicular bodies of the degradation pathway (reviewed by Gruenberg, 2001). In some cases, syntaxin 8 was also observed at the plasma membrane (Subramaniam et al., 2000; Kasai and Akagawa, 2001), suggesting a vesicular cycling of syntaxin 8..

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	84	The mechanism of CFTR recycling is still poorly understood, but CFTR has previously been detected in recycling endosomes using fluorescence microscopy in human bronchial epithelial cells (Poschet et al., 2002). Thus, physical binding between CFTR and syntaxin 8 may occur in recycling endosomes, a cellular compartment which is required for CFTR recycling pathway and where syntaxin 8, probably assembled with other SNARE proteins (i.e. endosomal SNARE complex), is implicated in its vesicular trafficking function. Syntaxin 8 overexpression is likely to disrupt the vesicular transport step in which it is involved, as it has been previously observed for several SNARE proteins (Dascher and Balch, 1996; Low et al., 1998; Peters et al., 1999). This could explain CFTR accumulation in recycling endosomes in our experiments. So our results show that syntaxin 8 appears as an important regulatory protein directly implicated in CFTR recycling pathway..

CFTR is known to be more abundant in the airway epithelium during the second trimester of human development than after birth. This could be a consequence of the change in function of the respiratory epithelium from chloride secretion to sodium absorption near term. Alternatively it might reflect an additional role for CFTR in the developing airway epithelium. Though the lung epithelia of CF fetuses and infants rarely show gross histological abnormalities, there is often evidence of inflammation. Our aim was to establish whether CFTR expression levels correlated with specific developmental stages or differentiated functions in the ovine fetal lung. We evaluated CFTR expression using a quantitative assay of mRNA at 14 time points through gestation and showed highest levels at the start of the second trimester followed by a gradual decline through to term. In contrast, ENaC expression increased from the start of the third trimester. These results support a role for CFTR in differentiation of the respiratory epithelium and suggest that its expression levels are not merely reflecting major changes in the sodium/chloride bulk flow close to term. These observations may have significant implications for the likely success of CF gene therapy in the postnatal lung..

The initial pathology of CF is exhibited in the pancreas in the early second trimester of gestation, when proteinaceous material starts to obstruct the ductal tree (8,9). This is perhaps not surprising since CFTR is expressed in epithelia from before the start of the second trimester of human development and CFTR expression levels are high in the mid-trimester pancreas (10 to 12). In most tissues the CFTR expression levels show little fluctuation between the second trimester of gestation and postnatal life. However, CFTR appears to be developmentally regulated in both human and sheep lung epithelium (11 to 13) where high expression levels during fetal life are in contrast to much lower abundance of CFTR mRNA by birth, and into adulthood.

Since the CFTR gene is known to exhibit a range of alternatively spliced forms in a number of species (18) it was necessary to confirm that no aberrant transcripts lacking parts of exons 6a and 6b were produced from the ovine gene. Conventional RT to PCR was carried out using primers spanning exons 4 to 7 and no alternative transcripts lacking exons 6a or 6b were detected in RNA from lung at mid-gestation or birth, pancreas, small intestine, salivary gland and colon at 2 days after birth (data not shown). These results suggested that the real-time TaqMan RT to PCR assay targeted to the exon 6a/6b boundary, would accurately reflect total CFTR mRNA transcription..

Values at 52 days of gestation, the end of the first trimester, were 75-fold higher than those at birth. By 66 days, CFTR mRNA levels were reduced 4.5-fold before increasing between 74 and 80 days. After levels peaked at 80 days of gestation, there was a gradual decline toward birth with negligible levels of expression by 4 days before term (143 days) and at birth. Two days after parturition, levels of CFTR mRNA increased slightly and this expression level was maintained at 2 weeks of age and in adult sheep tissue. Experiments were performed three times with samples analysed in triplicate. To evaluate the variation in CFTR expression levels in individuals at specific time points, samples were analysed from a sib pair at 74 days gestation and a half-sib pair at 2 days after birth. In both cases, CFTR expression levels were not significantly different from each other (74 days, P = 0.69; 2 days, P = 0.86; two-tailed Student s t-test)..

The gradual decline in CFTR that we observed during ovine fetal lung development could be accounted for by at least two explanations. Either, the percentage of cells that express CFTR within the lung epithelium decrease with time or the levels of expression within the same cell type gradually decreases. On the basis of previous data we would expect the former explanation to be correct. In postnatal human lung epithelium significant CFTR expression is limited to specific cells within the serous portion of submucosal glands and individual cells in the airway surface epithelium (20,21). This is in contrast to the apparent expression of CFTR mRNA in the majority of cells in the fetal lung epithelium (11). Furthermore, in human trachea, CFTR expression was seen to be intermediate and diffuse during the first trimester by in situ hybridization (11). In the second trimester, CFTR mRNA expression was reduced and limited to a subset of cells in the epithelia of the trachea and by the third trimester, only individual cells expressed CFTR but at very high levels (12)..

However, the quantitative assays show that in contrast to the human CFTR gene, which is expressed at a higher level in the crypts of the small intestine than in the colon, ovine CFTR mRNA is most abundant in the colonic epithelium. This may reflect functional differences in the ruminant digestive system.

The fetal lung is filled with a high chloride, low pH fluid that is distinct from amniotic fluid. Chloride is actively secreted from the lung epithelium into the lung lumen during development and as a chloride ion channel, CFTR protein could contribute to this process. However, chloride conductances other than CFTR are likely to be more important in fetal lung fluid secretion since CF is not associated with hypoplastic lungs at birth.

Recent data have shown that ENaC is inhibited by CFTR, which probably interacts directly with it (2,25,26). The gradual decline in CFTR mRNA levels and protein would be compatible with enabling ENaC activity. Furthermore, we have shown that the abundance of ENaC transcripts is inversely proportional to the levels of CFTR mRNA in the developing ovine lung after the second trimester, hence the expression of the genes encoding these two ion channels may be also coordinately regulated..

The periods of high and low CFTR expression that we have defined, correspond to distinct developmental phases in the sheep lung. Relatively high levels of CFTR mRNA expression are observed during the pseudoglandular phase (between 40 and 80 days of sheep gestation) when the bronchial tree and acini form. During the developmental progression to the canalicular phase (80 to 120 days of gestation) when differentiation into type I and II epithelial cells occurs, CFTR mRNA levels begin to decline, and remain low until birth. Larson et al. (28) have shown that overexpression of CFTR in the lungs of wild-type mice, at 15 to 16 days (corresponding to the late pseudoglandular and early canalicular developmental stages), advanced epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, the same investigators suggested that transient expression of CFTR in CF mice following intramniotic injection of adeno-CFTR cDNA at 15 to 16 days of mouse gestation, corrected the lethal intestinal disease (29). The expression profile of CFTR in the developing sheep lung is consistent with data from the mouse that suggest a crucial role for CFTR in lung epithelial maturation.

Relative standard curves for CFTR and 18S rRNA levels were generated from seven, sequential, 5-fold dilutions of a common arbitrary sample of lung RNA at 83 days gestation. The determined arbitrary values for CFTR were divided by the appropriate 18S rRNA value to give an expression ratio. This ratio was then expressed as a percentage of one chosen sample (the  calibrator ). For all experiments, total RNA at 83 days of gestation was used as the calibrator sample. Standards and experimental samples were assayed three times with each sample analysed in triplicate in each experiment. Reaction controls were performed which omitted RT and/or template RNA. Standard curves were fitted by linear regression and goodness of fit was reported as the coefficient of determination (R2)..

Because the CFTR is expressed in the epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract and all CF mouse models are characterized by gastrointestinal obstruction, we hypothesized that CFTR null mice would have increased epithelial cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis within the small intestine. The rate of intestinal epithelial cell migration from crypt to villus was increased in CFTR null mice relative to mice expressing the wild-type CFTR. This difference in migration could be explained by an increase in epithelial cell proliferation but not by a difference in apoptosis within the crypts of Lieberkuhn. In addition, using two independent sets of CF cell lines, we found that epithelial cell susceptibility to apoptosis was unrelated to the presence of a functional CFTR. Thus increased proliferation but not alterations in apoptosis within epithelial cells might contribute to the pathophysiology of CF..

Mutation of the CFTR results in a decrease in epithelial cell chloride permeability. Although the defect affects all exocrine tissues, in humans it manifests itself primarily in the airways and intestine. CF is characterized by reduced chloride and fluid secretion, which results in accumulation of mucus within the bronchioles and in meconium ileus in CF newborns and intestinal obstructions in older CF patients. In all mouse models of CF in which the CFTR has been deleted by insertional or deletional mutagenesis, intestinal pathophysiology is characterized by mucus accumulation in the crypts of Lieberkuhn, goblet cell hyperplasia, and intestinal obstruction. In addition, the CFTR is expressed in the epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract with a reduction in expression along the crypt-to-villus axis (7, 26)..

Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is a physiologically relevant process that occurs in regenerating tissues such as the lung and intestine. Cell turnover is a balance between proliferation and elimination, and cell proliferation has been shown to be greater in airway epithelia and nasal polyps in CF patients than in tissue from non-CF patients (12, 15). Although this phenomenon has traditionally been attributed to inflammation, the possibility that the proliferative differences might be due to differential expression of the CFTR has not been addressed..

Therefore, a method previously described by Potten (21) in which apoptosis is quantified by calculating the percentage of cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei within the first 10 cells following the Paneth cells in the crypts of Lieberkuhn was used to quantify apoptosis in the small intestine of CFTR mice. Crypts were scored by an investigator blinded to the identity of animals that met the following criteria: 1) Paneth cells could be viewed, 2) the crypt lumen could be seen, and 3) a minimum of 10 nonoverlapping epithelial cells in the crypt column could be distinguished. Levels of spontaneous apoptosis were evaluated in control animals. Whole body cesium gamma irradiation was used to induce apoptosis in the small intestine of CFTR mice in an attempt to uncover genotypic differences in susceptibility to apoptosis. An initial dose-response curve using CFTR +/ mice revealed that significant epithelial cell apoptosis could be seen 3 h after whole body cesium gamma irradiation with 100 rads. Higher doses of gamma irradiation did not result in detection of more apoptotic cells. Therefore, subsequent experiments were performed with a dose of 100 rads, and the animals were killed 3 h after gamma irradiation. Following fixation and sectioning as described above, intestinal tissue was deparaffinized, stained with hematoxylin, and placed on a coverslip with Permount. The average number of apoptotic nuclei was determined in a minimum of 50 crypts/animal in 18 CFTR / mice (8 control, 10 irradiated) and 14 each of +/ and +/+ mice (5 control, 9 irradiated) and expressed as a percentage of the first 10 crypt cells. ANOVA was used to test whether irradiation increased intestinal cell apoptosis, and two-tailed t-tests were used to determine the statistical significance of irradiation within each genotype..

Higher doses of gamma irradiation did not result in detection of more apoptotic cells. Therefore, subsequent experiments were performed with a dose of 100 rads, and the animals were killed 3 h after gamma irradiation. Following fixation and sectioning as described above, intestinal tissue was deparaffinized, stained with hematoxylin, and placed on a coverslip with Permount. The average number of apoptotic nuclei was determined in a minimum of 50 crypts/animal in 18 CFTR / mice (8 control, 10 irradiated) and 14 each of +/ and +/+ mice (5 control, 9 irradiated) and expressed as a percentage of the first 10 crypt cells. ANOVA was used to test whether irradiation increased intestinal cell apoptosis, and two-tailed t-tests were used to determine the statistical significance of irradiation within each genotype..

By 48 h, the distance that the epithelial cells from the CFTR / mice have migrated is significantly greater than the distance of migration in the CFTR +/ mouse intestine (P = 0.018) (Fig. 1). Because epithelial cell migration from the crypts of Lieberkuhn up the intestinal villi is the net result of proliferation and apoptosis within the crypts, both components were evaluated separately to see if either or both are altered as a result of the expression of the mutant CFTR. An increase in epithelial cell migration might occur if apoptosis is reduced and/or proliferation within the crypts of Lieberkuhn is increased..

CFTR mice given an intraperitoneal injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were killed 2-48 h after BrdU injection. Cells that incorporated BrdU were localized immunohistochemically, and the distance from the base of the crypt of Lieberkuhn to each BrdU-positive cell was determined in 20 animals (3 animals/genotype were evaluated at 2 and 24 h and 4 animals/genotype were examined at 48 h). BrdU-labeled epithelial cells from CFTR / mice migrate up the intestinal villi at a faster rate than do cells from CFTR +/ mice. Each point represents the mean  plus or minus  SE of the most distal BrdU-positive cell for the animals in the group.

To determine whether the low levels of spontaneous apoptosis seen within the crypts masks a difference in susceptibility to apoptosis, intestinal apoptosis was induced with whole body cesium gamma irradiation. Irradiation significantly increased apoptosis in all genotypes (P  <  0.001) but did not uncover any differences in susceptibility to apoptosis between genotypes (Fig. 2). Epithelial cells at the villus tips do not show nuclear fragmentation and condensation and, additionally, detection of apoptosis in the gastrointestinal tract by TUNEL is highly variable (19).

0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	55	Many CF patients and all mouse models of CF have a common pathology in their susceptibility to gastrointestinal obstruction. In the normal intestine, epithelial cells line the villi of the absorptive surfaces. These cells are continuously regenerated by proliferation in the crypts of Lieberkuhn, differentiation, and migration up the villi. At the tips of the villi, the cells undergo apoptosis and are shed into the lumen (11, 24). In addition, Martin et al. (18) have shown that both proliferation and apoptosis occur in the stem cells within the crypts and that apoptosis within the crypts is likely to be an important part of the homeostatic process for tissue maintenance. Under normal conditions, stem cell proliferation and epithelial sloughing are in equilibrium. As we have shown in the current study, epithelial cells in CFTR / mice migrate up the crypt-villus axis at a greater rate than in animals expressing a functional CFTR. The epithelial cells from CFTR / mice migrated 27% farther in 48 h than those from the CFTR +/ mice. This difference in rate is due to differences in proliferation and not apoptosis within the crypts of Lieberkuhn with ~12% more cells with proliferative capacity in the CFTR / mice than the CFTR +/ mice. Because villus length is not different between the genotypes (data not shown), the increased number of cells proliferating within the crypt and migrating up the villi would lead to an increase in the mass of cells that are sloughed into the gastrointestinal tract..

At the tips of the villi, the cells undergo apoptosis and are shed into the lumen (11, 24). In addition, Martin et al. (18) have shown that both proliferation and apoptosis occur in the stem cells within the crypts and that apoptosis within the crypts is likely to be an important part of the homeostatic process for tissue maintenance. Under normal conditions, stem cell proliferation and epithelial sloughing are in equilibrium. As we have shown in the current study, epithelial cells in CFTR / mice migrate up the crypt-villus axis at a greater rate than in animals expressing a functional CFTR. The epithelial cells from CFTR / mice migrated 27% farther in 48 h than those from the CFTR +/ mice. This difference in rate is due to differences in proliferation and not apoptosis within the crypts of Lieberkuhn with ~12% more cells with proliferative capacity in the CFTR / mice than the CFTR +/ mice. Because villus length is not different between the genotypes (data not shown), the increased number of cells proliferating within the crypt and migrating up the villi would lead to an increase in the mass of cells that are sloughed into the gastrointestinal tract..

Potentially, differences in intracellular pH might account for the enhanced proliferation in CFTR / cells. Cytosolic pH is thought to be one of the factors that control the rate of proliferation (8) with cytoplasmic alkalinization constituting a signal for mitogenesis (1, 22, 27). In addition, cells with higher intracellular pH are more likely to be in the S, G2, or M phases of the cell cycle, whereas cells with lower pH are more likely to be in G1 (19). Cells expressing a mutated CFTR have been reported (5, 6) to have an elevated cytosolic pH, and overexpression of the wild-type CFTR but not a mutant CFTR results in growth arrest (23). Thus a mutation in the CFTR may result in an elevated intracellular pH, which stimulates the cell to undergo proliferation more readily and thus increase the rate at which epithelial cells of the crypts of Lieberkuhn proliferate and migrate up the intestinal villi..

Chronic inflammation has been shown to be present in the CF intestine with increased luminal content of immune cell constituents, secretory immunoglobulins, and cytokines (25).

In this initial study, cycloheximide and etoposide were used to induce apoptosis. The CFTR is an anion channel that when mutated does not allow for chloride to be transported across the plasma membrane. Because this is a transport problem, one concern with the use of any drug or chemical to induce apoptosis is a difference in the ability of the cells to transport the drug or chemical across the cell membrane. To avoid this potential problem in the current studies, UV irradiation was utilized as the apoptotic stimulus. Cells expressing the mutated CFTR were more resistant to apoptosis induced by UV irradiation than cells expressing the wild-type CFTR, which is in accordance with the findings of Gottlieb and Dosanjh (9). However, one control that was lacking from the original set of experiments was the introduction of the wild-type CFTR into these resistant cell lines to restore susceptibility to apoptosis. In the current study, infection of C127 F08 cells with an adenovirus expressing the wild-type CFTR failed to restore susceptibility to apoptosis. -galactosidase adenovirus-infected cells were found to be more susceptible to death than both the uninfected and infected CFTR cells. The reason behind this increased propensity toward death is not known. The -galactosidase construct used in these experiments was the nuclear-targeted protein, which, because of its location of expression, may make the cells more susceptible to the DNA-damaging effect of UV irradiation. To confirm the findings from the C127 cells, an independent set of cell lines was used to determine whether expression of a mutated or wild-type CFTR results in differences in susceptibility to apoptosis. Cells with a mutated CFTR were found to be no different in their sensitivity to UV irradiation than cells expressing the wild-type CFTR when evaluated for membrane destabilization detected by the uptake of YOPRO-1, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, DNA degradation, or caspase cleavage. Thus taken together the data suggest that the CFTR does not play a role in a cell's susceptibility to apoptosis..

The altered proliferation within the crypts of Lieberkuhn is not accompanied by changes in apoptosis but results in an increased rate of cell migration up the villus. The increased number of cells reaching the intestinal lumen might contribute to the viscosity of the luminal contents and increase the likelihood of intestinal blockage, one of the pathophysiological hallmarks of CF. If epithelial cell proliferation and turnover is increased in parallel in the CF lung and pancreas, this might contribute to the viscosity of the bronchial and pancreatic secretions and exacerbate the symptoms of CF..

Here we show, using macroscopic current recording from excised membrane patches, that the anionic antioxidant tripeptide glutathione is permeant in the CFTR channel. This permeability may account for the high concentrations of glutathione that have been measured in the surface fluid that coats airway epithelial cells. Furthermore, loss of this pathway for glutathione transport may contribute to the reduced levels of glutathione observed in airway surface fluid of cystic fibrosis patients, which has been suggested to contribute to the oxidative stress observed in the lung in cystic fibrosis. We suggest that release of glutathione into airway surface fluid may be a novel function of CFTR..

It remains unclear how the reduced epithelial Cl permeability caused by the functional absence of CFTR leads to the complexity of symptoms seen in CF lung disease.

Airway surface fluid (ASF) contains ~400  microM GSH, ~50 times the concentration found in plasma and 100 times that found in the extracellular fluid of many other tissues (1, 5, 17, 20). The source of the high concentration of GSH found in ASF is unknown (20). Interestingly, the concentration of GSH in ASF is greatly reduced in CF (16), which may exacerbate the severe oxidative stress that results from chronic inflammation of the CF lung (19).

0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	24	A broad range of large organic anions are able to carry current through CFTR when present in the intracellular solution (11). PKA-stimulated I-V relationships obtained with GSH (Fig. 1A) or GSSG (Fig. 1B) in the intracellular solution and Cl in the extracellular solution (bi-ionic conditions) indicated that both of these large anions were permeant in CFTR, with mean permeabilities (according to Eqs. 1 and 2) of 0.082  plus or minus  0.011 (n = 8) for GSH and 0.0061  plus or minus  0.0017 (n = 5) for GSSG. In contrast, neither GSH (Fig. 1C) nor GSSG (Fig. 1D) were measurably permeant when present in the extracellular solution under bi-ionic conditions. This asymmetric permeability is similar to that which we previously observed with a number of other large organic anions (11). This asymmetry is abolished by substances that "lock" CFTR channels in the open state, such as pyrophosphate (PPi) (11). As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, addition of 10 mM PPi to the intracellular solution stimulated the influx of GSH and GSSG from the extracellular solution. All of these properties of GSH and GSSG permeation are similar to those we described previously for a number of different large organic anions (11). As discussed in more detail elsewhere (11), the reasons for the disruption of asymmetric permeability caused by PPi are not currently known but may involve inhibition of ATP hydrolysis-dependent transitions between different channel open states. The mean relative permeability of GSH and GSSG under different conditions, calculated according to Eqs. 1 and 2 (see METHODS), are summarized in Fig. 1, E and F. Note that the permeability of the divalent anion GSSG is very low compared with GSH and other large monovalent anions (Fig. 1, E and F) (11)..

A-D: example current-voltage (I-V) relationships recorded with either GSH or GSSG present in intracellular or extracellular solution under bi-ionic conditions, as stated on each individual panel. CFTR currents were consistently much smaller with intracellular GSSG than under any of the other ionic conditions studied; reasons for this are unknown. I-V relationships such as those shown in A-D were used to calculate mean permeabilities for GSH (E) and GSSG (F), when present in intracellular solution (In) or extracellular solution (Out) under bi-ionic conditions. Numbers in parentheses are number of patches examined. Permeability ratios shown for GSH and GSSG in extracellular solution in absence of pyrophosphate (PPi) are maximum values, since no reversal potential was observed under these conditions over voltage range studied. Actual permeabilities under these conditions are likely to be considerably lower; they may be zero (see Ref. 11)..

Indeed, the large organic anions gluconate and glutamate, both of which are permeant in CFTR when present in the intracellular solution (11), are also low-affinity blockers of Cl permeation through the channel (10). As shown in Fig. 3, addition of GSH (5 mM) or GSSG (10 mM) to the intracellular solution reduced the macroscopic CFTR Cl current recorded with 150 mM NaCl present on both sides of the membrane. Block by intracellular GSH and GSSG was immediate and readily reversible, consistent with an open channel block mechanism. Analysis of the blocking effects of GSH and GSSG using the Woodhull model (21; see METHODS) suggested Kd(0) = 15.8  plus or minus  3.7 mM and z' = 0.11  plus or minus  0.02 (n = 5) for GSH and Kd(0) = 23.7  plus or minus  2.9 mM and z' = 0.02  plus or minus  0.03 (n = 4) for GSSG. Thus, although the affinity of channel block by these two anions is relatively low, it is at least 20 times higher than that estimated for intracellular gluconate or glutamate ions at a membrane potential of 0 mV (~600 and 1,100 mM, respectively; Ref. 10). The ability of intracellular GSH and GSSG to act as blockers of CFTR Cl current is consistent with their being able to enter the pore from the intracellular end..

Reduced transepithelial Cl transport is thought to be the primary defect in CF (15); however, the link between this reduced Cl permeability and the pathogenesis of CF lung disease remains unclear. Previously, we suggested that CFTR may fulfill another direct transport role, allowing efflux of a broad range of large organic anions from the cytoplasm (11). Based on our present results, we propose that a potential physiological substrate for this transport pathway is the important antioxidant molecule GSH. The ability of GSH to permeate through CFTR suggests a direct link between CFTR and antioxidant defense in the lung..

High concentrations of GSH (~400  microM) are also found in ASF of healthy individuals (1). We propose that GSH may be released into ASF via CFTR, further emphasizing the role of CFTR in determining ASF composition (18). Because cytoplasmic concentrations of GSH are so high, a passive permeation pathway would presumably be sufficient to mediate release of such amounts of GSH into ASF. Loss of this GSH transport pathway may contribute to CF lung disease. The levels of GSH are greatly reduced in ASF of CF patients (16), potentially exacerbating the oxidant stress that results from neutrophil-dominated inflammation of the CF lung (16, 19). GSH levels in ASF are also reduced in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and adult respiratory distress syndrome and are increased in cigarette smokers with no clinical evidence of lung disease (16)..

Both MRP and cMOAT mediate ATP-dependent export of large intracellular organic anions, in particular glutathione-S-conjugates (6, 14). GSSG is a substrate for both MRP- and cMOAT-mediated transport (8, 14). Unconjugated GSH may be transported by cMOAT (14) but is thought not to be transported by MRP (8); however it may act as a cosubstrate for MRP-mediated transport of unconjugated compounds (12, 13). Potential functional overlap between CFTR and other ABC proteins is of particular interest, since it has been suggested that MRP may be able to functionally substitute for CFTR in the lung and alleviate CF symptoms (7). Our results suggest that such functional substitution may be due to restoration of GSH or GSH-conjugate transport..

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	5	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel whose phosphorylation regulates both channel gating and its trafficking at the plasma membrane. Cysteine string proteins (Csps) are J-domain-containing, membrane-associated proteins that have been functionally implicated in regulated exocytosis. Therefore, we evaluated the possibility that Csp is involved in regulated CFTR trafficking. We found Csp expressed in mammalian epithelial cell lines, several of which express CFTR. In Calu-3 airway cells, immunofluorescence colocalized Csp with calnexin in the endoplasmic reticulum and with CFTR at the apical membrane domain. CFTR coprecipitated with Csp from Calu-3 cell lysates. Csp associated with both core-glycosylated immature and fully glycosylated mature CFTRs (bands B and C); however, in relation to the endogenous levels of the B and C bands expressed in Calu-3 cells, the Csp interaction with band B predominated. In vitro protein binding assays detected physical interactions of both mammalian Csp isoforms with the CFTR R-domain and the N terminus, having submicromolar affinities. In Xenopus oocytes expressing CFTR, Csp overexpression decreased the chloride current and membrane capacitance increases evoked by cAMP stimulation and decreased the levels of CFTR protein detected by immunoblot. In mammalian cells, the steady-state expression of CFTR band C was eliminated, and pulse-chase studies showed that Csp coexpression blocked the conversion of immature to mature CFTR and stabilized band B. These results demonstrate a primary role for Csp in CFTR protein maturation. The physical interaction of this Hsc70-binding protein with immature CFTR, its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the decrease in production of mature CFTR observed during Csp overexpression reflect a role for Csp in CFTR biogenesis. The documented role of Csp in regulated exocytosis, its interaction with mature CFTR, and its coexpression with CFTR at the apical membrane domain of epithelial cells may reflect also a role for Csp in regulated CFTR trafficking at the plasma membrane.

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	7	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)1 is responsible for the cAMP-activated chloride conductance of epithelial cell apical membranes (1). Mutations in the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis, whereas hyperactivity of this transport pathway produces secretory diarrhea. The folding of CFTR is energetically complex; misfolding and degradation of the protein are features of the most common CFTR mutation (F508) (2, 3). In addition, F508 CFTR is unable to undergo ATP-dependent conformational changes in the ER that are required for its proper folding. When CFTR folding is retarded in the ER, the protein becomes a target for proteolysis by ER-associated degradation mechanisms that police the protein secretory pathway for misfolded or incompletely complexed proteins (4). This degradation involves ubiquitination of the aberrant protein and its delivery to the proteasome (5, 6). Nearly all of the F508 CFTR produced by the cell is destroyed in this manner; and because of its complex folding pattern, much of the wild-type protein is also degraded. The mechanisms that govern CFTR folding/degradation processes are facilitated by chaperone and co-chaperone protein interactions (discussed further below)..

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	9	The primary step in CFTR activation involves cAMP/protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of its central regulatory (R) domain, which not only permits the channel to gate, but also alters pathways for CFTR trafficking at the plasma membrane (7). In recent years, protein interactions at several CFTR domains have been implicated in channel function and trafficking. The N-terminal cytosolic tail of CFTR is a site of syntaxin 1A binding (8), and syntaxin 1A overexpression is thought to inhibit CFTR currents by reducing channel gating (9) and by interfering with regulated CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane (10). A motif promoting CFTR endocytosis has been identified at the C terminus, and this region interacts physically with the plasma membrane endocytic adapter (AP-2) complex (11, 12). The C terminus of CFTR corresponds to a PDZ (PSD-95/Disc-large/ZO-1) binding motif, which interacts with ezrin radixin moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 or E3KARP to bring ezrin into proximity with CFTR (13, 14). Ezrin can anchor protein kinase A at a position physiologically appropriate for CFTR phosphorylation (15, 16), and ezrin interactions with the cytoskeleton permit retention of CFTR at the apical membrane as a mechanism to establish its polarity in epithelial cells (17). Here, we report the interaction of CFTR with another multidomain protein, the cysteine string protein (Csp)..

Csp null mutants in Drosophila produce a temperature-sensitive block of synaptic transmission followed by paralysis and premature death. These findings demonstrate a crucial role for Csp in neurosecretion (22). In neurons, Csp is associated predominantly with synaptic vesicles (19), and in secretory cells it is found in large dense core or secretory granules (23, 24). Studies of membrane dye labeling (25) and neurotransmitter release (26, 27) indicated that Csp knockouts exhibit defective neurotransmitter exocytosis; presynaptic endocytosis and vesicle recycling appear to be intact. Studies in neuroendocrine (28) and endocrine cells (24) have confirmed that altered Csp expression elicits an impaired secretory phenotype..

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	13	Csps contain an N-terminal "J-domain," a central cysteine-rich "string" region, and a phylogenetically more variable C-terminal domain. The J-domains of Csps are structurally conserved among different species, and this region provides a fingerprint of Csp as a member of the DnaJ/Hsp40 (heat shock protein) chaperone family. As observed for other chaperone proteins (29), the HPD motif of the Csp J-domain mediates its binding to and activation of the Hsc70 chaperone ATPases, which influence protein conformation/binding. Structural predictions indicate that the C terminus of Csp1 may form a coiled-coil region, and this structure may be important in view of the emerging evidence that Csp can interact with proteins involved in exocytosis, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein and syntaxins 1A and 4 (21, 30, 31). Thus, prior results suggest that Csp could link functions of the SNARE complex with those of Hsc70. The concept that assembly of the core fusion complex requires chaperone activity has been raised previously (21); however, the explicit roles of Csp and Hsc70 in the assembly or disassembly of SNARE components are not yet known. The C terminus of Csp contains the only primary structural difference that exists between the mammalian isoforms: full-length Csp1, and its C-terminal truncated variant, Csp2 (32, 33)..

We found that various mammalian epithelial cell lines express two Csp isoforms and that the expression of Csp1 predominated over that of Csp2. In Calu-3 airway epithelial cells, Csp partially colocalized with CFTR in the ER and apical plasma membrane domains. Csp coprecipitated with CFTR from Calu-3 cell lysates and bound selectively to the N terminus and R-domain of CFTR with high affinity. Coexpression of Csp isoforms with CFTR inhibited the functional responses associated with its cAMP stimulation, and exogenous Csp expression decreased the production of mature CFTR. These findings suggest that Csp is a CFTR-binding partner that can influence the biogenesis and trafficking of CFTR.

As shown in Fig. 1A, all of the mammalian epithelial cells examined expressed two Csp isoforms. The upper bands in Fig. 1A are appropriate in size for Csp1 (33-35 kDa), whereas the lower bands in mammalian cells correspond to the size expected for Csp2 (26-28 kDa); this isoform was uniformly less abundant. In contrast, A6 cells expressed only one Csp isoform. It is more closely related to Csp1 than Csp2 (33), although its molecular size is slightly smaller than the Csp1 in mammalian cells.

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	42	To confirm the expression of Csp isoforms in these cells, reverse transcription-PCR was employed, and the results are shown in Fig. 1B. The sizes of the PCR products were as expected for the cDNAs encoding Csp1 and Csp2. These products are not derived from contaminating DNA because the primers employed span Csp exons. Csp2 protein is truncated relative to Csp1 because of the insertion of a stop codon-containing RNA splice fragment (32); this accounts for the smaller size of the Csp2 protein but its larger cDNA and PCR product (Fig. 1B). Although the PCR results are not quantitative, the Csp amplicon ratios from different cell lines generally agreed with the pattern of isoform expression observed by immunoblot. As with the protein analysis, Csp isoforms were expressed at lower levels in T84 cells. Only one isoform of Csp was detected in A6 cells, in accord with the protein data (Fig. 1A) and information in the data base. Sequencing of these PCR products confirmed the expression of Csp1 and 2 in Calu-3 cells, and of the single isoform (33) reported in Xenopus A6 epithelia (data not shown)..

Sections taken at various cell depths (Fig. 2, A-D) showed a predominantly punctate and vesicular distribution pattern for Csp (green fluorescence). Csp and CFTR (red fluorescence) colocalized in the most apical sections, as indicated by the yellow staining pattern of Fig. 2A. As seen in the xz scan (Fig. 2E), a fraction of Csp colocalized with CFTR at the apical region of some cells, but the apex of other cells showed little apparent colocalization. Although Csp colocalized with CFTR in apical membrane compartments, significant fractions of both proteins showed no apparent overlap by immunofluorescence in their steady-state cellular distributions (Fig. 2). This is partly because of the presence of Csp in what appear to be large secretory granules that lack CFTR (44). These granules are likely to contain the secretory products characteristic of airway submucosal gland serous cells, which Calu-3 cells express (e.g. mucins, microbial defense substances and protease inhibitors) (45). CFTR was not detected in their membranes (Fig. 2), in contrast to the localization of CFTR found in the mucin granules of canine gallbladder cells (46). This observation suggests that Csp may play a CFTR-independent role in secretory granule exocytosis from Calu-3 cells, and this possibility will require further study..

Preliminary analysis of Calu-3 cells by sucrose density gradient centrifugation was consistent also with the colocalization of these proteins because Csp was found in fractions containing the ER marker calnexin.2 The results suggest that a fraction of Csp is colocalized with CFTR at both the ER and the apical membrane domain of Calu-3 epithelia..
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	49	Interaction of CFTR with Csp-- To determine whether a physical interaction between Csp and CFTR could be detected in vivo, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 3). In these studies, the initial precipitation was performed with either Csp antiserum or with antibodies against the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR. As shown in Fig. 3A (lane 3), Csp antibody coimmunoprecipitated the mature, glycosylated CFTR (band C, upper) as well as the immature, core-glycosylated CFTR (band B, lower) from Calu-3 cell extracts. As a negative control, no CFTR was precipitated by a nonimmune IgG (lane 2). As a control for the coimmunoprecipitation, we performed direct CFTR immunoblotting on the same Calu-3 membrane preparations (Fig. 3A, lane 1). Both CFTR bands were present, but the ratio of the B and C bands found in the Csp immunoprecipitation differs from that constitutively expressed. Together with the results from the cellular localization experiments, the immunoprecipitation results suggest that in the steady state, Csp interacts with both the immature, core-glycosylated form of CFTR in the ER and with mature, fully glycosylated CFTR at the apical membrane domain. As shown in Fig. 3B, a CFTR NBD1 antibody coprecipitated Csp from Calu-3 membranes (see positive control, Calu-3 cell lysate, lane 1). An N-terminal CFTR antibody did not precipitate significant Csp (data not shown). The lower band denoted Csp in panel B likely represents deacylated Csp, produced by the coimmunoprecipitation conditions, which include overnight incubation with detergent, as noted by others (47). This lower band is not observed under the conditions used for immunoblotting (Fig. 1). As a negative control, Csp did not coprecipitate with a GST antibody (Fig. 3B, lane 2). The absence of Csp coprecipitation by anti-CFTR-N could represent a problem of antibody affinity, or it may reflect impaired antibody access to its epitope at the N terminus of CFTR..

To evaluate CFTR domain interactions with Csp, we performed pull-down experiments in which GST or GST-CFTR fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with Calu-3 or CFTR-expressing HEK293 membrane extracts. Protein complexes were washed, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed using Csp antibodies. To verify that comparable amounts of GST or GST fusion proteins were applied in these assays, the Western blots were subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue. The similar amounts of fusion proteins present are illustrated in Fig. 4A. As seen in Fig. 4B, both the CFTR R-domain and the N terminus showed significant interactions with Csp.

No binding was detected between Csp and GST, GST-CFTR-N random, or GST-syntaxin 1A in these pull-down assays. The interaction of Csp with CFTR-N is consistent with the finding from the above coimmunoprecipitation studies and suggests that the interaction with CFTR-N could be masked by Csp binding..

The Csp isoform(s) that interact with CFTR or CFTR domains in Calu-3 cells (Figs. 3 and 4) cannot be determined because of the lack of isoform specific Csp antibodies. Csp1 may be the more physiologically significant isoform because of its predominant expression and the presence of only Csp1 in some species (Fig. 1).

The Csp isoform(s) that interact with CFTR or CFTR domains in Calu-3 cells (Figs. 3 and 4) cannot be determined because of the lack of isoform specific Csp antibodies. Csp1 may be the more physiologically significant isoform because of its predominant expression and the presence of only Csp1 in some species (Fig. 1).

As indicated by the data from both assays, the interaction of Csp1 with the CFTR R-domain (lane 2) was stronger than that with CFTR-N (lane 4), consistent with the Calu-3 cell pull-down experiments of Fig. 4. In the present experiments, a weak interaction between CFTR-NBD1 and Csp1 (lane 5) was also detected relative to the GST negative control (lane 1). The data for CFTR-C (lane 3) were not different from the GST control. Unlike Csp1, Csp2 showed similar levels of binding to CFTR-R and CFTR-N.

In these pull-down experiments, 35S-labeled Csp1 or 2 was mixed with various amounts of unlabeled Csp before mixing with immobilized CFTR domains. As shown in Fig. 6A, unlabeled Csp1 competed with labeled Csp1 for binding to CFTR-R, such that 1  microM unlabeled Csp1 eliminated 51% of 35S-Csp1 binding. The results imply that the affinity for Csp1 binding to CFTR-R is ~1  microM. Qualitatively similar results were obtained for Csp1 binding to the CFTR N terminus, but in this case the apparent binding affinity was ~10 nM. Similar to the data of Fig. 6A, the association of labeled Csp2 with either the CFTR N terminus or R-domain was essentially eliminated in the presence of 1  microM cold Csp2 (data not shown). These results indicate that both Csp1 and Csp2 show saturable binding to the R-domain and N terminus of CFTR and that the affinities of these interactions are in the submicromolar range. Whether the differences in apparent binding affinity detected in these experiments (e.g. Csp1 interactions with R and N) have physiological significance will require detailed knowledge of their functional consequences..

To initiate such studies, we coexpressed CFTR with either Csp1 or Csp2 in Xenopus oocytes and determined the CFTR-dependent current and capacitance changes evoked during cAMP stimulation. Prior studies of CFTR-expressing oocytes indicate that the cAMP-induced membrane current (Im) is caused by the chloride flow through the CFTR and that the corresponding increase in membrane capacitance (Cm) monitors changes in cell surface area which are associated with regulated insertion of CFTR into the plasma membrane (10, 41). In relation to the initial rationale for these studies, we monitored Cm because Csp is known to function in regulated exocytosis in other systems (21). Control oocytes not injected with CFTR cRNA showed no changes in Im or Cm in response to cAMP stimulation, as observed previously (41). Expression of Csp without CFTR also yielded no Im or Cm responses to cAMP (data not shown). The steady-state data from eight experiments in CFTR expressing oocytes are provided in Fig. 7, lower panel. Coexpression of Csp1 or Csp2 with CFTR decreased the Im and Cm responses that result from CFTR stimulation. Although either Csp isoform reduced the functional expression of CFTR, Csp2 was the more potent inhibitor of Im and Cm (~90% inhibition) relative to Csp1 (~50% inhibition). The upper panel of Fig. 7 documents the expression of Myc-tagged Csp isoforms at the time of recording. The band in lane 1, observed in oocytes expressing CFTR alone, corresponds to the single known endogenous Xenopus Csp, consistent with the A6 cell line data shown in Fig. 1A. The exogenous expression of Myc-tagged Csp1 and 2 are shown in lanes 2 and 3 of the upper panel. We do not know whether the endogenous Xenopus Csp, which most closely resembles mammalian Csp1 (42), contributes to differences in the extent of inhibition by these isoforms or whether the different potencies relate to their structural features..

CFTR was precipitated from oocyte membrane extracts, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted (see "Experimental Procedures"). CFTR currents recorded from these populations of oocytes at the time of harvest are also provided. As seen in Fig. 8 (upper panel), the coexpression of Csp1 or Csp2 produced significant decreases in the level of CFTR expression (to 52 and 36% of the control level by densitometry, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). As a negative control, CFTR was not detected in noninjected oocytes (lane 1). As a positive control, we blotted CFTR expressed transiently in HEK293 cells (lane 6). The apparent molecular masses of CFTR B and C bands expressed in oocytes was similar to those observed in HEK cells (a longer exposure demonstrated migration of HEK cell band B at the same location as observed in oocytes). An increase in CFTR expression was observed with the Csp2 double mutant, but this did not result in currents greater than those of the CFTR control. This degree of CFTR expression increase was not observed in all experiments, and it was not present in mammalian cells (see below). The basis of this stimulatory effect of Csp2 double mutant has not been pursued. As to the double mutant mutation sites, His-43 is a conserved site in the J-domain of Csp which is essential for Hsc70 binding and ATP hydrolysis (48), and Glu-93 is located in the Csp linker region and has been shown previously to abrogate the inhibitory effect of Csp overexpression on insulin release from pancreatic cells (24). These results indicate that the effects of exogenously expressed Csp on CFTR activity are specific for known Csp functional domains, and they suggest that the inhibition of CFTR functional response is due primarily to a Csp-induced reduction in CFTR protein expression..

CFTR levels were determined by immunoblot after 24 h. The Csp cDNAs used for transfection included an N-terminal Myc-tag, permitting exogenous Csp expression to be detected using an anti-Myc antibody (lower panel, Fig. 9A). As shown in the top panel of Fig. 9A, the coexpression of either Csp1 or Csp2 with CFTR (lanes 3 and 4) eliminated the expression of mature, glycosylated CFTR (band C) and produced an accumulation of immature CFTR (band B). This finding suggests that Csp overexpression interferes with the processing of CFTR to its mature form and that it stabilizes the immature form of CFTR. The effect of exogenous Csp on CFTR biogenesis is specific because the Csp2 double mutant (H43V/E93Q) eliminated its inhibitory effect on CFTR maturation (lane 5). In other experiments, a similar result was obtained with the Csp2 single mutant, H43Q, implying that a functional J-domain is critical for the inhibitory effect of Csp overexpression.

As shown in the middle panel of Fig. 9A, the effect of Csp1 or 2 on CFTR expression was not associated with a change in Hsc70 expression levels when this Hsc70-binding protein was expressed. Thus, the failure of cells to express mature CFTR is not caused by a change in the expression of this important CFTR chaperone. In addition, the specificity of the Csp effect for CFTR biogenesis was determined by coexpressing Csp with the VSV-G. Csp coexpression did not affect the production of the mature VSV-G, in experiments performed in a manner similar to those with CFTR (Fig. 9B).

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	73	The effect of Csp on the steady-state expression of mature CFTR was supported by the results of pulse-chase assays. As shown in Fig. 10, Csp1 coexpression in HEK293 cells blocked the conversion of immature CFTR to mature CFTR. As in prior studies (5), ~30% of wild-type CFTR matures to the fully glycosylated band C protein (lower panels); however, no band C was detected in Csp-coexpressing cells. In addition, the half-life of immature CFTR was prolonged, consistent with the accumulation of band B observed in the steady-state data (Fig. 9A). Similar effects on the biogenesis of mature CFTR resulted from the coexpression of Csp2 (data not shown). With Csp coexpression, the rise in band B production at chase periods of 30 and 60 min is probably attributed to the lack of cold methionine and cysteine in the chase media; nevertheless, the experiments with CFTR alone were performed identically. The results indicate that Csp interferes with CFTR biogenesis when Csp is overexpressed. The implications of these findings for a physiological role of Csp in the production of CFTR will be discussed below..

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	77	Role of Csp in Regulated Exocytosis-- Csp is expected to influence CFTR directly by virtue of its localization at the cytosolic surfaces of intracellular membranes that contain CFTR. A defining feature of the Csps is their central cysteine-rich (string) domain, where palmitoylation at multiple sites permits Csp to associate with membrane lipid (49). Immunofluorescence demonstrated that Csp is distributed in membrane-limited compartments, including the apical membrane domain, in Calu-3 cells (Fig. 2). The Csps were discovered in Drosophila, and from their cellular distribution and knockout studies, a role for these proteins in neurotransmitter secretion became apparent (18). Studies in neuroendocrine (28) and endocrine cells (24) have confirmed the role of Csp in regulated exocytosis. Several studies have implicated a regulated exocytic event in the control of plasma membrane CFTR channel density (50). In Xenopus oocytes expressing CFTR, cAMP stimulation enhances the chloride current and elicits increases in membrane capacitance and cell surface CFTR labeling, consistent with cAMP-regulated insertion of CFTR into the plasma membrane (10, 41, 51). In adenovirus-transduced Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, CFTR was distributed in both intracellular and plasma membrane compartments under basal conditions and was recruited to the plasma membrane during cAMP stimulation (52). The partial colocalization of Csp with CFTR at the apical membrane domain of Calu-3 cells (Fig. 2E) and its interaction with mature (band C) CFTR (Fig. 3A) is consistent with the concept that this protein may participate in post-Golgi CFTR trafficking events. It will be interesting to determine whether Csp interacts with CFTR in a regulated trafficking compartment because this location would be consonant with the documented role of Csp in regulated exocytosis. To perform such studies, however, it will be necessary to obviate the influence of Csp on CFTR maturation..

Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that more of the core glycosylated, immature CFTR was associated with Csp than was the mature, fully glycosylated protein, particularly in proportion to the steady-state expression levels of the mature and immature forms of CFTR. In addition, Csp coexpression reduced the production of mature CFTR, and this effect of Csp appears to require a functional J-domain. These results imply that Csp and CFTR interact during CFTR biogenesis in the ER. As a member of the DnaJ family of proteins, Csp could play a role in CFTR processing via its association with Hsc70. The DnaJ proteins can serve as co-chaperones that recruit Hsc70 ATPases to specific substrates, where they activate the ATPase activity of the chaperone to modulate protein conformation (folding) or protein-protein interactions (4, 29). Hsc70 has long been recognized as a CFTR chaperone, which coprecipitates with CFTR in the presence of ATP (39). Hsc70 has been shown to assist in preventing the aggregation of NBD1, the domain in which the common CFTR folding mutant, F508, is located (4, 53, 54). Normally, wild-type CFTR will be released from chaperones as it achieves its native conformation, but Hsc70 is thought to remain attached to misfolded CFTR where it can recruit the ubiquitin ligase, CHIP, to facilitate proteosome-mediated CFTR degradation (40, 55)..

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	81	Csp is a J-domain protein that interacts with Hsc70 and enhances its ATPase activity (56). The interaction of Csp with Hsc70 and CFTR is likely to affect CFTR processing in one of two ways. First, Csp may be a CFTR co-chaperone that stabilizes intermediate forms of CFTR to promote their folding and maturation. This model suggests that Csp contributes positively to CFTR maturation, similar to the Hsc70 co-chaperone, Hdj-2 (53). Second, Csp interactions with nonfolded CFTR intermediates may contribute to the degradation of nascent CFTR. This model suggests that Csp may contribute to CFTR degradation, similar to the Hsc70-interacting protein, CHIP (see below). Either model could explain how Csp overexpression reduces the steady-state expression levels of mature CFTR in mammalian cells or oocytes and therefore, the cAMP-stimulated CFTR currents (Figs. 8 and 9). In the first model, Csp overexpression causes a prolonged association of Hsc70 with CFTR, which can target CFTR for degradation (55). Hsc70 has been shown to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of several cellular proteins (57). For example, overexpression of Hsc70 leads to ubiquitination and degradation of apolipoprotein B (58). Thus, a prolonged Csp-mediated association of CFTR with Hsc70, because of Csp overexpression, could lead to CFTR degradation, despite the possibility that the physiological role of Csp is to facilitate CFTR biogenesis..

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	83	The second model is trivial, in that augmenting the level of a protein involved in CFTR degradation would reduce CFTR expression. Illustrative of this model is the Hsc70-binding protein CHIP, a ubiquitin ligase whose overexpression promotes proteasome-mediated CFTR degradation (40). CHIP appears to recognize slowly folding or misfolded forms of CFTR and promotes their destruction by binding to CFTR-associated Hsc70. CHIP then targets CFTR to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The finding that proteosome inhibitors fail to promote trafficking of class II CFTR mutants suggests that mechanisms exist for irreversible targeting of protein to intracellular degradation processes before their cellular destruction. CHIP appears to be a component of this pathway; in principle, Csp could function in this manner as well..

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	85	Several findings favor the co-chaperone model. First, the predominant interaction of Csp with CFTR band B in Calu-3 cells (Fig. 3) suggests a physiological role for Csp in the maturation of CFTR because the majority of the CFTR expressed in these cells is the fully glycosylated mature form. Second, the direct interaction of Csp with CFTR subdomains in the absence of Hsc70 (Figs. 4 and 5) suggests that Csp may localize Hsc70 at specific sites to facilitate CFTR folding. In contrast to CHIP (40), Csp does not require Hsc70 for its interaction with CFTR. Third, Csp overexpression stabilized CFTR band B, which is contrary to the result expected for a protein that promotes degradation. Finally, previous data indicate a positive role for Csp in protein folding processes, also favoring the first model of Csp interaction. As is true of other DnaJ proteins, Csp can bind to unfolded proteins and prevent their aggregation (49). This activity is synergistic with the similar action of Hsc70. Together, these findings suggest that Csp may serve as a co-chaperone during CFTR biogenesis..

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	87	Csp Interactions with the N terminus and R-domain-- With regard to protein interactions that could regulate CFTR biogenesis, it is interesting that Csp has the capacity to bind to both the R-domain and the CFTR N terminus. Previous studies implicate the N terminus as a site important for the normal processing of CFTR and suggest that interactions of the R-domain with other CFTR subdomains may facilitate its biogenesis (3). N-terminal truncations of CFTR are poorly processed, and little of the truncated protein is able to traffic to the plasma membrane. In addition, several N-terminal disease mutations are processing mutants. Several studies indicate that a pivotal point in CFTR synthesis is the generation of the R-domain. Before synthesis of the R-domain, CFTR is unstable and is associated with chaperones to prevent NBD aggregation (53, 54). Once the R-domain is formed, chaperone protein associations with CFTR decrease, and the nascent protein becomes more stable. Other studies indicate that mutations near the N terminus of CFTR which lead ultimately to protein degradation are not recognized by the ER-associated degradation machinery until the R-domain is synthesized (3). This implies that degradation processes recognize structural interfaces between CFTR subdomains. These interdomain effects may be mediated by specific co-chaperones that can interact with several CFTR subdomains to facilitate access of Hsc70 to intermediates in the folding pathway; Csp is a candidate for such interactions..

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	89	Finally, the discussion has focused primarily on CFTR biogenesis in the ER; however, it is possible also that the physiological action of Csp involves the trafficking of immature CFTR to post-ER compartments. For example, Csp and CFTR could interact in the transition of CFTR to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment or to proximal Golgi regions prior to CFTR glycosylation. The mechanistic involvement of Csp in such trafficking processes may parallel its action in regulated exocytic events (see discussion above), presumably exploiting its interaction with Hsc70 to facilitate trafficking protein interactions. In addition, a nonconventional pathway for CFTR trafficking has been proposed recently (59, 60) involving direct transit from the ER to the trans-Golgi network, perhaps via an endosomal compartment. Csp could be involved in these trafficking steps; however, the significance of their role in CFTR maturation was cell type-dependent, and the presence of this pathway in epithelial cells has not yet been demonstrated. Further studies will be necessary to evaluate these possibilities..

However, the principal findings of the present study demonstrate a primary role for Csp in CFTR protein maturation. Although Csp did not interact with the process of VSV-G maturation, it will be interesting to determine whether there are additional proteins whose biogenesis involves interactions with Csp.

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	3	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) encodes a transmembrane protein (CFTR) which functions in part as a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated chloride channel. CFTR expression is controlled temporally and cell specifically by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Insight into CFTR regulation could be facilitated by the successful introduction of the entire 230 kb human CFTR and adjacent sequences into mammalian cells. To this end, we have introduced two different CFTR-containing yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) (320 and 620 kb) into Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO) cells. Clonal cell lines containing human CFTR were identified by PCR, and the genetic and functional analyses of one clone containing each YAC are described. Integration of the human CFTR-containing YACs into the CHO genome at a unique site in each cell line was demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Southern blot analysis suggested that on the order of one copy of human CFTR was integrated per CHO cell genome. Fiber-FISH and restriction analysis suggested that CFTR remained grossly intact. Northern analysis showed full-length, human CFTR mRNA. Immunoprecipitation followed by phosphorylation with protein kinase demonstrated mature, glycosylated CFTR. Finally, chloride secretion in response to cAMP indicated the functional nature of the human CFTR. This study provides several novel results including: (i) functional human CFTRcan be expressed from these YACs; (ii) CHO cells are a permissive environment for expression of human CFTR; (iii) the level of human CFTR expression in CHO cells is unexpectedly high given the lack of endogenous CFTR production; and (iv) the suggestion by Fiber-FISH of CFTR integrity correlates with functional gene expression. These YACs and the cell lines derived from them should be useful tools for the study of CFTR expression. INTRODUCTION.

It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) leading to the loss of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-stimulated chloride efflux from epithelial cells (2 -4 ). CFTR is a 230 kb gene encoding a 1480 amino acid transmembrane protein which functions as a chloride channel with several other regulatory properties (5 ,6 ). More than 600 mutations in CFTR have been identified in individuals with CF (7 ). The most common mutation, a deletion of 3 bp leading to the loss of a phenylalanine residue at position 508, is found in nearly 70% of CF alleles (8 )..

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	7	CFTR is expressed primarily in exocrine epithelia from the lung, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and sweat glands (9 -11 ). The expression is generally low in these tissues, although a few specific epithelial cell types, such as the serous cells in the submucosal glands of the lung, have relatively high level expression (12 ). The mechanisms that govern the level and the cell specific regulation of CFTR expression have been explored but remain poorly understood. The putative promoter region lies within 3800 bp of the start site of CFTR transcription and supports low level expression of reporter genes in vitro (13 -16 ). CFTR expression can be induced by cAMP (17 ) and suppressed by phorbol ester (18 ,19 ). McDonald et al. (20 ) demonstrated that the induction of CFTR expression by protein kinase A is mediated by an 8 bp cAMP responsive element upstream from CFTR. Pittman et al. (21 ) analyzed the function of an inverted CCAAT element at -132 to -119 upstream from CFTR in detail. They showed that transcription factor binding to this element confers both basal and cAMP-induced CFTR expression. The level of CFTR expression also appears to be related to the state of cellular differentiation (22 ). Additional regulatory elements have been shown to lie within this 5'-flanking region as well as within the first CFTR intron (23 ). DNase I hypersensitivity sites have been demonstrated within the 120 kb upstream of CFTR, but no correlation with cell type specific CFTR expression was observed (24 ). Taken together, these studies provide little insight into the exact mechanisms that determine the level and specificity of CFTR expression..

Obstacles to this approach include: (i) obtaining an appropriate vector containing a full-length, human CFTR without deletions, mutations or rearrangements; (ii) maintaining the integrity of CFTR during vector propagation; and (iii) transferring CFTR intact into appropriate mammalian cells. Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) provide potential vectors for such a study. YACs containing human CFTR were generated soon after the gene was identified (25 ,26 ). Although the genetic structure of these YACs has been studied, the functionality of CFTR contained within them has not been established..

These primers were chosen toward the 5'-end of the gene since neor was located beyond the 3'-end of CFTR. Seven out of 14 clones derived using the smaller YAC and the six out of seven clones derived from the larger YAC were positive for CFTR exons 2 and 6a. Control CHO cell DNA was negative under identical reaction conditions. Clones positive for both exons were analyzed for CFTR mRNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using primers spanning exon 7 to exon 9. Three out of seven clones derived using the smaller YAC and four out of six clones derived using the larger YAC were positive. Control CHO cell RNA was negative under identical reaction conditions (data not shown). Based on this screening, candidates were chosen for further study. The detailed genetic and functional analyses of the two clones with the highest level of CFTR mRNA are described below.

Using a YAC derived from y37AB12 (25 ) containing the entire CFTR as a probe, the human CFTR was localized to a single locus in each clone. The human CFTR was integrated at CHO chromosome band 4p21-23 in the CS2/C5 cell line and at CHO chromosome band 5q27 in the CS1/F2 cell line..

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	21	Southern analysis was performed to determine the copy number of human CFTR incorporated into each CHO cell clone (Fig. 3 ). Genomic DNA from CS2/C5, CS1/F2, control CHO cells and HT-1080 (a pseudodiploid human fibrosarcoma cell line; ATCC CCL 121) was digested with EcoRI and hybridized to a cDNA fragment containing part of the CFTR 3'-untranslated region within exon 24. The expected 2.2 kb single band was seen in CS2/C5, CS1/F2 and HT-1080, but not in control CHO. CFTR copy number was assessed by comparing the clones with HT-1080. The intensity of the bands from 10 [mu]g of CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 DNA was similar to that obtained from 5 [mu]g of HT-1080 DNA. These data suggest that on the order of one copy of CFTR was integrated into the CHO genome in each cell line. Similar results are shown for CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 compared with CFPAC-1 cells [a hyperdiploid human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line (ATCC CRL 1918)]..

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	23	The integrity of the human CFTR present in the CHO cell clones was assessed by Fiber-FISH (Fig. 4 ). DNA strands from both CFTR-containing clones, CHO cells and normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were analyzed. The probes used to delineate human CFTR included the human CFTR-containing YAC used for FISH (Fig. 2 ) and cosmids cW44 (27 ) containing exon 1 and cf24 (a gift from Jeff Touchman and Eric Green, NIH, Bethesda, MD) containing exons 20 to 24. The rhodamine labeled cosmids delineate the ends of the CFTR coding region and the fluorescein-labeled YAC probe extends 45 kb upstream and 30 kb downstream from the 230 kb gene. The expected hybridization pattern was seen in PBL as well as in DNA fibers obtained from CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 cells. DNA fibers from control CHO cells did not hybridize with any of the CFTR probes. These data not only confirm the presence of human CFTR in both clones, but suggest that the gene is grossly intact..

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	26	Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA from CS2/C5, CS1/F2, control CHO and human HT-1080 cells was performed to assess the integrity of the integrated CFTR (Fig. 5 ). The DNA was digested with EcoRI, separated on a 0.8% agarose gel and hybridized to a probe comprising the full-length, human CFTR cDNA which should hybridize to any EcoRI fragments which contain CFTR exons. The data shows that the two clones have very similar hybridization patterns, and that the bands are nearly identical to the pattern seen in the control human DNA. The genomic DNAs from the yeast containing each YAC also have a similar hybridization pattern to the clones and to the human genomic DNA, although the faintest bands in the yeast are difficult to visualize in the mammalian cells. This data suggests a high degree of integrity of the majority of the integrated human CFTR in the CHO cell lines over the 230 kb of coding sequence and is consistent with our observation of full-length CFTR mRNA and functional protein. Human CFTR mRNA and protein are expressed in both CHO cell lines.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	27	The presence of the human CFTR mRNA was determined by Northern analysis (Fig. 6 ). A 6.5 kb mRNA transcript was observed in both CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 cells. This transcript was similar in size to the CFTR mRNA produced by T84 cells which served as a positive control for CFTR expression (13 ). No corresponding transcript was detected in control CHO cells or normal human airway epithelial cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that both CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 produce a sufficient amount of full-length, human CFTR mRNA to be detected not only by RT-PCR but by Northern analysis..
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	28	The presence of human CFTR was determined by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with an antibody to the C-terminus of CFTR, phosphorylation with [[gamma]-32P]adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 7 ). Both clones produced mature, glycosylated CFTR which could be phosphorylated in vitro. A similar CFTR profile was seen in T84 cells. No corresponding band was observed in the control CHO cell lysate. The appearance of mature, human CFTR in CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 cells demonstrates that CHO cells possess the cellular machinery to not only transcribe CFTR from the introduced YAC but to translate and appropriately process the protein..

A significant rise in 36Cl- efflux was observed 30-60 s after cAMP stimulation in both clones (p  < 0.05). The level of 36Cl- efflux in response to cAMP in early passage CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 cells was similar to that observed in T84 cells (p  < 0.01). There was no analogous cAMP-stimulated 36Cl- efflux in control CHO cells or in another clonal CHO cell line (S1) derived using a 140 kb YAC containing neor and human DNA unrelated to CFTR. In the absence of endogenous CFTR activity in CHO cells, the release of 36Cl- from the cell layer of the clones in response to cAMP indicates the presence of functional human CFTR produced from the introduced YACs..

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	33	This study describes the generation of two clonal CHO cell lines, CS2/C5 and CS1/F2, containing full-length, human CFTR. These cell lines were derived from the fusion of CHO cells with yeast spheroplasts containing two different YACs which include human CFTR and ~75 or 375 kb of adjacent sequences. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on metaphase nuclei to indicate the site of YAC integration. A single site of integration on a different CHO chromosome was found in each cell line. Southern analysis suggested that each clone most likely contains on the order of one copy of human CFTR per CHO cell genome. Fiber-FISH suggested the gross structural integrity of the transferred CFTR in both cell lines. The integrity of the integrated CFTR was indicated further by restriction analysis of genomic DNA. These results suggested that the majority of human CFTR was grossly intact and correlated with functionalCFTR production, potentially extending the application of Fiber-FISH beyond its current status as a genetic mapping tool (28 ,29 ). The Fiber-FISH also suggested that the flanking sequences common to both YACs were present in both cell lines. Finally, the sequence-tagged site, sL12, located at the extreme 5'-end of yCFTR8-Neo (26 ) was detected in DNA from CS1/F2 cells suggesting that this larger YAC is incorporated in its entirety into the CHO genome (data not shown)..

Although the human CFTR contained in these YACs has been shown to be grossly intact, even after transfer into Chinese hamster fibroblasts (30 ), the functionality of the CFTR has not been established until now. The present study demonstrates the production of full-length CFTR mRNA and functional protein by both CS2/C5 and CS1/F2. Human CFTR production in these cell lines implies that the regulatory elements needed for gene expression are contained within these YACs. The ability of these cells to produce mature and functional protein at the cell surface for more than 15 passages is demonstrated by cAMP-stimulated 36Cl- efflux. CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 are distinctive from the other clonal lines generated in this study because their CFTR mRNA can be detected by both RT-PCR and Northern analysis. None of the other cell lines created in this study and analyzed by Northern analysis have comparable mRNA transcripts..

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	39	Ordinarily, YAC gene transfer is carried out in a mammalian cell line in which the gene of interest is endogenously expressed, placing the YAC into an environment likely to be permissive for the human promoter (32 -35 ). In contrast, the present study demonstrates YAC-mediated gene transfer into cells lacking endogenous CFTR production (36 ,37 ). It is unclear why only human CFTR appears to be functionally expressed when both the endogenous and transferred genes could potentially interact with the same basal transcription factors. Several aspects of YAC integration may support expression of the transferred human CFTR in these CHO cell clones. For example, it has been suggested that transferred YACs may retain a chromatin structure that favors expression (38 ). CFTR expression from these YACs may be favored by the requirement that the nearby neor has to be expressed in order for the cells to survive, forcing the adjacent chromatin to remain open. In addition, the human and hamster genes could have different affinities for DNA binding proteins. An alternative explanation is that the hamster CFTR is mutated and cannot produce functional CFTR. To better understand the differential expression of the hamster and human genes, it would be useful to directly compare the structure of the two genes. However, this work remains to be done because hamster CFTR has not yet been extensively characterized. In the present studies, full length human CFTR probes did not clearly cross hybridize with control CHO cells, suggesting there is very little homology between the hamster and human CFTR, or perhaps that the gene is absent in the control CHO line..

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	41	The etiology of the unexpectedly high level of human CFTR expression in these CHO cell lines is also unclear. Each clonal cell line produces mRNA and protein at easily detectable levels. The FISH and Southern analysis suggest that this level of expression is likely a consequence of CFTR integrated at a unique locus in each cell line at a copy number on the order of one per CHO genome. In contrast, when the techniques employed in the present study are applied to evaluate CFTR expression in normal diploid human epithelial cells, it is difficult to detect CFTR mRNA (10 ) or protein (S. Cheng, Genzyme, Framingham, MA, pers. comm.). The level of CFTR expression could be related to a number of factors including the regulatory sequences within the YAC vector, the distance the gene lies from the YAC ends and the integration site in the host genome (32 ,38 ). Another potential positive influence on CFTR promoter function is the SV40 enhancer that supports neor expression. The SV40 enhancer has been shown to augment CFTR promoter function in reporter gene constructs (15 ). In addition to these factors, the liberation of the gene from a negative regulatory element, possibly downstream, in a region not included in either YAC, could result in higher than expected expression. Other CFTR-containing YACs with additional flanking sequences are available (26 ) and could be used to address this issue..

Such position independent expression is not necessarily expected in cell lines created by YAC transfer. It has been postulated that a buffer of DNA sequence might insulate the gene of interest from positional effects at the site of integration (32 ). The extensive amount of sequence upstream from CFTR in these YACs could potentially act as a buffer and might account for the similar level of expression seen in the two different clones.

Mechanical stretching of the fibers was carried out by first melting a small slice of a DNA containing agarose plug (~10-20 [mu]l). The plug was placed in 20 [mu]l of water on a slide and allowed to melt for 2 min on a thermal block maintained at 85oC. Water was added to compensate for evaporation during this period. Stretching was accomplished by pulling the edge of a second microscope slide across the DNA. When no moisture was evident after air drying, the slide was immersed in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 at 70oC for 2 min to remove residual agar and non-adherent DNA. The slide was allowed to air dry and cool for 1 min. It was then dehydrated through an ethanol series (70%, 85%, 100%) to retain fibers through subsequent processing and further reduce non-specific binding. Probe hybridization, washing and detection were carried out as described by Heiskanen et al. (49 ). Protein analysis.

The media was removed, the cell layers were washed three times with Dulbecco's PBS without calcium or magnesium (Gibco\BRL), then 1.5 ml Ringer's saline containing 2.5 [mu]Ci Na36Cl (sp. act. >3 mCi/g, Amersham) were placed on the cells. Following a 2-3 h incubation, the cells were washed four times with 0.75 ml Ringer's saline to remove the excess radioactivity. During a control period of 1 min the cell layer was washed with 0.75 ml Ringer's saline at 15 s intervals to determine the cells' baseline level of 36Cl-efflux. Chloride efflux was stimulated by the addition of 0.75 ml Ringer's saline containing a cAMP cocktail [2.5 [mu]M forskolin (Sigma), 250 mM 8-bromo-adenosine 3':5' cyclic monophosphate (Sigma) and 250 mM 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3':5' cyclic monophosphate (Sigma)] at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 min after the baseline 36Cl-efflux had been determined. The cells were then lysed with 0.5 N NaOH to determine the amount of 36Cl- remaining in the cell layer. The samples were mixed with 5 ml CytoScint (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and counted in a Beckman model LS-1801 liquid scintillation counter. The data was normalized on a per min basis. The increase in 36Cl- efflux associated with cAMP stimulation was compared to the baseline efflux at 1 min by paired t-test. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	5	We have previously described a protocol for the simultaneous isolation and reconstitution of a protein kinase A (PKA)-sensitive outwardly rectified chloride channel (ORCC) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) from bovine tracheal epithelium. Immunoprecipitation of CFTR from this preparation prevented PKA activation of the ORCC, suggesting that CFTR regulated the ORCC and that this regulatory relationship was preserved throughout the purification procedure. We now report the purification of CFTR from bovine tracheal epithelia and the purification of a CFTR conduction mutant (G551D CFTR) from retrovirally transduced mouse L cells using a combination of alkali stripping, Triton-X extraction, and immunoaffinity chromatography. Immunopurified CFTR proteins were reconstituted in the absence and presence of ORCC. To test the hypothesis that only functional CFTR can support activation of ORCC by PKA and ATP, we used an inhibitory anti-CFTR peptide antibody or G551D CFTR. When anti-CFTR peptide antibodies were present prior to the addition of PKA and ATP, activation of both the ORCC and CFTR was prevented. If the antibody was added after activation of the ORCC and CFTR Cl channels by PKA and ATP, only the CFTR Cl channel was inhibited. When ORCC and G551D CFTR were co-incorporated into planar bilayers, only the ORCC was recorded and this channel could not be further activated by the addition of PKA and ATP. Thus, functional CFTR is required for activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP. We also tested the hypothesis that PKA activation of ORCC was dependent on the extracellular presence of ATP. We added ATP on the presumed extracellular side of the lipid bilayer under conditions where it was not possible to activate the ORCC, i.e. in the presence of inhibitory anti-CFTR antibody or G551D CFTR. In both cases the ORCC regained PKA sensitivity. Moreover, the addition of hexokinase + glucose to the extracellular side prevented activation of the ORCCs by PKA and ATP in the presence of CFTR. These experiments confirm that both the presence of CFTR as well as the presence of ATP on the extracellular side is required for activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP..

ORCCs are present in the apical membranes of CF airway epithelia, but they cannot be activated by protein kinase A (PKA) and ATP(3, 4, 5) . CFTR channels are regulated by PKA and ATP and are inhibited by the channel blocker diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC) but not by 4,4`-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2`-disulfonic acid (DIDS)(6, 7) , whereas ORCCs are DIDS-sensitive. Although CFTR and ORCC channels are distinct proteins, they are linked through unknown regulatory pathways. Different mechanisms by which CFTR might regulate the ORCC can be envisioned. For example, CFTR could interact directly with the ORCC protein in the apical membrane, regulation could be a consequence of the channel function of CFTR, or both. It has been shown that CFTR can act as both an ATP and a Cl channel(6) . Recently Guggino's group (7) demonstrated that ATP transported through CFTR acts as an autocrine stimulator of the ORCC. The proposed mechanism of regulation is via a P receptor that, either through a direct coupling to the ORCC or through a G protein-coupled signaling pathway, stimulates the ORCC..

Fig. 2A shows typical current traces of channel activity of bovine tracheal CFTR after incorporation and activation by PKA and ATP. No channel activity was observed whatsoever when incorporation was performed in the absence of PKA and ATP in the bathing solution. Incorporations were random; therefore, PKA + ATP was present in both compartments of the bilayer chamber prior to incorporation. When wild type CFTR-containing vesicles were used, a small (16 picosiemens) linear anion-selective channel was recorded. The identity of the incorporated channel was confirmed by its insensitivity to 100  microM DIDS, its sensitivity to DPC, and its block by anti-CFTR antibodies (Fig. 2B). Moreover, this channel had a Cl  >  I permselectivity (4:1). Anti-CFTR antibodies added to the one side of the bilayer containing incorporated CFTR, to a final concentration of 25-50 ng/ml, inhibited bovine CFTR channel activity in the presence of PKA and ATP. However, due to the random orientation of the channel in the bilayer, in some of the experiments (11/28) these antibodies did not inhibit CFTR when added to one side of the system only. In these same experiments, addition of antibodies to the opposite side successfully inhibited channel activity. Addition of the anti-CFTR antibody (the antibody used in the purification of CFTR) to either or both sides of the bilayer did not have any effect on the activity of incorporated bovine CFTR (Fig. 2). Incorporation of G551D CFTR and treatment with PKA and ATP did not result in the appearance of any channel activity (n = 15)..

Anti-CFTR antibodies 200  microg/ml were added to both sides of the bilayer, followed by addition of 100  microM DIDS to both compartments of the bilayer chamber. Addition of 100  microM DIDS in a separate experiment (n = 13) to either side (or both) of the channel-containing bilayer prior to addition of anti-CFTR antibodies had no effect on channel activity. In the experiment shown (representative of 18 out of a total 33), 300  microM DPC completely blocked channel activity when added to one side of the bilayer (usually trans). In the other 15 experiments, DPC was ineffective when added to this one side of the bilayer. Thus, addition of 300  microM DPC was made to the opposite side; this resulted in abolished channel activity. In the experiment shown, anti-CFTR antibodies (50 ng/ml) were added to one side of the bilayer (usually cis).

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	46	Effect of Inhibitory Anti-CFTRAntibodies on Activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATPWe next examined whether inhibitory anti-CFTR antibodies could prevent the activation of ORCC by PKA + ATP. For these experiments we used immunopurified material obtained using p38 antibodies that contained CFTR co-purified with the ORCC. Current rectification of the ORCC allowed us to determine the sidedness of the incorporated channels. Moreover, the incorporation of proteins into negatively charged bilayers held at -80 mV permitted us to perform oriented reconstitutions. The cytoplasmic (PKA-sensitive) portion of both channels faced the cis compartment, while the extracellular portion faced the trans compartment in more than 90% of successful incorporations of ORCC + CFTR, as assessed by PKA activation. Another observation allowed us to determine whether CFTR was co-reconstituted into the bilayer membrane prior to PKA activation. Current-voltage (I/V) curves of ORCC in the presence of nonphosphorylated CFTR were slightly less rectified in the negative voltage quadrant compared with when CFTR was absent (Fig. 5). This distinction was important because in a few experiments when PKA + ATP failed to activate ORCC incorporated into the bilayer membrane (3 out of 72), using the criterion described above, we concluded that CFTR was not present in the bilayer.

For these experiments we used immunopurified material obtained using p38 antibodies that contained CFTR co-purified with the ORCC. Current rectification of the ORCC allowed us to determine the sidedness of the incorporated channels. Moreover, the incorporation of proteins into negatively charged bilayers held at -80 mV permitted us to perform oriented reconstitutions. The cytoplasmic (PKA-sensitive) portion of both channels faced the cis compartment, while the extracellular portion faced the trans compartment in more than 90% of successful incorporations of ORCC + CFTR, as assessed by PKA activation. Another observation allowed us to determine whether CFTR was co-reconstituted into the bilayer membrane prior to PKA activation. Current-voltage (I/V) curves of ORCC in the presence of nonphosphorylated CFTR were slightly less rectified in the negative voltage quadrant compared with when CFTR was absent (Fig. 5). This distinction was important because in a few experiments when PKA + ATP failed to activate ORCC incorporated into the bilayer membrane (3 out of 72), using the criterion described above, we concluded that CFTR was not present in the bilayer. Furthermore, in these same three experiments, CFTR channel activity also was not observed subsequent to addition of PKA + ATP to either side of the bilayer..

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	50	We found that anti-CFTR antibodies had no effect on base-line ORCC activity, confirming their specificity toward CFTR. If inhibitory anti-CFTR antibodies were added to the presumptive cytoplasmic bathing solutions after PKA and ATP activation of the incorporated channels, only CFTR Cl channel activity was inhibited, while ORCC remained activated with a P 0.78  plus or minus  0.06 (n = 21; Fig. 3A). Amplitude histograms of channel recordings made in the presence of PKA and ATP (Fig. 3B) showed that at least three CFTR Cl channels accompanied one ORCC channel (only one ORCC was active in the bilayer after inhibition of CFTR using anti-CFTR antibodies). However, it would be premature to draw any conclusions about the exact molar ratio of ORCC and CFTR necessary for interaction from these bilayer experiments, because in other comparable experiments two to five CFTR channels per single ORCC have been observed. In contrast to these results obtained with anti-CFTR antibodies added after PKA + ATP activation of incorporated channels, addition of inhibitory anti-CFTR antibodies prior to addition of PKA and ATP prevented activation of both CFTR and ORCC by PKA + ATP (n = 11; Fig. 4, A and B)..

Separation of ORCC from co-purified ORCC and CFTR was achieved by immunodepletion of CFTR from the preparation. The removal of CFTR was confirmed by the absence of a 170-kDa phosphoprotein and lack of activation by PKA + ATP of reconstituted ORCC incorporated into planar lipid bilayers, as described earlier (12) . G551D CFTR was immunopurified as described under ``Methods'' and co-reconstituted with the preparation containing ORCC but devoid of CFTR. For replacement of normal CFTR with G551D CFTR we used autoradiography/densitometry to estimate the intensity of the in vitro phosphorylated CFTR (170 kDa) band and replaced normal CFTR with a similar amount of G551D CFTR, as G551D CFTR can also be in vitro phosphorylated. Under these conditions following incorporation into the bilayer, only the ORCC was recorded with no change in open probability upon addition of PKA and ATP to one (either cis or trans) side of the bilayer (P = 0.39  plus or minus  0.04; n = 24 in control; P = 0.38  plus or minus  0.05; n = 9 in presence of PKA + ATP). Detailed analysis of the electrical properties of ORCC revealed a change in its rectification properties in the presence of G551D CFTR in the negative potential quadrant, similar to what was described for ORCC in the presence of normal CFTR (see Fig. 5). In three separate experiments, liposomes containing only G551D CFTR were fused with a bilayer already containing ORCC but not CFTR. The presence of G551D CFTR, like incorporation of wild type CFTR, produced a change in the rectification properties of ORCC. In only 2 experiments from a total 26 performed, ORCC incorporated from liposomes presumably containing both ORCC and G551D CFTR displayed properties identical to ORCC incorporated from CFTR-immunodepleted preparations. These observations allowed us to conclude that the change of rectification was indicative of the presence of G551D CFTR in a bilayer containing ORCC. Nonetheless, the ORCC was not activated by PKA + ATP in these experiments (n = 9), thus supporting the hypothesis that the conductive form of CFTR was required for the activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP. However, in three experiments in which PKA and ATP were added to both sides of a bilayer containing ORCC and G551D CFTR, the activity of ORCC was increased 2-fold (from 0.38  plus or minus  0.05 to 0.81  plus or minus  0.07, data not shown)..

To test if the transport of ATP by CFTR is required for activation of the ORCC, we added an ATP scavenging system, hexokinase (0.5 unit/ml) + glucose(5 mM), to the presumptive extracellular side of the bilayer containing incorporated ORCC and CFTR Cl channels. The presence of hexokinase + glucose on the presumptive extracellular side did not influence activation of the CFTR channel by PKA + ATP added to the opposite side of the bilayer, but it did prevent the PKA-mediated activation of ORCC (n = 12). These results are in contrast to the PKA-mediated activation of ORCC and CFTR seen in the absence of hexokinase and glucose (cf. Fig. 3)..

Mutant F508 CFTR is mistrafficked, accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and may cause "cell stress" and activation of nuclear factor (NF)-B. G551D mutants also lack Cl channel function, but CFTR is trafficked normally. We compared the effects of CFTR mutations on the endogenous activation of an NF-B reporter construct. In transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, the mistrafficked F508 allele caused a sevenfold activation of NF-B compared with wild-type CFTR or the G551D mutant (P  <  0.001). NF-B was also activated in 9/HTEo/pCep-R cells and in 16HBE/pcftr antisense cell lines, which lack CFTR Cl channel function but do not accumulate mutant protein in the ER. This endogenous activation of NF-B was associated with elevated interleukin-8 expression. Impaired CFTR Cl channel activity as well as cell stress due to accumulation of mistrafficked CFTR in the ER contributes to the endogenous activation of NF-B in cells with the CFTR mutation..

One of the major clinical manifestations of CFTR mutations is excessive airway inflammation (14-17), implying that CFTR affects the immune function of airway epithelial cells, particularly the expression of nuclear factor (NF)-B-dependent proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines. Several lines of experimental evidence suggest that CFTR dysfunction influences the exogenous activation of epithelial immune function (8, 30). Bacteria persist in the respiratory tract of CF patients due to decreased antimicrobial activity in CF airway surface fluid and impair bacterial clearance due to mucus plugging (25). Cells with CFTR mutations have increased numbers of asialoglycolipid receptors for common bacterial pathogens (24). Ligation of these receptors activates NF-B-dependent epithelial interleukin (IL)-8 production to recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from the circulation into the airways (8). Epithelial expression of IL-8 after bacterial stimulation is increased in cells with CFTR dysfunction, a finding demonstrated in both matched CF and corrected cell lines (5, 9, 27, 30) and in cftr-deficient [cftr(/)] mice compared with normal control mice (29). How CFTR dysfunction might affect the endogenous expression of NF-B-dependent genes is less well documented..

It is complexed in the cell cytoplasm with IB- and -, which are selectively phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded in the proteasome in response to stimuli (2). There is both signal-dependent and signal-independent IB- phosphorylation (20), a distinction that may be relevant to the endogenous activity of NF-B as opposed to the activation in response to a superficial stimulus such as bacterial attachment to surface receptors. Ligation of superficial asialo-GM1 receptors on epithelial surfaces by bacterial adhesins stimulates Ca2+-dependent kinase activity through mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and NF-B activation (23a). NF-B translocation may be regulated by other intracellular factors that lead to a different pattern of IB- phosphorylation than that elicited by extracellular stimuli (4). It has been proposed that the abnormal trafficking of F508 CFTR and its accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) provides sufficient intracellular stress to cause NF-B activation (2)..

0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	12	The most common CFTR mutation responsible for CF in ~70% of patients is the deletion of a phenylalanine residue (F508) in the nucleotide binding domain. The F508 mutant CFTR not only fails to transport Cl in response to cAMP but accumulates in the ER due to abnormal maturation and folding (1, 7, 32). From experimental data generated with adenovirus mutants targeted for retention in the ER, Pahl and colleagues (18, 19) proposed that homozygous F508 mutations in CFTR would similarly cause Ca2+ release, activation of NF-B, and resultant transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Comparison of the endogenous activation of NF-B in IB3 cells (W1282X/F508), a trafficking mutant similar to the homozygous F508 mutation, with that in corrected C-38 cells, which express a functional but truncated form of CFTR, was consistent with this hypothesis. The transcriptionally active p65 component of NF-B was found in the nuclei of unstimulated CF cells but not of the corrected cells by immunofluorescence labeling and was confirmed by gel shift assays (8). Manipulations to increase CFTR trafficking to the apical surface of the cell, such as growth at low temperature or the addition of glycerol, decreased the amount of p65 found in the IB3 cell nuclei. Although these observations were consistent with the hypothesis that abnormal CFTR proteins cause endogenous activation of NF-B, they did not differentiate between two possible mechanisms: that "cell stress" associated with CFTR mistrafficking leads to changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and stimulation of NF-B translocation or that CFTR Cl channel dysfunction by itself is associated with endogenous activation of NF-B..

Analysis of the activation of NF-B in such cell lines would provide the opportunity to determine whether Cl channel dysfunction alone is associated with the regulation of NF-B. The G551D CFTR mutant, in which a conserved glycine in the ATP binding cassette is mutated, lacks Cl channel function, but the protein is properly folded and trafficked (12). Patients with the G551D mutation have a clinical disease that is indistinguishable from that caused by the more common F508 mutation (10). The 9/HTEo human tracheal epithelial cell line transfected with a plasmid directing constitutive expression of the CFTR regulatory (R) domain also fails to transport Cl in response to cAMP while expressing low levels of wild-type CFTR message detected by RT-PCR (21). These 9/HTEo/pCep-R cells are readily activated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and express significantly more IL-8 than control cells containing the empty vector (5). The impact of impaired CFTR Cl channel activity on the normal interaction of IBs and NF-B is not known. Recently constructed 16HBE cell lines expressing plasmid-encoded cftr in the sense or antisense orientation also provide the opportunity to test the impact of CFTR Cl channel function on the activation of NF-B in airway cells without the confounding issues of mistrafficked CFTR protein (23)..

Although CFTR mistrafficking typical of the common F508 mutation and associated cell stress may be responsible for the increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with CF cells, we sought to establish whether CFTR Cl channel function as well as the effects of CFTR mistrafficking contributes to endogenous activation of NF-B and the excessive inflammation that characterizes CF airway pathology..

IB3 cells (F508/W1282X), a human bronchial epithelial cell line, and C-38 cells, "corrected" cells with normal physiology that express an episomal truncated form of CFTR (33), were obtained from P. Zeitlin (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and grown in LHC-8 medium (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) plus 10% FCS. The IB3 cells used in these studies contain the empty vector. 16HBE cells transfected with plasmids expressing the first 131 nucleotides of cftr in either the sense or antisense orientation were grown in MEM plus 10% FCS plus L-glutamine and have been previously described (23). Cells expressing the antisense plasmid failed to respond to cAMP agonists with Cl secretion. Stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells that express F508 CFTR or G551D CFTR were obtained from J. Riordan (Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, Scottsdale, AZ) and grown in MEM plus 200  microM methotrexate plus 8% FCS.

Each IL-8 data point was determined in quintuplicate, and means  plus or minus  SD were calculated. Significance was evaluated with a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's posttest (GraphPad Instat version 3.00, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to test the null hypothesis that there was no difference in the amount of IL-8 produced by the epithelial cells with different CFTR function..

This was in contrast to the threefold increase in luciferase activity associated with CHO cells expressing mutant F508 CFTR (P  <  0.001 for F508 compared with the pCep vector control). Experiments done with stably transfected CHO cells yielded similar results (Fig. 3C); expression of F508 CFTR was associated with a sevenfold increase in reporter activation compared with that in the CHO cells expressing the G551D mutation (P  <  0.001) or CHO cells transfected with the reporter construct alone (P  <  0.001). The relative expression of CFTR in the CHO cells was roughly equivalent (Fig. 3, B and D).

Clinical studies have clearly established a direct correlation between infection, IL-8 secretion, and the accumulation of PMNs and their toxic products in the CF lung (14-17). Bacterial stimulation of cells with CFTR mutations activates significantly greater cytokine expression than matched cells with normal CFTR function (5, 8, 29, 30). Several reports (8, 28) suggest that cells with CFTR dysfunction have endogenously upregulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Young infants with CF, even without detectable evidence of prior infection, have PMNs and increased amounts of IL-8 in their airways (14), and proinflammatory cytokine expression is increased in cells cultured directly from uninfected CF tissues (28). These findings are consistent with the in vitro studies demonstrating endogenous activation of NF-B in CF but not in corrected cell lines. As indicated by the data in this report, lack of CFTR Cl channel function and the physiological consequences of mistrafficked mutant CFTR both appear to contribute to the endogenous activation of NF-B in CF airway cells, which is manifested by the increased expression of IL-8 in these cells, even in the absence of bacterial stimulation..

0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	54	There is evidence of endogenous activation of NF-B in cells with CFTR dysfunction due to several different mechanisms. In previous studies, IB3 cells, which express the W1282X/F508 mutation associated with mistrafficked CFTR that accumulates in the ER, were found to have significant amounts of the p65 component of NF-B in nuclei under basal conditions in which there was no nuclear NF-B in the corrected C-38 cells (8). Because the translocation of NF-B can be associated with many types of stimuli, additional consequences of accumulated mutant CFTR in the ER were also demonstrated in the mutant cell line. The IB3 cells were found to have higher basal [Ca2+]i, a predicted consequence of "ER stress" (2, 18). The presence of nuclear NF-B in the IB3 cells could be correlated with increased IL-8 expression as estimated by RT-PCR compared with that in the control C-38 cell line. The concentration of IL-8 in the tissue culture supernatant was minimal in these cells after an 18-h incubation in serum-free medium; however, the relative amount of IL-8 message was consistent with a previous report by DiMango et al. (8). Not all investigators have found increased endogenous levels of IL-8 associated with CFTR mutations (30). Cell culture conditions, effects of FCS, and handling of the monolayers all can affect the translocation of NF-B and endogenous expression of IL-8. Thus it seems relevant to demonstrate that the presence of nuclear p65 appears to be associated with the expected biological response, namely IL-8 expression..

Stimulation of NF-B translocation is associated with an antiapoptotic effect in many cell lines including respiratory epithelial cells. Rates of apoptosis can be increased by proteasome inhibitors that inhibit IB degradation and block NF-B translocation (31). In a study published recently (23), the rates of IB3 and C-38 cell apoptosis were equivalent both under control conditions and after bacterial stimulation despite the observed differences in endogenous nuclear NF-B. Thus the association between CFTR dysfunction, activation of NF-B, and transcription of NF-B-dependent genes is somewhat selective and is not a global response..

The presence of the mistrafficked mutant F508 CFTR was a significant stimulus for NF-B activation in CHO cells. The G551D CFTR, which does not function appropriately as a Cl channel but is trafficked normally to the apical surface of the respiratory epithelial cell (10), did not stimulate NF-B. Expression of normal CFTR from the same plasmid construct did not cause NF-B activation in CHO cells nor did transfection with the empty vector or the luciferase reporter construct. Although both the G551D and F508 CFTR mutations are associated with clinical disease and lack of Cl secretion in response to cAMP (10), the major difference between these mutants is the mistrafficking and accumulation of F508 CFTR within the ER. Thus it appears that the consequences of mistrafficking of F508 are sufficient to activate NF-B in CHO cells..

The homozygous F508 or the compound F508/W1282X mutation could activate NF-B by two independent mechanisms: cell stress associated with mistrafficking or effects directly due to lack of CFTR Cl channel activity. Cell lines that lack CFTR Cl function due to either the overproduction of the CFTR R-domain or the expression of CFTR antisense had activated NF-B and significant amounts of endogenous IL-8 production compared with the corresponding control cell lines. The amount of IL-8 endogenously expressed by these cell lines was greater than that of the IB3 or C38 cells and could be quantified by a standard ELISA assay. The presence of the p65 component of NF-B in nuclei of undisturbed cells grown on coverslips as well as the relative activation of an NF-B reporter construct compared with appropriate controls indicates that their activated state is unlikely to be an artifact of either cell transformation or manipulations occurring during cell culture. Because neither the 9/HTEo/pCep-R or the 16HBE/cftr antisense cells have excessive CFTR accumulation in the ER, the lack of CFTR Cl channel function in these epithelial cells appears to be responsible for the observed increase in NF-B activation and IL-8 expression..

0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	62	Exactly how CFTR dysfunction contributes to the activation and nuclear localization of NF-B is unclear. There are multiple mechanisms for NF-B activation that can be divided into signal-dependent and signal-independent pathways (20). In airway epithelial cells, bacterial attachment to asialo-GM1 activates a Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway that results in NF-B activation and IL-8 transcription through a cascade that includes phosphorylation of both the p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase families of mitogen-activated protein kinases (23a). A signal-independent pathway, perhaps involving IB or NF-B regulation directly, may be affected by mistrafficked CFTR. IB- has been shown to be increased in IB3 cells under basal conditions and is hypophosphorylated, enabling nuclear NF-B with bound IB- complexes to direct transcription (30). Hypophosphorylated IB- may be involved in either signal-dependent or the persistent activation of NF-B (26). Diminished levels of cytosolic IB- was associated with CF (F508/F508) bronchial gland cells in primary culture and correlated with the presence of nuclear NF-B Rel A (27). It is possible that CFTR function, perhaps by affecting pH in specific intracellular compartments (3), affects relevant kinase or phosphatase activity. Abnormalities in signal transducer and activator of transduction-1 phosphorylation in the same 9/HTEo/pCep-R cells have been described recently (13), indicating that CFTR may have a role in multiple signaling pathways. These observations reflect the complexities of CFTR involvement in the normal physiology of the epithelial cell. Strategies such as gene therapy to correct CFTR Cl channel function alone, which do not ameliorate the effects of mutant CFTR mistrafficking in the majority of airway epithelial cells, may not be sufficient to control the inflammatory component of CF lung disease..

In the 12 years since the discovery of the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl channel (14), translation of such efforts clinically has been remarkable and includes 1) identification of almost 1,000 different mutations (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr), including 70% with a phenylalanine deletion (F508) that has led to successful clinical detection of individuals with a family history (even before the completion of the human genome project) and 2) ~20 trials of human CF gene therapy involving dosing to the nose or airways (2, 22). Such rapid progress, however, belies the complexity of the CFTR gene and the pathophysiology of CF..

0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	5	CFTR is a unique member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter gene family in that it 1) conducts Cl, 2) transports substrates across membranes in a nonconductive fashion (e.g., facilitates ATP release), 3) regulates other ion channel proteins (e.g., positive regulation of outwardly rectifying Cl channels or negative regulation of Na+ channels), and 4) regulates intracellular compartment acidification and protein processing (18). Such complexity has led these authors to categorize defects in CF respiratory epithelium as primary (dehydration associated with dysfunctional Cl transport), secondary (hyperabsorption of Na+), or tertiary (enhanced binding of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; proinflammatory environment). Fundamental to such diversity is the awareness that very minor mutations (e.g., F508, a single-amino acid deletion within a 1,480-amino acid protein) result in the profound pathological phenotype of CF (23). In the case of F508, the missense mutation results in a mutant CFTR that is believed to fold improperly, and such defects in its biosynthesis and trafficking result in little or no surface CFTR. Other mutations in CFTR lead to genotypic or phenotypic changes that span the range from no CFTR in the membrane to CFTR that reaches the membrane but does not respond to appropriate stimuli or conduct Cl (6). Adding to this complexity is a recent report describing tissue-specific changes in the impairment of F508 processing (10). Some mutations overlap with PDZ-interacting domains on the COOH terminus of CFTR that are required for polarization of CFTR to the apical membrane of respiratory epithelium (13) and may underscore CFTR regulation of other ion channels by affecting the relationship between accessory proteins, linker proteins, and regulatory cofactors..

Although the defect in Cl conductance is critical to the pathology of CF respiratory epithelia, contributions of alterations in vesicle trafficking, protein processing, and immune function clearly contribute to the pathogenesis and maintenance of CF (18). These efforts underlie the disparities between genotype and phenotype in CF and suggest that in addition to nucleotide repair (gene therapy, aminoglycoside-dependent restoration of readthrough of full-length CFTR), pharmacotherapy targeted toward improved biosynthesis of mutated CFTR may be a useful adjunct approach to the treatment of CF (24)..

The steps in proper folding of CFTR, quality control mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum trafficking, and requisite association with various chaperones are outlined by Brodsky and reference is made to three original articles in the Special Topic. The mechanisms by which sodium 4-phenylbutyrate may be a modulator of such chaperones are presented by Rubenstein and Lyons (17) and Choo-Kang and Zeitlin (5), and the in vivo efficacy of a chemical chaperone, trimethylamine oxide, in the restoration of defective Cl conductance in the critical target tissue (intestinal epithelium) of CFTR null mutant mice is presented by Fischer et al. (7). This collective work strongly supports the concept that small molecules are useful alternative or adjunct therapies for disorders of protein folding (23, 24)..

An editorial by Blackwell et al. (1) accompanies the manuscript by Weber et al. (21) and highlights the central role of unregulated nuclear factor (NF)-B in the proinflammatory cytokine profile of cells expressing mutated CFTR. In this regard, blocking the production of NF-B may be an alternative rational therapeutic approach in CF therapy. In addition to enhanced cytokine (interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-) production, oxidative stress appears to be a component of CF epithelia. Previous in vitro work (9, 11) showed that CFTR is associated with the transport of glutathione (GSH). In the current Special Topic, Gao et al. (8) show that the Cl channel-forming peptide N-K4-M2GlyR increased Cl secretion and GSH efflux in a human CF airway epithelial cell line, suggesting that apical Cl conductance (but not necessarily CFTR function per se) is coupled to GSH efflux. Velsor et al. (20) report in this issue that GSH was decreased in the epithelial lining fluid of CFTR-deficient mice and that an imbalance in antioxidant defense in CFTR-deficient mice was evident. These data extend previous observations that GSH was decreased in the airway fluid of humans with CFTR (16) and that aerosol delivery of GSH may be a useful therapy for CF (15).

Although the mechanism coupling such hyperabsorption to CFTR mutations remains unknown, an extracellular serine protease-mediated signaling pathway has been identified (19) that activates an amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel. In the Special Topic in this issue, Bridges et al. (3) show that human bronchial epithelial cells are sensitive to aprotinin. Using the Kunitz domain of aprotinin as a pharmacophore, they show that BAY 39-9437, a recombinant Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, decreased Na+ absorption in non-CF and CF human bronchial epithelia..

Using cell surface biotinylation and antibody uptake studies, we show that CFTR undergoes constitutive endocytosis and recycling back to the plasma membrane.

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	7	CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF), a common lethal genetic disease of Caucasians, results from mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a member of the ABC superfamily of transport proteins (28). CFTR is a cAMP-activated anion channel and channel regulator that functions at the apical membrane of polarized epithelia to regulate secretion in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (37). Previous studies have shown that CFTR is not a stable component of the plasma membrane but is rather efficiently endocytosed from the cell surface (18, 27, 35) through clathrin-coated pits (4, 5). Furthermore, such entry of CFTR into the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway is mediated by binding of a tyrosine-based endocytic motif in the carboxyl terminus of CFTR (27, 35) to the medium subunit of the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex (36). In addition to endocytic motifs, CFTR also interacts with PDZ-domain containing proteins (29, 32) and AMP kinase (10) at its carboxyl terminus and syntax-ins at its amino terminus (24, 25). How all these interactions modulate cell surface expression of CFTR is not clear (2, 22), although morphological, biochemical, and functional data indicate that CFTR is present in cell surface and intracellular compartments in both heterologous expression systems and epithelial cells that natively express CFTR (1, 3, 33).

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	8	CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF), a common lethal genetic disease of Caucasians, results from mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a member of the ABC superfamily of transport proteins (28). CFTR is a cAMP-activated anion channel and channel regulator that functions at the apical membrane of polarized epithelia to regulate secretion in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (37). Previous studies have shown that CFTR is not a stable component of the plasma membrane but is rather efficiently endocytosed from the cell surface (18, 27, 35) through clathrin-coated pits (4, 5). Furthermore, such entry of CFTR into the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway is mediated by binding of a tyrosine-based endocytic motif in the carboxyl terminus of CFTR (27, 35) to the medium subunit of the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex (36). In addition to endocytic motifs, CFTR also interacts with PDZ-domain containing proteins (29, 32) and AMP kinase (10) at its carboxyl terminus and syntax-ins at its amino terminus (24, 25). How all these interactions modulate cell surface expression of CFTR is not clear (2, 22), although morphological, biochemical, and functional data indicate that CFTR is present in cell surface and intracellular compartments in both heterologous expression systems and epithelial cells that natively express CFTR (1, 3, 33). Although much is now known about the mechanisms of CFTR internalization, the fate of internalized CFTR is less well documented. Previous studies have suggested that internalized CFTR is recycled (31), but the pathway and compartments through which CFTR traverses to undergo recycling are not known..

Some molecules such as the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are retained in the sorting endosome, which matures into and/or fuses with late endosomes (6). Molecules that are destined to be recycled back to the cell surface are initially targeted to the endosomal recycling compartment (ERC) (9, 23). While the ERC has been extensively characterized on the basis of studies of transferrin receptor recycling (39) and insulin-regulated recycling of GLUT-4 (14), there are no data concerning the entry of ion channels, such as CFTR, into this compartment for recycling back to the cell surface. Rme-1 is an epsin homology (EH) domain containing protein (8) recently identified as a key element in controlling exit from the ERC (15). A dominant negative Rme-1 (Rme-1 G429R), when expressed in mammalian cells, has no effect on the endocytosis of integral membrane proteins such as the transferrin receptor but dramatically inhibits the recycling of the transferrin receptor back to the cell surface, trapping the receptor in the ERC (15). Endocytosed proteins such as LDL, which are targeted to lysosomes and do not enter the ERC, are unaffected. We examined the fate of endocytosed CFTR by using dominant negative Rme-1 as a tool for probing transport of CFTR through the ERC..

Briefly, plasma membranes were biotinylated at 4 degrees C using a cleavable reagent (Sulpho-NHS-SS-biotin; Pierce, Rockford, IL) and then warmed up to 37 degrees C to load endocytic vesicles with biotinylated proteins (including CFTR). Remaining cell surface biotin was removed using MESNA as previously described (34). Subsequently, the cells were either lysed or rewarmed to 37 degrees C to allow internalized biotinylated CFTR to recycle to the cell surface. The cells were again cooled to 4 degrees C, the disulphide bonds on recycled cell surface proteins were reduced with MESNA, and the cells were lysed. Biotinylated proteins were isolated by streptavidin-agarose beads, eluted into SDS sample buffer, and resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Biotinylated CFTR was detected by Western blot analysis as described above..

To confirm that G429R Rme-1 inhibited exit from endosomal recycling compartments in 293 cells, we transiently expressed GFP-tagged G429R Rme-1 in cells stably expressing wild-type CFTR. Endosomal recycling compartments were identified by incubating cells for 60 min at 37 degrees C in the continued presence of Cy3-labeled transferrin. In untransfected cells (Fig. 3a), transferrin-positive compartments were seen as discrete perinuclear vesicles throughout the cytoplasm of the cell. When experiments were performed using cells transiently transfected with G429R Rme-1, transferrin was observed in large perinuclear compartments (Fig. 3c). Such compartments colocalized with GFP-tagged G429R Rme-1 (Fig. 3, c and d), consistent with the effects of G429R Rme-1 on affecting exit but not entry into the ERC. Nontransfected cells incubated under similar conditions with DiLDL showed uptake of labeled LDL into large cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 3e), presumably late endosomes/lysosomes.

As an alternative strategy to show that G429R Rme-1 causes "trapping" of CFTR in the ERC, vesicles from CFTR/293 cells transfected with G429R Rme-1 were subject to immunomagnetic isolation by using anti-CFTR antibodies (Fig. 7). Because CFTR in ERC should be oriented such that the cytosolic domains of CFTR are facing the outside of the vesicle, we immunoprecipitated CFTR-containing vesicles from cells by using antibodies directed against the amino and carboxyl termini of CFTR. Immunoblot analysis of such isolated vesicles revealed the presence of band C CFTR. Rme-1 and transferrin receptor were also identified within CFTR-containing vesicles. In contrast, markers for early endosomes (EEA1) and lysosomes (Lamp1) showed very little signal..

CFTR-containing vesicles were subjected to immunomagnetic isolation. For subsequent immunoblot analysis, the following antibodies were employed. Rme-1 (70 kDa; a gift from M. S.

To show that CFTR enters the ERC from the clathrin-coated endocytic pathway, we monitored the traffic of internalized CFTR. Because the steady-state level of cell surface CFTR in the presence of G429R Rme-1 is extremely low and there are no high-affinity extracellular antibodies or ligands for CFTR, we decided to utilize a CFTR/transferrin receptor chimera transiently coexpressed with G429R Rme-1. TRVb1 cells lacking endogenous transferrin receptors were transiently transfected with a CFTR transferrin receptor (TfR) chimera in which the cytoplasmic domain of the transferrin receptor was replaced with the carboxyl terminal domain of CFTR. Twenty-four hours after such transfection, some cells were also transfected with G429R Rme-1. Traffic of the CFTR/TfR chimera was monitored by using Cy3-conjugated transferrin. Cells containing CFTR/TfR (Fig. 8, a and b) or CFTR/TfR and G429R Rme-1 (Fig. 8, c-f) were incubated for 1 h in the continued presence of Cy3 transferrin (Fig. 8, a and c). Cy3 transferrin was efficiently taken up in both sets of cells. After the hour pulse with labeled transferrin, cells were subject to an hour chase in the absence of labeled transferrin and 100-fold excess of unlabeled transferrin. Cells expressing CFTR/TfR alone (Fig. 8b) showed loss of cell associated signal because the transferrin was efficiently recycled back to the cell surface and released into the medium. In contrast, cells expressing CFTR/TfR and G429R Rme-1 (Fig. 8d) failed to recycle internalized transferrin back to the cell surface.

Of interest are the observations that the endocytic internalization kinetics for CFTR are rapid (12, 18, 27, 34) and that internalized CFTR appears to be fully functional (5, 17). These observations suggest the possibility that internalized CFTR may be constitutively recycled back to the cell surface. Indeed, given the rapid internalization kinetics of CFTR, biosynthetic kinetics would have to be equally rapid to maintain steady-state cell surface CFTR. However, treatment of CFTR-expressing CHO cells with either cycloheximide or brefeldin A did not cause any diminution of forskolin-stimulated CFTR function up to 24 h (16), arguing that internalized CFTR may be recycled rather than degraded. Studies by Swiatecka-Urban et al. (31) have further argued that recycling of CFTR may be important in establishing its apical polarity in epithelial cells..

The role of Rme-1 in regulating aspects of the endocytic/recycling pathway has been established by using dominant negative mutants in CHO cells and C. elegans. While Rme-1 has no effect on initial clathrin-mediated endocytic events, Rme-1 function is necessary for proteins to exit the ERC and travel back to the plasma membrane. In contrast, Rme-1 plays no role in the traffic of proteins, such as LDL, to the late endosome/lysosome pathway. Although there is only one Rme family member in C. elegans, there are four related genes in humans (8, 21, 26). As yet, the tissue distribution and expression overlap of CFTR with the different Rme-1 genes are not known..

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	49	We show that internalized CFTR enters the endocytic recycling compartment on its traffic back to the cell surface in an identical fashion to the well-described marker for endosomal recycling, the transferrin receptor. Expression of dominant negative Rme-1 has no effect on endocytosis, as shown by uptake of LDL, transferrin, and CFTR/transferrin chimeras, consistent with previously published data (8, 15). In contrast to traffic of LDL to late endosomes/lysosomes, which is unaffected by dominant negative Rme-1 and shows no colocalization with GFP-tagged G429R Rme-1, transferrin (a marker for the recycling compartment) shows almost complete overlap with GFP-tagged G429R Rme-1. CFTR localization in dominant negative Rme-1-expressing cells shows overlap with both transferrin and GFP, arguing that internalized CFTR enters the same recycling compartment that transferrin has access to. The observation that expression of dominant negative Rme-1 caused a marked redistribution of CFTR away from the plasma membrane to being trapped in the ERC argues for a rapid endocytic rate for CFTR. Indeed, several groups have shown that CFTR is efficiently endocytosed from the cell surface (12, 18, 27, 34). Moreover, the redistribution of CFTR in the presence of G429R Rme-1 argues that maintenance of steady-state cell surface levels of CFTR is primarily due to recycling of internalized CFTR rather than insertion of newly synthesized CFTR. The lack of high-affinity antibodies to extracellular domains of CFTR, and the low level of expression of cell surface CFTR in the presence of G429R Rme-1, precluded monitoring of CFTR from the cell surface to the ERC. To confirm that entry of CFTR into the ERC was from the endocytic pathway, we monitored access of transferrin receptor/CFTR chimeras to the ERC. Transferrin receptor constructs that lack a cytoplasmic tail are internalized inefficiently (13, 27). Addition of the carboxyl tail of CFTR to tail-less transferrin receptors restores efficient internalization of the receptor and labeled transferrin reporters (27). Transfection of cells with transferrin receptor/CFTR chimeras and dominant negative Rme-1 shows that labeled transferrin is trapped within the ERC, arguing that entry into the ERC is from the endocytic rather than the biosynthetic pathway. Moreover, it argues that the carboxyl tail of CFTR does not contain any signals that direct traffic of CFTR away from recycling pathways to lysosomal degradative compartments. While many endocytosed membrane proteins are thought to recycle to the cell surface via a juxtanuclear recycling compartment (23), this is not true for all proteins. For example, Kir channels, a potassium channel family involved in regulating membrane excitability (38), do not recycle to the cell surface through Rme-1-regulated compartments (19). Thus it is clear that different ion channels can traffic and recycle through diverse compartments..

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   We have previously identified the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR)-interacting protein CAL and demonstrated that CAL modulates CFTR plasma membrane expression by retaining CFTR within the cell. Here, we report that in addition to regulating membrane expression, CAL also regulates the expression of mature CFTR. The co-expression of hemagglutinin-tagged or Myc-tagged CAL with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CFTR in COS-7 cells causes a dose-dependent reduction in mature GFP-CFTR, independent of its tags. Bafilomycin A1, a lysosomal proton pump inhibitor, increases mature GFP-CFTR, confirming previous reports of lysosomal degradation of mature CFTR. Importantly, bafilomycin A1 reverses CAL-mediated CFTR degradation. The proteasome inhibitor, MG132, on the other hand, does not reverse the effect of CAL. CAL has no effect on CFTR maturation, suggesting that it exerts its effects on mature CFTR. Co-expression of CAL enhances the degradation of CFTR. We showed previously that CAL reduces the half-life of CFTR at the cell surface. Here we show that expression of dominant-negative dynamin 2 K44A, a large GTPase inhibitor that is known to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and vesicle formation in the Golgi, increases cell surface CFTR as measured by surface biotinylation. More importantly, dynamin 2 K44A also restores cell surface CFTR in CAL-overexpressing cells and partially blocks the CAL-mediated degradation of mature CFTR. These data suggest a model in which CAL retains CFTR in the cell and targets CFTR for degradation..

The best-known and probably the primary defect in cystic fibrosis is salt and water transport in plasma membranes of epithelial cells lining the organs of lung, pancreas, liver, intestines, sweat duct, and reproductive systems (3). CFTR is a membrane protein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transport family.

Immature, wild type CFTR is folded inefficiently in the ER with a large fraction degraded before reaching the plasma membrane (9). That which is folded efficiently traffics to the Golgi and acquires complex glycosylation characteristic of the mature CFTR. The most common mutation in CF, F508CFTR, is a misfolded protein and is recognized as such by the ER, translocated to the cytosol, and degraded by the 26 S proteasome (9). Thus, the predominant majority of the F508 never matures and traffics to the plasma membrane..

They found that lysosomal inhibitors increase the half-life of mature wild type CFTR in baby hamster kidney cells transfected with CFTR and in the endogenous CFTR in Caco-2 and T84 cells. Interestingly, C-terminal truncation mutants do not traffic to the lysosome. Instead, they are degraded in the proteasome (10). Thus, CFTR appears to enter different degradative pathways depending on signals within its C terminus..

Several PDZ domain proteins known to interact with CFTR include NHE-RF/EBP-50, CAP70, and CAL (CFTR-associated ligand) (11 to 15). The C-terminal tail of CFTR plays a potential regulatory role in modulating its Cl to  channel activity. Adding recombinant NHE-RF or CAP70 fusion proteins to the cytoplasmic side of CFTR in vitro increases the activity of CFTR (15, 16). In addition, NHE-RF anchors CFTR to cytoskeleton stabilizing the cell surface CFTR (13, 17). Both NHE-RF and its related protein, E3KARP, link cAMP-dependent protein kinase to CFTR (13, 18). Moreover, NHE-RF was shown to link 2-adrenergic receptor to CFTR (19). Formation of such macromolecular complexes facilitates the efficiency of activation CFTR..

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	12	CAL (also known as PIST (PDZ domain protein interacting specifically with TC10), GOPC (Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif containing), and FIG (fused in glioblastoma)) (11, 20 to 22) is a CFTR-interacting PDZ domain protein that associates predominantly with the Golgi apparatus. Overexpression of CAL reduces CFTR chloride currents in mammalian cells by decreasing the expression of CFTR in the plasma membrane (11). This effect of CAL can be overcome by NHE-RF, which restores the plasma membrane expression of CFTR. CAL favors the retention of CFTR within the cell, whereas NHE-RF favors surface expression by competing with CAL for the binding of CFTR (11). Interestingly, overexpression of CAL also reduces the amount of CFTR (23). These findings point to a role for CAL in the intracellular trafficking of CFTR. Consistent with this notion, CAL interacts with proteins involved in membrane vesicle trafficking such as the SNARE protein, syntaxin 6, and the small GTPase, TC10 (20, 22). Furthermore, CAL also interacts with and potentially regulates the intracellular trafficking of the Wnt receptors, frizzled 5 and 8, neural members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, CALEB/NGC (21, 24), and the chloride channel, CLC-3B (23)..

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	16	In addition to the PDZ domain, the C-tail of CFTR contains motifs for endocytosis. A tyrosine motif at the C terminus of CFTR binds directly with the  micro light chain of the AP2 complex involved in sorting CFTR for endocytosis into clathrin-coated pits (27). Surface CFTR is endocytosed rapidly. For example, within 5 min, 50% CFTR at the plasma membrane is endocytosed via AP2 clathrin-coated pits. CFTR contained within endosomes can be either recycled back to the plasma membrane or degraded in the lysosome. Because surface CFTR has a long half-life (24 to 48h), the majority of CFTR must be recycled back to the cell surface instead of targeted to the lysosome for degradation. It is not clear how this process is regulated. In this study, we examined the role of CAL on the expression of mature CFTR protein. We found that CAL regulates the expression of mature CFTR through mechanisms that are both bafilomycin A1- and dynamin 2-sensitive..

Co-expression of CAL reduces the total cellular CFTR (23). To confirm these observations, we co-transfected GFP-CFTR into COS-7 cells with different concentrations of either HA- or Myc-tagged CAL. GFP-CFTR was previously shown to have the single channel properties and intracellular trafficking patterns similar to that of wild type CFTR (28). Fig. 1 depicts the steady state levels of CFTR, HA-CAL, and tubulin, which is used to assess protein loading. Note that CFTR resolves into two bands that are well known to correspond to the upper mature C-band (fully glycosylated) and the lower immature B band (core glycosylated) of CFTR (29). Note that expression of either type of tagged CAL construct significantly reduced steady state levels of the mature band of CFTR assayed at 48 h post-transfection. Consistent with previous results (23), the effects of CAL on mature CFTR were dose-dependent and independent of the epitope tags. Both results argue that CAL down-regulates CFTR mature protein in a specific fashion. For example, the abundance of tubulin, a cytoskeleton protein, was not affected by either HA-CAL (Fig. 1, A and C) or Myc-CAL (Fig. 1, B and C). Likewise, co-expression of HA-CAL or Myc-CAL did not affect the expression of GFP, a cytosolic protein, or GFP-frizzled 4, a membrane protein (data not shown). Neither GFP nor frizzled 4 binds to CAL (11). All of the GFP-tagged proteins used have the same cytomegalovirus promoters, eliminating a nonspecific effect on promoter activity. In addition, NHE-RF has no effect on the abundance of mature CFTR (11, 23). These data suggest that CAL does not down-regulate GFP-CFTR by reducing its transcription (see more on pulse-chase experiments later) or by acting on the GFP moiety of the fusion proteins..

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	36	  Is the Degradation of CFTR Influenced by CAL? To investigate the role of the lysosome and the proteasome in CAL-mediated down-regulation of CFTR, we examined the effect of their respective inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment with bafilomycin A1, a lysosomal proton pump inhibitor (30), increases steady state protein levels of CFTR. Our data combined with previous findings obtained with other lysosome blocking agents (10, 11) suggest that lysosomal degradation is an important process in regulating mature CFTR abundance. Important for this study is that bafilomycin A1 reverses CAL-mediated reduction in mature CFTR (Fig. 2A). Fig 2A (first and third lanes) shows the typical effect of CAL on mature CFTR. In the absence of bafilomycin A1, CAL-transfected cells have significantly less mature CFTR than in cells not transfected with CAL (Fig. 2A, third lane is 57.1  plus or minus  4.2% of first lane; p  <  0.05, n = 3). Importantly, after 24 to 48 h of bafilomycin A1 treatment, the effect of CAL is significantly reduced (Fig. 2A, fourth lane, is 75.7  plus or minus  5.9% of second lane; p  >  0.05, n = 3). The effect of bafilomycin is likely underestimated. Some CAL-induced reduction in mature CFTR was expected to take place prior to the addition of bafilomycin midway, at 24 h posttransfection. Thus, some CAL-induced reduction in mature CFTR was expected to take place prior to the addition of bafilomycin. Fig. 2B depicts the extent of CFTR bafilomycin A1 sensitivity (see "Experimental Procedures"). At 24 to 48 h posttransfection, 27.93  plus or minus  2.85% of CFTR is bafilomycin-sensitive. In contrast, in cells transfected with 6  microg of HA-CAL/100-mm dish, 49.55  plus or minus  7.62% of CFTR is bafilomycin-sensitive (p  <  0.01). The reversal of CAL-mediated reduction of mature CFTR by bafilomycin A1 is also reproduced in the stable cell line 4F2 (Fig. 2C, fourth lane is 77.8  plus or minus  9.6% of second lane; p  >  0.05, n = 3; whereas Fig. 2C, third lane is 65.6  plus or minus  6.8% of first lane, p  <  0.05, n = 3). More importantly, transfection of HA-CAL leads to an increase in the extent of bafilomycin A1-sensitive degradation of CFTR (Fig. 2D). These results strongly suggested that CAL plays a key role in regulating the bafilomycin A1-sensitive degradation of CFTR. On the other hand, treating CAL-transfected cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 did not rescue mature GFP-CFTR (Fig. 2A) back to the control levels observed in the absence of CAL. In contrast to bafilomycin A1 treatment, in the presence of CAL, MG132 actually reduced levels of mature CFTR. It has been observed by several investigators that proteasome inhibition does not increase the maturation of CFTR (31, 32). MG132 did not increase immature CFTR in the Nonidet P-40 lysates probably because blocking of proteosomal degradation leads to the accumulation of CFTR into a detergent-insoluble polyubiquitinated form of immature CFTR (32). The failure of MG132 to inhibit CAL reduction of mature CFTR is further evidence that CAL can function downstream of the proteosome and influence the degradation of mature CFTR..
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	37	What Is the Effect of CAL on CFTR Maturation? The steady state level of mature CFTR is determined by new protein synthesis and the trafficking and maturation of CFTR from ER to Golgi as well as post-Golgi degradation. To eliminate the possibility that, in addition to enhancing the degradation of mature CFTR in the lysosome, CAL decreases CFTR synthesis and/or maturation, we examined the synthesis and maturation of CFTR by metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments. In Fig. 3A, COS-7 cells transfected with GFP-CFTR with or without HA-CAL were metabolically pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine for 30 min at 16 h post-transfection. The cells were then chased in medium supplemented with unlabeled methionine and cysteine for 1 to 4 h to follow the maturation of CFTR. The lower band (Fig. 3A, band B) is the newly synthesized CFTR in ER that appears first. Not all newly synthesized CFTR is converted to mature CFTR (band C, upper band); because CFTR folds inefficiently, most of band B is degraded by ER-associated degradation (8). Fig. 3 shows that GFP-CFTR matures similarly whether transfected or not transfected with CAL. Therefore, CAL exerts its effects on mature CFTR and does not affect the synthesis and trafficking to Golgi. To test this hypothesis directly, the effect of CAL on mature CFTR was examined. GFP-CFTR becomes fully mature after chasing for 4 h (Fig. 3A). There is no significant difference in the amount of CFTR in CAL transfected and untransfected cells (40,990  plus or minus  1840 versus 39,284  plus or minus  1464 arbitrary unit/dish, p  >  0.05, n = 3). The mature CFTR was then followed when cells were chased for an additional 16 h. As shown in Fig. 3C, there was less 35S-labeled mature CFTR after 16 h in cells transfected with HA-CAL than with those not transfected with HA-CAL, confirming the role of CAL in the degradation of mature CFTR. On the other hand, if bafilomycin A1 was added at 4 h in the absence of CAL, followed by a 16-h chase, more labeled CFTR remains after 16 h compared with that remaining in the absence of both CAL and bafilomycin A1, suggesting that degradation was inhibited. Of note is that there is more labeled CFTR remaining in CAL-transfected cells in the presence of bafilomycin than in CAL-transfected cells in the absence of bafilomycin. Importantly, the fraction of mature CFTR sensitive to bafilomycin A1 is statistically larger in the presence of CAL versus the control (50.61  plus or minus  0.45 versus 43.72  plus or minus  1.2, p  <  0.01), indicating that CAL is enhancing the degradation of mature CFTR. Taken together, these data suggest that CAL does not affect early CFTR biosynthesis in the ER or maturation to mature CFTR. CAL retains CFTR intracellularly and down-regulates mature CFTR most likely by enhancing its degradation in the post-Golgi compartments..

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	53	At steady state, CAL is localized to the Golgi complex, particularly in the TGN and cytosol. TC10 is localized at the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles; syntaxin 6 is primarily in Golgi and endosomes. CFTR spans all of these compartments. For these proteins to work in concert on CFTR, they must physically interact. One possibility is that they interact at the interface of their respective compartments. Alternatively, one or all of these proteins could cycle among different compartments. For example, CAL may traffic from TGN/Golgi to the plasma membrane and then to endosomes and to the lysosome, or it may traffic directly from the TGN to the lysosome. Fig. 6 depicts evidence supporting this notion. The data show that expression of a dominant-negative dynamin 2 mutant redistributes CAL to the cell periphery into punctuate structures that co-localize with the mutant dynamin 2. In this circumstance CAL is arrested at the sites where dynamin regulates vesicle budding (Fig. 6). The dynamin 2 mutant Dyn2K44A is well known to inhibit endocytosis and to affect the Golgi (33, 35). The observation that the dynamin 2 mutant Dyn2K44A enhances surface expression of mature CFTR and does not have a large effect on the total amount of mature CFTR supports the notion that the primary effect of Dyn2K44A is post-Golgi. Thus, it is likely that CAL can traffic with CFTR past the Golgi and target CFTR for degradation either through endocytosis at the plasma membrane or via direct trafficking from a post-Golgi compartment to the lysosome. However, it is important to note that our data do not exclude other ways of regulating mature protein and cell surface expression CFTR..

Neuronal CAL contributes to the pathology of Lurcher mice (39). Lurcher mutant mice are ataxic because of degeneration of the cortex of the cerebella. Constitutive activation of the GluRd2Lc receptor causes an inward current and the death of Purkinje cells. Neuronal CAL has an additional 8 amino acids at the beginning of the second coiled-coil domain. CAL binds to GluRd2 and Beclin1 and links receptor activation to autophagy and cell death (39). Autophagy involves trafficking membrane compartments to the lysosome for degradation. Therefore, CAL maybe involved in lysosomal trafficking in autophagy..

The mature sperm of male mice missing CAL lack acrosome, a specialized lysosomal structure derived from the Golgi that is required for oocyte activation. In normal mice, CAL is located in the TGN and TGN-derived vesicles of the round spermatids. These data suggest that CAL is involved in acrosome biogenesis, perhaps by facilitating protein cargo transport to this organelle..

Interfering with the degradation of F508 CFTR in the post-Golgi compartments may be an attractive method to boost levels of mature CFTR. Our current study suggests a method to accomplish this by inhibiting the degradation of mature CFTR. More importantly, a more specific way of blocking the interaction between CAL and CFTR may potentially allow more CFTR to be trafficked to the plasma membrane..

0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	3	The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been implicated in the degradation of newly synthesized, misfolded and unassembled proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Using a cell-free reticulocyte lysate system we have examined the relationship between biosynthesis and ER-associated degradation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a polytopic protein with 12 predicted transmembrane segments. Our results provide direct evidence that full-length, glycosylated and membrane-integrated CFTR is a substrate for degradation and that degradation involves polyubiquitination and cytosolic proteolytic activity. CFTR ubiquitination was both temperature- and ATP-dependent. Degradation was significantly inhibited by EDTA, apyrase, and the proteasome inhibitors hemin and MG132. Degradation was inhibited to a lesser extent by clasto-lactacystin -lactone, ALLN, and N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone and was relatively unaffected by lactacystin and N-tosyl lysyl chloromethyl ketone. In the presence of hemin, polyubiquitinated CFTR remained tightly associated with ER microsomes. However, membrane-bound ubiquitinated CFTR could be subsequently degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments upon incubation in hemin-free, ATP-containing lysate. Thus ER-associated degradation of CFTR occurs via a membrane-bound, rather than cytosolic, intermediate and likely involves recruitment of degradation machinery to the ER membrane. Our data suggest a model in which the degradation of polytopic proteins such as CFTR is coupled to retrograde translocation and removal of the polypeptide from the lipid bilayer.

The ER also functions to recognize misfolded or unassembled proteins and prevent their exit to the Golgi complex (5-7) through a process termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (8). Substrates for ERAD, like other secretory and transmembrane proteins, are initially targeted to and translocated across the ER membrane via the Sec61 translocon complex (1, 2). However, aberrantly folded proteins are selectively translocated back into the cytosol where they undergo ubiquitination and degradation by cytosolic proteases (9-11). Certain ERAD substrates such as major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains (10, 12, 13) and unglycosylated prepro- factor undergo complete retrograde translocation into a soluble, cytosolic form prior to degradation (8). In contrast, mutant forms of carboxypeptidase Y and unassembled T cell receptor  subunits translocate back to the cytosol but remain associated with cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane (14, 15). In both cases the generation of cytosolic intermediates is thought to occur via retrograde transport through the Sec61 translocon complex (9-11)..

Yeast mutants with defective ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes or proteasome subunits show decreased degradation of mutant forms of Sec61p (16, 17), a resident ER protein with 10 predicted transmembrane segments (18). ERAD may also play a role in ensuring proper protein levels in the ER as suggested by mevalonate-mediated regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (19-21). For the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a plasma membrane protein, approximately 80% of wild type protein and 100% of common mutant forms are degraded prior to reaching the Golgi complex (22, 23). Recent studies have demonstrated that ER-associated degradation of CFTR also requires an intact ubiquitin conjugation pathway and likely involves the 26 S proteasome (24, 25). While the underlying reasons for CFTR degradation remain unknown, it has been proposed that the majority of wild type CFTR, like mutant CFTR, is recognized by ER quality control machinery, because it fails to fold properly (26-29)..

0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	9	Degradation of polytopic proteins by cytosolic proteases poses a particular problem in that multiple transmembrane (TM) segments must be removed from the membrane. It is unclear whether polytopic proteins, like secretory and bitopic transmembrane proteins, proceed through cytosolic intermediates prior to degradation. One possibility is that the proteasome might degrade only cytosolic peptide loops, leaving lumenal and/or transmembrane segments to be degraded by other proteases (7, 30). Alternatively, degradation might be coupled to the process of retrograde translocation. To distinguish among these possibilities, it will be necessary to define the temporal relationship between recognition, retrograde translocation, and degradation events involved in polytopic protein ER degradation. In this regard, a cell-free system that reconstitutes ERAD is attractive, because it is readily amenable to physical and pharmacological manipulation. Using such a system, Sato et al. (31) recently demonstrated that CFTR could be ubiquitinated cotranslationally, indicating that initial recognition events in ER degradation might occur very early in the lifetime of a polytopic protein. In the current study we use a similar cell free system to demonstrate that CFTR ubiquitination can also occur after protein synthesis, N-linked glycosylation, and membrane integration have been completed. We have also been able to separate the process of ubiquitination from that of degradation and now show that ubiquitinated CFTR remains tightly associated with the ER membrane until it is degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptide fragments. CFTR degradation is therefore physically localized to the ER. Our results are consistent with a model in which cytosolic degradation machinery is recruited to the ER membrane by polyubiquitinated substrates and suggest that degradation occurs coincident with polypeptide removal from the lipid bilayer.

Translation of plasmid pSPCFTR (35) in the absence of ER-derived microsomal membranes generated a polypeptide migrating at ~160 kDa (Fig. 1A). This translation product shifted 6 kDa in size when rough microsomes were added at the start of translation, consistent with the addition of two N-linked core carbohydrates at the predicted consensus sites in the fourth extracytoplasmic loop. The presence of full-length CFTR was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with peptide-specific antisera raised against N terminus, R domain, and C terminus epitopes. Carbonate extraction of translation products demonstrated that in vitro synthesized CFTR was fully integrated into the ER membrane. Thus the RRL system is capable of efficiently reconstituting the early events of CFTR biosynthesis and processing, in agreement with results reported by Sato et al. (31). To test the stability of newly synthesized CFTR in the ER membrane, cyclohexamide was added after 2 h of translation, and samples were incubated for an additional 4 h (Fig. 1B). At 24  degrees C, CFTR was remarkably stable, whereas at 37  degrees C CFTR was rapidly converted into a high molecular weight (HMW) complex with an estimated size of  > 450 kDa (T1/2  < 30 min). For convenience, this large complex will subsequently be referred to as the HMW complex, and the ~170 kDa band will be referred to as full-length CFTR..

Canine pancreas microsomal membranes were present during translation in all lanes except lane 1. Lanes 1, 2, and 7 represent total translation products analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Translation products were immunoprecipitated with nonimmune sera (lane 6) or with peptide-specific antisera raised against the N terminus (lane 3), R domain (lane 4) or C terminus (lane 5) of CFTR. For carbonate extraction, translation products (lane 7) were incubated at pH 7.5 (Tris) or at pH 11.5 (Carb), and supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions were analyzed directly. B, CFTR translation was carried out as in A except that aurin tricarboxylic acid (0.1 mM) and cyclohexamide were added 15 min and 2 h after the start of translation, respectively.

Microsomes were then resuspended and incubated at 37  degrees C in sucrose buffer containing ATP (lanes 1-5), RRL supplemented with an ATP regeneration system (lanes 6-10), ATP-depleted RRL (lanes 11-15), or ATP-depleted RRL supplemented with additional ATP (lanes 15-20). At specified time points samples were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE. In the presence of buffer alone, or in ATP-depleted RRL,  > 70% of full-length CFTR remained intact after 4 h of incubation (Fig. 2B). However, when microsomal membranes were incubated in fresh RRL containing ATP, or in ATP-depleted RRL supplemented with additional ATP, full-length CFTR was rapidly converted into the HMW complex (T1/2  <  30 min) that subsequently disappeared over the next 4 h. These results are consistent with a two-step process in which full-length CFTR is initially converted into a HMW complex via an ATP-dependent mechanism, and the HMW complex is then a substrate for degradation..

0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	30	The CFTR HMW Complex Is Polyubiquitinated-- We noted that degradation of the CFTR HMW complex in Fig. 2 contrasted with results in Fig. 1B where the complex accumulated over time. One difference between these two experiments is that CFTR translation is performed in the presence of hemin, a required co-factor for protein expression in RRL (38), and aurin tricarboxylic acid, an inhibitor of protein synthesis initiation. Both of these compounds inhibit ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated substrates in RRL. These results, together with the requirement for ATP and cytosol, suggested that the HMW complex might represent polyubiquitinated CFTR. Microsomal membranes containing newly synthesized CFTR were therefore incubated in fresh RRL supplemented with bovine ubiquitin and 40  microM hemin. Aliquots were then immunoprecipitated with anti-bovine ubiquitin antisera and analyzed by SDS-PAGE at specified time points. As shown in Fig. 3A, the HMW complex, but not full-length CFTR, was reactive against anti-ubiquitin antisera (lanes 11-15). No reactivity was observed when immunoprecipitation was performed with nonimmune sera (NIS, lanes 6-10) or when bovine ubiquitin was omitted from the lysate (data not shown). To further confirm CFTR ubiquitination, microsomes containing newly synthesized CFTR were incubated in RRL in the presence of methylated ubiquitin, which blocks the sequential addition of ubiquitin molecules by preventing isopeptide bond formation at ubiquitin residue Lys-48. Under these conditions we observed a dose-dependent inhibition in the rate of HMW complex formation (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the sequential, covalent addition of multiple ubiquitin molecules contributes to the formation of the CFTR HMW complex..

Inhibitors of serine, cysteine, and metalloproteases had essentially no effect on the rate of disappearance of either full-length CFTR or the HMW complex (Fig. 4A). In contrast, hemin and MG132, both known inhibitors of the proteasome, resulted in significant delay in the disappearance of the HMW complex particularly at early time points (Fig. 4B). Quantitation of autoradiograms revealed that hemin effectively blocked 60% of HMW complex degradation. In contrast, MG132, ALLN, and TPCK slowed but did not prevent HMW complex disappearance. Surprisingly, little inhibition was observed for lactacystin or TLCK. These results suggested either that certain proteasome inhibitors might be relatively inactive in the RRL system, or alternatively, that degradation of ubiquitinated CFTR might involve additional protease activities. To distinguish between these possibilities, we therefore examined the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the degradation of methylated lysozyme, a known substrate of the 26 S proteasome. For these and subsequent experiments the rate and extent of protein degradation was quantitated by measuring the conversion of CFTR and/or lysozyme into trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptide fragments..

Microsomal membranes containing newly synthesized CFTR were collected and incubated in RRL in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture consisting of 500  microM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 150 nM aprotinin, 1  microM E-64, 0.5 mM EDTA and 1  microM leupeptin (A) or in individual proteasome inhibitors at the indicated concentrations (B). At each time point, aliquots were mixed directly with SDS loading buffer and analyzed by PAGE. C, CFTR and the HMW complex were quantitated at each time point by densitometry, normalized to the amount of CFTR present at T = 0, and plotted as a function of time. Data shown are representative of results from multiple experiments..
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	36	As shown in Fig. 5, 26% of [14C]lysozyme and 65% of newly synthesized CFTR were degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptide fragments within 3 h in RRL. Lysozyme degradation was inhibited by approximately 90% in the presence of 40  microM hemin or 10 mM EDTA consistent with previous studies (39). Hemin also resulted in formation of a HMW complex containing [14C]lysozyme (data not shown). In contrast, the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, as well as its active metabolite clasto-lactacystin -lactone, had little effect on lysozyme degradation ( < 10% inhibition). Under these same conditions CFTR degradation was inhibited by approximately 80% in the presence of EDTA or the ATP hydrolyzing enzyme, apyrase. Hemin inhibited CFTR degradation by 56%, while lactacystin and clasto-lactacystin -lactone inhibited CFTR degradation by only 20 and 35%, respectively. In these latter experiments, lactacystin-based inhibitors were preincubated with RRL for 30-60 min prior to addition of CFTR-containing microsomal membranes. These experiments demonstrate that specific lactacystin-based proteasome inhibitors are relatively inactive at blocking degradation of these ubiquitinated substrates in RRL. It should also be noted that a significant amount of CFTR degradation in RRL (35-40%) appears to proceed through a hemin insensitive pathway distinct from that utilized by lysozyme..

Hemin (40  microM), EDTA (10 mM), or apyrase (0.1 unit/ microl) was added at T = 0 as indicated. Lactacystin (100  microM) or clasto-lactacystin -lactone (100  microM) were preincubated with RRL for 30-60 min prior to assembling the reaction. Aliquots were precipitated in 20% trichloroacetic acid, and soluble counts were calculated by the following formula: % counts released = (Cn  C0)/(T  C0), where Cn = soluble counts at each time point, C0 = soluble counts at T = 0, and T = total counts per aliquot. Results represent the average ( plus or minus S.E.) of two to six separate experiments..
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	38	Ubiquitinated CFTR Remains Tightly Associated with the ER Membrane-- Sixty-five percent of in vitro synthesized CFTR protein was degraded to trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments within 3 h of incubation in RRL (Fig. 5). Degradation could not be restricted solely to large cytosolic peptide loops (i.e. N terminus, nucleotide binding domains, and the R-domain), as these loops contain only 47% of total methionine residues (40). Rather, our data indicate that proteolytic machinery also gains access to small cytosolic loops and possibly lumenal and/or transmembrane regions of the protein. Thus prior to or coincident with degradation, some or all of CFTR is likely to be extracted from the membrane. We therefore tested whether the ubiquitinated HMW complex, which has already been targeted for degradation by ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, might undergo retrograde translocation to a cytosolic intermediate. Ubiquitinated CFTR complexes were generated by incubation in RRL (in the presence of hemin), and vesicles were collected by pelleting through a sucrose cushion. As shown in Fig. 6A, both CFTR and the CFTR HMW complex were nearly quantitatively recovered in the microsome pellet in the absence of detergent. In addition, preincubation of CFTR-containing microsomes in high salt (up to 1.1 M KCl) failed to extract full-length CFTR or the HMW complex into the supernatant fraction (Fig. 6B). Thus ubiquitinated CFTR does not behave as a cytosolic or peripheral membrane protein..

0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	40	Results from Fig. 6 do not rule out the possibility that HMW ubiquitinated CFTR might also be pelleted as a large, detergent-sensitive protein complex. We therefore tested whether the HMW complex was physically associated with the ER by membrane floatation. Aliquots of RRL containing newly synthesized CFTR and/or polyubiquitinated CFTR were diluted into 2 M sucrose, layered beneath a discontinuous sucrose gradient, and centrifuged for 2 h as described under "Experimental Procedures" (Fig. 7A). For half of the samples, ribosomes were first stripped from membranes by incubation in KCl/EDTA (Fig. 7B). The secretory protein bovine prolactin (41) was used as a standard to determine the location of microsomal membranes in the gradient. Both full-length CFTR and the polyubiquitinated complex exhibited the same floatation pattern as the secretory control. Thus in the absence of degradation, CFTR remained membrane-associated long after ubiquitination had occurred. Following ribosome stripping with EDTA/KCl microsomes more uniformly partitioned into the lighter fractions. However ribosome removal had no detectable effect on dislocation of ubiquitinated CFTR from the ER membrane..

Vesicles were isolated at sequential time points, reincubated in the presence or absence of fresh RRL, and degradation of CFTR was monitored by release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts. As shown in Fig. 8A, 70% of total CFTR was degraded into trichloroacetic acid soluble counts following 3 h incubation in ATP-containing RRL. When vesicles were collected after 20 min of preincubation in hemin-containing RRL and resuspended in fresh RRL lacking hemin, 56% of the total CFTR was subsequently degraded. This degradation remained sensitive to both hemin and EDTA. Incubation of CFTR in hemin-containing RRL for longer periods of time (i.e. 1-2 h) resulted in the near complete conversion (~90%) of full-length protein into the HMW complex as in prior experiments (data not shown). Even after 2 h of preincubation, 57% of total CFTR protein was still able to be degraded upon removal of hemin. In each of these experiments, the degradation of polyubiquitinated CFTR was thus 80% as efficient as the degradation of newly synthesized protein. Furthermore, with longer preincubation times the reversible component of CFTR degradation became progressively more sensitive to inhibition such that after 2 h of preincubation, hemin and EDTA each blocked degradation of polyubiquitinated CFTR by approximately 90%. When microsomes containing pre-ubiquitinated CFTR were similarly resuspended and incubated in the presence of buffer alone (Fig. 8B), no degradation of the HMW polyubiquitinated CFTR was observed..

0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	45	Together these results demonstrate that: (i) the inhibitory effects of hemin on CFTR degradation are reversible, (ii) most, but not all, of the membrane-bound ubiquitinated CFTR remains a substrate for degradation, (iii) CFTR degradation, like ubiquitination, requires the presence of both ATP and cytosolic factors, and (iv) degradation is physically localized to the ER membrane and likely occurs coincident with removal of at least a portion of CFTR from the lipid bilayer.     DISCUSSION.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	46	The ER is a primary site of cellular quality control involved in the recognition and disposal of misfolded and unassembled proteins (5). While it was initially proposed that ER proteases were responsible for degrading ER substrates, recent evidence indicates that ERAD is mediated largely by cytosolic proteases including the 26 S proteasome (6, 7). This topologic disparity between substrate and degradation machinery has resulted in a reevaluation of protein movement into and out of the ER compartment (6). It now appears that translocation across the ER membrane is a bidirectional process that is regulated, in part, by the folded state of a given protein substrate. Whereas, nascent secretory and transmembrane proteins are targeted to, translocated across, and/or integrated into the ER membrane by ER translocation machinery (2, 42), proteins that fail to fold properly may also be recognized by ER quality control machinery and transported out of the ER and back to the cytosol (6, 9, 10, 15). These observations have raised important questions regarding the process of retrograde transport across the ER membrane. At what stage of biogenesis are protein substrates identified? How do recognition events target proteins back to the translocon and/or facilitate movement into the cytosol? And how is this retrograde transport coupled to the process of degradation? In the current study, we address these issues by developing an in vitro system that reconstitutes de novo synthesis and ER-associated degradation of the polytopic protein CFTR. Full-length, glycosylated and membrane-integrated CFTR was a substrate for ATP-dependent ubiquitination. In addition, polyubiquitinated CFTR remained tightly associated with the ER membrane until it was degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptide fragments. Thus ubiquitination precedes retrograde translocation, and degradation of polytopic proteins such as CFTR is physically localized to the ER membrane rather than the cytosol as proposed for some secretory and transmembrane substrates (8, 10, 13)..

0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	48	Our results are consistent with a model in which CFTR degradation is tightly coupled to removal of the polypeptide from the lipid bilayer. At least 65% of [35S]methionine-labeled CFTR was degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments, consistent with proteasomal degradation in which the resulting polypeptides are 6-9 residues in length (43). Because a small fraction of full-length CFTR (approximately 10-15%) remained intact in nearly all experiments, the extent of degradation for individual CFTR polypeptides actually approached 80%. Thus CFTR degradation could not be limited to large cytosolic regions containing the N terminus, nucleotide binding domains, and R domain, which together comprise 61% of the total mass but only 47% of methionine residues (40). If all cytosolic loops within 8-15 residues from the membrane were cleaved, then degradation of all full-length CFTR polypeptide chains would liberate only 60% total CFTR methionine into the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction (40). It therefore seems likely that proteolytic machinery such as the proteasome might participate in removal of CFTR from the lipid bilayer to gain access to transmembrane segments and/or lumenal peptide regions. This possibility is supported by the observation that: (i) proteasome-like particles are physically localized to the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane (44) and (ii) our results that CFTR degradation occurs via a membrane-bound, rather than cytosolic, intermediate. If retrograde translocation of CFTR occurred through the Sec61 translocon, then extraction from the lipid bilayer could potentially involve the reverse process of membrane integration, namely lateral movement of TM segments from the membrane back into the translocation channel and into the cytosol (45, 46)..

Lactacystin and clasto-lactacystin -lactone, which covalently inactivate the active site threonine residue on the 5 subunit of the 20 S proteasome (subunit X of the mammalian proteasome) (47, 48), had relatively minor effects on CFTR degradation as determined either by disappearance of the CFTR HMW complex (Fig. 4) or generation of trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments (Fig. 5). It is interesting that clasto-lactacystin -lactone, the active form of lactacystin, is inactivated by glutathione in cells (49, 50). Our observation that neither lactacystin nor its -lactone form inhibited the degradation of lysozyme, a known proteasome substrate, suggests that RRL is capable of rendering these agents inactive, even when preincubated in the absence of exogenous reducing agents. We do not know why the results reported here differ from those of Qu et al. (51) that demonstrated 20  microM lactacystin inhibited the degradation of both 1-antitrypsin and lysozyme in a similar RRL system. However, our results were consistent for two different preparations of lactacystin and at multiple inhibitor concentrations up to 100  microM. It is possible that these differences reflect varying amounts of proteasome in different RRL preparations..

0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	52	The most potent inhibitors of CFTR degradation were EDTA, apyrase, and hemin. EDTA and hemin have been shown previously to inhibit the degradation of other proteasome substrates in RRL by stabilizing HMW ubiquitin conjugates (39, 52, 53). Hemin, a heme precursor, exerts pleiotropic effects in RRL. Its stimulatory effect on protein translation (38) is proposed to be mediated by inactivation of the translation factor eif-2, possibly by inhibiting an endogenous RRL kinase (54, 55). In addition, hemin directly inhibits ATPase activities of the purified 19 S proteasome regulatory complex (PA700) as well as the 26 S proteasome itself (56). Because the catalytic core of the 20 S proteasome cannot accommodate folded or ubiquitinated polypeptides, it has been proposed that ATPases contained within the 19 S regulatory subunit are required for substrate unfolding as well as deubiquitination (43, 48, 56-59). It is therefore likely that hemin inhibits proteasome-mediated CFTR degradation by blocking ATPase activity and thereby preventing CFTR unfolding and/or deubiquitination. If CFTR unfolding were required for removal from the bilayer, such a mechanism would explain the accumulation of membrane-bound, polyubiquitinated CFTR observed in the current study..

One such candidate is signal peptidase complex, an ER-localized protease that is capable of cleaving transmembrane proteins (61) and free signal peptides (30) at sites located within the plane of the lipid bilayer. Interestingly, CFTR contains cryptic signal peptidase cleavage sites within or adjacent to TM segments of the N terminus hydrophobic domain (62, 63). If similar proteases facilitated CFTR degradation, then TM segments and small peptide loops could potentially be released from the membrane. Such a mechanism might explain why a significant amount of CFTR degradation was ATP-independent and hemin insensitive. It is also possible that the membrane-bound HMW complex might actually consist of polyubiquitinated CFTR cleavage products that are then degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway..

Processing in the RRL system is limited to early events that occur at the ER membrane, and it is possible that CFTR might require specialized cellular components that are limiting in RRL and/or canine pancreas microsomes. Recently, RRL and yeast-derived cell-free systems have been used to examine the degradation of other secretory and transmembrane proteins (8, 51), including CFTR (31). Our observation that 85-90% of newly synthesized wild type CFTR is degraded in the RRL system is consistent with studies that demonstrate most wild type CFTR is also degraded in the ER membrane of intact cells (22, 23). In addition, preliminary experiments in our laboratory have demonstrated that other polytopic proteins expressed in the RRL system, such as human P-glycoprotein and aquaporin water channels, are much more stable than CFTR.2 These studies indicate that rapid CFTR degradation in vitro is not simply a cell free artifact, but rather reflects specific structural features recognized by ER quality control machinery. In vitro systems such as RRL will thus likely provide a versatile tool for investigating the events and cellular machinery involved in ER-associated degradation. In the case of CFTR, they may also provide screening assays to identify compounds that improve folding and trafficking efficiency.     ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	2	THE STUDY by van Heeckeren and colleagues, one of the current articles in focus (Ref. 20, see p. L717 in this issue), addresses the question of whether adenoviral delivery of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to the cystic fibrosis airways attenuates inflammation and mortality associated with a chronic bacterial infection. This is an intriguing question because adenoviral vectors themselves can invoke a substantial immune response that prohibits their repeated administration to the lung (2). In their article, van Heeckeren and coworkers report that, within the infected cystic fibrosis lung, CFTR expression and/or adenoviral vector-induced inflammation yields a significant survival advantage. This promising observation may have profound implications for the utility of adenoviral vectors in the gene therapy treatment of cystic fibrosis..
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	3	CFTR mutations and cystic fibrosis lung pathophysiology. Cystic fibrosis is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population, with a frequency of 1 in 2,500 live births. It is caused by defective function of the cftr gene product (14), which encodes a 170- to 180-kDa protein that functions as a cAMP-regulated chloride channel. The CFTR protein is expressed normally in those tissues affected in cystic fibrosis, including airway submucosal glands and airway epithelial cells. The cystic fibrosis respiratory disease phenotype includes thick mucus secretion and bacterial colonization of the lung with a select few bacterial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13). Repeated P. aeruginosa infections compounded by an inability to clear this organism result in a profound neutrophil migration into the airways and secretion of a variety of inflammatory mediators, including neutrophil elastase, reactive oxygen species, and inflammatory cytokines, which cause irreversible damage to the airways and gas-exchange components..

0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	5	Cystic fibrosis and adenoviral vector-mediated gene therapy. Correction of the defective cftr gene in vivo has long been the holy grail of the cystic fibrosis research community. The use of adenoviral vectors in this pursuit has been problematic (reviewed in Ref. 2). In early clinical trials, the administration of adenoviral vectors encoding CFTR demonstrated great promise, with transient correction of chloride transport defects. Subsequent studies, however, failed to repeat this initial finding and, moreover, revealed that adenoviral vector-mediated delivery of CFTR to the cystic fibrosis airways was limited by the local immune response associated with multiple vector administrations. Similarly, van Heeckeren and colleagues (19) reported previously that P. aeruginosa-induced bronchopulmonary inflammation also limited the efficacy of adenoviral vector-mediated gene transfer. Despite this limitation, several studies suggest that the extent of CFTR correction required for a normal lung phenotype may be quite low (2), thereby validating the use of adenoviral vectors in cystic fibrosis gene therapy..

0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	7	Until the current study by van Heeckeren et al. (20), the impact of adenoviral vector-mediated gene therapy had not been examined in the context of a cystic fibrosis lung chronically infected with bacteria (19). In this ambitious study by van Heeckeren and coworkers (20), the authors determined whether CFTR delivery improved the outcome of a cystic fibrosis murine model infected with P. aeruginosa. Specifically, the authors reported that gut-corrected cystic fibrosis mice treated with an adenoviral vector encoding CFTR and inoculated with P. aeruginosa-laden agarose beads exhibited a significantly greater cumulative 10-day survival compared with sucrose controls; survival of empty vector controls, however, was not significantly different. Importantly, these authors observed that there were no differences between mice receiving the CFTR vector or controls with regard to the extent of lung inflammation. From these data, the authors concluded that the observed survival advantage in mice receiving adenoviral delivery of CFTR to the cystic fibrosis lung may be due to CFTR expression and/or proinflammatory effects of the adenoviral vector..

0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	9	CFTR expression vs. adenoviral vector-induced inflammation. Because cumulative 10-day survival was not significantly different between mice receiving CFTR-encoding vectors vs. empty vector controls, it is likely that CFTR expression plays a small role in this response. As the authors note (20), it is possible that the administration of an adenoviral vector may have induced a protective immune response that improved cumulative survival. In support of this possibility, the authors observed a persistent lung lymphocytosis in response to adenoviral vector administration; this response was further enhanced upon challenge with P. aeruginosa-laden agarose beads. Interestingly, the authors did not observe increased bacterial killing in mice treated with either the CFTR-encoding adenoviral vector or the empty vector control..
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	10	Early studies by Markham and coworkers (8, 12) suggest that T cell-mediated immune responses are protective against P. aeruginosa infections. For example, these authors have shown that adoptive transfer of T cells from mice immunized with P. aeruginosa to granulocytopenic mice resulted in nearly 100% survival upon challenge with P. aeruginosa (12). Similar findings have been reported by others (3). Despite these reports, the exact nature of T cell-mediated immunity in P. aeruginosa infections remains unclear. Hoiby and colleagues have reported that, in a rat model of P. aeruginosa pnuemonia (4) and in cystic fibrosis patients (11), chronic P. aeruginosa infection induces a T helper type 2 (Th2)-like response. Th2 responses are characterized by the production of IL-4 and IL-5 and are important in the generation of humoral immunity. These results are further supported by their observation that chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection is more severe in a Th2 responding mouse strain (BALB/c) (10). With regard to protective T cell immunity, Hoiby and coworkers (4, 5, 9) have demonstrated that induction of a Th1-dominated cytokine response improves the outcome of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection. Th1 responses are characterized by the production of IFN- and are instrumental in the generation of cell-mediated immunity. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that adenoviral vector administration can trigger a Th1 response in the lungs of mice (18, 21) and humans (1). In light of these findings, it is tempting to conclude that the improved cumulative survival observed in the van Heeckeren study (20) is a function of an adenovirus-induced Th1 response; however, this conclusion may be too simplistic..
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	11	Several recent studies call into question the beneficial nature of a Th1 response in P. aeruginosa infections. Reports examining the role of the virulence factor alginate (17) and the quorum-sensing molecule N-(3-oxododecanoyl)homoserine lactone (16) in P. aeruginosa pathogenicity indicate that each of these factors induces a Th1-predominated immune response that may contribute to P. aeruginosa pathogenesis. Moreover, Schultz and colleagues (15) have reported recently that, in a rat model of P. aeruginosa pneumonia, endogenous IFN- impairs bacterial clearance and host defense. Clearly, differences in the strain of P. aeruginosa (nonmucoid vs. mucoid), type of infection (acute vs. chronic), route of administration, and model system of analysis must be taken into account when considering the role of Th1/Th2 responses in P. aeruginosa infections..
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	12	Despite the ongoing debate of T cell responses in P. aeruginosa infections, it should be noted that these studies were performed in non-cystic fibrosis model systems. Because recent evidence indicates that T cell responses may be dysregulated in cystic fibrosis (6, 7), such studies need to be performed in the context of the cystic fibrosis lung. This is underscored by the van Heeckeren study (20), which suggests that adenoviral vector-induced inflammation may promote survival of cystic fibrosis mice during a chronic P. aeruginosa infection. As with all well-conceived studies, this study precipitates a number of unanswered questions. For example, in the absence of P. aeruginosa infection, does the nature of the inflammatory response differ between mice receiving an adenoviral vector encoding CFTR vs. empty vector controls? Does CFTR play a role in the T cell immune responses triggered by P. aeruginosa infection? How does the hyperimmune response of the cystic fibrosis lung contribute to adenoviral vector- or P. aeruginosa-mediated inflammation? Future studies examining immune responses triggered upon adenoviral vector administration of the P. aeruginosa-infected cystic fibrosis airways should provide new and important information regarding the utility of adenoviral vectors in cystic fibrosis-related gene therapy..

The goal of this review is to summarize data related to regulation of the protein product of the CF gene, CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), by a variety of small molecules. There has been a surge of interest in discovering small molecules that could be exogenously added to cells and tissues to regulate CFTR and could potentially be used alone or in combination with genetic approaches for therapy in CF. We will discuss the apparent mechanisms of action of genistein, milrinone, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, IBMX, and NS-004; several of which appear to interact directly with one or both nucleotide binding domains of CFTR. We also discuss how HCO3 interacts with CFTR as both a permeating anion and a potential regulator of Cl permeation through the CFTR ion channel. It is likely that there are complicated interactions between Cl and HCO3 in the secretion of both ions through the CFTR and the anion exchanger in intestinal cells, and these may yield a role of CFTR in regulation of intestinal HCO3 secretion as well as of intra- and extracellular pH..

0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	8	CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) is the most common fatal genetic disease of the Caucasian population, with an incidence of 1 in 2,500 live births and a carrier frequency of ~1 in 25. The disease is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (30), which functions as a cAMP-activated Cl channel. At the cellular level, CFTR dysfunction results in defective cAMP-regulated Cl conductance, primarily in cells of epithelial origin (27). Although lung disease is the primary cause of mortality in CF patients, a significant proportion of the morbidity can be directly attributed to gastrointestinal complications. The duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon express high levels of CFTR mRNA (30). Immunocytochemical analysis also demonstrated high CFTR protein expression at the luminal surfaces along the intestine (7). The small intestine of CF patients exhibits decreased Cl and fluid secretion that results in meconium ileus (lower water content and higher viscosity compared with non-CF patients) in ~10% of all CF newborns and accumulation of mucus and intestinal obstructions [primarily in ileocecum and large intestine in  > 20% of adult patients (see Ref. 13)]. Intestinal pathophysiology appears to be the hallmark of recently developed transgenic CF mouse models. The ileocecum and large intestine appear to be the most common sites of intestinal blockade, whereas jejunal obstructions occur less frequently (13)..

This secretion is controlled by multiple hormones and nerve cell transmitters, which will couple to the activation of CFTR as well as the other ion channels and transporters that are required to generate transepithelial secretion. Phosphorylation of CFTR by protein kinases (PK) and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases (PP) is considered the major way by which CFTR Cl channel activity is physiologically regulated. In addition, the normal gating cycle (both opening and closing) of CFTR requires ATP binding and hydrolysis at the two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) of CFTR (see Ref. 11). ATP concentration is likely maintained constant in cells and is therefore not a significant physiological regulator..

This has been a controversial area of research. Most secretory epithelia secrete both Cl and HCO3, and CFTR seems to be involved in a critical way that is still poorly understood. We will discuss data relevant to the question of whether the key role of CFTR is to conduct HCO3 itself or to play some sort of permissive role in HCO3 secretion through an adjacent anion exchanger that requires Cl at the cell's luminal aspect to exchange for cellular HCO3. Alternatively, CFTR could also be required to keep cellular Cl concentration low enough that Cl enters the cell on the exchanger and exchanges for cellular HCO3. We will also discuss the possibility that HCO3 may regulate the activity of CFTR by altering the permeation of Cl due to the multi-ion pore behavior of CFTR..

0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	18	Genistein. Genistein is a member of the large class of naturally occurring flavonoids. Some flavonoids are more potent than genistein in activating CFTR (19), but we will focus on genistein because it has been investigated the most thoroughly. Genistein is a potent activator of CFTR (e.g., Ref. 20, 22), but the activating mechanism has been debated. Genistein did not seem to operate through activation of protein kinase A (PKA), PKC, or PKG, because there were no increases in intracellular cAMP, Ca2+, or cGMP concentrations (21, 32). Genistein is a well-known tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor, and two other PTK inhibitors (tyrphostin 47 and tyrphostin B42) also stimulated CFTR, and genistein-stimulated channel activity was blocked by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate (21, 32). However, several other PTK inhibitors (tyrphostin A23, tyrphostin A51, erbstatin analog, and herbimycin) failed to stimulate CFTR (20). Genistein also stimulated CFTR equally well when GTP (a poor substrate for tyrosine kinases) was used as a replacement for ATP (10). Some results suggested that genistein activated CFTR by blocking a PP: inactivation rates of CFTR currents on cAMP removal were markedly decreased by genistein (20), and CFTR was phosphorylated on the same amino acids by both genistein (which did not raise cAMP concentration) and forskolin (which did) (29)..
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	19	More recent data have indicated that the most likely explanation for the stimulatory effect of genistein was through direct binding to an NBD of phosphorylated CFTR. Genistein did not directly open CFTR channels, because genistein did not stimulate CFTR in ATP- or cAMP-depleted monolayers (22). Similarly, genistein activation of CFTR in excised patches required both ATP and prior phosphorylation by PKA (10). In addition, genistein stimulated phosphatase-resistant, thiophosphorylated CFTR, even in the presence of PKI (to block PKA) or VO4 (to block PP) (10, 39). Kinetic analysis indicated that a genistein concentration of  < 35  microM induced prolonged openings of CFTR (similar to the effect of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog), whereas a genistein concentration of  > 35  microM caused prolonged closed times (38)..

0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	21	An attractive model for stimulatory and inhibitory effects of genistein on CFTR is that of Gadsby et al. (11) for CFTR gating. This model (11) proposes that ATP binding and hydrolysis at NBD1 control channel opening and closing at low phosphorylation levels, and once ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 has opened a highly phosphorylated CFTR channel, ATP binding to NBD2 can stabilize the open state. Hydrolysis of the nucleotide at NBD2 terminates the stabilization. Agents that interfere with ATP hydrolysis at NBD2 [e.g., 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) or pyrophosphate] induce prolonged burst opening. Genistein is a competitive inhibitor with ATP for binding to PTK (inhibitor constant, 13.7  microM) and to other ATP-binding proteins, and crystal structure analysis of the Src family tyrosine kinase Hck revealed that the structurally related flavone and CFTR activator quercetin (19) localized to the binding site for the adenine ring of AMP-PNP or ATP (34). When considering the sequence homology shared by Walker A-type-binding motifs of PTK and NBDs of CFTR, it therefore seems possible that genistein competes for ATP-binding sites on CFTR, possibly at NBD2 (10), thereby slowing down ATP hydrolysis and preventing CFTR channel closure. It is unlikely that genistein activates CFTR by binding to a Src kinase, because this would require activation of a tyrosine kinase and genistein blocks tyrosine kinases. It might also be proposed that higher concentrations of genistein inhibit CFTR by competing with ATP at NBD1 (which may have a lower affinity for genistein binding) and prevent CFTR from opening..
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	22	NS-004. The substituted benzimidazolone NS-004 has effects that are quite similar to those exhibited by genistein. NS-004 activated CFTR (at 0.1 to 1  microM) and F508-CFTR (at  > 10  microM) without raising cAMP concentration and also in the presence of a PKA inhibitor (12), but it was necessary to pretreat cells with forskolin before patch excision to observe CFTR channel activation by NS-004. In addition, the drug caused active CFTR channels to increase their activity, but it had no effect when added after channel rundown, indicating that NS-004 required phosphorylated CFTR. NS-004 did not inhibit in vitro PP activity. Thus, although NS-004 was thought to operate by directly opening CFTR (12), the drug may use a mechanism similar to that of genistein to increase open probabilities of phosphorylated, active channels without affecting either PK or PP..
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	23	Milrinone. The cardiotonic drug milrinone is an inhibitor of cGMP-inhibited PDE (a class III PDE) and was selected from several drugs inhibiting PDE isozymes (23). Because PDE inhibitors raise cellular cAMP concentration and CFTR is activated by increases in cAMP concentration, it has been assumed that milrinone (and also IBMX, see below) stimulate CFTR by raising cAMP. However, the exact mechanisms have not been determined. Milrinone activated both normal and F508-CFTR in transformed nasal epithelial cells (24), and a combination of forskolin and milrinone (but not milrinone alone) increased the potential difference across nasal epithelium of F508-CFTR mice in vivo but not in transgenic mice lacking CFTR (24). Milrinone activated CFTR even when cells had been maximally stimulated with forskolin or some other cAMP agonist, indicating that the drug likely had other effects than to stimulate production of cAMP..
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	24	IBMX, DPCPX, and other xanthine derivatives. IBMX is an inhibitor of PDE with broad specificity. Despite its broad use as a PDE inhibitor, it seems unlikely that IBMX works solely via this mechanism. IBMX activated CFTR even when cells had been maximally stimulated with forskolin or some other cAMP agonist (23). Although other substituted xanthine derivatives activated CFTR, there was no correlation between effects on CFTR and cellular cAMP and ATP concentrations (4). We have also found, through use of a fluorescence assay for PKA activity (as opposed to measurements of cAMP concentration using RIA), that forskolin caused fibroblasts to raise cAMP concentration to such a high level that PKA activity was saturated (by maximally binding cAMP), and IBMX (which indeed raised cAMP concentration) had no further effect to increase PKA activity (B. Eckert and T. E. Machen, unpublished observations). It therefore seems likely that the stimulatory effects of IBMX on CFTR are due to combined effects to raise cAMP (when PKA has not been saturated) and also to block PP or directly bind to CFTR..

We have also found, through use of a fluorescence assay for PKA activity (as opposed to measurements of cAMP concentration using RIA), that forskolin caused fibroblasts to raise cAMP concentration to such a high level that PKA activity was saturated (by maximally binding cAMP), and IBMX (which indeed raised cAMP concentration) had no further effect to increase PKA activity (B. Eckert and T. E. Machen, unpublished observations). It therefore seems likely that the stimulatory effects of IBMX on CFTR are due to combined effects to raise cAMP (when PKA has not been saturated) and also to block PP or directly bind to CFTR..

DPCPX stimulates F508-CFTR channels in a variety of epithelial and fibroblast cells (8, 15). In some cells, correction of the CF defect by transfection with the CFTR gene rendered the transfected cells insensitive to DPCPX. In contrast, DPCPX stimulated recombinant CFTR channels from HEK cell microsomal membranes incorporated into planar lipid layers (2). The effects of DPCPX seemed not to be due to an effect on A1 receptors, because Northern analysis showed that a DPCPX-sensitive cell line (CFPAC-1) had no A1 receptor mRNA, and another xanthine analog 1,3-diallyl-8-cyclohexylxanthine (DAX) was a potent CFTR activator but a poor A1 adenosine receptor antagonist. Using a rapid membrane filtration assay, Cohen et al. (6) reported that DPCPX bound to NBD1 of F508-CFTR [dissociation constant (Kd) = 1.0 nM] with an affinity 17 times higher than that to NBD1 of wild-type CFTR (Kd = 17.0 nM) with a rank order among different xanthines of DAX  >  DPCPX  >  caffeine  >  DA-DPCPX  >  adenosine  >  >  IBMX  >  2-thio-DPCPX. These results were consistent with a unique binding site for DPCPX and related xanthines on NBD1 of CFTR in the vicinity of F508 (2). DPCPX was ~25-fold more potent than IBMX in potentiating F508-CFTR by a mechanism other than elevation of intracellular cAMP concentration (15). Stimulation of CFTR by DPCPX or DAX required prephosphorylated CFTR (2). Thus DPCPX (and likely all the other xanthines, including IBMX), genistein, and NS-004 all seemed to activate prephosphorylated CFTR by binding directly to CFTR. DPCPX appeared to bind to NBD1 rather than to NBD2, and it also seemed to be more selective for F508-CFTR than wild-type CFTR..

The most common mutation in CF, F508-CFTR, leads to a trafficking-impaired protein that gets degraded in the cell (40). Some mutations lead to trafficking-competent, but misfunctional, proteins (e.g., G551D-CFTR; Ref. 40). It appears that mutants with different misfunctions will need selective treatments. For example, genistein failed to activate F508-CFTR in CF bronchial epithelial cells (22), but addition of genistein and cAMP agonists to NIH/3T3 cells overexpressing F508-CFTR caused a strong, synergistic activation (18). Alternatively, when CF nasal epithelial cells were treated with 4-phenylbutyrate or low temperature to increase expression of F508-CFTR in the membrane (31, 40), genistein was a potent stimulant (9). In addition, the trafficking-competent G551D-CFTR mutant expressed in fibroblasts was stimulated by the combination of genistein and forskolin when forskolin alone was ineffective (9). These data indicate that genistein targets CFTR mutants present in the plasma membrane. Both NS-004 and, especially, DPCPX have also been shown to activate F508-CFTR. IBMX produced a small, CFTR-related secretory response in jejunum, cecum, and rectum from G551D mice but had no effect in the nasal epithelium (36). NS-004 restored near normal channel activity from P574H-CFTR (a mild, trafficking-impaired mutation in NBD1) (3). These results suggest that, in addition to their direct effects on CFTR, these drugs may also have other effects that increase the number of channel proteins found in the membrane. It is also important to remember that there may be tissue-specific effects of the drugs, because epithelial cells will require concomitant activity of basolateral K+ channels to secrete fluid efficiently..

0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	31	Background: Role of CFTR in HCO3 secretion across intestine. HCO3 secretion is a key function that occurs in the stomach, pancreas, and small and large intestine. HCO3 secretion is particularly important in the duodenum to protect the intestinal mucosa against damage from large amounts of acid from the stomach (1). Transepithelial secretion of HCO3 likely involves the concerted activities of an apical anion channel, Cl/HCO3 exchange, HCO3 uptake across the basolateral membrane, and/or production of HCO3 by intracellular carbonic anhydrase activity. The paracellular pathway may also contribute, since a transepithelial gradient for HCO3 favoring secretion occurs. Electrogenic HCO3 secretion is activated by secretagogues that increase intracellular cAMP, cGMP, or Ca2+ concentrations (1), and this HCO3 secretion required the presence of CFTR in all segments of the small intestine in mice (16, 17, 33). However, the specific mechanism(s) involved remains a mystery. With the use of the pH stat method in combination with inhibitors of anion exchange and CFTR, recent work (5) with duodenum from normal and CFTR knockout mice shows that CFTR may have contributed to HCO3 secretion in two ways: directly by conducting HCO3 into the lumen and also indirectly by conducting Cl into the lumen, which could be recycled back into the cell via anion exchange for HCO3. Because CFTR is expressed at highest levels in the crypts (7), electrogenic HCO3 secretion is predicted to occur primarily in this region. In contrast, CFTR is expressed at lower levels and carbonic anhydrase activity is expressed at higher levels in the villus epithelium, so CFTR-coupled Cl/HCO3 exchange activity may be primarily localized to the villus..

0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	33	Does CFTR conduct HCO3? Patch-clamp studies showed that HCO3 was conducted through CFTR in NIH/3T3 cells recombinantly expressing wild-type CFTR (26), with a permeability ratio of Cl to HCO3 of 0.25. Similar measurements have also been presented recently by Linsdell et al. (25), who found a permeability ratio of Cl to HCO3 of 0.14. We also measured CFTR-mediated permeation of HCO3 across the apical membrane of Calu-3 monolayers, and conductance ratios of cAMP-stimulated HCO3 and Cl currents of 0.1-0.27 were obtained (22). Thus HCO3-to-Cl permeability or conductance ratios of CFTR ranged from 0.10 to 0.27. A role of CFTR's function as a HCO3 conductor has also been suggested in CF models using a variety of methods comparing wild-type CFTR-expressing cells with F508-CFTR-expressing CF cells (22, 35) or wild-type with CFTR knockout mice (CFTR /) (5, 13, 17, 33). These reports suggested the possibility that a defect in HCO3 secretion through CFTR may contribute to the pathophysiology of CF pulmonary disease (22, 35). In contrast to these experiments that showed that CFTR conducts HCO3, Quinton and Reddy (28) (P. Quinton, personal communication) showed using microelectrode methods that in intact sweat ducts HCO3 was equally impermeant through CFTR as gluconate. This contradiction remains unresolved..
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	34	Does CFTR contribute to cytosolic and/or extracellular pH regulation? If CFTR is permeant to HCO3, it is expected that it should contribute to movements of HCO3 into and out of the cell and thereby alter pH of the cell or extracellular fluids. In NIH/3T3 cells expressing exogenous CFTR, we showed forskolin-stimulated changes of pH that were absent in cells expressing F508-CFTR (26). Data have also been presented for biliary epithelial cells showing that CFTR may regulate the activity of the anion exchanger and alter cytosolic pH regulatory ability in these cells (14) In contrast, we have recently compared cytosolic pH regulation in CF and CFTR-corrected nasal cells and found no apparent differences (L. Lu, E. Wunderlich, and T. E. Machen, unpublished results). A possible explanation was that these cells expressed Na+/H+ and Cl/HCO3 exchange and Na+-HCO3 cotransport, and these mechanisms were much more prominent than CFTR in regulating cytosolic pH. Thus, in cells that express prominent activity of transporters that regulate cytosolic pH, the conductive pathway for HCO3 across CFTR might be of minor importance for cytosolic pH regulation. However, CFTR might still contribute importantly to the accumulation of HCO3 in the poorly buffered apical/luminal fluid..

It has been well described that thiocyanate (SCN) is highly permeant across CFTR, but when mixtures of Cl and SCN are used, the conductance of CFTR decreases (37). This effect has been interpreted in terms of multi-ion pore behavior of CFTR, i.e., interactions of anions within the pore can lead to anomalous effects. Also, the halide anion I both permeated and blocked CFTR. We have similarly shown that both F and HCO3 added to the apical surface reduced Cl conductance of CFTR in Calu-3 cells (Illek and Machen, unpublished observations). In vivo both Cl and HCO3 are present in the cytosol at similar concentrations, and both are driven by the membrane potential into the pore of CFTR, suggesting that both ions may compete for common binding sites in the permeation path, and thus affect the permeation of each other. This could be particularly important for tissues that secrete large amounts of HCO3..

0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	38	Summary: Role of CFTR in HCO3 secretion. The exact role of CFTR in HCO3 permeation under physiological conditions likely depends on the relative expression of CFTR and other HCO3 channels, HCO3 transporters and paracellular permeability of HCO3. In addition, the cell-to-lumen electrochemical driving forces for Cl and HCO3 will determine ion movements across the luminal cell membrane and tight junctions. CFTR appears to be important both as a HCO3 conductance and also in some way as a direct or indirect regulator of adjacent anion exchange, e.g., as a source of luminal Cl that may exchange for cellular HCO3 and/or as a means of keeping cellular Cl concentration low enough that the anion exchanger operates as an HCO3 secretion mechanism. Many CFTR-expressing epithelia, including the intestine, pancreas, and liver, exhibit different gradients of Cl and HCO3 along the length of the organ, so these relationships will also be affected by the anatomic structures..

We used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a model ERAD substrate, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), to explore whether CFTR is sequestered before degradation, to identify the molecular machinery regulating sequestration, and to analyze the relationship between sequestration and degradation. We report that CFTR is sequestered into ER subdomains containing the chaperone Kar2p, and that sequestration and CFTR degradation are disrupted in sec12ts strain (mutant in guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Sar1p), sec13ts strain (mutant in the Sec13p component of COPII), and sec23ts strain (mutant in the Sec23p component of COPII) grown at restrictive temperature.

Incorrectly folded proteins are targeted for ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD)* and are eliminated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Brodsky and McCracken, 1999). Because proteasomal degradation occurs in the cytoplasm, ERAD substrates must be retrotranslocated from the ER to the cytoplasm before digestion. The cellular machinery involved in the sorting and translocation of ERAD substrates is under active investigation. One of the key requirements is a fully competent early secretory pathway because mutations in proteins involved in ER-Golgi traffic cause disorganization of ER structure and inhibit ERAD (Taxis et al., 2002). The Sec61p/Sec63p translocon (Plemper et al., 1997) and auxiliary proteins Der1p (Knop et al., 1996), Der3p/Hrd1p (Bordallo and Wolf, 1999), and Hrd3 (Hampton et al., 1996) have been shown to be required for retrotranslocation of ERAD substrates. In addition, a subset of molecular chaperones such as calnexin (McCracken and Brodsky, 1996), BiP (Plemper et al., 1997; Nishikawa et al., 2001), Hsp70 (Zhang et al., 2001), and p97 (Rabinovich et al., 2002) participate in selecting ERAD substrates. Evidence indicates that two distinct mechanisms participate in directing different substrates for ERAD (Vashist et al., 2001). Soluble ERAD substrates such as carboxy peptidase Y (CPY), PrA, and KHN require functional transport between the ER and the Golgi (Caldwell et al., 2001; Vashist et al., 2001), and the degradation of these proteins is delayed when ER-Golgi traffic is inhibited in sec18 to 1 and sec12 to 4 strains. Additional components encoded by PER17 (Vashist et al., 2001), ERV14, and ERV29 (Caldwell et al., 2001) appear essential in degradation of soluble ERAD substrates, and appear to function by regulating ER-Golgi transport of specific soluble proteins. In contrast, the degradation of membrane ERAD substrates such as mutant forms of Ste6p, Yor1p, Sec61p, Vph1p, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) seem unaffected by sec18 to 1, sec12 to 4, sec21 to 1, per17 to 1, erv14, or erv29 mutations (Loayza et al., 1998; Katzmann et al., 1999; Caldwell et al., 2001; Kiser et al., 2001; Vashist et al., 2001). These findings suggest that transmembrane ERAD substrates do not enter post-ER compartments of the secretory pathway before degradation. In agreement, soluble ERAD substrates can be detected in post-ER transport vesicles, whereas transmembrane ERAD substrates are excluded (Vashist et al., 2001)..

Soluble ERAD substrates such as carboxy peptidase Y (CPY), PrA, and KHN require functional transport between the ER and the Golgi (Caldwell et al., 2001; Vashist et al., 2001), and the degradation of these proteins is delayed when ER-Golgi traffic is inhibited in sec18 to 1 and sec12 to 4 strains. Additional components encoded by PER17 (Vashist et al., 2001), ERV14, and ERV29 (Caldwell et al., 2001) appear essential in degradation of soluble ERAD substrates, and appear to function by regulating ER-Golgi transport of specific soluble proteins. In contrast, the degradation of membrane ERAD substrates such as mutant forms of Ste6p, Yor1p, Sec61p, Vph1p, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) seem unaffected by sec18 to 1, sec12 to 4, sec21 to 1, per17 to 1, erv14, or erv29 mutations (Loayza et al., 1998; Katzmann et al., 1999; Caldwell et al., 2001; Kiser et al., 2001; Vashist et al., 2001). These findings suggest that transmembrane ERAD substrates do not enter post-ER compartments of the secretory pathway before degradation. In agreement, soluble ERAD substrates can be detected in post-ER transport vesicles, whereas transmembrane ERAD substrates are excluded (Vashist et al., 2001)..
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	9	The exact pathway for degradation of transmembrane ERAD substrates from the ER is unclear, but there is evidence to suggest that at least some retained proteins are sorted into specialized ER subdomains before degradation (Kamhi-Nesher et al., 2001; Kiser et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2001). It is unknown what molecular mechanisms regulate sequestration of ERAD substrates, and whether such sequestration is required for ER retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation. To explore these questions, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mutant strains defective in the Sar1p/COPII sorting machinery and a known ERAD substrate, CFTR, as our model system..

COPII sorting is initiated by Sar1p, a small GTPase (Veldhuisen et al., 1997) that is activated by Sec12p-mediated guanine-nucleotide exchange. Sar1p in its GTP-bound state associates with the ER membrane and recruits the Sec23p/Sec24p to COPII complex and subsequently the Sec13p/Sec31p to COPII complex to the membrane (for review see Barlowe, 2000). The assembly of the COPII coat on ER budding structures is coupled to the selection of transmembrane proteins into the nascent budding structures that will eventually bud from the ER as transport vesicles. COPII function has been examined to date exclusively in the context of secretory traffic..

In mammalian cells, only 20% of newly synthesized wild-type CFTR folds correctly and is transported from the ER to the plasma membrane through the secretory pathway, whereas the remaining 80% of CFTR is degraded from the ER through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Jensen et al., 1995; Ward et al., 1995; Moyer et al., 1998; Riordan, 1999). In mammalian cells, CFTR is not sequestered into ER subdomains before degradation because inhibition of proteasomal activity by chemical inhibitors or overtaxing the proteolytic capacity by overexpressing CFTR leads to retrotranslocation of CFTR from the ER and its accumulation in cytosolic aggresomes (Johnston et al., 1998). In yeast, the majority (if not all) of newly synthesized CFTR is also degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, but in contrast to mammalian cells, CFTR in yeast is not delivered to aggresomes, but appears sequestered in ER subdomains before degradation (Kiser et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2001)..

EGFP-CFTR is not seen in a sample precipitated with anti-F1ss antibody. The mobility of EGFP-CFTR (175 kD) is appropriate for a chimera of EGFP (27 kD) and full-length human CFTR (145 kD)..

Both proteins have been previously shown to be required for degradation of CFTR tagged at the COOH terminus with GFP (Kiser et al., 2001) or HA (Zhang et al., 2001) in yeast. As shown in Fig. 1 B, EGFP-CFTR in wild-type yeast is digested rapidly, with a half-life of 10 to 15 min (Fig. 1 B), slightly more rapidly than previously published (20 min, Kiser et al., 2001; 30 min, Zhang et al., 2001). All CFTR appears to be degraded in yeast (Kiser et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2001), as opposed to mammalian cells where 20% is transported to the plasma membrane. It is possible that yeast does not have sufficient machinery to efficiently fold overexpressed CFTR, or that even correctly folded CFTR is "read" by yeast as defective. In contrast to rapid degradation in wild-type yeast, EGFP-CFTR remains stable in pre1 to 1 mutant yeast even after 90 min of chase, and the half-life of EGFP-CFTR in the ubc6 strain is extended to 40 min.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	24	  We performed immunofluorescence with known organellar markers to localize EGFP-CFTR. As shown in Fig. 2 B, EGFP-CFTR is not detected in small punctate structures containing the late Golgi marker Kex2p (Preuss et al., 1992). This result agrees with findings that CFTR expressed in yeast undergoes ER-type N-glycosylation, but does not undergo Golgi-type oligosaccharide modifications (Kiser et al., 2001). EGFP-CFTR is not detected on the plasma membrane, and does not colocalize with the fluorescent dye FM 4 to 64 (Fig. 2 B) shown to be transported to endosomal (unpublished data) or vacuolar compartments of yeast as a function of incubation time and temperature (Vida and Emr, 1995; the minimal colocalization in the vacuole is due to bleed-through from the strong EGFP-CFTR signal and is not visible in cells without EGFP-CFTR). The lack of vacuolar localization is consistent with lack of degradation of CFTR via the Pep4p/Prb1p vacuolar proteases (Kiser et al., 2001; Gelman et al., 2002)..
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	25	EGFP-CFTR is detected in relatively large punctate structures that contain Kar2p (Fig. 2 B). The punctate Kar2p distribution in EGFP-CFTR to expressing yeast is distinct from its normal cage-like perinuclear localization in control yeast (Paddon et al., 1996). The effects of EGFP-CFTR expression on intracellular morphology were analyzed by electron microscopy of yeast transformed with either empty or EGFP-CFTR to containing plasmids. As shown in Fig. 2 C, normal nuclear membrane and sub to plasma membrane ER structures are evident in the control cell (arrows), in agreement with published images (Zhang et al., 2001). In contrast, EGFP-CFTR cell shows clusters of membranous structures in proximity to the perinuclear ER (arrowheads). Higher magnification shows them to be accumulations of tubular and vesicular elements, morphologically analogous to ER extensions observed in yeast expressing CFTR (Zhang et al., 2001). The relative size of such clusters (average diameter 0.5 to 1  microm) corresponds to the approximate size of the fluorescent Kar2p/EGFP-CFTR puncta. Significantly, membrane amplification induced by CFTR (Zhang et al., 2001) or EGFP-CFTR (this work) is distinct from multi-layered ER "karmellae" induced by expression of HMG-CoA reductase (Koning et al., 1996). Together, the data suggest that EGFP-CFTR localizes to subdomains of the ER network that represent penultimate stations before degradation. The results also imply that sequestration into the ER domains is more efficient than subsequent removal by degradation..

First, we tested the localization of EGFP-CFTR in wild-type, ubc6, and sec18 to 1 yeast strains when grown at 24 degrees C (permissive temperature for strains defective in COPII components) and when grown at 39 degrees C (restrictive temperature for strains defective in COPII components). As shown in Fig. 2 D, EGFP-CFTR in the wild-type strain remains as punctate spots at both temperatures. Similarly, the pattern of EGFP-CFTR in the ubc6 strain defective for proteasomal degradation is analogous to that in the wild-type strain. This strongly suggests that EGFP-CFTR is sorted into the punctate structure and maintained there before it is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation. Our data, together with the finding that CFTR remains sequestered in Kar2p-containing subdomains in yeast strain (pre1 to 1pre2 to 2) defective for proteasomal degradation (Zhang et al., 2001), suggest that the catalytic activity of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc6p is not sufficient to remove EGFP-CFTR from ER subdomains, and that ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are tightly coupled. The same punctate EGFP-CFTR pattern is observed in sec18 to 1 strain grown at either temperature, indicating that block in vesicular fusion during ER-Golgi protein transport does not significantly affect EGFP-CFTR sequestration..

In wild-type strain, EGFP-CFTR is degraded rapidly at both temperatures, with a half-life of 10 to 15 min (Fig. 3 A).

In contrast, the degradation rate is delayed significantly when the yeast is shifted to the restrictive temperature, with the half-life extending to 40 to 45 min, a threefold increase compared with the permissive temperature. The temperature-sensitive strains sec23 to 1ts and sec13 to 1ts (Salama et al., 1997) are defective at the restrictive temperature due to an S382L mutation (Yoshihisa et al., 1993), and a mutation that has not yet been identified, respectively.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	34	  It must be stressed that EGFP-CFTR, like other transmembrane ERAD substrates, does not enter the ER-Golgi recycling degradative pathway. Like the previously characterized CFTR (Kiser et al., 2001), EGFP-CFTR is degraded with normal kinetics at permissive and restrictive temperatures in a sec18 to 1 strain (Fig. 3 E). The strain is defective in Sec18p function, as shown by a block in maturation of the vacuolar CPY at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 3 E). Together, the results indicate that ER-Golgi transport and recycling are not required for EGFP-CFTR degradation. Our findings suggest a novel role for the Sar1p/COPII sorting machinery. In addition to selecting correctly folded substrates into the forward secretory pathway (Schekman and Orci, 1996; Bannykh et al., 2000) and selecting misfolded soluble ERAD substrates for the ER-Golgi recycling degradative pathway (Vashist et al., 2001), Sar1p/COPII also sorts misfolded substrates into subdomains of the ER from which they are subsequently degraded. How does the same machinery sort proteins into three distinct pathways? A common sorting mechanism for both correctly folded and misfolded membrane proteins presents a spatial problem because these classes must occupy distinct regions of the ER. It is likely that additional targeting mechanisms coordinate with Sar1p/COPII to direct the proteins to ER exit or retention. It appears that a primary distinction is made at the level of packaging into COPII vesicles; although correctly folded soluble and transmembrane proteins for secretory traffic and misfolded soluble ERAD substrates for ER-Golgi recycling degradative traffic are sorted into COPII vesicles, misfolded transmembrane ERAD substrates are excluded (Vashist et al., 2001). There is evidence that transmembrane ERAD substrates are prevented from entry into COPII vesicles and are retained in the ER through the action of luminal ER proteins. For example, mutants of the transmembrane ATPase Pma1p appear to be retained and degraded in the ER through the action of a protein disulfide isomerase to related protein, Eps1p (Wang and Chang, 1999). Similarly, the retention of a transmembrane H2a precursor in the ER is determined by a pentapeptide sequence present on the luminal side of the ER (Shenkman et al., 1997). In addition, ERAD substrates can be retained by binding to calnexin. It has been shown that calnexin binds to wild-type and folding compromised F508CFTR in the ER, but the association with F508CFTR is prolonged and might facilitate ER retention (Pind et al., 1994). ERAD substrates can be also retained by association with the translocon (Loayza et al., 1998; Kamhi-Nesher et al., 2001). Cytoplasmic chaperones may also participate in ER retention (Brodsky et al., 1999). The finding that strains inactivated in the cytosolic Hsp70 Ssa1p do not sort CFTR into ER subdomains supports the view that ER sequestration requires the coordinate action of Sar1p/COPII and accessory factors..

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	36	That Sar1p/COPII is likely to participate in the secretory and the degradative pathways is supported by data obtained from whole genome microarray analysis where many genes involved in secretory traffic were found to be UPR targets (Travers et al., 2000). Initially, the up-regulation was viewed as means to increase traffic in the ER-Golgi recycling degradative pathway for soluble ERAD substrates (Caldwell et al., 2001). However, our work suggests that the up-regulation is also a means to increase components required for ER sequestration of transmembrane ERAD substrates. Specifically relevant to our analysis is the up-regulation of SEC12, SEC13, and SEC24. Thus, it may be that the UPR-mediated up-regulation of these genes may not be a cellular strategy to remove protein from the ER by exporting them, but additionally might promote sorting of retained proteins toward degradation..

SUMMARY APPENDIX REFERENCES   The focus of this review is the regulated trafficking of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in distal compartments of the protein secretory pathway and the question of how changes in CFTR cellular distribution may impact on the functions of polarized epithelial cells. We summarize data concerning the cellular localization and activity of CFTR and attempt to synthesize often conflicting results from functional studies of regulated endocytosis and exocytosis in CFTR-expressing cells. In some instances, findings that are inconsistent with regulated CFTR trafficking may result from the use of overexpression systems or nonphysiological experimental conditions. Nevertheless, judging from data on other transporters, an appropriate cellular context is necessary to support regulated CFTR trafficking, even in epithelial cells. The discovery that disease mutations can influence CFTR trafficking in distal secretory and recycling compartments provides support for the concept that regulated CFTR recycling contributes to normal epithelial function, including the control of apical CFTR channel density and epithelial protein secretion. Finally, we propose molecular mechanisms for regulated CFTR endocytosis and exocytosis that are based on CFTR interactions with other proteins, particularly those whose primary function is membrane trafficking. These models provide testable hypotheses that may lead to elucidation of CFTR trafficking mechanisms and permit their experimental manipulation in polarized epithelial cells..

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	4	THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR (CFTR) is responsible for the cAMP-activated anion conductance of epithelial cell apical membranes. As a principal apical conductance pathway, the CFTR anion channel is involved in cAMP-dependent Cl and bicarbonate secretion in airway and intestinal epithelia and exocrine glands. It also influences the activity of other conductive pathways, through either linked regulatory interactions or electrochemical coupling that influences the driving forces for ion transport (49, 93). Subsequent to the cloning of the CFTR gene, methods for in situ hybridization and the development of antibodies to CFTR permitted the characterization of its distribution in a variety of tissues (52, 104, 107). The results generally correlated with the presence of cAMP/PKA-stimulated anion secretory processes in various epithelial tissues, identified in earlier studies using physiological methods. Mutations in the gene encoding CFTR produce cystic fibrosis (CF), whereas hyperactivity of this transport pathway underlies secretory diarrheas. CF disease arises from a reduced density and/or activity of CFTR in the apical membranes of secretory epithelial cells, such as those in the airways, exocrine pancreas, salivary glands, reproductive tissues, and intestines. A regulated CFTR conductance pathway is also important for the normal functions of several absorptive cells, including epithelia lining the airway surface and sweat gland ducts (for a general review, see Ref. 82)..

Historically, studies of this pathway were motivated by the question of whether it would be possible to explain all of the manifestations of CF disease on the basis of a missing anion conductance at the apical membranes of epithelial cells. Accordingly, functional roles for CFTR other than its primary role as an apical membrane anion conductance pathway have been proposed to contribute to CF pathology. These include disease-associated changes in regulated protein secretion (65), the chemistry of macromolecular secretions (22, 33, 90), and the properties of the airway microenvironment that lead to bacterial colonization of CF airways (89)..

As an integral membrane protein, CFTR will reside at least transiently in all compartments of the protein secretory pathway as it migrates toward the cell surface. Thus one can expect to find CFTR in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and endosomal and lysosomal compartments of epithelial cells (Fig. 1). Although there is no question that CFTR channels function as a regulated conductance pathway when they are resident in the apical membrane, numerous studies (see CFTR LOCALIZATION IN CELLS) have also indicated that a significant quantity of mature (i.e., post-Golgi) CFTR is contained within intracellular compartments, that CFTR within these compartments is functional (9, 78), and that cAMP stimulation can modulate the distribution of CFTR between these compartments and the plasma membrane (see REGULATED CFTR TRAFFIC). Therefore, the issue is not whether apical Cl conductance is due to regulation of the gating of membrane-resident CFTR channels or whether it results from the insertion of CFTR channels into the membrane, because both processes occur. We want to know to what extent these forms of CFTR regulation are linked mechanistically and how trafficking of CFTR contributes to the overall conductance response..

Although there is no question that CFTR channels function as a regulated conductance pathway when they are resident in the apical membrane, numerous studies (see CFTR LOCALIZATION IN CELLS) have also indicated that a significant quantity of mature (i.e., post-Golgi) CFTR is contained within intracellular compartments, that CFTR within these compartments is functional (9, 78), and that cAMP stimulation can modulate the distribution of CFTR between these compartments and the plasma membrane (see REGULATED CFTR TRAFFIC). Therefore, the issue is not whether apical Cl conductance is due to regulation of the gating of membrane-resident CFTR channels or whether it results from the insertion of CFTR channels into the membrane, because both processes occur. We want to know to what extent these forms of CFTR regulation are linked mechanistically and how trafficking of CFTR contributes to the overall conductance response..

Intracellular locations of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) during maturation, plasma membrane insertion, and degradation. Properly folded, nascent CFTR leaves the rough endoplasmic reticulum and travels through the Golgi, where it undergoes glycosylation to mature (band C) protein. Mature CFTR leaves the Golgi in vesicles that can travel directly to the apical plasma membrane or to the recycling endosome. CFTR-containing vesicles continually traffic between recycling endosomes and plasma membrane, with rates of trafficking and protein distribution determined by cell type, differentiation, and phosphorylation conditions. CFTR eventually follows the late endosome-to-lysosome pathway for degradation. Misfolded CFTR mutants and significant wild-type nascent CFTRs are degraded by the proteosome..

In a relatively recent review of this subject, Bradbury (10) argued that disparate conclusions regarding the regulation of the distribution of CFTR between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments might be reconciled if regulated CFTR trafficking was a property specific to epithelial cells, i.e., studies showing a lack of CFTR trafficking were generally performed in fibroblasts. Nevertheless, four years after the Bradbury review, the literature has not been clarified. Accordingly, the task of bringing some synthesis to this conflicting data set is not an easy one. Yet, we feel that it is possible to do so and that the attempt should add to our understanding of the control of plasma membrane CFTR density, a critical issue in CF disease..

CONSEQUENCES OF REGULATED CFTR... SUMMARY APPENDIX REFERENCES   This review is primarily concerned with the steadystate distribution of CFTR between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments and with the effect of cAMP/PKA-mediated stimulation on its distribution. The methods used to determine cellular CFTR localization have relied primarily on its detection by antibodies in cultured cells or tissue sections. Other studies have employed functional assays subsequent to cell fractionation, and others have relied on the expression of epitope-tagged or green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CFTR fusion proteins as a method of locating exogenously expressed CFTR. Cellular targets for these studies have included both polarized and non-polar cells. Detection of a reliable CFTR signal has often required overexpression of this normally low-abundance protein in heterologous systems..

From a biochemical standpoint, the prevailing view is that core-glycosylated, immature (band B) CFTR is localized in the ER, whereas complex glycosylated, mature (band C) CFTR is present primarily in compartments distal to the Golgi, including the apical membrane. In contrast with many heterologous expression systems, relatively little band B is observed by immunoblot in most epithelial cells expressing CFTR endogenously at steady state. For example, the ratio of band C to B in Calu-3 airway cells is 10 (100). This indicates that most of the CFTR expressed endogenously in epithelial cells is located in distal compartments of the protein secretory pathway. The first reported studies of CFTR localization, performed in COS-7 cells transiently expressing CFTR, showed a weak, diffuse plasma membrane staining pattern. Most of the signal was intracellular, probably due to protein overexpression (23). In polarized epithelial cells that express CFTR endogenously (T84, HT29, Caco-2, and airway epithelia), this signal was located unambiguously at the apical membrane domain (27, 28). No staining was detected in the basolateral membrane, and little perinuclear staining of CFTR was observed in epithelial monolayers, implying that little CFTR is present in the ER at steady state (consistent with the low levels of band B). The studies of Denning et al. (27) highlighted the importance of localizing CFTR within epithelial cells that express the protein endogenously. In the same study, a mostly intracellular location of exogenously expressed CFTR was found in non-polar HeLa and 3T3 cells..

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	16	Biochemical methods. The central question concerning the issue of regulated CFTR trafficking is whether the protein that contributes to the plasma membrane anion conductance is present strictly in the apical plasma membranes of epithelial cells or whether it is present also in a subapical, post-Golgi compartment from which it is mobilized to the cell surface during stimulation. A related issue is whether CFTR is stable in the plasma membrane or undergoes recycling to intracellular compartments. In this regard, a rapid rate of CFTR endocytosis from the cell surface has been observed in both epithelial and nonepithelial systems (13, 61, 85). These studies used biotinylation procedures to monitor the rate of CFTR internalization from the cell surface. In T84 cells, it was estimated that 50% of cell surface CFTR is retrieved within a few minutes (85); in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells the internalization rate was 5% per minute (61). These rates of endocytosis are not different from those of constitutively recycling receptors, such as those for transferrin or LDL. These findings, together with the estimated 24- to 48-h half-life of mature, plasma membrane CFTR (7, 41), indicate that virtually all of the CFTR that is internalized by endocytosis must be returned to the plasma membrane by a recycling/exocytic pathway. The presence of this rapid CFTR recycling pathway is a minimal requirement for a regulated insertion-retrieval model that controls cellular CFTR distribution. Thus the question should not be whether CFTR undergoes trafficking at the plasma membrane but whether this process contributes to a change in the distribution of CFTR between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in response to cAMP/PKA regulation..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	17	In addition to these kinetic considerations, the presence of CFTR in endosomes under steady-state conditions has been established with the use of a combination of biochemical techniques and functional assays that rely on CFTR's anion channel activity. Bradbury et al. (12) resolved CFTR in the early stages of endosomal retrieval within clathrin-coated vesicles from epithelial cells. CFTR was demonstrated to be present in this compartment by immunoblot. After removal of the clathrin lattice by uncoatase and fusion of the resulting membranes with planar lipid bilayers, currents with biophysical and regulatory properties characteristic of CFTR were observed. Because clathrin removal was a necessary prerequisite for reconstitution, CFTR was definitely a component of this endocytic compartment. Additional studies have demonstrated that the rapid endocytosis of CFTR from the cell surface depends on clathrin-mediated pathways and that CFTR is not significantly internalized into caveolae (11, 85). Several transport and/or channel proteins have been found to internalize via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, including aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) (101), Na/H exchanger 3 (NHE3) (24), renal outer medulla K channels (ROMK) (114), and epithelial Na channels (ENaC) (96). Recent studies of the mechanism of CFTR endocytosis (see Functional studies of endocytosis) indicate a direct physical interaction of CFTR with the plasma membrane adapter complex, making CFTR a specific target of this endocytic machinery..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	18	Other methods for demonstrating the presence of CFTR in endosomes have relied on the ability of CFTR to provide a pathway for anion transport that parallels the vacuolar H-ATPase. Lukacs et al. (60) allowed CHO cells expressing CFTR to take up the pH-sensitive dye FITC-dextran into endosomes, where the rate of dissipation of a pH gradient across endosomal membranes was stimulated by addition of a proton ionophore. In these intact cells, pH gradient dissipation was limited by the counterion. Activation of cAMP production elicited a twofold increase in the rate of pH change in cells expressing CFTR but not in parental or mock-transfected cells. The results were duplicated in microsomes isolated from these cells. Biwersi and Verkman (9) used a similar method for monitoring endosomal pH in CFTR-transfected 3T3 cells and in T84 cells endogenously expressing CFTR. Treatment of the cells with forskolin before microsome isolation produced an approximately twofold increase in the rate of subsequently measured pH gradient dissipation but had no effect on microsomes isolated from nontransfected or F508 CFTR-expressing 3T3 cells. These data are also consistent with the presence of functional CFTR in endosomes that, in principle, could contribute to CFTR recycling..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	19	Morphological methods. Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy for detection of cellular CFTR, investigators have generated data that arrive at somewhat divergent conclusions with respect to the importance of regulated CFTR trafficking. On one side of this issue is the study of Lehrich et al. (55) in shark rectal gland, a tissue that expresses CFTR at high levels endogenously. These investigators used quantitative confocal microscopy to show that CFTR immunofluorescence extended from the apical membrane into subapical, supernuclear regions of the cell and that during stimulation with secretagogues, the overall depth of this CFTR signal decreased by 50%. Similar conclusions were reached when the histogram of CFTR fluorescence intensity as a function of distance from the apical membrane was quantitated. These cAMP agonist effects on CFTR distribution, imposed in perfused, intact rectal glands before fixation, were reversible. Whether this shift in fluorescence signal represents insertion of vesicles containing CFTR into the apical membrane remains unknown; however, the findings are consistent with the acute hormonal regulation of CFTR trafficking in an intact epithelial tissue..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	20	Similarly, Ameen et al. (1, 2) used immunofluorescence microscopy to quantify the cellular location of CFTR in rat small intestine and the influence of cAMP-dependent agonists on its distribution. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) elicited a bicarbonate-rich fluid secretory response in isolated perfused intestinal loops and elicited, within the same time frame, a redistribution of CFTR to the apical membrane domain. CFTR association with the apical membrane was quantified by colocalization of F-actin as a brush border marker. In duodenal villus cells, VIP elicited a reversible, threefold increase in brush border associated CFTR, and it redistributed CFTR within the cell apex to the brush border within 30 min. These studies were confirmed by immunoelectron microscopic methods (see Immunoelectron microscopy). The results provide support for a physiological role for cAMP-induced CFTR-containing membrane traffic in the regulation of the apical anion conductance in a native, endogenously expressing epithelium..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	21	Other investigators have reached different conclusions with respect to regulated CFTR trafficking. Moyer et al. (70) expressed a GFP-CFTR fusion protein in MDCK type I epithelial cells and used quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy and cell surface biotinylation to determine the effect of cAMP stimulation on apical membrane CFTR localization. Their findings showed that cAMP did not stimulate detectable GFP-CFTR translocation from intracellular compartments to the apical membrane, along an apical-to-basal GFP fluorescence gradient that extended throughout the cell. In these cells, cAMP did not regulate GFP-CFTR endocytosis, determined by apical biotinylation and subsequent immunoprecipitation. Likewise, disruption of microtubules with colchicine did not affect cAMP-stimulation of Cl secretion or the expression of GFP-CFTR in the apical membrane. Thus the authors concluded that cAMP stimulates CFTR-mediated Cl secretion in MDCK type I cells by activating only the channels that are resident in the apical membrane. A regulated CFTR trafficking event may be lacking in this cell type; however, it is also reasonable to ask whether the exogenous expression of CFTR driven by the CMV promoter leads to saturation of regulated trafficking pathways (see Functional studies of exocytosis)..

Surface biotinylation experiments reported in the same study (58) also showed no stimulation-dependent increase in apical membrane CFTR. Two biotinylated proteins were detected by CFTR antibody precipitation following biotinylation; they were of equal intensity and 200 to 220 kDa in molecular size. Yet, others have demonstrated by immunoblot that CFTR in Calu-3 cells shows the typical pattern of a predominant band C of 150 to 180 kDa and relatively little band B; the latter is presumably intracellular (c.f., Refs. 18 and 100). Thus it is not clear that the biotin-labeled proteins identified in these experiments were CFTR..

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	24	It is possible that differences in the conclusions drawn from fluorescence measurements in native and cultured epithelial cells stem from variations in the distribution of CFTR in subapical compartments under nonstimulated conditions. In the studies of native secretory tissues (shark rectal gland and rat intestine), the apical fluorescence signal extended into the cell sufficiently to detect a clear change in its distribution with stimulation. In MDCK cells expressing GFP-CFTR (70), there was an even deeper distribution of expressed protein, but this may reflect its deposition in nonphysiological compartments, as described earlier in this article. Given quantitative limitations of GFP visualization, 7 molecules/pixel (79), it may be necessary to express CFTR at nonphysiological levels to obtain a CFTR signal. In Calu-3 cells (58), the CFTR signal was much more densely localized at the apical membrane domain. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to ask whether a band of apical fluorescence detected in epithelial cross sections can resolve apical membrane CFTR from that present in a nearby subapical recycling pool. Consideration of the point-spread function of fluorescence intensity variation with distance suggests that structures separated by  > 0.2  microm will not be resolved using light microscopy. Thus immunofluorescence, even coupled with confocal microscopy, may lack the ability to resolve fluorescence signals from membrane vesicles having a diameter of 0.1  microm or less, which are components of the CFTR recycling pathway. This vesicle size expectation is based on neurosecretory and other regulated trafficking vesicles (see APPENDIX). For example, intracellular GLUT-4 staining by thin-section immunoelectron microscopy was localized to vesiculotubular structures 50 to 70 nm in diameter (62). Thus it is possible that different conclusions at the light microscopic level may emerge from different cellular distributions of intracellular CFTR trafficking compartments and their constituents (see CONSEQUENCES OF REGULATED CFTR TRAFFICKING)..

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	26	Immunoelectron microscopy. The results of several studies using immunoelectron microscopic methods are consistent with a subapical population of post-Golgi CFTR (c.f. Refs. 26, 42, 86, and 107). Puschelle et al. (86) used immunogold labeling to localize CFTR in vesicles present beneath the plasma membrane of human airway epithelial cells. They also observed vesicles in the process of fusion or retrieval from the plasma membrane. Immunogold labeling of CFTR-expressing L cells and Sf9 cells also demonstrated the presence of CFTR beneath the plasma membrane as well as in the rough ER (26). Studies of the striated duct of rat submandibular gland cells by Webster et al. (107) showed immunogold labeling of CFTR along the apical membrane as well as in numerous subapical membrane vesicles. Their estimates of labeling density suggested that more CFTR is present in subapical intracellular compartments than in the plasma membrane under "resting" conditions. Some of the CFTR-labeled vesicles also stained with antibodies against the transferrin receptor and rab4, two endosomal markers, indicating that these vesicles are likely part of an endosomal/recycling pathway for CFTR..

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	29	The study of Howard et al. (42) examined apical membrane domain CFTR localization as a function of CFTR expression level. In an earlier study (43), these investigators showed that CFTR located in the plasma membrane could be discriminated from intracellular CFTR by using nonpermeabilized MDCK cells expressing an extracellular epitope-tagged CFTR (where the flag, M2 epitope, was added to the 4th extracellular loop of CFTR, after amino acid 901). They found that cAMP stimulation increased the cell surface signal of CFTR two-to threefold in the steady state. In the more recent studies, they induced CFTR expression by using a recombinant adenovirus that encoded M2-901/CFTR. Virally expressed, FLAG-tagged CFTR was functional and could be detected on the apical surface of forskolin-stimulated, polarized MDCK (type II) cells by immunofluorescence performed on nonpermeabilized epithelial monolayers. At a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) (i.e., lower CFTR expression level), forskolin stimulated the insertion of M2-901/CFTR into the apical membrane, but at higher MOI and M2-901/CFTR expression levels, no agonist-dependent increase in surface expression could be detected. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the redistribution of CFTR to the apical membrane upon forskolin stimulation at the lower CFTR expression levels and demonstrated that the apically inserted CFTR originated from a population of subapical vesicles. Results similar to these have been obtained with the use of immunoelectron microscopy in Calu-3 cells endogenously expressing CFTR, where a two- to threefold increase in apical CFTR was observed in response to acute forskolin stimulation (Hug MJ and Frizzell RA, unpublished observation)..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	30	The observations of Howard et al. (42) may reconcile at least some of the prior conflicting reports regarding the effect of cAMP stimulation on CFTR trafficking. They show that a high level of CFTR expression, obtained by using strong promoters, for example (70), can saturate pathways for regulated CFTR trafficking, even in epithelial systems. Also in oocytes, the CFTR trafficking signal (cAMP-induced increase in membrane capacitance) saturated as the CFTR expression level was elevated by injection of more RNA (102). Inappropriate trafficking of AQP-2, in relation to the actions of dominant-negative AQP-2 mutants, has also been observed at high protein expression levels (51). Later in this article, we discuss candidate protein interactions that may mediate regulated CFTR trafficking at the apical membrane. If cells express different levels of the relevant traffic regulatory proteins, then it is likely that the contribution of regulated CFTR trafficking to the total anion conductance (as opposed to regulated gating of membrane resident CFTR) will vary in different epithelial or nonepithelial systems..

SUMMARY APPENDIX REFERENCES   Functional studies of endocytosis. The concept that the CF gene product may play a role in regulated membrane trafficking is not new. The implication, from defective mucin and glycoprotein secretion found in CF airways and other organs (64, 67), was that the CF gene product, once identified, would be involved somehow in the control of protein secretory processes. Because the secretion of mucin in several CFTR-expressing tissues is stimulated by cAMP (65), and because cAMP/PKA regulatory pathways also control CFTR gating, it was reasonable to anticipate that protein secretion by exocytosis may lead also to an increase in the numbers of CFTR channels in the plasma membrane (Fig. 1)..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	33	The first studies that implicated CFTR function in regulated endocytosis were performed in colonic and pancreatic epithelial cell lines, with the latter transduced to express CFTR using retrovirus vectors. Bradbury et al. (13, 14) measured detergent-sensitive horseradish peroxidase and FITC-dextran uptake to monitor fluid phase endocytosis in T84 and CFPAC-1 cells. They found that cAMP significantly inhibited fluid-phase endocytosis, and in pancreatic cells, this depended on the expression of wild-type (wt) CFTR. No cAMP inhibition of endocytic activity was observed in parental CFPAC-1 cells or those transduced by empty vector. A similar 60% inhibition of endocytosis was observed during cAMP stimulation of endogenous CFTR-expressing T84 (13) and 9HTEo-cells (94). In T84 cells, PKC stimulation did not affect either basal endocytosis or the inhibitory effect elicited by cAMP stimulation..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	34	Methods employing biotinylation of the cell surface have also demonstrated that CFTR internalization is inhibited by cAMP/PKA. Prince et al. (85) biotinylated carbohydrate residues on the extracellular surface of T84 cells using NHS-biotin. Subsequent immunoprecipitation and radioisotope labeling of CFTR with the use of [32P]ATP and PKA was performed to distinguish between CFTR at the cell surface and in intracellular compartments. These workers found that apical membrane CFTR was rapidly internalized by T84 cells (half-time of 3 min), and they showed that cAMP decreased this internalization rate to an extent similar to that found in prior studies of fluid-phase endocytosis (60% inhibition). They also showed that the internalization rate of G551D CFTR was similar to that of the wild-type protein but that, interestingly, its endocytosis was not affected by cAMP. This finding suggested that either the channel activity of CFTR is related to its ability to be retrieved from the cell surface or the altered structure of the G551D mutant precludes regulation of both gating and trafficking. It was difficult to detect a change in the total amount of CFTR at the cell surface using the method of Prince et al. (85). Even at short times (1 min), only a 12% increase in apical membrane CFTR was detected. However, the use of in vitro phosphorylation to detect CFTR after its biotinylation and immunoprecipitation may be influenced by the existing phosphorylation status of the protein, thus compromising surface CFTR detection. That is, if CFTR is already phosphorylated by agonist, the subsequent CFTR signal would be reduced because phosphorylation sites are already occupied. A method that avoids this complication employs a second CFTR antibody to detect biotinylated CFTR, which avoids the potential for back-phosphorylation to reduce the signal. This approach also demonstrates a forskolin-induced inhibition of CFTR endocytosis, a depletion of the protein from intracellular compartments, and a consequent increase in plasma membrane CFTR (61)..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	35	Studies documenting the presence of functional CFTR in endosomes have been extended to show a role for CFTR in postendocytic membrane trafficking. Biwersi et al. (8) implicated a role for CFTR in cAMP-stimulated endosome-endosome fusion. They labeled endosomes of CFTR-expressing and control 3T3 cells with fluorophores such that a fluorescence signal would be detected if endosomes from separately labeled cell populations fused with one another. These investigators asked whether the presence of CFTR in these endosomes, and its stimulation by cAMP, influenced the fusion process. Endosomes from nonstimulated CFTR-expressing cells fused with each other at a rate that did not differ from that observed in control cells not expressing CFTR. The endosomes isolated from CFTR-expressing cells that were stimulated by forskolin, however, showed a 2.6-fold increase in fusion rate. This was abolished by endosomal Cl depletion, suggesting that a CFTR-mediated Cl flux, or the conformational changes in CFTR associated with Cl conduction, somehow contribute to this process. These data are consistent with the concept that CFTR stimulation can alter membrane traffic in endosomal recycling pathways..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	36	Recent findings have been able to establish certain structural features of CFTR that govern its rapid removal from the cell surface. Studies by Prince et al. (84) and Weixel and Bradbury (109) have demonstrated that the internalization of CFTR via clathrin-dependent mechanisms depends on the presence of a YXX motif (where is a bulky hydrophobic residue) at the CFTR COOH terminus. Similar tyrosine-based endocytic motifs are present on other proteins that are rapidly retrieved from the cell surface (see Ref. 80 for review). In vivo cross-linking and in vitro pull-down assays showed that CFTR binds to the plasma membrane endocytic adaptor complex AP-2. The CFTR COOH terminus was able to bind AP-2 but did not bind the Golgi-specific adaptor complex AP-1. Mutation of the tyrosine residue at position 1424 of CFTR significantly reduced the ability of an isolated CFTR COOH terminus to bind AP-2. The YDSI sequence of CFTR interacts specifically with the  micro2 subunit of AP-2 (108), a site implicated in adapter binding to similar endocytic motifs (74). Protein binding studies showed that the COOH terminus binds selectively to this adapter subunit. Cells expressing either a dominant negative  micro2 or a CFTR lacking the tyrosine-based internalization motif at the COOH terminus (Y1424A) fail to endocytose CFTR efficiently. These studies indicate that the interaction of CFTR's COOH terminus with AP-2 guides it into the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway, as observed for many cell surface receptors. Although these studies provide compelling evidence for specific protein interactions that mediate CFTR retrieval at the cell surface, they do not yet provide an indication of how this process may be regulated by cAMP/PKA. We have speculated on possible mechanisms for regulated CFTR endocytosis (see MECHANISMS OF REGULATED CFTR TRAFFICKING: PERPETRATOR OR BYSTANDER? and Fig. 2)..

(13) on CFTR-dependent endocytosis also examined CFTR-dependent exocytic recycling to the cell surface. To monitor exocytosis, the plasma membranes were pulse-labeled with a biotinylated lectin (WGA), and after its removal from the bath, the cells were allowed to take up lectin into intracellular compartments. Remaining cell surface WGA was blocked with unlabeled avidin, and at various times the recycling of internalized WGA to the cell surface was assayed using Texas Red-labeled avidin. In cells expressing wt CFTR, recycling and exocytosis of internalized marker was increased approximately threefold by forskolin, whereas cAMP stimulation had no effect on WGA recycling in either the parental CFPAC-1 cell line or in empty vector controls. Importantly, these studies showed that cAMP-responsive recycling/exocytosis required CFTR expression..

Treatment of cells expressing wt CFTR with a cAMP analog elicited increased release of FITC-dextran, and this was accompanied by increases in membrane capacitance monitored during whole cell patch-clamp measurements. Again, trafficking was CFTR dependent; cAMP had no effect on membrane capacitance or recycling/exocytosis in airway cells derived from a CF patient. The investigators concluded that cAMP stimulates exocytosis and the CFTR Cl conductance of normal but not CF cells and that it does so by stimulating the delivery of CFTR channels from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane..

However, studies of Xenopus oocytes generally have shown a good correlation between cAMP stimulation of CFTR currents and increases in membrane capacitance (81, 102, 105). In the studies of Takahashi et al. (102), the apparent changes in cell surface area with stimulation, determined from membrane capacitance measurements, were confirmed by using blinded measurements of membrane morphometry in stimulated and nonstimulated cells. In addition, recruitment of CFTR to the cell surface was demonstrated by using epitope-tagged M2-901/CFTR labeling of nonpermeabilized cells (81). Together, these findings are consistent with the exocytic insertion of CFTR into the oocyte plasma membrane during cAMP stimulation. The cell surface immunofluorescence studies of Peters et al. (81) suggested a low level of CFTR expression in the plasma membrane of nonstimulated oocytes (i.e., fluorescence levels were near background in the absence of stimulation). These data suggested that recruitment of CFTR to the cell surface is a significant component of CFTR current stimulation in this system. However, this conclusion assumes that the flag-CFTR labeling approach can detect low levels of cell surface CFTR. Although technically difficult, it would be optimal to determine a dose-response relation between cAMP-dependent cell surface CFTR labeling and some independent parameter such as the corresponding change in membrane capacitance. It is possible, for example, that some threshold level of CFTR residing in the plasma membrane cannot be detected by this method, underestimating levels of CFTR at the cell surface under basal conditions. However, this concern does not compromise the data, obtained from three different methods, consistent with stimulation-dependent recruitment of CFTR to the surface of these cells..

(105), who used impedance analysis to assess membrane conductance and capacitance and correlated the changes in these parameters induced by cAMP. In agreement with prior reports (81, 102), cAMP stimulation of CFTR-expressing oocytes evoked significant increases in both current and capacitance that were not observed in noninjected or F508-expressing cells. Injection of Rp-cAMP (a specific cAMP antagonist) abolished the effects of the cAMP stimulation on both current and capacitance. Interestingly, the less specific PKA inhibitors, KT5720 and H8, after prolonged (overnight) exposure, primarily blocked the capacitance increases evoked by cAMP while having less effect on the corresponding current activation. However, these reagents have been shown to alter cytoskeletal properties. For example, KT5720 induces microtubule rearrangement by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (76), and H8 has been shown to alter cytoskeletal protein phosphorylation through inhibition of PKC (63). It would be interesting to explore these actions further, because both of these less selective kinase inhibitors produce cytoskeletal disruption, which may account for their inhibitory effects on membrane trafficking. Indeed, Weber et al. (106) showed that microtubule disruption markedly inhibits current and capacitance increases evoked by cAMP in CFTR-expressing oocytes, and similar conclusions have been reached in CFTR-expressing epithelial cells (103)..

(57) arrived at a different conclusion. They employed a CFTR construct containing a cysteine substitution in the postulated CFTR conduction pathway to arrive at the conclusion that essentially all conductance activation by cAMP in oocytes was due to CFTR channels that are already present in the plasma membrane. This approach relied on changes in conductance induced by treatment of this CFTR mutant with cysteine-reactive methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents, whose effects have been attributed to altered charge shielding properties in the CFTR conduction pathway. When oocytes were treated briefly with 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSET; a positively charged modifier) for as little as 20 s before cAMP activation, the activated channels behaved as if their properties were already modified. Because MTSET has been demonstrated in other systems to be cell impermeant, the data suggest that the modified channels must have already been present at the cell surface. These findings are consistent with a lack of regulated CFTR redistribution in oocytes, but they need not negate the results of prior studies for two reasons. First, this study used CFTR expression levels (based on conductance) that are 5 to 10 times higher than the prior work in which capacitance measurements were made. As discussed earlier in this article, overexpression of CFTR can saturate pathways available for regulated trafficking. Consistent with this idea, Takahashi et al. (102) observed that increasing CFTR expression levels increased CFTR currents, but the corresponding capacitance changes plateaued, as if regulated trafficking pathways had saturated. Constitutive delivery of CFTR to the plasma membrane at high expression levels would limit one's ability to detect a population of trafficking channels. Second, Liu et al. (57) did not measure membrane capacitance, cell surface CFTR, or any other measure of CFTR trafficking. Nevertheless, there is not a facile explanation for differences between these carefully performed studies and those cited above. It should be determined, using MTS CFTR modification together with capacitance measurements or surface CFTR labeling, whether high CFTR expression levels would account for these results..

In the studies of Chen et al.

In addition, they found no increase in steady-state plasma membrane labeling by FM 1-43 when the cells were stimulated by cAMP during fluorescence measurements. Enhanced dye labeling (fluorescence intensity) would be expected if additional membrane were exposed at the cell surface as a result of exocytosis.

The cells were labeled to steady-state intensity with FM dye, and their fluorescence intensity was monitored during cAMP stimulation. However, if the increase in plasma membrane area induced by cAMP is only 3% over the basal membrane area (suggested from capacitance measurements at 37 degrees C; Ref. 46), this signal would not be detected during steady-state dye labeling. Rather, subsequent to stimulation, it is necessary to wash out dye and agonist from the membrane to minimize plasma membrane (background) staining. This permits visualization of the dye retrieved by subsequent endocytosis of labeled plasma membrane, assuming that the cell recovers to its original area following reversal of stimulation. As recent studies in this laboratory performed at 37 degrees C have demonstrated, measurements performed in this manner indicate that FM 1-43 labeling is increased by cAMP stimulation in Calu-3 (45). The protocol used in the studies of Chen et al. (21) and Chang et al.

Estimates of the numbers of CFTR channels in intracellular vesicles obtained by using data derived from Calu-3 cell and oocyte measurements are provided in the APPENDIX. Important assumptions in these calculations include the single-channel parameters and assumed vesicle radius (100 nm). The calculations are based on reported values of membrane current and capacitance changes from patch-clamp studies of cAMP-stimulated cells (46, 102). These calculations and assumptions yield estimates of 1 to 10 channels per vesicle in these systems; they are not likely to provide more than one order of magnitude estimate of channel density. The mean oocyte current and capacitance changes reported by Weber et al. (105) were both approximately fourfold smaller than those in the Takahashi study (102) so that the calculated outcome would be unaffected. For comparison, Wright et al. (110) estimated the number of Na-dependent glucose transporters per oocyte vesicle at 10 to 20, based on freeze-fracture scanning electron microscopy. The size of the imaged oocyte vesicles was 100 to 120 nm. The value of 1 to 10 CFTRs per vesicle is instructive when considering whether one should be able to visualize vesicular GFP-CFTR by light microscopic methods. As discussed earlier in this article, the sensitivity of GFP detection (79), together with these considerations, suggests that CFTR density in a single transport vesicle is near the limit of detection..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	56	Relation to other systems. It is worth emphasizing that the source of CFTR current generation, whether membrane-resident or inserted channels, need not be a black-and-white issue. In most systems, plasma membrane CFTR currents are likely to arise from both stimulation of membrane-resident channels and acutely trafficked CFTR channels, and the proportions of these may differ among cell types or experimental conditions (see CONSEQUENCES OF REGULATED CFTR TRAFFICKING). Data from studies of the regulated trafficking of GLUT-4 or AQP-2 indicate that they undergo recycling even under basal conditions (15, 17). During stimulation, the rate coefficients of the steps involved in recycling these proteins are altered, changing their distribution to increase the number of transporters and/or channels in the plasma membrane. Presumably, regulated CFTR recycling behaves similarly. As appears to be true of CFTR, the cellular background that can support regulated GLUT-4 or AQP-2 trafficking is very important. Thus the expression of GLUT-4 in nonmuscle or nonadipose derived cells eliminates the insulin-regulated redistribution of GLUT-4 (40, 44). Similarly for AQP-2, its endogenous expression in vas deferens results in a constitutive apical membrane localization; the channel is not found in a cAMP/PKA-regulated internal compartment as it is in renal epithelia, and there is no effect of stimulation on apical channel density (99). A requirement for the proper cellular context is likely to also characterize the regulated trafficking of CFTR. The AQP-2 data suggest that such differences can exist not only between epithelial and nonepithelial cells but also between epithelial systems. This conclusion underscores the need to determine which cellular components provide the proper context..

TOP ABSTRACT CFTR LOCALIZATION IN CELLS REGULATED CFTR TRAFFIC MECHANISMS OF REGULATED CFTR... CONSEQUENCES OF REGULATED CFTR... SUMMARY APPENDIX REFERENCES   The studies discussed above do not provide a mechanistic basis for the CFTR-dependent proteins and regulatory events involved in the control of CFTR distribution at the apical membrane. Positive reports of regulated CFTR trafficking (increased exocytosis, decreased endocytosis, and increased endosome fusion) have indicated that these events require both the expression of CFTR and its stimulation by cAMP/PKA. In addition, with the exception of Xenopus oocytes, these processes appear to be epithelial cell specific. In view of the relatively recent discovery of the extensive interactions of CFTR with other proteins, speculation regarding possible molecular mechanisms governing at least some of these trafficking reactions seems warranted. Although firm conclusions cannot be drawn at this stage, the principal value of the models we propose is to suggest testable hypotheses that may lead to an understanding of mechanism. Moreover, it is our contention that the importance of regulated CFTR trafficking for anion secretion will continue to generate controversy until its mechanistic basis is understood to the extent that it can be manipulated experimentally (e.g., in the same manner that identification of adapter protein interactions with CFTR has provided a mechanistic basis for CFTR endocytosis)..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	58	Endocytosis. The physical interaction between the CFTR COOH terminus and the  micro2 subunit of the AP-2 adapter complex, indicated by the results of recent studies (108), suggests a model like that shown in Fig. 2 for PKA-mediated regulation of endocytosis. This scheme is based on observations concerning the inherently rapid rate of CFTR-dependent endocytosis and the inhibitory effect of cAMP on this process (13, 14, 61, 85). It assumes that CFTR is normally endocytosed at a rapid rate because of its interaction with the AP-2 adapter complex at the YDSI motif of the COOH terminus. Recent data indicate that this interaction requires also phosphorylation of the  micro2 subunit, which facilitates AP-2 interactions with membrane lipids (25). The model of Fig. 2 implies that the PKA-mediated inhibition of CFTR endocytosis may result from occlusion or obstruction of the adapter protein binding site at the COOH terminus by a CFTR phosphorylation event. For example, this could result from an as yet unidentified physical interaction of the phosphorylated R domain with the COOH-terminal tail where adapters bind, or it could be mediated by another interacting protein whose association with the COOH terminus is proportional to CFTR phosphorylation. The key feature of this model relies on phosphorylation-dependent accessibility of the COOH terminus site for adapter protein binding..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	59	A second possibility is that the YXX motif itself is altered by phosphorylation. In species where CFTR's sequence has been described, the YDSI motif is highly conserved (108). Although it does not conform to a canonical PKA consensus sequence, it is possible that the Y+2 serine is phosphorylated by PKA or another kinase, which acts to disrupt the adapter binding motif. The possibility that AMP kinase, implicated in binding to this region of CFTR (39), is involved in phosphorylation of the YDSI internalization motif requires evaluation. However, the function of this kinase is presumably to downregulate CFTR during metabolic stress, which would be expected to promote, not inhibit, CFTR retrieval. Nevertheless, a phosphorylation event at or near this site could reduce the endocytic rate of CFTR in parallel with the activation of channel gating. It remains to be determined whether such a mechanism can account for the finding, made in both epithelial and nonepithelial systems (13, 14, 85, 94), that PKA phosphorylation inhibits CFTR endocytosis, leading to retention of the channel on the cell surface..

What determines the ability of CFTR to enter a regulated (as opposed to constitutive; Fig. 1) secretory pathway during its progression to the cell surface? In Xenopus oocytes, a redistribution of CFTR between intracellular and plasma membrane compartments is demonstrable by immunofluorescence measurements, as discussed above. These data can be interpreted to suggest that CFTR is stabilized, kinetically, in an intracellular compartment under nonstimulated conditions. Therefore, it is reasonable to ask what structural feature(s) of CFTR provides for its entry into a regulated secretory pathway under basal conditions. CFTR carries its own regulatory domain, and the phosphorylation of this domain stimulates both channel gating and trafficking. Therefore, it is logical to ask whether the R domain is responsible for the entry of CFTR into a regulated pathway. For this purpose, CFTR lacking the R domain has been expressed from two injected RNAs, each corresponding to a CFTR half molecule: N-TM1-NBD1 and TM2-NBD2-C (56). Oocytes expressing these constructs showed spontaneous currents quantitatively similar to the stimulated currents of cells expressing wt CFTR, and they were not further augmented by cAMP stimulation. In addition, there was no change in membrane capacitance during stimulation, indicating that regulated CFTR trafficking required the R domain. The direct targeting of R-CFTR to the plasma membrane in these cells is consistent with the concept that the nonphosphorylated R domain may allow CFTR to access a regulated intracellular compartment and that CFTR within this compartment can be redistributed to the plasma membrane when the R domain is phosphorylated. Therefore, it is reasonable to ask the following: What are the mediators of this process? Do protein interactions involving the R domain govern the movement of CFTR through this regulated trafficking pathway?.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	62	Although these questions cannot be answered with certainty at present, the relatively recent discovery by Kirk and colleagues (72, 73) that CFTR interacts physically and functionally with syntaxin 1A (S1A) suggests soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins as candidates for participation in this regulated trafficking process. The interaction of S1A with the NH2 terminus of CFTR (73, 81) and the inhibition of CFTR currents during S1A overexpression (72) have been interpreted as the consequence of a direct interaction of S1A with CFTR that reduces its open probability (20). However, in addition, Peters et al. (81) showed that S1A overexpression decreased the density of CFTR channels in the plasma membrane. They concluded that disruption of SNARE complex formation by overexpressed S1A interfered with CFTR trafficking (presumably with exocytosis). As regards the functional involvement of syntaxin with CFTR, there is no reason to discount one mechanism in favor of the other; that is, syntaxin may regulate CFTR gating and also function as a component of the machinery that brings CFTR into the plasma membrane, or it may act as a regulator of that process..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	63	Although these questions cannot be answered with certainty at present, the relatively recent discovery by Kirk and colleagues (72, 73) that CFTR interacts physically and functionally with syntaxin 1A (S1A) suggests soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins as candidates for participation in this regulated trafficking process. The interaction of S1A with the NH2 terminus of CFTR (73, 81) and the inhibition of CFTR currents during S1A overexpression (72) have been interpreted as the consequence of a direct interaction of S1A with CFTR that reduces its open probability (20). However, in addition, Peters et al. (81) showed that S1A overexpression decreased the density of CFTR channels in the plasma membrane. They concluded that disruption of SNARE complex formation by overexpressed S1A interfered with CFTR trafficking (presumably with exocytosis).

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	64	How might SNARE proteins be involved in regulated CFTR exocytosis? To pose an answer to this question, we should recount several observations. First, the Kirk laboratory has shown that the NH2 terminus of CFTR, to which S1A binds, also interacts with a proximal portion of the R domain in protein binding studies (71). A series of basic amino acid residues at the NH2 terminus is thought to mediate this association. Mutation of these residues altered the magnitude and kinetics of CFTR current stimulation in oocytes and decreased the open probability of single CFTR channels (34), perhaps by interfering with NH2 terminus-R domain interactions that influence CFTR gating. The NH2 terminus is also the site of S1A binding (73). Thus it is possible that NH2 terminus-R domain interactions influence the association of CFTR with S1A or that it affects the ability of S1A to interact with other proteins necessary for CFTR trafficking..

Csp is a resident of synaptic vesicles, and its knockout interferes with regulated neurotransmitter release (116), as does a S1A knockout (111). In protein binding studies, Csp interacted with both the CFTR NH2 terminus and R domain. It seems likely that the interactions of S1A and Csp with the NH2 terminus and the additional interactions of the NH2 terminus and Csp with the R domain may provide a means for linking proteins involved in regulated membrane trafficking to the regulatory (phosphorylation) status of the R domain (similar in general concept to the proposal above for regulated CFTR endocytosis). According to the model shown in Fig. 3, phosphorylation of the R domain would alter these protein interactions in a manner that would lead to SNARE protein associations appropriate for fusion of CFTR-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane. It is also of interest that Csp can bind to several SNARE proteins, including S1A, syntaxin 4, and vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP-2) and that Csp has been proposed as a modulator of SNARE protein interactions (19). According to this concept, NH2 terminus-R domain interactions within CFTR can alter single-channel properties, but they may also couple the phosphorylation-dependent activation of CFTR channel gating to proteins that regulate CFTR trafficking. It is possible that a protein such as Csp, through its ability to interact with SNARE proteins on one hand and with both the NH2 terminus and R-domain of CFTR on the other, provides a transduction mechanism for coupling CFTR channel activation to channel trafficking mediated by the SNARE machinery..

A: under basal conditions, CFTR is distributed between the apical plasma membrane and subapical vesicles derived from the recycling endosome. The NH2 terminus of CFTR binds to syntaxin 1A, which tethers vesicles close to the plasma membrane. The cysteine string protein (Csp), localized to CFTR-containing vesicles at the apical membrane domain, binds to the R domain. Blue bubbles indicate the CFTR site of syntaxin binding; interaction regions on other proteins are depicted by small boxes. B: stimulation by cAMP activates PKA, phosphorylating (asterisks) the R domain and Csp. R domain phosphorylation may disrupt binding between syntaxin and the NH2 terminus, which also interacts with the R domain (see text). Csp-R domain interactions may also be altered by phosphorylation; Csp may then act as a chaperone for SNARE protein interactions involving syntaxin 1A, which is now free to bind vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) and other members of the SNARE complex (not shown). CFTR in the plasma membrane is active, and its gating is syntaxin sensitive. C: the SNARE complex facilitates fusion of the CFTR vesicle to the plasma membrane, inserting active CFTR channels (D) and increasing CFTR channel density..

CONSEQUENCES OF REGULATED CFTR... SUMMARY APPENDIX REFERENCES   CFTR channel density. The most obvious consequence of regulated CFTR insertion/retrieval processes is that the distribution of CFTR between intracellular compartments and the apical plasma membrane will vary with agonist stimulation. The analogy of this process to other examples of transporters whose overall plasma membrane activity is modulated by trafficking, such as the vasopressin-stimulated AQP-2 water channel or the insulin-dependent GLUT-4 transporter, have been cited throughout this article. For CFTR, there is no doubt that the gating of this channel is regulated by phosphorylation when the channel is already present in the plasma membrane. Why, then, should the trafficking of CFTR also be regulated? Control of insertion/retrieval is a common mechanism for regulation of transporters having slow activation kinetics. Control of channel number would provide for amplification of the secretory response to agonist while preserving an option to sequester CFTR within a compartment where it cannot affect the plasma membrane Cl conductance. High intracellular salt levels can be deleterious to cells, whose intracellular ionic composition and volume must be closely regulated (30)..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	70	In addition, the contribution of trafficking events to anion secretion may vary with the differentiation status of the epithelium (6, 37). It has been found, for example, that CFTR in some epithelial cells does not find its way to the plasma membrane until the tight junctions have formed and the cells polarize (68). As the epithelium is developing, cells may utilize regulated trafficking as a means to fine tune the apical Cl conductance until the expression levels of other transporters, metabolic or regulatory components, on which overall secretory or absorptive ion movements depend are expressed at appropriate levels. At that stage, the mature cell may find it reasonable to better anchor CFTR in the plasma membrane by virtue of PDZ domain (69, 97) and other interactions, to shift the balance of channel distribution in favor of the plasma membrane. Yet, even in well-differentiated native epithelia, significant CFTR trafficking signals can be demonstrated (see REGULATED CFTR TRAFFIC). Not until we know, from a mechanistic viewpoint, the protein interactions that mediate CFTR trafficking events will we be able to determine how such a balance is achieved or how it may be perturbed to counter the effects of disease..

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	72	Relation to CF disease. Disease-related mutations that influence CFTR trafficking in distal compartments of the protein secretory pathway have been identified. It is probably true that mutations in proteins that control general trafficking pathways would have a negative selective advantage and may be lethal; however, CFTR mutations that influence its trafficking have now been described. Several reports have indicated that the half-life of F508 CFTR at the plasma membrane, and perhaps in other post-Golgi compartments, is markedly reduced relative to that of wt CFTR. Using functional measurements of CFTR activity in CHO cells, Lukacs et al. (59) found that the plasma membrane currents associated with F508 CFTR (recruited to the cell surface at low temperature) decayed with a half-time of  < 4 h, whereas the functional half-life of wt CFTR currents was  > 24 h..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	73	Heda et al. (41) measured the half-life of F508 vs. wt CFTR in the plasma membrane of LLC-PK1 cells using cell surface biotinylation, streptavidin-mediated isolation, and immunoblot analysis. Mutant CFTR was brought to the cell surface with the use of a combination of low temperature and butyrate preincubation. They found that the half-life of plasma membrane F508 CFTR was 4 h, whereas the corresponding half-life of wt CFTR exceeded 48 h in these cells. The cAMP-dependent iodide efflux correlated with CFTR expression at the cell surface. These authors concluded that F508 CFTR is more rapidly internalized and perhaps targeted to a degradation pathway. The parallel study of Sharma et al. (95) reached a similar conclusion. Mutant CFTR was encouraged to escape the ER with the use of a combination of reduced temperature and chemical chaperone (glycerol) treatment. They observed also a rapid degradation rate of F508 CFTR, which they attribute to decreased conformational stability: the protein was more susceptible to aggregation and protease digestion. These authors favor the concept that folding defects of this CFTR mutant persist in the mature, post-Golgi protein (most studies agree that it lacks normal channel gating kinetics and open probability; c.f. Ref. 92) and that this leads to its more rapid degradation, perhaps by ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. It is also possible, in view of the model for regulated CFTR endocytosis illustrated in Fig. 2, that the rapid degradation of F508 CFTR reflects its more rapid endocytic rate (41, 95), increasing its exposure to degradation mechanisms. It is evident from these findings that the altered stability of mutant CFTR in distal trafficking pathways will require attention should rescue of F508 CFTR from ER degradation pathways be an achievable therapeutic target for CF disease..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	74	Another interesting disease mutation that influences distal pathway CFTR trafficking has been identified by Silvis et al. (98). These investigators searched the mutation database for disease mutations that may lead to increased CFTR endocytosis through creation of an endocytic motif. The N287Y mutant resides in the second intracellular loop of CFTR and results in mild disease when expressed in combination with F508 CFTR. This mutant did not exhibit a folding defect, because the N287Y and wt CFTRs showed similar maturation kinetics. However, there was roughly 50% of the mutant at the plasma membrane at steady state relative to wt CFTR. An increased colocalization of the mutant with the endocytic marker EEA1 suggested that this mutation alters the distribution of CFTR between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments. Cl transport was reduced in proportion to altered cell surface CFTR, but the single-channel properties of N287Y were similar to those of wt CFTR. Biotinylation experiments showed that N287Y CFTR was internalized approximately twice as fast as wt CFTR, which is expected to alter its distribution between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments. These findings provide evidence of disease mutations where the primary defect lies in altered kinetics of CFTR recycling at the plasma membrane, resulting in subnormal apical membrane CFTR levels..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	75	Intracellular CFTR channel function. A second consequence of regulated CFTR trafficking is that intracellular CFTR distribution may vary with the secretory status of the epithelium. Despite indications that intracellular CFTR channels can be activated by cAMP/PKA (9, 77), the model of Barasch et al. (5), suggesting that vesicular CFTR activity alters internal compartment pH, cellular glycoprotein processing, and bacterial colonization, has not been supported by subsequent studies (32, 35, 60, 83). Nevertheless, there is a fundamental need for resolving the causes for increased bacterial adherence to CF cells and their glycoprotein secretory products and for the preferential binding of P. aeruginosa to undersialylated CF mucins (16, 31, 48, 53, 91, 113). These findings argue that the deletion of CFTR from the distal secretory pathway influences epithelial cell surface chemistry. These properties of CF cells and their secretions could be affected by CFTR-dependent membrane trafficking events in intracellular compartments as well as at the plasma membrane domain. For example, Biwersi et al. (8) demonstrated that CFTR promotes endosome-endosome fusion, and, as with plasma membrane CFTR redistribution, this required both CFTR expression and cAMP stimulation. If the presence of CFTR in internal membranes alters patterns of posttranslational glycoprotein modification by changing the compartmentation of enzymes or substrates involved in these processes (78), the surface chemistry of CF cells may be affected..

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	77	Protein secretion. An issue related to the above discussion concerns the role of CFTR in epithelial tissue protein secretory activity, which is largely suggested by the data of McPherson and colleagues (65, 67), who examined mucin and amylase secretion by salivary glands of control and CF patients. Metabolic incorporation of isotopic label into the carbohydrate residues of mucins was used to quantitate secretory rates. The results showed that the -adrenergic stimulation of mucin and amylase secretion was reduced 60% in submandibular salivary glands derived from CF subjects. An extensive series of studies showed that alterations in signal transduction mechanisms were not responsible for this difference and that the mucin content of control and CF glands was similar. Recently, similar results have been obtained by using the salivary glands of CFTR knockout mice (67). Again, the cAMP-dependent secretory component of secretion was impaired. Mergey et al. (66) have performed experiments of this type in several human airway cell lines. They demonstrated independent regulation of 14C-labeled glycoconjugate secretion by PKA and PKC pathways (i.e., their effects were additive). The PKA agonist isoproterenol increased mucin release by 40% in control cells, but this effect was virtually eliminated (reduced to 3% stimulation) in cells derived from CF subjects. A difference in PKC-mediated secretion between control and CF cell lines was not detected, similar to the observations of Bradbury et al. (13) on cAMP-regulated membrane trafficking in T84 cells. Moreover, the attenuated PKA response in CF airway cells could be restored by adenovirus-mediated CFTR expression. The results suggest that CFTR can play an important role in cAMP-mediated glycoconjugate secretion. Although not explicitly implicating CFTR in mucin release, the studies of Kuver et al. (54) have demonstrated cAMP-dependent regulation of protein or mucin secretion in CFTR-expressing canine gallbladder epithelial cells. CFTR was detected by immunostaining on mucin granule membranes..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	78	In studies that may have implications for epithelial protein secretion, Yilla et al. (112) examined the influence of vacuolar H-ATPase inhibition on the constitutive protein secretory pathway in HepG2 cells. Although treatment with concanamycin B did not influence ER-to-Golgi transit, the kinetics of protein traffic between the Golgi and plasma membrane were significantly impaired. The secretion of albumin, 1-antitrypsin, and transferrin was delayed, and processing of N-linked glycans by sialyltransferases was inhibited, resulting in the secretion of less extensively modified glycoproteins. This study implicates intracellular compartment acidification in the sialylation and N-linked glycan modification of secreted glycoproteins and with the rate of protein secretion. In a related study, Jilling and Kirk (50) demonstrated that cAMP increased the secretion of several proteins, including 1-antitrypsin, into the apical but not the basolateral compartment of T84 cells. This effect was Cl dependent and resulted also in an increase in protein sialylation. An involvement of CFTR in regulated exocytosis could underlie the differences in protein secretion observed in studies of cells and/or tissues derived from normal and CF patients or CF knockout mice..

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	80	Common threads. Once we understand the reasons for the ability of CFTR to alter membrane traffic, it may become apparent that the underlying mechanisms involved in the progression of CFTR between different compartments have certain features in common. A critical question in this regard concerns the exit of CFTR protein from the ER. Reasons for thinking along these lines include the common features controlling vesicle transit along compartments of the secretory pathway, e.g., a combination of SNARE and coat protein associations, which often involve interactions with the cargo being conveyed (3)..
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	81	Our recent findings regarding Csp interactions with CFTR (115) also may provide an example of how common trafficking events may occur in the early and later components of the protein secretory pathway. Csp regulates exocytosis in neurosecretory cells, and implications for a similar role in CFTR exocytosis were discussed above. In addition, Csp plays a role in CFTR maturation in the ER. Csp antibodies co-precipitate a large proportion of band B CFTR and localize Csp protein to the ER, in addition to its presence at the apical domain. The major influence of Csp overexpression was a disruption of the biogenesis of mature CFTR (band C). Because Csp is an Hsc70 binding protein, which also binds to CFTR, it is likely that Csp serves as a CFTR co-chaperone. Csp overexpression may decrease CFTR biogenesis by prolonging its association with Hsc70, which can lead to CFTR degradation (88). Much work needs to be done to determine the role of Csp in CFTR maturation, but it is interesting to speculate that the steps involved in the egress of nascent CFTR from the ER and from a regulated compartment of the distal secretory pathway to the plasma membrane may involve similar protein interactions. Therefore, identifying the mechanisms underlying stage-specific CFTR trafficking events may also shed light on traffic occurring at other compartments of the cell..

SUMMARY APPENDIX REFERENCES   As with any active field of study, the above discussion leaves several issues unresolved. On balance, there is good evidence that epithelial cells exhibit regulated CFTR trafficking as a mechanism to increase the density of CFTR channels at the cell surface. This process may contribute to the cAMP-dependent secretion of proteins contained within this trafficking compartment. Some results that show a lack of regulated CFTR trafficking may be attributable to the use of overexpression systems or nonphysiological experimental conditions. Yet, there are other findings that cannot be similarly rationalized, and this may reflect the need for expression of the right set of interacting proteins, perhaps some of them as yet unidentified. The finding that disease mutations influence CFTR trafficking events in the distal protein secretory pathway and thereby contribute to the CF phenotype further supports the concept that regulated CFTR recycling is important for normal epithelial function. The era of CFTR interactions with other proteins, particularly with recognized traffic regulatory components, is beginning to shed light on the potential mechanism of regulated CFTR trafficking. We suggest testable hypotheses (Figs. 2 and 3) regarding the manner in which CFTR phosphorylation may alter protein interactions and thereby affect the distribution of CFTR between apical membrane and intracellular compartments. Yet, it is likely that controversy regarding the significance of this process will continue until we can identify the specific components of the CFTR-dependent trafficking machinery, permitting their expression or activity to be modulated experimentally in polarized epithelial cells and, ultimately, in the organism..
