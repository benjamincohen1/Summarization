Cells transfected with cDNAs bearing this mutation produce more A[beta]1-42(43) than those transfected with wild-type APP and this effect is additive with that of the previously reported APP V717I mutation thus providing a novel approach for further increasing A[beta]1-42(43) in model systems.

INTRODUCTION.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	5	Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) that cause early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) have previously been identified (1 ). Those which lead solely to AD have been reported at two sites: at codon 717 and a double mutation at codons 670/1 (K/M670/1N/L) (for review see ref. 1 ). These mutations, and the presenilin mutations which also lead to FAD, have in common the feature that they increase the concentration of A[beta] ending at A[beta]42(43) (2 -8 ). Here we report the identification of a novel mutation in APP which is associated with an Alzheimer phenotype and show that it too results in an increased extracellular concentration of A[beta]42(43). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION.

Further, we demonstrate an additive increase in the relative concentration of A[beta]1-42(43) from cells transfected with constructs containing both the I716V and the V717I mutations. This finding provides a novel approach for further increasing A[beta]1-42(43) concentration in model systems..

In this context, the family we report here, in which the mean documented onset age was ~53 years, was a candidate for having an APP mutation. Sequencing revealed a mutation changing the predicted amino acid at codon 716 from isoleucine to valine. This mutation is likely to be pathogenic due to its proximity to the previously identified V717I mutation and it has not previously been observed in any of the hundreds of normal samples that we and others have previously sequenced. The only other living affected family member did not wish to be sampled and this precluded segregation analysis of the mutation..

0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	11	A common feature of early onset FAD-linked mutations is to increase the concentration of A[beta] ending at A[beta]42(43). To determine whether the I716V mutation also affected the extracellular concentration of A[beta]1-42(43), we performed transient transfection analysis in both CHO and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. The results obtained from a representative experiment are shown in Table 1 . Relative to wild-type and the vector control, the I716V mutant cDNA caused a 30-60% increase in the proportion of A[beta]1-42(43) in both of the cell lines examined. This increase was similar to the effects of the V717I mutation analyzed in parallel in these series of experiments and as reported previously (3 ,8 ). Importantly, the increase in the absolute concentration of A[beta]1-42(43) produced by I716V transfected cells was observed even when the absolute concentrations of A[beta]1-40 were essentially identical. In order to both increase the `n' number for statistical analysis and account for variance in transfection efficiency between experiments we focused our subsequent analysis on the ratio of A[beta]1-42(43) to A[beta]1-40 as this has previously been shown to be elevated invariably in both the APP (V717I) and the presenilin mutations (2 -8 ). The ratios obtained from three additional independent transient transfections in both HEK 293 and CHO cells have been combined with the ratios obtained from the experiment in Table 1 to produce Figure 1 . These results demonstrate an ~2-fold increase in the ratio of A[beta]1-42(43) to A[beta]1-40 when compared with the wild-type control (P = 0.0026, Mann-Whitney)..

An increase in the absolute concentration of A[beta]42(43) was however observed in the plasma from this patient when compared with the average concentration of five non-demented, control subjects analyzed in parallel (Table 1 ). In fact, this individual had the highest concentration of A[beta]42(43) in this series despite having the second lowest concentration of A[beta]1-40.

Due to the proximity of these mutations and the nature of the amino acid changes we were interested in exploring the effect of the combination of these mutations on the A[beta]42 phenotype. To address this question we constructed a cDNA containing both the I716V and V717I mutations in the pcDNA3 vector. Our analysis of cells transiently transfected with this artificial double mutant construct demonstrated an increase in the ratio of A[beta]1-42(43) to A[beta]1-40 when compared with each individual mutation either separately (P = 0.02) or pooled (P = 0.0066) (Table 1 ). This feature may be useful in designing constructs which maximize A[beta]1-42(43) concentration for modeling the disease process..

DNA sequencing revealed a heterozygote A - >  G transversion at codon 716 changing the predicted amino acid sequence from isoleucine (ATC) to valine (GTC). Resequencing in the opposite orientation revealed the corresponding change. This change destroys a Sau3AI enzyme cut site. PCR amplification of exon 17 with flanking intronic primers 17INF (5'-CCTCATCCAAATGTCCC-3') and 17INR (5'-GGTAAGTTGCAATGAAT-3') followed by restriction digestion with Sau3AI gives two fragments (256 and 243 bp) in normal individuals but in carriers of the mutation an additional fragment (499 bp) that corresponds to the uncut PCR product is observed. Screening for this change in the proband confirmed the alteration and failed to find this change in a further 50 normals. In addition, this exon of the APP gene has been sequenced by our group on the order of 500 times without finding this, or other changes except in cases where AD was segregating as an autosomal dominant disorder with an onset age in the 50s.

0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	4	The presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) proteins are necessary for proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) within its transmembrane domain. One of these cleavage events (termed -secretase) generates the C-terminal end of the A-peptide by proteolysis near residue 710 or 712 of APP770. Another event (termed -like or -secretase cleavage) cleaves near residue 721 at ~2-5 residues inside the cytoplasmic membrane boundary to generate a series of stable, C-terminal APP fragments. This latter cleavage is analogous to S3-cleavage of Notch. We report here that specific mutations in the N terminus, loop, or C terminus of PS1 all increase the production of A42 but cause inhibition of both -secretase cleavage of APP and S3-cleavage of Notch. These data support the hypothesis that -cleavage of APP and S3-cleavage of Notch are similar events. They also argue that, although both the -site and the -site cleavage of APP are presenilin-dependent, they are likely to be independent catalytic events.

0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	6	The -amyloid precursor protein (APP)1 undergoes a series of proteolytic processing events (Fig. 1). One processing event, which is mediated sequentially first by -secretase and then by -secretase, generates several proteolytic fragments, including a 40-42-amino acid fragment termed A and a number of C-terminal fragments (CTFs) that contain the cytoplasmic tail of APP. These CTFs have been variously termed "-stubs," "-stubs," or "APP intracellular domain" (AICD). Detailed analysis of these products has revealed that the cleavage events that give rise to the C terminus of A occur after residues 40 or 42 of the -secretase stub (Fig. 1). However, those that give rise to the predominant, stable CTFs have an N terminus at residues 49, 50, or 52, which are located 2-5 residues inside the cytoplasmic membrane boundary (1-7). These latter cleavage events and the S3-cleavage of Notch occur at approximately the same position relative to the inner surface of the membrane (i.e. within 2-5 residues of the surface) (Fig. 1) (1-7). Beyreuther and colleagues (1) have referred to the cleavages at residues 40-42 as -secretase cleavage and to the cleavages at residues 49-52 as -cleavage. For the sake of clarity, we retain this terminology..

Consequently, it has been suggested that PS1 and PS2 mutations have a "gain-of-function" effect on -secretase activity. Paradoxically, several of these mutations suppress the ability of human presenilin proteins to complement the Notch signaling phenotype induced by the loss-of-function C60S mutant in Caenorhabditis elegans (11, 12). Conversely, the C60S loss-of-function mutation in the sel-12 presenilin homologue, which inhibits Notch processing of C. elegans, causes increased A42 production when introduced into human PS1 as the C92S mutation (13, 14). However, the -secretase cleavages of APP near residue 42 (15), the -cleavages of APP near residue 50 (1-5), and the S3-cleavage of Notch (7, 16) all appear to be presenilin-dependent. It has been difficult, therefore, to reconcile the apparently opposing action of pathogenic presenilin mutations on A production in mammalian cells and on Notch cleavage in invertebrates. We now report that, although PS1 mutations augment -secretase cleavage at residue 42, they in fact suppress both S3-cleavage of Notch and -cleavage of APP near residue 50. These data suggest that -secretase cleavage at residue 42 and S3-/-cleavage are likely to be independent activities.

Certain cell lines also stably expressed the APP695 "Swedish" mutant. In some experiments, cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding a membrane-bound Notch protein (Myc-tagged NotchE) cloned into pCS2+ vector (17, 18). To examine the ability of APP mutants to increase or decrease A production, some cells were co-transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type or mutant forms of the C-terminal 99 amino acids of APP (corresponding to the product of -secretase cleavage of FL-APP) that had been fused to an artificial signal peptide to ensure correct orientation and cloned into pCEP4 vector (19).

0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	26	Generation of APP C-terminal Stubs by Microsomal Membranes and by Purified PS1 Complexes-- Incubation of microsomal membrane fractions derived either from native HEK293 cells or from HEK293 cells expressing APPSwedish generated an ~6-kDa APP C-terminal fragment, which migrated below the major APP C-terminal fragments (i.e. -stub and -stub) arising from -secretase or -secretase cleavage of FL-APP (Fig. 2A, left panel). A similar result was observed in microsomal membrane fractions generated from fibroblasts of PS1 wild-type mice. In contrast, microsomal membrane fractions from fibroblasts of PS1/ mice or from HEK293 cells stably expressing the loss-of-function PS1-D385A mutant all showed significant inhibition in the production of the 6-kDa C-terminal fragment of APP (Fig. 2B). Similarly, there was significant inhibition in the production of the 6-kDa C-terminal fragment of APP when microsomal membranes were extracted from HEK293 cell lines expressing APPSwedish, and the resulting microsomal membranes were themselves then incubated with Compound E (a well documented -secretase inhibitor of A production (24)) (Fig. 2B). When detergent-solubilized, immuno-purified, high molecular weight presenilin complexes (which contained C99-APP, PS1-NTF, PS1-CTF, and nicastrin) were investigated under the same assay conditions, the same ~6-kDa APP C-terminal band was also produced (Fig. 2A, right panel). The generation of the ~6-kDa fragment was highly sensitive to the detergent used. Thus, CHAPSO permitted robust production of this fragment, whereas other detergents, such as digitonin and dodecylmaltoside, supported this cleavage event less efficiently (data not shown). Triton X-100 and Nonidet P-40, both of which disassemble PS1 complexes, resulted in no C-terminal APP stubs or A generation (data not shown). These data, when taken together, imply that the ~6-kDa fragment is an authentic, presenilin-dependent, proteolytic cleavage product..

Microsomal membranes from stable HEK293 cells expressing APPSwedish (APPSwe) or purified PS1 complexes from stable HEK293 cells expressing C99-APP were incubated at 37  degrees C for 30 min or 2 h. An ~6-kDa -stub migrating below the major APP-CTFs (-stub and -stub) generated from - and -cleavage -stub was detected by Western blot with anti-APP-CTF antibody. (The variation in -stub density reflects differences in -stub abundance in cells used to prepare the PS1 complexes, which overexpressed C99-APP.) As shown in B, -cleavage is dependent on the presence of functional presenilin. -stubs were inhibited in microsomal membranes from fibroblasts of PS1/ mice, D385A mutant PS1-transfected HEK293 cells, and microsomal membrane preparations treated with -secretase activity inhibitor Compound E..

Analysis of conditioned media from cultured cell lines (Fig. 4A, upper panel, and Table I) revealed that all of the pathogenic PS1 mutations produced increased amounts of A42 when compared with either mock-transfected cells or cells expressing wild-type PS1 (normalized values, PS1-wt: 1.0  plus or minus  0; PS1-L392V: 3.42  plus or minus  0.81; PS1-G206A: 2.43  plus or minus  0.04, p  <  0.05). A42 production was also increased by supernatants from microsomal preparations from mutant PS1 cells (PS1-wt: 1.04  plus or minus  0.12; PS1-L392V: 2.00  plus or minus  0.48; PS1-G206A: 1.66  plus or minus  0.19, p  0.05) (Fig. 4A, lower panel, and Table I). In agreement with prior data, A40 levels were not statistically increased in the PS1 mutant cells either in conditioned medium (PS1-wt: 1.0  plus or minus  0.11; PS1-L392V: 1.05  plus or minus  0.26; PS1-G206A: 1.17  plus or minus  0.07, p = not significant) or in the cell-free preparations (PS1-wt: 1.09  plus or minus  0.03; PS1-L392V: 1.15  plus or minus  0.11; PS1-G206A: 1.22  plus or minus  0.13, p = not significant). The intuitive expectation was that the increased -secretase activity induced by these mutations would be accompanied by increased levels of both the N-terminal (A) and the C-terminal (-stubs) cleavage products. In fact, microsomal membrane preparations containing mutant PS1 produced lower amounts of the ~6-kDa -stubs, regardless of whether the production of -stubs was assessed in the microsomal membranes themselves (Fig. 4B and Table I) or in the supernatant when the membranes were pelleted (not shown). These differences in -cleavage in microsomal membrane preparations from cell lines expressing mutant PS1 were statistically significant when compared with similar preparations from mock-transfected or PS1 wild type-transfected controls (PS1-L392V = 0.54  plus or minus  0.07, p = 0.05; PS1-G206A = 0.57  plus or minus  0.12, p  <  0.05; PS1 Exon9 = 0.47  plus or minus  0.07, p  <  0.05). Furthermore, despite increased production of A42, MALDI-MS analysis of the C-terminal APP fragments revealed only the presence of -stubs beginning at positions 49, 50, or 52 (Fig. 3, right panel). This decrease in the generation of -stubs was not due to differences in the expression of full-length APP, in the maturation or processing of APP, or in the steady state levels of - and -secretase generated C-terminal stubs of APP (which are the direct substrates for -secretase and -secretase cleavage)..

A42 levels in the conditioned medium (top panel) from PS1 mutant cell lines are increased by 2-4-fold. Similar increases (1.5-2-fold) were observed from the microsomal membrane preparations (bottom panel). A40 levels are not statistically different. B, -stub formation was inhibited by PS1 mutations (L392V, G206A or Exon 9). The decrease in -stub generation does not correlate with differences in FL-APP or - and -CTF-APP levels. n = three independent replications..

However, studies using isocoumarin inhibitors (25) and the analysis of the effects of specific PS1 mutations have revealed that the biological functions of PS proteins in the generation of A and NICD can be separated (13, 26). To compare S3-cleavage of Notch with - and -cleavage of APP, we next investigated the effects of these FAD mutations on S3-cleavage of Notch. The same stable HEK293 cell lines expressing either wild-type or mutant PS1 were transiently transfected with NotchE (16-18). NotchE encodes membrane-tethered Notch tagged at the C terminus with c-myc and is a substrate for presenilin-dependent cleavage at the S3-site (16). NICD formation was then followed in pulse-chase experiments. In contrast to cells expressing wild-type PS1, those expressing mutant PS1 showed significant reductions in NICD formation to about half of the amount in wild-type cells (PS1-L392V: 0.59  plus or minus  0.06, p  <  0.05; PS1-G206A: 0.48  plus or minus  0.11, p  <  0.05; PS1 Exon 9: 0.56  plus or minus  0.09, p  <  0.05) (Fig. 5 and Table I)..

To determine whether mutations in the substrate for - and -cleavage (i.e. C99/C83-APP) might also have the same effect, HEK293 cells were transfected with the wild-type C99-APP, I45F mutant C99-APP (which increases A42 (19)), or V50F mutant C99-APP (which decreases A42 (19)). Equivalent amounts of total membrane from each cell line were incubated in the assay system as described above. In agreement with similar results published during the preparation of this manuscript (1), the amounts of -stubs generated by these cell lines were essentially equivalent, suggesting that C99 mutations do not affect the generation of -stubs (Fig. 6), although they significantly alter the production of A42..

0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	40	Our data reveal that all three of the pathogenic PS1 mutations tested here differentially affect several presenilin-dependent activities. These three mutations (each in different domains of PS1) cause an increase in the activity of -secretase producing A42, whereas simultaneously inhibiting both -cleavage of APP and S3-cleavage of Notch. This differential effect of these PS1 mutations provides insight into the complex, regulated, intramembranous proteolysis of type 1 membrane proteins such as APP and Notch. First, our data support the growing body of evidence that suggests that -cleavage of APP and S3-cleavage of Notch are likely to be similar, if not identical, proteolytic processing events (1-5). The single difference that has been noted to date between the - and S3-cleavages is that S3-cleavage of Notch is sequence-dependent, whereas -cleavage of APP is not (1-5)..

0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	42	Second, our data show that the increase in 42-cleavage of APP is accompanied by decreases in - and S3-cleavage activities. This conclusion is entirely compatible with prior data that suggest that FAD-pathogenic mutations have a loss-of-function effect on S3-cleavage of Notch when examined both in vivo in C. elegans and biochemically in vitro (7, 11, 12). The reduction in S3-cleavage of Notch is modest, which provides an explanation for why FAD-associated mutations in PS1 do not have clinical evidence of embryonic defects in humans, who are usually heterozygous for PS1 mutations, and for why transgenes encoding FAD-linked PS1 mutants are able to rescue the Notch phenotype of PS1/ mice (27). (We are, however, aware of one case with a compound heterozygote mutation in PS1 (M146V/S365T) in which the affected proband did have several minor congenital malformations (28)). Our data are also in accord with previously published data indicating that when the C. elegans sel-12 C60S loss-of-function mutant is expressed in mammalian cells as the human PS1-C92S homologue, it reduced processing of Notch and increased A42 production (13, 14)..

0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	44	Finally, the reciprocal relationship between 42-secretase and the -secretase/S3-cleavage suggests that the molecular events leading to the production of A peptide are probably more complex than a single proteolytic cleavage. It seems likely that both the -secretase and the -/S3-cleavage functions are presenilin-dependent. However, it remains unclear whether both - and -secretase cleavages are necessary for the generation of A, and if so, in which order these cleavage events occur. The fact that an authentic -stub (containing residues 43-99) has never been observed has been taken to support the view that -cleavage may be the initial and necessary cleavage followed by a carboxyl-exopeptidase degradation back to residue 42. However, our data suggest that these two activities are more likely to be separate events. Indeed, the most parsimonious explanation for our data is that there are two pathways: a physiological pathway mediating - and S3-cleavage (to generate signal transduction molecules such as AICD and NICD) and a default pathway that generates A42. These functionally distinct pathways, however, could still be subserved by the same catalytic machinery. Thus, in the absence of the presenilin complex, neither pathway would be active. However, functional modulation of the presenilin complex (for instance, by missense mutations or by post-translational modification of the presenilins themselves) or of other components of the presenilin complex (e.g. glycosylation of nicastrin) might alter the relative balance of - and -cleavage pathways. We cannot, of course, preclude the alternate possibility that distinct structural components are involved in these two pathways. Our data, in agreement with previously published data, show that although many missense mutations in the substrate for -/-secretase cleavage (C99-APP) can alter A production, they do not modulate -cleavage (1, 29). Such observations are compatible with the hypotheses that 1) the molecular mechanisms of substrate:catalysis interactions for A generation and -stub/NICD production are different and 2) PS1 mutations might primarily affect a regulatory function rather than directly execute catalytic cleavage..

To understand intracellular signaling events downstream of PS1, we investigated in this study the action of PS1 on mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Overexpressed PS1 suppressed the stress-induced stimulation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Interestingly, two functionally inactive PS1 mutants, PS1(D257A) and PS1(D385A), failed to inhibit UV-stimulated SAPK/JNK. Furthermore, H2O2- or UV-stimulated SAPK activity was higher in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells from PS1-null mice than in MEF cells from PS+/+ mice. MEFPS1(-/-) cells were more sensitive to the H2O2-induced apoptosis than MEFPS1(+/+) cells. Ectopic expression of PS1 in MEFPS1(-/-) cells suppressed H2O2-stimulated SAPK/JNK activity and apoptotic cell death. Together, our data suggest that PS1 inhibits the stress-activated signaling by suppressing the SAPK/JNK pathway..

One of the early events in the development of AD is the accumulation of amyloid ss-peptide (Ass) in the cerebral cortex. Ass1 to 42 is produced from amyloid ss-protein precursor (APP) by both ss-secretase to  and -secrease to mediated processing (Selkoe 1998 ). Most cases of early-onset familial AD (FAD) are caused by mutations in the genes encoding presenilin 1 (PS1) (Sherrington et al. 1995 ) and presenilin 2 (PS2) (Levy-Lahad et al. 1995 ; Rogaev et al. 1995 ). Presenilins appear to be required for the processing of APP to Ass (by -secretase activation) (De Strooper et al. 1998 ; Wolfe et al. 1999 ; Li et al. 2000 )..

0.32985634.11331298.html.plaintext.txt	11	PS1 is a membrane protein that contains eight putative transmembrane domains and primarily localized to intracellular membranes including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Cook et al. 1996 ; Doan et al. 1996 ; Kovacs et al. 1996 ; De Strooper et al. 1997 ). Presenilins are homologous to two Caenorhabitis elegans gene products, SEL-12 and HOP1, both of which facilitate Notch/LIN-12 signaling (Artavanis-Tsakonas et al. 1999 ). Indeed, PS1 plays a pivotal role in Notch signaling by regulation of the Notch processing through -secretase activation (Levitan and Greenwald 1995 ; Li and Greenwald 1997 ; Chan and Jan 1999 ; De Strooper et al. 1999 ; Ray et al. 1999 ; Li et al. 2000 ). Notch signaling appears to be associated with the regulatory mechanisms of a variety of cellular events including cell fate control during embryonic development, differentiation, cell growth, and apoptosis (Artavanis-Tsakonas et al. 1999 )..
0.32985634.11331298.html.plaintext.txt	12	The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is one of the major signaling pathways that transmit intracellular signals initiated by extracellular stimuli to the nucleus. The MAPK pathway regulates a variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and death (Minden and Karin 1997 ; Ip and Davis 1998 ; Schaeffer and Weber 1999 ). The MAPK pathway includes three distinct components: MAPKs, MAPK kinases (MAPKKs), and MAPKK kinases (MAPKKKs). MAPKKKs phosphorylate and activate MAPKKs, which in turn phosphorylate and activate MAPKs. When activated, MAPKs phosphorylate various proteins that include transcription factors, thereby regulating gene expression or other cellular functions. The family of mammalian MAPKs includes three subfamilies: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK (Boulton et al. 1991 ; Han et al. 1994 ; Cobb and Goldsmith 1995 ; Kyriakis and Avruch 1996 ; Su and Karin 1996 ; Fanger et al. 1997 ). The Erk pathway consists of Erk and upstream kinases that include MAPK/Erk kinase 1 and Raf-1 (Schaeffer and Weber 1999 ). This pathway is often stimulated by mitogenic stimuli. The p38 MAPK pathway consists of p38 MAPK and its upstream kinases that include MAPKKs such as MKK3 or MKK6 and MAPKKK such as ASK1 or TAK1 (Schaeffer and Weber 1999 ). The SAPK/JNK pathway consists of SAPK/JNK and upstream kinases that include MAPKKs such as SEK1/JNKK1/MKK4 or MKK7, and MAPKKKs such as MEKK1, ASK1, or TAK1 (Minden and Karin 1997 ; Ip and Davis 1998 ). Like the p38 pathway, the SAPK/JNK pathway can be activated by a variety of cellular stresses that include genotoxic stress, free radicals, heat shock, osmotic shock, ischemia, and proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-1ss (Minden and Karin 1997 ; Ip and Davis 1998 ). When activated, SAPK/JNK can phosphorylate and activate c-Jun or other transcription factors including ATF-2 and Elk-1 (Gupta et al. 1995 ; Minden et al. 1995 ; Yang et al. 1998 ). Although the physiological role of SAPK/JNK is not fully understood, SAPK/JNK has been shown to be involved in the cellular mechanism of apoptotic cell death under certain conditions (Minden and Karin 1997 ; Ip and Davis 1998 ). In particular, a series of studies using mice have demonstrated a pivotal role of SAPK/JNK in apoptotic cell death and excitotoxic neuronal death (Yang et al. 1997 ; Dong et al. 1998 ; Kuan et al. 1999 ; Tournier et al. 2000 )..

When activated, MEKK1 can phosphorylate and activate SEK1, which then phosphorylates and activates SAPK/JNK. To better understand how PS1 suppressed the SAPK activity in cells, we examined a possible action of PS1 on SEK1 and MEKK1. Ectopic PS1 inhibited the UV-stimulated SEK1 or MEKK1 activity in transfected HEK293 cells (Fig 2A and Fig B). Overexpressed PS1, however, failed to inhibit SAPK activity stimulated by coexpression of a constitutively active form of MEKK1, MEKK1 (Fig 2 C). These results suggest that PS1 might suppress the SAPK/JNK pathway by acting on a site or sites upstream of MEKK1. Rac1, a member of the small GTP-binding protein Rho family, has been shown to act upstream of MEKK1 to stimulate the SAPK/JNK pathway (Coso et al. 1995 ; Minden et al. 1995 ). Overexpression of Rac1V12, a constitutively active mutant of Rac1, induced SAPK stimulation in transfected HEK293 cells (Fig 2 D), and PS1 did not repress the Rac1V12-induced SAPK stimulation. This suggests that PS1 may inhibit the SAPK/JNK pathway by acting on a site upstream of Rac1 or by a pathway independent of the Rac1-mediated signaling..

The FAD-linked PS1 mutants M146V, C410Y, and L286V inhibited the UV-stimulated SAPK activity in cotransfected HEK293 cells, just as wild-type PS1 did (Fig 3 A). In contrast, the biologically inactive transmembrane aspartate mutants of PS1 (D257A and D385A) could not inhibit the UV-induced SAPK stimulation (Fig 3 B). The two aspartic acid residues D257 and D385 in PS1 are essential for PS1 endoproteolysis and -secretase activation (Wolfe et al. 1999 ). The UV-induced SAPK stimulation was also repressed by overexpression of PS1Ex9 (Fig 3 B). PS1Ex9 is a functional PS1 mutant lacking exon 9 (amino acids 290 to 319), which contains an endoproteolytic site, M298 (Thinakaran et al. 1996 ; Podlisny et al. 1997 ). Thus, PS1Ex9 does not undergo endoproteolysis but is competent for -secretase activation (Li et al. 2000 ). Our data, therefore, suggest that -secretase activation may be important for PS1 to suppress the SAPK/JNK pathway..

0.32985634.11331298.html.plaintext.txt	40	SAPK/JNK has been shown to mediate stress-induced apoptotic cell death under certain conditions (Xia et al. 1995 ; Verheij et al. 1996 ; Minden and Karin 1997 ; Ip and Davis 1998 ). We examined whether PS1 could modulate SAPK-involved apoptotic cell death in B103 cells (Fig 5). Exposure of B103 cells to H2O2 resulted in an increase in apoptosis (Fig 5 A). The H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death was markedly reduced in cells transfected with SEK1(K129R), a dominant negative form of SEK1. Apoptosis induced by MEKK1 overexpression was also repressed in B103 cells transfected with SEK1(K129R) (Fig 5 B). These results suggest that the SAPK/JNK signaling cascade is involved in the mechanism of the H2O2- or MEKK1-induced apoptosis in B103 cells. Overexpressed PS1 prevented apoptotic cell death induced by H2O2 (Fig 5 A), but not by MEKK1 (Fig 5 B). These data suggest that PS1 might prevent the H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death through inhibiting the SAPK/JNK pathway and that the inhibition occurs a site upstream of MEKK1 in the SAPK/JNK pathway. Our data also show that PS1Ex9, which retains an ability of -secretase activation (Li et al. 2000 ) and suppressed the SAPK/JNK pathway (Fig 3), also inhibited H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death (Fig 5 A). In contrast, PS1(D257A), which lacks an ability of -secretase activation (Wolfe et al. 1999 ) and could not suppress the SAPK pathway (Fig 3), failed to block the H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death..

Interestingly, the endogenous JNK1/SAPK activity both at the basal state and in the H2O2-stimulated state was higher in MEFPS1(-/-) cells than in MEFPS1(+/+) cells (Fig 6 A). Ectopic expression of PS1 in the MEFPS1(-/-) cells resulted in a decrease in the H2O2-stimulated SAPK/JNK activity (Fig 6 B). We also examined H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death in MEFPS1(+/+) and MEFPS1(-/-) cells. MEFPS1(-/-) cells were more sensitive to H2O2-induced apoptosis than MEFPS1(+/+) cells (Fig 6 C). Furthermore, overexpressed PS1 converted MEFPS1(-/-) cells to be more resistant to H2O2-induced apoptosis (Fig 6 D). On the other hand, biologically inactive PS1(D257A), which failed to suppress the SAPK pathway (Fig 3), did not lower the H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death in the MEFPS1(-/-) cells. Together, these data strongly suggest that PS1 functions as a negative regulator of the SAPK/JNK pathway and that PS1 suppresses H2O2-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the SAPK/JNK pathway..

0.32985634.11331298.html.plaintext.txt	47	In this study, we demonstrate that PS1 inhibits the SAPK/JNK pathway. Ectopically expressed PS1 blocked the stress-induced stimulation of SAPK/JNK and its upstream kinases including SEK1 and MEKK1. FAD-linked PS1 mutants, M146V, C410Y, and L286V, were also able to inhibit the SAPK stimulation. Interestingly, biologically inactive PS1 mutants D257A and D385A, both of which have been shown to lack -secretase activation and PS1 endoproteolysis (Wolfe et al. 1999 ), failed to inhibit SAPK stimulation. Furthermore, PS1Ex9, which lacks the endoproteolysis site but is competent for activation of -secretase activity (Li et al. 2000 ), retained the inhibitory effect on the SAPK/JNK pathway. These data suggest that the -secretase activation, rather than the PS1 endoproteolysis, is required for the PS1-induced inhibition of the SAPK/JNK pathway. -Secretase has two major substrates, APP and Notch (De Strooper et al. 1998 , De Strooper et al. 1999 ). The cleavage of APP or Notch by -secretase produces Ass or the intracellular domain of Notch, Notch-IC, respectively. Ass1 to 42 did not inhibit the SAPK/JNK activity (data not shown). In comparison, our preliminary data showed that overexpression of the Notch intracellular domain, which is the active form of intracellular Notch, resulted in suppression of SAPK/JNK activation (data not shown). These findings imply that PS1-mediated cleavage of Notch might be involved in the mechanism of PS1-induced suppression of the SAPK pathway. In this regard, Notch has been previously proposed to play a role in the regulation of the SAPK/JNK pathway (Ordentlich et al. 1998 ; Zecchini et al. 1999 )..

0.32985634.11331298.html.plaintext.txt	49	Several lines of evidence suggest that presenilins are involved in apoptosis (Kim and Tanzi 1997 ; Kim et al. 1997 ). Overexpression of PS2 has been shown to potentiate apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by NGF withdrawal or neurotoxic Ass1 to 42 (Wolozin et al. 1998 ). Another study showed that ALG3, a truncated form of murine PS2, reduced T cell receptor to  or Fas-induced apoptosis in a mouse T cell hybridoma (Vito et al. 1996 ). Studies using PS1-null mice have demonstrated that PS1 is involved in neuronal survival (Shen et al. 1997 ). In this study, we show that ectopic PS1 suppressed the H2O2-induced apoptosis in B103 neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, deficiency of PS1 caused an elevation in the H2O2-induced apoptosis in MEF cells from PS1-null mice, as compared with MEF cells from PS1+/+ wild-type mice. The H2O2-induced apoptosis was blocked by overexpression of SEK1(K129R), suggesting that the SAPK/JNK pathway is involved in the mechanism of the H2O2-induced apoptosis. Thus, our findings suggest that PS1, by inhibiting the SAPK pathway, can protect cells from stress-induced apoptotic cell death. The precise mechanism by which PS1 inhibits the SAPK/JNK pathway, however, needs to be further studied..

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Several lines of evidence have indicated that the presenilin proteins function within macromolecular complexes and are necessary for the regulated intramembranous proteolysis of certain type 1 transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein, Notch, and p75. Data from multiple complementary experiments now suggest that there may be several distinct presenilin complexes. We show here that presenilin mutations and certain detergents affect the abundance and componentry of the presenilin complexes, and these structural effects correlate with their effects on -secretase activity. Our data suggest that there are at least three complexes, including a 150-kDa nicastrin-aph-1 complex (which is likely to be a precursor complex). There is a stable and abundant intermediate complex of 440 kDa, which contains aph-1, pen-2, nicastrin, and PS1. However, it is the very low abundance, high mass (670 kDa) heteromeric complexes that are associated with the highest -secretase-specific activity..

This form of regulated intramembranous proteolysis requires the presence of a complex of interacting membrane-bound proteins, including the presenilin proteins, aph-1 (4, 5), pen-2 (5), and nicastrin (6). Others and we have previously suggested that although these proteins clearly physically interact with each other, they may in fact form more than a single complex (7 to 11). We now report the results of several complementary experiments that directly support this notion and that show that functional -secretase activity mostly arises from a low-abundance, very high molecular weight complex (670 kDa). These data continue to raise the possibility that either additional proteins may be present in these functional complexes or the functional complex is a higher order multimer of the presenilin, aph-1, pen-2, and nicastrin proteins. These data also provide a partial structural explanation for the differential effects of detergents and certain mutations on -secretase activity..

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	21	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   There is an apparent stoichiometric discrepancy between the predominant localization of some of the presenilin complex components within the early secretory pathway (e.g. PS1 and aph-1) versus the functional observation that -secretase cleavage of Notch and APP occur predominantly at, or near, the cell surface. To explore this, we undertook immunocytochemical studies of endogenous presenilin components in KNS glioma cells, mouse cerebellar granule neurons (not shown), and mouse cerebellar glial cells (Fig. 1). It was immediately apparent that although there is overlap between the distributions of these proteins, the degree of overlap is far from a perfect spatial co-registration (Fig. 1). These results hint either that there may be more than one type of complex formed by various different combinations of these proteins or that the complex components might be added to complexes in a spatially and temporally defined order. The conclusion that there may not be a single "presenilin complex" would be in good agreement with previously published biochemical experiments, which had have shown that aph-1 and immature forms of nicastrin co-fractionate separately from PS1 and pen-2 on glycerol velocity gradient and 2D gel electrophoretic fractionations (8, 9). If nicastrin, aph-1, pen-2, and the presenilins do indeed form more than a single type of complex, it immediately begs the question as to whether all of these complexes have -secretase activity..

Any two components showed partial overlap (A, bottom row), but all three components showed only modest overlap (B)..
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	23	  To begin to address these issues, we undertook detailed 2D gel electrophoresis studies using BN gel electrophoresis in the first dimension, followed by standard SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis in the second dimension. When the initial cell lysates of HEK293 cells expressing APPSwedish were prepared using 1% CHAPSO as the solubilizing detergent, at least two distinct PS1 immunoreactive spots were identified at 440 and 670 kDa, together with a smear pattern at even higher masses (Fig. 2, left). The 440- and 670-kDa complexes both contained maturely glycosylated nicastrin, aph-1, pen-2, PS1-NTF, and PS1-CTF. However, only the 670-kDa complex contained APP-CTFs. These observations are unlikely to simply represent idiosyncrasies of the gel electrophoresis methodology because a broad distribution of complexes ranging from 150 to 670 kDa were also seen when these lysates were resolved on glycerol velocity gradients (Fig. 3A, left). Because the resolution of individual complexes is less robust on unidimensional glycerol velocity gradients, and because the glycerol velocity gradients resolve proteins according to relative buoyancy rather than by charge and mass as in gel electrophoretic separations, the predicted mass measurements are not identical between the 2D gel studies and the velocity gradients. Nevertheless, in general agreement with the result of the 2D gels, immature nicastrin and one of two peaks of aph-1 are enriched in lower molecular weight fractions at 100 to 200 kDa (Fig. 3A, left, fractions 3 to 5). On the other hand, PS1, pen-2, and maturely glycosylated nicastrin are enriched in higher molecular weight fractions from 200 to  > 670 kDa, and there is a secondary peak of aph-1 at 440 kDa (Fig. 3A, left, fraction 8)..

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of presenilin complexes from HEK293 cells expressing APPSwedish solubilized in 1% CHAPSO (left) or 1% digitonin (right) reveal the presence of several distinct complexes. In CHAPSO, which supports -secretase activity in cell-free assays, there are at least two heteromeric complexes (670 and 440 kDa) containing PS1, nicastrin (NCT), aph-1, and pen-2. In digitonin, which does not support -secretase activity in cell-free assays, the abundance of the 670-kDa complex is dramatically reduced..

A, glycerol velocity gradient analyses of membrane preparations containing presenilin complexes solubilized in 1% CHAPSO (left) or 1% digitonin (right). These studies confirm the existence of a low molecular mass (150 kDa) complex enriched in aph-1 and immature nicastrin (lanes 3 and 4) and one or more higher molecular weight complexes (200 to 670 kDa) containing PS1, and varying amounts of mature nicastrin (NCT), aph-1, and pen-2 (lanes 5 to 11). Like the 2D gel studies, the 670-kDa complexes (lanes 8 to 11) were essentially absent when membranes were solubilized in 1% digitonin. B, cell-free -secretase assays were performed on pooled fractions from the CHAPSO glycerol velocity gradients (left3) and from the digitonin glycerol velocity gradients (right). Compared with control fractions incubated at 0  degrees C (top left), -stubs were actively generated by CHAPSO-solubilized fractions 5 to 6, 7 to 8, 9 to 10, and 11 to 12 incubated at 37  degrees C for 4 h (middle left); the highest specific activity relative to starting amount of PS1 was in fractions 9 to 10 and 11 to 12 (lower left). PS1 complexes from digitonin-solubilized fractions failed to co-immunoprecipitate APP-CTFs and consequently failed to generate -stubs (right). The failure to generate -stubs by digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes could not be reversed by adding additional exogenous APP-CTFs (see Fig. 3D), and addition of digitonin to CHAPSO-solubilized PS1 complexes (with docked substrate) also resulted in loss of -secretase activity (data not shown), arguing that digitonin alters the conformation and/or componentry of PS1 complex, rendering it non-functional. C, histograms of the specific -secretase activity for pooled fractions from the glycerol velocity gradients. -Secretase activity was calculated as the quantity of -stubs produced/quantity of -stubs produced plus residual APP-CTFs relative to the amount of PS1 in that fraction. Pooled fractions containing proteins with molecular mass less than 600 kDa (fractions 3 to 6 or 3 to 8) had less -secretase activity than did fractions with proteins of molecular mass of greater than 600 kDa (fractions 9 to 12). D, addition of exogenous substrate (APP-C99) resulted in robust generation of -stubs in CHAPSO-solubilized PS1 complexes (CHP) incubated at 37  degrees C, but failed to induce -stub production at 4  degrees C (negative control) in digitonin-solubilized membranes (DIG) at any temperature. This result argues that the absence of -stub generation by digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes (B, right) is caused by the failure of digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes to dock -secretase substrates..
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	27	  The 150 kDa aph-1-nicastrin complex is unlikely to subserve catalytic activity because it is present in PS1 to / to  cells, which do not support -secretase activity. From these experiments alone, it is not possible to conclude which, if any, of the other higher mass complexes are associated with functional -secretase activity. Attempts to measure the activity of specific complexes isolated from the 2D gels were not successful, presumably because of the low abundance of properly folded complexes being recovered. To circumvent this problem, we elected to use three complementary strategies, which might, when taken together, indirectly infer which of these complexes were necessary for functional activity. These three approaches were: 1) direct ascertainment of functional -secretase activity from glycerol velocity gradient fractions; 2) analysis of the differential effects of detergents on -secretase activity, complex composition, and complex size; and 3) analysis of the differential effects on PS1 mutations on -secretase activity, complex composition, and complex size..

The highest specific -secretase activity relative to the amount of PS1-NTF in each fraction was found in the higher mass fractions ( > 500 kDa) of the glycerol velocity gradient (specific activity, 34.6  plus or minus  14.7 and 44.3  plus or minus  17.1 in fractions 9 to 10 and 11 to 12, respectively, compared with 12.1  plus or minus  9.7 and 23.5  plus or minus  10.63 in fractions 3 to 4 and 5 to 6, respectively, p  <  0.05) (Fig. 3, B, lower left, and C)..
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	31	Previous in vitro studies have shown that CHAPSO is the optimum detergent for preserving -secretase activity in cell-free membrane preparations and that -secretase activity is significantly reduced by digitonin and completely abolished by Triton X-100, n-octyl glucoside, and many other detergents (18, 19). When the glycerol velocity and 2D gel electrophoretic experiments were repeated using digitonin, there was a significant (100-fold) reduction in the abundance of the high molecular weight presenilin complexes on both the 2D gel electrophoreses (Fig. 2, right) and on the glycerol velocity fractionation experiments (Fig. 3A, right). Furthermore, these fractions contain very little co-immunoprecipitating APP-CTFs and failed to generate significant quantities of -stubs in the cell-free -secretase assay (Fig. 3B, right). To confirm that the absence of -secretase activity in digitonin-solubilized fractions was caused by failure of docking and cleavage of APP-CTFs by the digitonin-solubilized complexes (as opposed to artifacts such as simple degradation of APP-CTFs during the assay), we performed two additional experiments. First, we immunopurified CHAPSO-solubilized PS1 complexes, and split the product into two aliquots. One aliquot was then submitted directly for -secretase assay, whereas digitonin was added to the other aliquot to a final concentration of 0.25%, and then submitted for -secretase assay. No -stubs were generated by the aliquot containing digitonin (data not shown). In the second experiment, we simply added additional purified APP-C99 to CHAPSO-solubilized and to digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes (Fig. 3D). Again, despite the abundant presence of substrate, the digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes failed to generate -stubs (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these experiments suggest that digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes have undergone either a conformational shift and/or have lost a substrated adaptor protein. When the presenilin complexes were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 or in 1% n-octyl glucoside (neither of which support -secretase activity), the very high molecular weight presenilin complex species were essentially abolished and only monomeric species were found (data not shown)..

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	33	Functional -secretase activity is also modulated by selected mutations in the presenilin proteins. In particular, mutation of either or both of the two aspartyl residues within membrane-embedded hydrophobic domains (PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A) have been associated with loss of proteolytic activity (20 to 22). We therefore investigated the structure and relative abundance of presenilin complexes isolated from cells overexpressing either wild-type PS1 or the PS1 D385A loss-of-function mutant. We have shown previously that the PS1 D385A mutation causes a reduction in the abundance of higher MW species on glycerol velocity gradient fractionation (23). We have also shown that this reduction is not caused by the simple failure of endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 (23). Thus, high molecular weight complexes comparable in size with those of wild-type PS1-NTF/CTFs were observed in cells expressing the holoprotein of the PS1 Exon 9 deletion mutant (which causes increased 42-secretase activity but impaired PS1 endoproteolysis) (23). In agreement with these prior observations, in the current 2D gel analyses, the PS1 D385A mutation was again associated with an altered distribution of complexes and components (Fig. 4). Thus, the 670-kDa complex was absent in digitonin-solubilized lysates of PS1 D385A-expressing cells, which displayed only the 440-kDa complex, and monomeric bands for nicastrin (110 kDa) and the PS1 D385A holoprotein (65 kDa) were observed (Fig 4A, right). Similar but less profound changes in relative abundance of the 670- and 440-kDa complexes were also apparent after CHAPSO solubilization (Fig. 4, B to F). Thus, in cells expressing wild-type PS1 (Fig. 4, B, left, and C to F), there was greater abundance of the 670-kDa complex relative to the 440-kDa complexes (670 kDa/470 kDa ratio, 1.11  plus or minus  0.15, n = 4 replications). However, in PS1 D385A overexpressing cells (Fig. 4, B, right, and C to F), there was a significant loss of the 670-kDa complex and a corresponding overabundance of the 440-kDa complex (670 kDa/440 kDa ratio, 0.57  plus or minus  0.03; p  <  0.002)..

A, 2D gel analyses of digitonin-solubilized membrane preparations from HEK293 cells overexpressing wild-type PS1 (left) or the PS1 D385A mutant (right). PS1 D385A cells show accumulation of the 440-kDa complex and loss of both the 670-kDa complex and the 150-kDa nicastrin/aph-1 complex. B, 2D gel analyses of CHAPSO-solubilized membranes preparations from HEK293 cells overexpressing wild-type PS1 (left) or PS1 D385A mutant (right). Wild-type PS1 cells show equal or greater abundance of the 670-kDa complex compared with the 440-kDa complexes. In contrast, the PS1D385A mutant cells show greater abundance of the 440-kDa complex and relative loss of the 670-kDa complex. C to F, to confirm the results of direct visual interpretations, the intensity profiles of Western blotting signals were plotted using NIH Image software (solid line, wild-type PS1; dotted line, PS1 D385A). Peak heights were then computed for the 440- and 670-kDa complexes, and these data were then used to compare the effects of detergents and PS1 mutations using the 670 kDa/440 kDa peak height ratio. In wild-type PS1-expressing cells, the 670-kDa complex predominated, whereas in PS1 D385A mutant cells, the 440-kDa complex predominated (p  <  0.002)..
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	36	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The immunocytochemical data, the data from glycerol velocity gradient and 2D gel electrophoretic separations, and the functional data arising from the differential effects of detergents and PS1 mutations cumulatively argue that there are several, authentic, independent complexes each with different molecular masses. Although each of the techniques differs in the observed sizes of the complexes, their results are congruent, and it therefore seems very unlikely that these apparently distinct complexes are artifacts. A more probable explanation is that the multiplicity of complexes relates to the maturation of the presenilin complex and to its functional regulation. Based upon the fact that aph-1 is relatively stable in the absence of PS1 and binds to immature nicastrin, we have previously suggested that aph-1 is an initial scaffolding molecule upon which the functional complex is built (8). This is supported by the fact that in PS1 to / to  cells, the 150 kDa aph-1-nicastrin complex is stable and contains immature nicastrin, whereas the 440- and 670-kDa complexes are destabilized. We now propose that the 440-kDa complex, which contains additional components (aph-1, PS1, nicastrin, and pen-2) but does not dock the APP-CTF substrate efficiently, is a relatively abundant but non-functional intermediary complex. In support of this, the 440-kDa complex is stably present under conditions that are not associated with functional -secretase activity (i.e. in the presence of digitonin or the PS1 D385A missense loss of function mutation). The prevalence (albeit at low levels of abundance) of the high molecular weight 670-kDa complex under conditions associated with functional -secretase activity suggests that these complexes are the species that contain full enzymatic activity. This is directly supported by the fact that the highest specific activity for -secretase activity is obtained in the glycerol velocity fractions containing complexes of  > 500 kDa..

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	38	There are two potential explanations for our results. The first and most straightforward explanation is that these complexes reflect the evolution of the presenilin complexes as they are assembled. The lower mass (150 and 440 kDa) complexes might then represent initial and intermediary complexes, whereas the low abundance, high mass complexes (670 kDa) could represent functional complexes that contain either additional components or contain the four known components in a higher order stoichiometry (e.g. 2:2:2:2). Direct experiments analyzing the composition of these complexes will be required to resolve this possibility. There are, however, two caveats to this hypothesis. First, small, but measurable amounts of the 670-kDa complexes are still present in CHAPSO lysates of PS1 D385A cells (although these complexes are considerably reduced in abundance relative to the 440-kDa complexes). This does not completely negate our hypothesis that the 670-kDa complexes are the functional conform because a substantial proportion of the PS1 D385A molecules are clearly in an aberrant conformational 440-kDa state in CHAPSO and nearly all of the PS1 D385A molecules are in the 400-kDa complex in digitonin. As a result, it is probable that the PS1 D385A molecules in the 670-kDa complexes in CHAPSO do not have an entirely normal conform. The second caveat concerning our postulated hierarchy of complexes arises from the observation that PS1 D385A-expressing cells do not assemble a robust nicastrin-aph-1 150-kDa complex. It could be argued that the 150 kDa nicastrin:aph-1 complex is not a precursor complex as we have postulated, but represents a downstream catabolic product of the 440- or 670-kDa complexes. The stable presence of the 150-kDa complex in PS1 to / to  cells makes this hypothesis unlikely. An alternate explanation for the disappearance of the 150-kDa complex in PS1 D385A cells, but not in PS1 to / to  cells, is that the 150-kDa complex could have a dual role. This complex could be involved in presenting new nicastrin molecules to the 440-kDa complexes, and involved in recovering and re-presenting used nicastrin molecules back to the 440-kDa complex. It is conceivable that in the presence of the PS1 D385A mutant, all available aph-1 might become locked-up in the PS1 D385A mutant 440-kDa complex, which fails to further mature, thereby causing disappearance of the 150 kDa nicastrin-aph-1 complex..

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	40	A second observation of note in our results is the fact that the C-terminal fragments of APP arising from - and -secretase cleavage of the APP holoprotein (which are the substrates for presenilin-dependent -secretase cleavage) are not uniformly present in all of the presenilin complexes (see Figs. 3 and 4). In fact, the APP C-terminal stubs are most abundant in complexes associated with functional -secretase activity. The increase in apparent molecular mass between the non-functional complexes and the functional complexes cannot be accounted for by the simple addition of one molecule of C-terminal APP stubs per complex (although we cannot exclude the possibility that multiple APP stubs are docked onto functional complexes). However, the differential presence of APP-CTFs raises the intriguing and more plausible possibility that detergents and mutants associated with loss of -secretase activity have either: 1) altered the conformation and/or complex stoichiometry in a way that precludes efficient docking of substrates or 2) perturbed the binding of adapter molecules that might be required to allow substrate docking. In keeping with this hypothesis, recent cross-competition assays with different classes of -secretase inhibitors has supported the notion that the substrate binding and catalytic sites of -secretase may be physically separate and that correct conformational shifts are required to bring bound-substrate into the catalytic site (24)..
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	41	In conclusion, our experiments suggest that the maturation and functional deployment of the presenilin proteins is more complex than has previously been thought. Our data raise the possibility that additional components may exist in the high molecular mass functional complexes. Our results also require a more detailed assessment as to whether all of the substrates that undergo presenilin dependent proteolysis are dependent on the same set of presenilin complexes or whether there are specialized complexes subserving cleavage of specific proteins. For instance, it is conceivable that the complexes may differ in componentry according to their subcellular distribution (e.g. lipid-rich raft domains, plasma membrane, endosomal-lysosomal pathway, or autophagic vacuoles (25 to 29)). If this were the case, such site-specific composition of the complex might confer either substrate specificity or preferred proteolytic cleavage sites within transmembrane domains and might therefore be potentially exploited therapeutically..

The cutting procedure is thought to be cholesterol dependent and strategies to lower cholesterol as therapeutic treatment are under intensive investigation.

0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	8	In all developed countries, humans live longer and longer. Although we all wish to enjoy increased longevity, a longer life is unfortunately associated with a dramatic increase for the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This has been widely recognized for years and numerous scientists have studied the cellular mechanisms causing AD with the goal of finally identifying targets for treatment. Indeed, it is likely that all genes directly involved in the generation of the deadly amyloid ss-peptide (Ass), which forms the disease-defining amyloid plaques, have now been identified (Haass, 2004). Currently, it is clear that Ass is generated by proteolytic processing of ss-amyloid precursor protein (APP), and two amyloidogenic secretases, ss- and -secretase, are involved (Fig. 1). The ss-secretase, ss-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE), is a typical aspartyl protease. -Secretase, however, is an unusual aspartyl protease complex composed of four individual proteins (presenilin, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2), with presenilin carrying the protease active site (Haass, 2004). -Secretase is uncommon not only in its molecular composition but also in its proteolytic activity, since it is able to cleave its substrate within the membrane (Fig. 1). A prerequisite of this intramembrane cut is the release of the ectodomain of APP via cleavage by BACE or -secretase. Removal of the ectodomain by BACE results in the production of Ass following -secretase cleavage, whereas ectodomain cleavage by -secretase is nonamyloidogenic since it cuts within the Ass domain (Fig. 1)..

0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	12	  Amyloidogenesis is known to be dependent on cholesterol levels (Simons et al., 2001), and moreover, this seems to have a direct relevance for AD, since high cholesterol is correlated with an increased risk for the disease (Kuo et al., 1998). In addition, the apolipoprotein 4 allele is known as a major genetic risk factor for AD (Corder et al., 1993). At the cellular level, Ass generation was found to occur in special cholesterol-rich membrane subdomains called DRMs (detergent-resistant membranes), and lowering cholesterol levels by treatment with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitors, statins, resulted in a strong decrease in Ass production (Simons et al., 1998; Fassbender et al., 2001; Ehehalt et al., 2003). This is likely due in part to an increase in nonamyloidogenic cleavage by -secretase (Kojro et al., 2001). In animal models, statin treatment was also associated with a significant drop in Ass load (Fassbender et al., 2001). Furthermore, a clear correlation between cholesteryl-ester levels and Ass generation was reported in cultured cells (Puglielli et al., 2001). More recently, it was demonstrated that inhibition of the enzyme that regulates the conversion of free cholesterol into cholesteryl-esters not only leads to a dramatic lowering of AD pathology in animal models but is also associated with a reversion of cognitive deficits (Hutter-Paier et al., 2004). Not surprisingly, efforts are under way to use cholesterol-lowering drugs in patients to decrease Ass production. Indeed, preliminary epidemiological studies and small clinical trials suggest that lowering cholesterol levels may reduce the risk for AD (Wolozin et al., 2000; Simons et al., 2002)..

0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	14	The strong cholesterol dependency of Ass generation suggested that secretases might be located within DRMs and this may regulate the processing of APP. Indeed, Ehehalt et al. (2003) demonstrated that antibody cross-linking induced BACE and APP to copatch within cholesterol-rich microdomains, and this resulted in increased Ass production. This proposed localization of secretases is supported by the recent findings of two different laboratories. Here, Abad-Rodriguez et al. (2004) report that they were able to identify endogenous BACE within DRMs of primary hippocampal neurons. Elsewhere, Vetrivel et al. (2004) recently demonstrated that the completely assembled, biologically active -secretase complex consisting of the presenilin fragments APH-1, mature Nicastrin, and PEN-2 resides within DRMs. Moreover, -secretase was found in syntaxin 6 to , syntaxin 13 to , and VAMP4-positive vesicles, demonstrating that -secretase accumulates in the DRMs of late Golgi and endosomes (Vetrivel et al., 2004), exactly where BACE is thought to be biologically active (Haass et al., 1995; Vassar et al., 1999; Walter et al., 2001). Similarly, monomeric and oligomeric Ass were concentrated in DRMs in the brains of a mouse model for AD (Lee et al., 1998; Kawarabayashi et al., 2004). Thus, it appears that the complete Ass generating proteolytic machinery coexists within DRMs of the same vesicles..
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	15	In this issue, the researchers provide a novel and unexpected explanation for why secretases are localized to cholesterol rich membrane domains. They present data suggesting that the DRM association of BACE restricts its access to APP, which they demonstrate accumulates in detergent sensitive membrane domains outside of DRMs (see Fig. 2). This may indicate aberrant access of APP to DRMs, and hence aberrant Ass production, during AD or it may indicate that even under physiological conditions some APP molecules come into close contact with DRMs. The latter seems more likely, since Ass is a physiologically normal product and not produced just in the brains of AD patients (Haass, 2004). These findings also demonstrate a completely novel cellular mechanism for controlling protease activity. Cells undergo major efforts to prevent proteases from contacting proteins not destined to be digested. This is accomplished by numerous mechanisms including synthesis of inactive proforms to be activated at appropriate sites, tagging protease substrates with ubiquitin, sequestering proteases in membrane surrounded environments (endosomes/lysosomes), or hiding the active sites of proteases within narrow tunnels (proteasomes). Abad-Rodriguez et al. (2004) and Vetrivel et al. (2004) add yet another control mechanism. They show that lipids can build an invisible boundary, corralling the -secretase complex and BACE away from their substrate, APP. Certainly, this mechanism did not evolve to protect us from AD. So why do the secretases concentrate within DRMs? A probable explanation is that -secretase is involved in several signaling pathways including Notch signaling (Selkoe and Kopan, 2003; Haass, 2004) and concentrating the proteolytic machinery in small membrane domains facilitates these processes. This would, however, imply that physiological substrates such as Notch and others must gain access to DRMs, an observation yet to be made..

0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	19	  There is, however, one obvious discrepancy between the results of the current study and earlier ones that must be addressed. Abad-Rodriguez et al. (2004) demonstrate that, upon moderate lowering of cholesterol, Ass generation surprisingly increased, whereas a large body of previously published data (see above) clearly demonstrated reduced Ass generation upon cholesterol reduction. How could that be the case, and does that mean that all previous approaches were simply wrong? The truth may be found on both sides. The findings Dotti and colleagues (Abad-Rodriguez et al., 2004) are indeed in apparent disagreement with studies showing that lowering cholesterol inhibits amyloidogenesis, both in cultured cells and in animal models (Simons et al., 1998; Fassbender et al., 2001; Ehehalt et al., 2003). However, in these studies, cholesterol was always strongly depleted and the cells that were used overexpressed APP. In contrast, the current study investigated neurons, the cells most affected by the deadly activity of Ass. Moderate reduction of cholesterol led to increased Ass levels, whereas a strong cholesterol reduction resulted in a significant drop in Ass generation (Fig. 2), similar to that observed before (Simons et al., 1998; Fassbender et al., 2001; Ehehalt et al., 2003). Thus, the effects of cholesterol reduction are dose dependent, and two apparently independent cellular mechanisms are affected. A moderate reduction in cholesterol causes a disorganization of DRMs, allowing more BACE to contact APP and resulting in enhanced Ass generation (Fig. 2). A strong reduction in cholesterol inhibits BACE/-secretase activity and results in a dramatic drop in Ass generation, even though BACE and -secretase can now contact APP directly (Fig. 2). In clear contrast to this model, Ehehalt et al. reported that BACE cleavage of APP occurs within lipid DRMs (Ehehalt et al., 2003), This discrepancy might be due to the fact that when overexpressed a fraction of APP may be mislocalized to DRMs, and then cleaved by BACE, an observation also made by Abad-Rodriguez et al. (2004). More work is needed to settle this controversy since the effects of lowering brain cholesterol on the production of endogenous Ass in mouse neurons or in human brains have not been directly demonstrated. Although the current findings raise some interesting questions, they do not necessarily challenge cholesterol-lowering tactics as AD therapy/prevention since animal studies to date are in clear favor of this strategy (Fassbender et al., 2001; Hutter-Paier et al., 2004). Moreover, cholesterol lowering drugs are taken by numerous patients with enormous beneficial effects on cardiovascular disorders and no side effects concerning Ass generation or dementia have been reported. Cholesterol-dependent processing of APP provides a striking example how disease-based research can dramatically advance basic knowledge in cell biology, and vice versa. Who would have thought, only 10 years ago, that DRMs might contain and regulate the deadly machinery responsible for the most abundant human neurodegenerative disorder and that this machinery might function via a novel and totally unexpected mechanism of intramembrane proteolysis?.

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	5	   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References   We investigated the relationship between PS1 and -secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in primary cultures of neurons. Increasing the amount of APP at the cell surface or towards endosomes did not significantly affect PS1-dependent -secretase cleavage, although little PS1 is present in those subcellular compartments. In contrast, almost no -secretase processing was observed when holo-APP or APP-C99, a direct substrate for -secretase, were specifically retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a double lysine retention motif. Nevertheless, APP-C99-dilysine (KK) colocalized with PS1 in the ER. In contrast, APP-C99 did not colocalize with PS1, but was efficiently processed by PS1-dependent -secretase. APP-C99 resides in a compartment that is negative for ER, intermediate compartment, and Golgi marker proteins. We conclude that -secretase cleavage of APP-C99 occurs in a specialized subcellular compartment where little or no PS1 is detected. This suggests that at least one other factor than PS1, located downstream of the ER, is required for the -cleavage of APP-C99. In agreement, we found that intracellular -secretase processing of APP-C99-KK both at the 40 and the 42 site could be restored partially after brefeldin A treatment. Our data confirm the "spatial paradox" and raise several questions regarding the PS1 is -secretase hypothesis..

Nevertheless, APP-C99-dilysine (KK) colocalized with PS1 in the ER. In contrast, APP-C99 did not colocalize with PS1, but was efficiently processed by PS1-dependent -secretase. APP-C99 resides in a compartment that is negative for ER, intermediate compartment, and Golgi marker proteins. We conclude that -secretase cleavage of APP-C99 occurs in a specialized subcellular compartment where little or no PS1 is detected. This suggests that at least one other factor than PS1, located downstream of the ER, is required for the -cleavage of APP-C99. In agreement, we found that intracellular -secretase processing of APP-C99-KK both at the 40 and the 42 site could be restored partially after brefeldin A treatment. Our data confirm the "spatial paradox" and raise several questions regarding the PS1 is -secretase hypothesis..

PSs are multimembrane-spanning domain proteins, essentially located in the ER, the intermediate compartment, and the cis-Golgi region (Walter et al., 1996; Culvenor et al., 1997; Annaert et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2000). Some evidence for the presence of minute amounts of PS at the cell surface has been provided (Ray et al., 1999). APP is a type I transmembrane protein processed by secretases, resulting in the generation of various fragments, most notoriously the amyloid peptide (Ass). Aggregation of this peptide is considered to be a central event in the process leading to Alzheimer's disease (Selkoe, 1999). The ss-secretase BACE (ss-site amyloid cleaving enzyme) has been identified recently. It is an aspartyl protease cleaving APP at the NH2 terminus of the amyloid peptide sequence (Vassar et al., 1999). The -secretase cleaves in the Ass sequence itself, precluding further Ass production. Several members of the ADAM family (a disintegrin and metalloprotease), i.e., TACE, MDC9, and ADAM10, have been implied in -secretase processing of APP (Buxbaum et al., 1998; Koike et al., 1999; Lammich et al., 1999). Finally, presenilin 1 (PS1)-dependent -secretase cleavage of APP releases the COOH terminus of the amyloid peptide (De Strooper et al., 1998). PS-dependent -secretase activities are also involved in the processing of other integral membrane proteins like Notch and APLP-1 (De Strooper et al., 1999; Naruse et al., 1998; Song et al., 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999). This -secretase cleavage is a novel type of proteolytic processing, occurring in the hydrophobic environment of the cell membrane. In the case of Notch, the cleavage results in the release of its intracellular domain that regulates gene transcription in a process that has been called "regulated intramembrane proteolysis" (Annaert and De Strooper, 1999; Brown et al., 2000)..

First, -secretase cleavage of APP and Notch is inactivated partially in PS1-deficient cells and completely in PS1/PS2 double to deficient cells (De Strooper et al., 1998, 1999; Song et al., 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Herreman et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2000). Moreover, mutagenesis of one or two aspartyl residues located in transmembrane domain 6 or 7 results in dominant negative to like effects on -secretase cleavage, suggesting that these aspartates contribute to the active site of PS (Wolfe et al., 1999). Some similarities with the prepilin peptidases has been taken as further evidence that the PS are proteases (Steiner et al., 2000). However, the strongest argument in favor for this idea comes from the observation that several compounds that inhibit -secretase bind specifically to PS (Esler et al., 2000; Li et al., 2000; Seiffert et al., 2000). Nevertheless, direct proof that the PS can hydrolyze peptide bounds is still lacking..

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	12	Remarkably, both Notch and APP apparently first need proteolytical trimming of their extracellular domain by TACE and -/ss-secretase, respectively, to become a substrate for PS/-secretase (De Strooper et al., 1998; Brou et al., 2000; Mumm et al., 2000; Struhl and Adachi, 2000). These proteases are located downstream in the biosynthetic pathway and therefore both Notch and APP first have to leave the ER to become a substrate for PS/-secretase. Despite significant advances in our understanding of -secretase processing, it remains unclear how APP, after its cleavage by - or ss-secretase, becomes exposed to PS. Moreover, Ass appears to be produced mainly in the endosomal compartment (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Hartmann et al., 1997), whereas PS is abundantly present in the ER and intermediate compartment (Walter et al., 1996; Culvenor et al., 1997; Annaert et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2000). This problem can be summarized as "the spatial paradox" (Annaert and De Strooper, 1999) and we now tackle this problem further by analyzing the processing of a series of APP-trafficking mutants in primary cortical neurons derived from PS1+/+ or PS1-/- mice. We analyzed the consequences of restricting APP trafficking to certain subcellular compartments for the generation of total Ass and Ass42. Constructs tested: (a) APP with deleted cytosolic tail (APP-ct); (b) APP with a double lysine ER retention motif in its cytoplasmic tail (APP-KK); (c) APP with a cytoplasmic tail from the LDL receptor (APP-LDL); (d) APP truncated at the ss-secretase cleavage site (APP-C99); and (e) APP-C99 with a double lysine (KK) motif. The APP-ct is poorly reinternalized and stays for longer times at the cell surface (Tienari et al., 1996). The KK motif acts an ER-retrieval signal (Jackson et al., 1993; Gaynor et al., 1994) and therefore APP-KK colocalizes abundantly with endogenous PS1 (Peraus et al., 1997; Annaert et al., 1999). The APP-LDL recycles between the endosomal system and the cell surface (Annaert et al., 1999). APP-C99 is a direct substrate for -secretase and after addition of the KK ER retention motif (APP-C99-KK) we anticipated creating an excellent substrate for PS1/-secretase. Overall, our data confirm the spatial paradox in the PS-is--secretase hypothesis and provide evidence that the transfer of APP-C99 in a compartment downstream of the ER is needed in addition to processed PS1 to obtain -secretase activity in primary cultures of neurons..

Metabolically labeled full-length APP and secretase-cleaved APP fragments were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by phosphorimaging as described in Materials and methods. For all constructs, protein expression levels are very similar in PS1+/+ and in PS1-/- cells (Fig. 2 A). Both full-length wild-type and APP-LDL chimera run as a doublet (Fig. 2 A) of 120 kD, corresponding to mature- and immature-glycosylated APP. The majority for both the APP-KK and APP-ct recombinant proteins is, however, the immature protein. This is expected for APP-KK, as the dilysine motif actively retains the protein in pre-Golgi compartments. The stronger immature APP-ct band could reflect the rapid processing of the mature form by -secretase at the cell surface (Tienari et al., 1997). Next, we analyzed proteolytic fragments derived from the different APP mutants. Secretion of the soluble ectodomain after - or ss-secretase cleavage generated from the different trafficking mutants was not significantly altered by PS1 deficiency, although the APP-ct, for instance, produced roughly twice as many APPs (Fig. 2). ss-Cleaved COOH-terminal stubs (APP-CTF) derived from APP-WT accumulated strongly in PS1-/- neurons (Fig. 2 B), confirming previous data (De Strooper et al., 1998). Interestingly, the same relative accumulation was observed for APP-CTF derived from the APP-LDL chimera. Also, total Ass secretion was severely decreased in PS1-/- neurons transduced for APP-WT and APP-LDL (Fig. 2 B). Although the secretion of Ass42 derived from APP-LDL is reduced by 80% in PS1+/+ neurons, in line with previous observations (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Perez et al., 1999), the additional relative decrease caused by PS1-/- deficiency remained unaltered when compared with APP-WT (Fig. 2, B and C). Together, these data suggest that in the case of the APP-LDL chimera, the enhanced recycling in the endosomal limb does not directly influence PS1-dependent -secretase processing..

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	20	  The reduction of ss-cleaved APP-CTF in the APP-ct to transduced wild-type neurons is accompanied by an 80% decrease in secretion of total Ass and Ass42 (Fig. 2, A and C). Moreover, no relative accumulation of ss-cleaved APP-CTF in PS1-/- neurons was observed. All this can be explained by a predominant -secretase cleavage of APP-ct at or near the plasma membrane, as reflected by the increased secretion of APPs cleaved at the -secretase site and the concomitant fivefold increase in p3 secretion (Fig. 3) . Interestingly, secretion of p3 is dramatically inhibited in the absence of PS1 (Fig. 3, bottom), indicating that -stubs generated near or at the cell surface are still substrates for PS1-dependent -secretase processing. Therefore, the data on APP-ct and APP-LDL clearly demonstrate that PS1 is needed for normal -secretase processing in the late Golgi region, at the cell surface, and in the endosomal compartments..
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	21	In contrast to the other mutants, the levels of APPs and of the COOH-terminal ss-stubs generated from APP-KK are very low, confirming the low - and ss-secretase activity in the ER (Fig. 2, A and B). Accordingly, the total Ass (Fig. 2 B) and Ass42 (Fig. 2 C) secretion was also strongly reduced by 90%. However, when overexpressed in PS1-/- neurons, secretion of Ass peptides was inhibited to the same extent as observed for peptides derived from APP-WT (Fig. 2, B and C)..
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	22	To circumvent the need for "preactivation" of APP-KK by - or ss-secretase, we generated APP-C99-KK, corresponding to APP truncated at the ss-secretase site (Lichtenthaler et al., 1999) and containing the KK-ER retention motif. When expressed in neurons, APP-C99-KK migrated with the same apparent molecular weight (10 kD) as the ss-stub coming from APP-WT or the APP-C99 without KK motif (Fig. 4 A; Lichtenthaler et al., 1999). APP-C99, like APP-WT, can be processed by -secretase as reflected by the generation of -APPCTF (Fig. 4 A). APP-C99-KK, in contrast, is either not processed or processed very little by - or ss-secretase, confirming the specific retention of APP-C99-KK in the ER and cis-Golgi region. In line with the prediction that APP-C99 does not require - or ss-secretase cleavage to become a substrate for -secretase, an estimated sevenfold increase in total Ass secretion (Fig. 4 A) is observed. This effect is also observed with Ass42, as detected by ELISA (Fig. 4 B). The -secretase cleavage of APP-C99 is strongly inhibited in the absence of PS1 (Fig. 4 C). Most surprisingly, however, was the observation that APP-C99-KK, which was also expected to be a substrate for PS1--secretase because it is retained in the ER, turned out to yield little if any Ass peptides (Fig. 4, A and B). It is unlikely that the KK motif directly interfered with the recognition of C99 by the -secretase complex, since the cytoplasmic tail of APP can be removed without affecting -secretase cleavage (Fig. 3). Moreover, C99KK becomes a substrate for -secretase under conditions specified below. Alternatively, the low Ass secretion from neurons expressing APP-C99-KK might be explained by intracellular retention of newly formed Ass peptides. Again, this could be ruled out, as no increased amounts of Ass could be immunoprecipitated from cell extracts (result not shown, but see Fig. 7 below)..

Importantly, APP-C99-KK colocalized abundantly with PS1 (Fig. 5, D to F), indicating that the simple presence of PS1 is not sufficient for -secretase processing to occur. In this respect, it is important to note that we have demonstrated previously that PS1 in the ER is already processed towards NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments (Annaert et al., 1999). We next investigated the subcellular localization of APP-C99 in primary cortical neurons. APP-C99 is clearly not distributed in the ER (Fig. 6 , A to C), as deduced from the complete lack of colocalization with BIP. Similarly, little if any colocalization was observed with ERGIC-53 marking the intermediate compartment (arrowheads in Fig. 6, D to F, including horizontal section [arrow]). Most surprisingly, however, was the observation that APP-C99 immunoreactivity also essentially did not distribute into the Golgi apparatus as demonstrated by GM130 staining (Fig. 6, G to I). Finally, and despite APP-C99 being a good -secretase substrate (Fig. 4), this fragment does not colocalize with PS1 (arrowheads and vertical section in Fig. 6, J to L). This is in clear contrast to the colocalization of PS1 with the inactive -secretase substrate APP-C99-KK (see also Fig. 5)..

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	34	  To test the hypothesis that a component of a more downstream subcellular compartment is needed to process APP-C99-KK in the ER, we treated neurons expressing APP-C99 or APP-C99-KK with brefeldin A (BFA), a drug that causes a rapid redistribution of the Golgi apparatus into the ER (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989). This treatment resulted in a drastic reduction in APP-C99 to derived Ass secretion, whereas no difference was observed in the case of APP-C99-KK (Fig. 7 A). However, addition of BFA resulted in a strong increase in intracellular Ass generated from APP-C99-KK, towards levels indistinguishable from those obtained in BFA-treated APP-C99 to transduced cells. This suggests that some unknown factors required for -secretase activity are redistributed from the Golgi region to the ER, which appears to be sufficient to partially restore Ass production from APP-C99-KK. It has been suggested that Ass generated in the endoplasmic reticulum consists mainly of Ass ending at residue 42 (Chyung et al., 1997; Cook et al., 1997; Hartmann et al., 1997; Wild-Bode et al., 1997). Remarkably, although we detect little intracellular Ass under our experimental conditions (Fig. 7, A and B), treatment with BFA induces the generation of Ass peptides, ending at residue 40 as well as at residue 42 (Fig. 7 B)..
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	35	   Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References   Previous studies (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Hartmann et al., 1997; Tienari et al., 1997) have shown that Ass can be generated at the cell surface and in the endosomes of neurons, where little, if any, PS1 is present (Annaert et al., 1999). The first aim of the current study was to investigate to what extent -secretase activity in these subcellular compartments depends indeed on PS1. To this end we expressed APP-ct and APP-LDL, two previously characterized trafficking mutants of APP (Peraus et al., 1997; Tienari et al., 1997; Annaert et al., 1999), in neurons. APP-ct lacks the endocytosis signals in the cytoplasmic domain of APP and is therefore only slowly internalized. Compared with APP-WT, APP-ct is processed mainly by an -secretase activity at the cell surface (Sisodia, 1992; Tienari et al., 1997; Annaert et al., 1999). This results in the replacement of Ass production by a roughly equal production of p3, the product of consecutive - and -secretase activity (Figs. 2 and 3), confirming that the APP-ct construct indeed behaves as predicted. Therefore, p3 production from this substrate reflects mainly -secretase cleavage of the -APPCTF at the cell surface. Expression of this construct in PS1-deficient neurons resulted in a strong decrease of p3, demonstrating that -secretase cleavage at the cell surface depends on PS1 (Fig. 3). Since APPs secretion is not affected in the absence of PS1 (Fig. 3), we rule out the possibility that the decreased p3 production is caused by decreased -secretase activity in these PS1-deficient cells..
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	36	APP-LDL expression selectively increased Ass40 secretion, as predicted from its preferential localization in the endosomes (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Peraus et al., 1997; Perez et al., 1999). Again, in the absence of PS1, Ass generation from APP-LDL strongly decreased, demonstrating that -secretase processing of APP in the endosomes depends on PS1. It should be noted that we have not been able to detect any endogenous PS1 immunoreactivity at the cell surface or in the endosomes of the neuronal cells used in the current study (Annaert et al., 1999)..
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	37	We next investigated whether we could increase -secretase processing of APP in the ER and the intermediate compartment, which contain the bulk of PS1 immunoreactivity in these neurons. Although several authors have provided evidence that the ER is a production site of this peptide, in particular Ass42 (Chyung et al., 1997; Cook et al., 1997; Hartmann et al., 1997; Wild-Bode et al., 1997), we and others have not been able to confirm these observations (Annaert et al., 1999; Iwata et al., 2001; Maltese et al., 2001). As shown in Fig. 2, a severe decrease in both Ass40 and Ass42 secretion is observed when APP is retained in the ER by means of the double lysine retention motif (APP-KK). Since the retention of APP in the ER implies that cleavage by - and ss-secretase (residing in the TGN, cell surface, and endosomes) becomes strongly compromised, and since proteolytic trimming of the APP ectodomain is a prerequisite for further -secretase processing (Struhl and Adachi, 2000), it seems logical that the APP-KK mutation results in a strongly decreased -secretase cleavage and inhibition of Ass generation. It is by consequence difficult to interpret the data obtained with APP-KK in regard to -secretase sensitivity. Therefore, we generated the APP-C99 construct, which is a direct substrate for -secretase (Lichtenthaler et al., 1999), and added to it the double lysine ER retention motif. As shown in Fig. 5, this construct is indeed retained in the ER, where it codistributes abundantly with PS1. Although we expected increased Ass production, no significant amount of Ass could be precipitated from the wild-type neurons (Fig. 4; Iwata et al., 2001; Maltese et al., 2001). This result was even more significant, as neurons expressing APP-C99 secreted about seven times more total Ass, or specifically Ass42, than those expressing APP-WT. The possibility that the Ass generated from APP-C99-KK is retained in the cells was ruled out, since no significant accumulation of cells associated Ass could be demonstrated (Fig. 7 A, lane 9, and B, lanes 2 and 5)The possibility that the KK motif directly interfered with -secretase cleavage was ruled out by two observations. First, it is clear from the results with APP-ct that the cytoplasmic domain of APP is not involved in the processing of APP by -secretase. Second, treatment of the cell cultures with BFA could restore the processing of C99-KK, clearly demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of the KK mutations is a trans, and not a cis phenomenon (Fig. 7). It should be pointed out here that PS1 in the ER is already proteolytically processed by the "presenilinase" and present as PS1-CTF and PS1-NTF (Annaert et al., 1999), thus in the putative active conformation. It follows from these data that the simple colocalization of a substrate (APP-C99-KK) with its putative protease (PS1) is not sufficient for proteolytic cleavage..

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	39	We conclude that Ass production, including Ass42, can not occur directly in the ER and requires at least one factor derived from a post-ER compartment. This conclusion is corroborated by two important pieces of evidence from the current work. First, APP-C99, which is a good substrate for -secretase, is mainly localized in a PS1-, BIP-, and ERGIC53-negative subcellular compartment (Fig. 6). Although the characterization of this compartment requires further experimentation, this result suggests that at least the proteolytic cleavage of the APP-C99 substrate occurs in a non-ER compartment. The second, more important argument comes from the experiments using BFA. BFA is a drug that causes the redistribution of post-ER compartments into the ER (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989). Treatment with this drug was sufficient to restore partially -secretase processing of APP-C99-KK proving that at least one non-ER component is needed to activate -secretase in the ER (Fig. 7). BFA treatment results in -secretase processing of APP at position Ass42, something which could possibly be anticipated based on current knowledge (Chyung et al., 1997; Cook et al., 1997; Hartmann et al., 1997; Wild-Bode et al., 1997). Surprisingly, however, cleavage at position Ass40 is also observed (Fig. 7 B), which is believed to occur mainly in the late compartments of the secretory and in the endosomal limbs of the subcellular trafficking pathways (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Hartmann et al., 1997; Tienari et al., 1997)..

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	41	Summarizing, our data indicate that efficient -secretase cleavage of APP can occur in compartments that contain little, if any, PS1, and that no or little -secretase activity is observed in compartments where abundant (maturated) PS1 is residing. This is a surprising result since most of the data currently available imply that PS1 is closely involved in -secretase type enzymatic activity (De Strooper et al., 1998, 1999; Steiner et al., 1999, 2000; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Wolfe et al., 1999; Esler et al., 2000; Herreman et al., 2000; Li et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2000). The spatial paradox between PS1 localization and -secretase activity can be explained by two hypotheses: (a) the minute amounts of PS1 in post to cis-Golgi compartments are the active enzymes. This implies that in addition to activation by presenilinase, additional proteins from these compartments are needed to make PS1 enzymatically active; and (b) PS1 is actually not the -secretase but acts, probably in concert with other proteins in the ER and intermediate compartment, to dispatch APP or -secretase to the subcellular compartment where cleavage will occur. In this hypothesis, BFA treatment results in the relocalization of the catalytic subunit(s) of -secretase to the ER..

In some studies, the specificity of the antibodies used can be questioned (Dewji and Singer, 1997), but in polarized cell types like MDCK cells (Georgakopoulos et al., 1999) or in specialized cell membranes like growth cones or lamellipodia (Schwarzman et al., 1999), some PS1 seems to be located near or at the cell surface. Ray et al. (1999) provided evidence that PS1 can travel in complex with Notch to the cell surface, albeit that this conclusion was based on a single type of experimental approach, i.e., cell surface biotinylation. Furthermore, the hypothesis that PS travels together with its substrates from the ER to the cell surface and becomes activated there is probably not tenable if one takes into account that the relative amount of PS1 to its substrates is extremely low (Thinakaran et al., 1998). If PS1 needs to accompany every substrate that it will cleave from the ER to the cell surface, it becomes, given the limited amounts of PS available in any cell type, difficult to understand why strong overexpression of APP does not saturate the system and does not lead to inefficient -secretase processing..

In addition, the function of the "inactive" pool of PS1 in the ER also remains to be explained. From the BFA experiments it follows that at least one other component of a non-ER compartment is needed to obtain activated PS1. This component is not the elusive protease called "presenilinase" responsible for PS maturation, and most probably not nicastrin, since this protein is present in the ER (Yu et al., 2000)..

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	47	The second hypothesis, that PS1 is needed for the correct trafficking of -secretase and its substrates, finds some theoretical support in the analogy with the sterol regulatory element to binding protein (SREBP) to SCREB cleavage to activating protein (SCAP) complex and the regulation of the proteolytical cleavage of SREBP (Brown et al., 2000). SCAP is, like PS1, an ER resident, multitransmembrane domain to containing protein and regulates the trafficking of the membrane-bound transcription factor SREBP to post-ER compartments. Upon cholesterol depletion, SREBP travels to the cis-Golgi, where a site 1 protease cleaves SREBP in its luminal domain. The remaining NH2-terminal, membrane-bound fragment then becomes a substrate for a site 2 protease that cleaves in the transmembrane domain of SREBP (Rawson et al., 1997; Nohturfft et al., 1999). The coupling of vesicular protein transport and proteolysis provides a stringent control on the activation of the system and it could be envisaged that PS1, like SCAP, provides a similar control on APP (and Notch) processing. However, it should be pointed out that in case of SREBP processing, SCAP regulates its luminal cleavage and that the site 2 intramembraneous cleavage occurs by default. In case of PS1, its role is limited to the regulation of the intramembraneous -secretase cleavage (De Strooper et al., 1998)..

(1996); (b) addition of a di-lysine motif (QM mutated to KK, APP-KK) by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene); (c) exchange of its cytoplasmic domain with that of the LDL receptor (APP-LDL); (d) full deletion of the APP ectodomain until the Asp1 amino acid of the amyloid peptide region (ss-secretase site). An additional AspAla (DA) was cloned by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) between the last amino acid of the signal sequence (Ala) and the first of the Ass region (Lichtenthaler et al., 1999) (APP-C99). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to add the di-lysine motif (APP-C99-KK). Recombinant SFV containing the APP mutants were generated as described previously (De Strooper et al., 1995)..

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	5	Mutations in genes encoding presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 account for the majority of cases of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease. The presenilins have been localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, but which of the multiple hydrophobic segments of the polypeptide chain span the lipid bilayer is unclear. To address this question, we have constructed a series of chimeric molecules in which a topologically neutral reporter protein (a C-terminal fragment of prolactin) containing three artificial glycosylation sites is fused to presenilin 1 following each of the 10 potential transmembrane domains identified in hydrophobicity plots. We have expressed these chimeras by translation in reticulocyte lysate containing canine pancreatic microsomes and by synthesis in transfected COS cells. Based on utilization of the glycosylation sites and sensitivity of the reporter to protease digestion, we provide evidence that presenilin 1 has six transmembrane segments with the N and C termini in the cytoplasm. This model provides important clues to the potential functions of different parts of the presenilin molecule and how these might relate to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease..

Familial forms of AD have been linked to mutations in three different genes, encoding the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), and presenilin 2 (PS2) on chromosomes 21, 14, and 1, respectively (2-5). Over 50% of the cases of early-onset familial AD are attributable to mutations in the presenilin genes. The mutations that have been described include over 35 different amino acid substitutions, as well as an in-frame deletion of exon 9 (reviewed in Ref. 6)..

These proteins are expressed in a number of tissues in addition to brain and are encoded by several alternatively spliced mRNAs (4, 7, 8). The presenilins exhibit significant homology to a protein from Caenorhabditis elegans called SEL-12, which, based on genetic evidence, modulates signaling by the LIN-12/Notch pathway (9). They show weaker homology to SPE-4, a membrane protein of C. elegans sperm (10). Immunofluorescence localization studies of transfected cells indicate that the protein is present at steady-state primarily in the ER, and perhaps in the Golgi also, but probably not on the plasma membrane (11). In a neuronal cell line, PS1 expressed using a viral vector is localized to the cell body and dendrites (12). Recent evidence indicates that PS1 is proteolytically cleaved between amino acids 260 and 320 in transfected cells as well as in brain tissue, although the significance of this cleavage is unclear (13). There are reports that recombinant forms of PS2 can positively regulate apoptosis in lymphocytes and PC12 cells, but whether the endogenous protein normally functions in this way is unclear (14, 15). Taken together, none of the available evidence clearly identifies the physiological role of the presenilins. However, analysis of patient fibroblasts, transfected cells, and transgenic mice that co-express PS1 and APP indicate that pathogenic mutations in the presenilin protein enhance production of the amyloidgenic A42 fragment by 1.5-2-fold (16-19)..

There are several reasons for this. First, knowing which domains of the polypeptide lie in the cytoplasm and which in the lumen of the ER or Golgi will dictate hypotheses about the function of these domains. Second, experimental attempts to identify cytoplasmic proteins that interact with the presenilins using screening procedures such as the yeast two-hybrid system or interaction cloning require a knowledge of which segments of the polypeptide chain lie in the cytoplasm. Third, the membrane topology of the presenilins can be correlated with the positions of pathogenic mutations, providing clues to how these mutations alter the function of the proteins. Finally, knowledge of the membrane topology of the presenilins will allow a more detailed comparison with possible homologues than is possible simply on the basis of hydrophobicity plots..

We have constructed chimeras in which a prolactin reporter is fused after each of these hydrophobic regions (Fig. 1B). The reporter is a C-terminal fragment of bovine prolactin (residues 82-229) onto which we have appended three consensus sites for N-glycosylation, as well as an HA tag so that the proteins can be recognized by anti-HA as well as anti-prolactin antibodies. A number of studies have utilized this portion of prolactin as a reporter, since it lacks any signals that might influence the membrane orientation of the adjacent polypeptide (24-26). When the fusion proteins are synthesized on membrane-attached ribosomes, the reporter will be glycosylated and protected from proteases applied from the cytoplasmic surface only if it resides in the lumen of the ER, which is topologically equivalent to the extracellular space. The two techniques we have combined here, tagging a protein with artificial glycosylation sites and fusing it to a reporter molecule that can be recognized by antibody binding or enzymatic activity, have been used individually to map the topology of a number of other membrane proteins (27, 28). We recognize that although these techniques can provide evidence in support of a specific model of membrane topology, it is always possible that experimental modifications of the polypeptide chain may perturb its interaction with the lipid bilayer. Fig. 1. Hydrophobicity plot of PS1 and schematic illustration of fusion constructs. Panel A: Hydrophobicity plot of human PS1. The method of Kyte and Doolittle (31) was used with a window size of 10 residues. Amino acid positions bounding the 10 hydrophobic regions (HRs) are as follows: HR1, 78-101; HR2, 129-150; HR3, 158-178; HR4, 188-209; HR5, 217-234; HR6, 240-261; HR7, 278-294; HR8, 378-393; HR9, 404-424; and HR10, 430-445. (Numbering is based on the RNA splice variant that lacks exon 4 encoding the sequence VRSQ [ref. 8]). Panel B: PS1-prolactin fusion proteins. The prolactin (PRL) reporter was fused after each of the following residues of PS1: HR1, 128; HR2, 157; HR3, 187; HR4, 215; HR5, 239; HR6, 277; HR7, 376; HR8, 403; HR9, 429; and HR10, 463. The fusion point in each construct is positioned as C-terminal as possible to minimize any effects of the reporter on the topology of the adjacent hydrophobic region. NCT/NGS/NGT are three artificial glycosylation sites, and HA is a hemagglutinin tag engineered at the C terminus of the prolactin reporter. [View Larger Version of this Image (38K GIF file)].
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	25	We first translated synthetic mRNAs encoding the PS1-prolactin chimeras in a reticulocyte lysate system. In the absence of canine pancreatic microsomes, proteins ranging in size from 33 to 70 kDa were recovered after immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody, corresponding to the unglycosylated fusion proteins (Fig. 2A, lane 1). When translation was performed in the presence of microsomes, HR1-PRL, HR3-PRL, and HR5-PRL (but not the other constructs) yielded additional products of slightly higher molecular weight (Fig. 2A, lane 2). These larger products represent glycosylated forms of the proteins, since they are eliminated when samples are treated with N-glycosidase F (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). As has been observed by others (25, 26), glycosylation in the in vitro system is inefficient, resulting in the presence of some unglycosylated protein even when translation is performed with microsomes (Fig. 2A, lane 2; Fig. 2B, lane 3). We noted that PS1-PRL fusion proteins often migrated as closely spaced doublets on SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2); this phenomenon has been observed for full-length PS1 synthesized both in vitro and in transfected cells and is likely to result from an uncharacterized posttranslational modification (11, 12, 29). Fig. 2. In vitro translation of PS1-prolactin chimeras. Panel A: mRNAs encoding the HR-PRL constructs shown in Fig. 1B were translated in reticulocyte lysate in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lanes 2, 3, and 4) of canine pancreatic microsomes. Samples were then left untreated (lanes 1 and 2), or were digested with proteinase K in the absence (lane 3) or presence (lane 4) of Triton X-100. All samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. The unglycosylated fusion proteins are indicated by filled arrowheads, glycosylated forms by open arrowheads, and protease-protected fragments by asterisks. The protease-protected fragments, like the intact fusion proteins, sometimes migrated as doublets because of an unknown posttranslational modification, as described in the text (see lane 3 for HR1). Molecular mass markers are in kilodaltons. Panel B: mRNAs encoding HR1-PRL, HR3-PRL and HR5-PRL were translated in reticulocyte lysate in the absence (lanes 1 and 2) or presence (lanes 3 and 4) of canine pancreatic microsomes. Samples were then left untreated (lanes 1 and 3), or were digested with N-glycosidase F to remove N-linked sugars (lanes 2 and 4). Proteins were analyzed without immunoprecipitation to avoid distortion of the gel bands by immunoglobulin. Arrowheads mark the positions of glycosylated forms of the fusion proteins. A similar analysis of the other 7 chimeras showed that they were not glycosylated (not shown). [View Larger Version of this Image (54K GIF file)].

The protected fragment was glycosylated (not shown) and migrated approximately 7 kDa lower than the corresponding intact glycosylated protein (Fig. 2A, lane 2). The fragment was eliminated when microsomes were permeabilized with Triton X-100 prior to protease digestion (Fig. 2A, lane 4), demonstrating that it does not represent an intrinsically protease-resistant portion of the molecule. The protected fragment could be immunoprecipitated with anti-prolactin as well as anti-HA antibodies, but not with an antibody against the N terminus of PS1 (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 4), indicating that the N terminus is protease-accessible and is therefore cytoplasmic. Based on the 7-kDa reduction in molecular size, we infer that proteinase K removes approximately 70 amino acids from the N terminus of HR1-, HR3-, and HR5-PRL (up to a point near the beginning of HR1), but that the cytoplasmic loops between the transmembrane hydrophobic segments are resistant to cleavage, probably because they are short ( < 10 amino acids) and therefore closely apposed to the lipid bilayer (25).

We again observed that only HR1-, HR3-, and HR5-PRL were glycosylated, as indicated by a reduction in the molecular weight of these proteins upon treatment with N-glycosidase F (Fig. 4A). In contrast to the situation in reticulocyte lysate, glycosylation of these chimeras in COS cells was essentially quantitative, making it unlikely that the proteins are heterogeneous with respect to localization of the reporter. Each of these three fusion proteins also produces a protected fragment that is ~7 kDa smaller than the intact protein following proteinase K digestion of a postnuclear supernatant derived from the transfected cells (Fig. 4B); the other seven fusion proteins do not yield any protected fragments (data not shown).

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	30	Taken together, the results of glycosylation site utilization and protease protection both in vitro and in cells suggest the model of PS1 topology shown in Fig. 5. HR1, HR3, and HR5 span the membrane from the cytoplasmic to the lumenal side and HR2, HR4, and HR6 from the lumenal to the cytoplasmic side. Both the N and C termini are cytoplasmic. HR7-HR10 do not constitute transmembrane domains, although our analysis does not address the issue of whether these segments associate closely with the lipid bilayer in the manner of "reentrant loops" described for some channel proteins (25, 27, 30). This model places the two consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (asparagine residues 275 and 401) in the cytoplasm, consistent with the fact that full-length PS1 expressed in cells or by in vitro translation is not glycosylated (12, 23, 29). Given the high degree of homology between PS1 and PS2, we would predict that PS2 has the same membrane topology shown in Fig. 5. Although our data support a six-transmembrane domain structure for PS1, it is of course possible that the membrane topology of the native protein is different from the one we have inferred here based on the properties of PS1-prolactin fusions. However, the fusion of a reporter segment or the introduction of ectopic glycosylation sites has not been found to disturb the topology of a number of other membrane proteins (27, 28). Fig. 5. Model for the membrane topology of PS1. Although our data indicate that HR7-HR10 do not span the membrane, one or more of these hydrophobic segments may associate closely with the lipid bilayer.

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	31	Our results are consistent with those of Doan et al. (21) who concluded that PS1 has either six or eight transmembrane domains (their data did not distinguish between the two possibilities), with the N terminus, C terminus, and part of the "loop" region between residues 320 and 390 in the cytoplasm. However, our results differ from those of Li and Greenwald (22) who proposed a model for the C. elegans PS1 homologue SEL-12 having eight transmembrane segments, including HR1-HR6, HR-8, and HR-9. We think it unlikely on theoretical grounds that HR8 of PS1 spans the membrane, since it is short (16 amino acids) and is only marginally hydrophobic (see Fig. 1A). The identification of HR8 and HR9 as transmembrane segments in SEL-12 was inferred indirectly from the enzymatic activity of a pair of -galactosidase fusions in which HR8 was deleted, and it is possible that this deletion modified the membrane topology of the protein or altered the activity of the galactosidase reporter. It is also conceivable that the membrane topologies of PS1 and SEL-12 are different..

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	33	Our model for the topology of PS1 has important implications for the function of the protein and its role in AD. We find that most of the polypeptide chain of PS1 is cytoplasmic, including the N-terminal region and a long C-terminal tail encompassing HR7-HR10. These segments may therefore be important in interactions with cytoplasmic proteins. Much of the cytoplasmic region from HR6 to the C terminus, exclusive of the segment between HR7 and HR8, is highly conserved in the presenilins and SEL-12, suggesting essential functions for this domain. A number of pathogenic mutations are found between the end of HR6 and the end of HR7 (reviewed in Ref. 6), and one might speculate that these alter associations of PS1 with molecules in the cytoplasm. Since little of the polypeptide chain protrudes into the ER lumen, a direct interaction between PS1 and lumenal proteins seems unlikely, although associations with other ER membrane proteins are possible. If PS1 binds to APP, a possibility suggested by enhanced production of the A 42 fragment in cells expressing mutant PS1 (16-19), this interaction would most likely occur transiently during transit of APP through the ER and Golgi and would probably involve either the transmembrane region or short cytoplasmic tail of APP..

The recently described endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 (13), which is predicted to occur following HR6, would be expected to generate a C-terminal fragment that lacks any transmembrane segments. Whether this fragment is soluble would depend on how tightly HR7-HR10 are associated with the lipid bilayer, but if it were diffusible it could serve to transmit a signal to other regions of the cell. Knowing the membrane topology of PS1 will now facilitate attempts to isolate interacting molecules and will provide a starting point for further investigations of the biological activity of normal and mutant forms of the protein..

One of the most studied candidates is the insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism (indel) of the gene for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). This study aimed to clarify its association with Alzheimer's disease. The meta-analysis included 39 samples, comprising 6,037 cases of Alzheimer's disease and 12,099 controls, using mainly primary data. Potential interactions with gender, age, ethnic group, and carrier status of the apolipoprotein E 4 allele were all examined. D homozygotes were at reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (odds ratio = 0.81, 95% confidence interval: 0.72, 0.90; corrected p = 0.0004); I homozygotes showed no association with Alzheimer's disease, while heterozygotes were at increased risk. Although there were clear differences among the three ethnic groups examined (North Europeans, South Caucasians, and East Asians), in all groups D homozygotes were at reduced risk. These results confirm the association of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme indel with Alzheimer's disease across diverse populations, although this is probably due to linkage disequilibrium with the true risk factor. Further, in North Europeans, both association and Hardy-Weinberg analysis suggested partial heterosis, that is, an increased risk for heterozygotes, due to a hidden interaction with another, as yet unknown, risk factor. This interaction warrants further investigation..

D homozygotes were at reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (odds ratio = 0.81, 95% confidence interval: 0.72, 0.90; corrected p = 0.0004); I homozygotes showed no association with Alzheimer's disease, while heterozygotes were at increased risk. Although there were clear differences among the three ethnic groups examined (North Europeans, South Caucasians, and East Asians), in all groups D homozygotes were at reduced risk. These results confirm the association of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme indel with Alzheimer's disease across diverse populations, although this is probably due to linkage disequilibrium with the true risk factor. Further, in North Europeans, both association and Hardy-Weinberg analysis suggested partial heterosis, that is, an increased risk for heterozygotes, due to a hidden interaction with another, as yet unknown, risk factor. This interaction warrants further investigation..

(1) first proposed an association with Alzheimer's disease of the insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism (indel) in intron 16 of the gene for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) on chromosome 17q23. The enzyme converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is potently hypertensive. The D allele is associated with raised plasma levels of the enzyme (2, 3). Kehoe et al. (1) found that I positives, that is, DI + II, were at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. The study comprised three samples, from Cardiff and London in Britain and Belfast in Northern Ireland, with strikingly similar results..

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	23	Data analysis and statistical methods Three methods are commonly used to produce odds ratios in genetic association studies: method 1, allelic (i.e., D vs. I in this case); method 2, comparing each genotype with one other in turn (e.g., DD vs. DI); method 3, comparing each genotype in turn with the other two combined. All three methods are subject to bias, the degree of bias depending on how imperfectly the model fits reality. For instance, method 1 is best suited to testing a codominant model, where there is an allelic dose effect (e.g., DD  >  DI  >  II). Method 3, on the other hand, may be used to test either an I-dominant/D-recessive or a D-dominant/I-recessive model. We chose to follow the hypothesis-generating study (1) in using method 3, partly because preliminary examination of subsequent studies had shown no evidence of codominance. We also used both methods 2 and 3 to examine heterosis (heterozygotes at greater or lesser risk than either homozygote). Our main approach, method 3, gives an estimate of the risk associated with each genotype when compared with the rest of the population..
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	24	Pooled odds ratios were calculated three times, by the fixed-effects method of Mantel and Haenszel (29), by the random-effects method of DerSimonian and Laird (30), and by the Bayesian random-effects method of Warn et al. (31). However, as the results of all three methods were very similar, only those of the first two are shown (table 2). The methods of meta-analysis permit the accumulation of results across independent studies, even where the number of subjects or the ratio of cases to controls varies considerably, as here in the cohort of Sleegers et al. (9), for example. The heterogeneity test was by the method of Armitage (32). Logistic regression analysis was used to compare odds ratios among ethnic groups. Funnel plots (33) and cumulative meta-analysis (34) were used to investigate bias. Analyses were performed using "R" (35) and the package "rmeta" by Thomas Lumley (http://www.cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/rmeta.html). All tests of significance were two sided. A Bonferroni correction factor of 3 was applied to all p values by genotype..

Heterozygotes were at increased risk in North Europeans. I homozygotes were at higher risk in East Asians, except by Bayesian analysis. We further examined heterosis (heterozygotes at greater risk) in North Europeans, by comparing DI with DD and with II in turn.

Heterozygotes were at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease overall (table 2) and mainly in North Europeans (table 3). This example of heterosis will be discussed below. Very similar results were achieved by three methods: fixed effects, random effects, and Bayesian random effects (refer to Materials and Methods and table 2). Only genotypic comparisons were made (refer to Materials and Methods), which showed that there was no allelic dose effect, except in East Asians (table 3), and that thus allelic comparisons would have proved less informative..

The second possibility is discussed below. Regarding the former, Kehoe et al. (1) in their study of ACE haplotypes gave evidence that the indel may not be the actual risk factor but rather in linkage disequilibrium with a nearby functional polymorphism that is the true risk factor. ACE haplotype analysis has also proved of value with other phenotypes, such as enzyme levels (36), insulin levels, myocardial infarction, and obesity (37). Future Alzheimer's disease studies may do better to examine polymorphisms in the regulatory regions, rather than the indel..

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	58	Heterogeneity Our overall results showed heterogeneity (table 2). Heterogeneity may be due to differences in sample selection (e.g., in age, gender, or diagnosis) or in methods (e.g., of genotyping), or it may be due to real differences in populations (e.g., in race) or in interactions with other risk factors (e.g., APOE*4). We examined all of these potential sources of heterogeneity. We found little effect of age, gender, or APOE*4 status, thus confounding our initial hypothesis. Both diagnostic and genotyping differences contributed some heterogeneity. The former was mainly due to the diagnosis of "possible Alzheimer's disease," reported to have a poor record of confirmation at autopsy (38). The latter was largely due to certain genotyping methods that may lead to underreporting of heterozygotes (27, 28), as shown by Hardy-Weinberg analysis..

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	60	However, the greatest source of heterogeneity was ethnic differences. Ethnic stratification removed nearly all heterogeneity (table 3). There were clear contrasts among the three ethnic groups examined (North Europeans, South Caucasians, and East Asians) in allelic frequencies and in odds ratios (table 3). The latter might be due to differences in linkage disequilibrium with the true risk polymorphism (see above). Some of these ethnic differences had previously been pointed out by Panza et al. (17, 39), by Buss et al. (40), and by Elkins et al. (12). These contrasts highlight the dangers of combining ethnic groups within a single cohort, even North and South Europeans, as indicated by Panza et al. (17, 39). Unfortunately, there was only one cohort of African origin, from the United States (41). Thus, no conclusions could be drawn about Africans..

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	62	Heterosis Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are common in studies of the ACE indel, as previously pointed out by Buss et al. (40). This may be due to either mistyping or heterosis. Several cases of such disequilibrium were indeed compatible with mistyping. Most examples of disequilibrium in North Europeans, however, were of an excess of heterozygotes in Alzheimer's disease, which requires another explanation. We believe that explanation is heterosis. Heterosis occurs when heterozygotes show either a greater or lesser association with a given trait than does either group of homozygotes. In this case, in North Europeans, both an excess of heterozygotes in Alzheimer's disease and an association of heterozygotes with Alzheimer's disease were found. Comings and MacMurray (42) have suggested three explanations for heterosis, of which their second can be applied here. This proposes that heterosis may follow from the inadvertent combination of two unlike subsets due to a hidden interaction with another, unknown risk factor. To test this proposal, we constructed a mathematical model with two equal subsets based on a median split of an unknown factor X (table 4). The model illustrates how, although heterozygotes may have intermediate odds ratios in each subset, they can emerge with the highest odds ratio when the subsets are combined (i.e., heterosis). The overall results of this illustrative model (table 4) were very close to those of the present meta-analysis (table 2). We should stress, however, that heterosis was found only in North Europeans. Moreover, although heterozygotes were at greater risk than D homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.25, 95 percent confidence interval: 1.08, 1.45), they were not at significantly higher risk than I homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.08, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.95, 1.22). Thus, partial heterosis better describes this case..

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	66	Biologic background Full discussion of the biologic basis of these associations is outside the scope of this mainly analytical study. However, we note the associations of the ACE indel and of nearby polymorphisms with various phenotypes, including cardiovascular risk (37, 43 to 47). In addition, ACE protein levels are raised in certain brain regions with Alzheimer's disease (48 to 50), the enzyme has been reported to modify ss-amyloid aggregation (51), ACE inhibitors have been reported to maintain memory in aged rats (52) and in human patients (53), and brain-penetrating ACE inhibitors have been associated with both reduced incidence of Alzheimer's disease in elderly hypertensive patients (54) and less cognitive decline in cases with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (55). Sleegers et al. (9) have recently provided evidence from magnetic resonance imaging of increased atrophy in both the hippocampus and amygdala of nondemented women homozygous for the ACE*I allele, together with a modest but significant increase in risk of Alzheimer's disease, independent of vascular factors. The D allele is associated with raised plasma levels of ACE (2), but that association is thought to be due to linkage disequilibrium with other nearby polymorphisms (3, 36). There is an apparent conflict between the benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy and the associations of the indel with Alzheimer's disease risk and pathology and with plasma levels of ACE. However, the influence of ACE polymorphisms on brain levels of the enzyme is not yet known and cannot be assumed to reflect the levels in plasma. This subject warrants fuller discussion than is possible here. A more detailed discussion is given by Kehoe (56), although it will need to be reconsidered and perhaps revised in the light of any interacting factor or factors that may emerge in future studies..

The quality of diagnosis and of genotyping varied among studies, but our overall results were not changed when these questions were taken into account. There was considerable heterogeneity in our initial results. However, we found the main sources of that heterogeneity and were able to remove it. Since cardiovascular factors are strong candidates for a potential interaction with ACE variants, the lack of data available to us on those factors was a limitation, which we hope will be overcome by future studies. Cardiovascular factors might also have influenced our results through selective mortality. However, D homozygotes have only a very slightly increased risk of cardiovascular complications (43 to 47, 57) and little evidence of any association with reduced life span (57 to 62). Thus, the influence of selective mortality, if any, is likely to be very small and not enough to provide an alternative explanation for our findings..

The familial cases included 10 patients of autosomal dominant AD families sampled for linkage analysis studies. In all patients mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) had previously been excluded. Four different PS-1 missense mutations were identified in six familial cases, two of which where autosomal dominant cases. Three mutations resulted in onset ages above 55 years, with one segregating in an autosomal dominant family with mean onset age 64 years (range 50-78 years). One PS-2 mutation was identified in a sporadic case with onset age 62 years. Our mutation data provided estimates for PS-1 and PS-2 mutation frequencies in presenile AD of 6 and 1% respectively. When family history was accounted for mutation frequencies for PS-1 were 9% in familial cases and 18% in autosomal dominant cases. Further, polymorphisms were detected in the promoter and the 5'-non-coding region of PS-1 and in intronic and exonic sequences of PS-2 that will be useful in genetic association studies. INTRODUCTION.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	5	Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of senile dementia and the fourth leading cause of death in western societies. AD is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system characterized by progressive loss of memory and intellectual functioning due to the appearance in the brain of two major lesions: senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The exact biochemical pathway leading to neurodegeneration is still unknown. In most AD cases the first symptoms of memory dysfunction or behavior changes become apparent after age 65 years (late-onset or senile AD); however, in many cases the disease starts earlier in life (early-onset or presenile AD). There are no indications that the disease in presenile AD cases is different from that observed in senile AD cases, apart from a more severe pathology and more rapid clinical progression. Both senile and presenile AD have a genetic etiology; however, genetic cases are more frequent among presenile AD cases (for a review see 1 ). Also, several AD families have been documented that segregate presenile AD in an autosomal dominant manner. In these families a positional cloning approach has been employed to identify AD genes (for a review see 1 ). To date, three AD genes are known that, when mutated, lead to presenile AD: the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) on chromosome 21 at 21q21.1 (2 ); the presenilin-1 gene (PS-1) on chromosome 14 at 14q24.3(3 ); the presenilin-2 gene (PS-2) on chromosome 1 at 1q42.1 (4 ,5 ). Although the normal function of the amyloid precursor protein (app) is unknown, mutations have been demonstrated to alter endoproteolysis of app such that more of a 42 amino acid long form of amyloid [beta] (A[beta]42) is produced (6 ). Rapid deposition of A[beta]42 in AD brains is an early morphological event in AD pathology. Also, the normal and pathological functions of the presenilin proteins (ps-1 and ps-2) are unknown (for a review see 7 ). Since they both constitute integral membrane proteins with six to eight transmembrane domains (TM) and one large hydrophilic loop (HL) (8 ,9 ), similar functions of ps-1 and ps-2 were predicted. Remarkably, mutations in PS-1 and PS-2 also produce more A[beta]42, suggesting that PS mutations and APP mutations lead to AD pathology through a common biochemical pathway..

All mutations occur in exons 16 and 17, encoding the A[beta] proteolysis product of app. However, extensive mutation analyses have shown that mutations in APP are rare, since they segregate in only 5% of the presenile AD families (1 ). Since the PS genes were identified more recently (for a review see 7 ), extensive mutation analyses have not yet been performed. However, initial estimates based on linkage analysis studies suggested that 70% of the presenile AD families were linked to chromosome 14 (10 ). Later, a mutation in PS-1 was found in each chromosome 14-linked AD family (3 ,11 ,12 ). To date 42 different missense mutations and one in-frame splice site mutation in PS-1 have been reported in 82 families world wide (13 ). Mutation screenings of PS-1 in presenile AD families not selected on the basis of linkage to chromosome 14 indicated that PS-1 mutations contribute less (30-50%) than initially estimated (14 ,15 ). A possible explanation for the lower mutation frequency of PS-1 may be that the initial mutation data were biased towards finding PS-1 mutations, since most families analyzed had been included in a genome-wide search for AD genes and were known to be linked to chromosome 14. Only one mutation has been reported in a proven non-familial AD case (16 ); however, only few mutation studies of sporadic AD cases have been performed..

Apart from the one PS-2 mutation identified in the chromosome 1-linked group of Volga German AD families, only one other PS-2 mutation has been identified to date (5 ,17 ). However, in contrast to PS-1 families onset ages in PS-2 families are highly variable and usually later in life (13 ). Therefore, it cannot be excluded that PS-2 families may have been missed, since presenile AD families with earlier onset ages are more likely to be ascertained for linkage analysis studies since they have more clear inheritance patterns. To date no mutation reports of PS-2 in non-familial presenile AD cases have been published; however, PS-2 has been less intensively investigated for mutations than PS-1..

To overcome several of the biases mentioned above we used a unique sample of 101 unrelated familial and sporadic presenile AD cases ascertained in a population-based manner in The Netherlands (18 ,19 ). The sample contained 11 autosomal dominant, 56 familial and 34 sporadic presenile AD cases. The mean onset age was 56.7  plus or minus  5.4 years (range 45-64 years), being lower than 60 years in 71 cases and lower than 50 years in 10 cases. In the autosomal dominant AD families all probands had an onset age before 65 years; however, in four families the mean onset age was above 65 years. In addition we analyzed the families of 10 autosomal dominant presenile AD cases included in this population-based study (20 ). In all cases mutations in exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene were previously excluded (19 ,20 ) while one family was shown to be linked to chromosome 14 (20 )..

0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	18	In PS-1 we identified four missense mutations in exons 4, 5, 7 and 9 respectively and one intronic polymorphism in intron 8 (Tables 2 and 3 and Fig. 1 ). The Ala79Val mutation was identified in three patients (1005, 1061 and 1087) (Table 2 ). To test whether the mutation in the three patients has the same ancestral origin we genotyped three simple tandem repeat (STR) markers flanking PS-1 (23 ,24 ). For D14S1028, D14S77 and D14S1004 all patients shared one common allele with allele frequencies calculated among the cases of respectively 0.27, 0.05 and 0.12. These data suggested that the three patients carrying the Ala79Val mutation might be related, although not closely, since genealogy studies had not indicated a familial relationship. The other three mutations occurred only once and none of the mutations were present in the 118 control individuals. The polymorphism observed in intron 8 is identical to that reported by Wragg et al. (25 ) and allele frequencies were determined by the primer mismatch PCR assay described by those authors (Table 3 ). Since the SSCP pattern of the intron 8 polymorphism could have masked the presence of mutations, we sequenced exon 8 in all cases. No other mutations were found..

0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	20	In one patient a missense mutation in PS-2 was detected, resulting in an Arg - >  His substitution at codon 62 in exon 4 (Table 2 and Fig. 1 A). Restriction digestion analysis showed that the mutation was absent in the other patients and controls. In addition, SSCP and sequence analysis of exon 4 identified two different polymorphisms in intron 3 and at codon His87 respectively (Table 3 ). Also, the SSCP patterns observed for exons 3, 5, 7 and 11 were due to polymorphisms, since the nucleotide changes involved intronic variations or exonic silent mutations (Table 3 and Fig. 1 B). The polymorphism in exon 5 (Thr122) was seen in only one patient and represents a very rare polymorphism. Also, the polymorphism in exon 7 (Ser236) is rare, since it was seen in only two patients. The allele frequencies of the other more frequent polymorphisms were estimated in the 118 control individuals by restriction enzyme digestion (Table 3 ). Comparison of the allele distribution in 15 control individuals showed that the two exon 3 polymorphisms are in linkage disequilibrium. Also, the two exon 4 polymorphisms are in linkage disequilibrium. Further, we demonstrated that the PS-2 polymorphisms in exons 3 (Ala23) and 4 (His87) and intron 11 show Mendelian inheritance..

All but one of the mutations (7 ,27 ) are novel mutations that were absent in 118 control individuals. Based on our mutation data we calculated a mutation frequency of 6% for PS-1 and 1% for PS-2 in presenile AD. Since all PS-1 mutations occurred in familial cases, i.e. cases with at least one first degree relative with AD, the mutation frequency is estimated at 9% (six out of 67 cases) in familial presenile AD cases. Among the familial cases in our study there were 11 cases belonging to families fulfilling our rigid criteria for autosomal dominant AD, i.e. three patients in two generations with a clinical diagnosis of AD in at least two cases (20 ). In two autosomal dominant families a PS-1 mutation was found resulting in a mutation frequency of 18% (two out of 11 cases) in autosomal dominant presenile AD..

However, we systematically analyzed each PCR-amplified exon of PS-1 and PS-2 together with positive controls of known mutations in the presence and absence of glycerol as denaturant. Mutations in PS-1 and PS-2 may also have been masked by polymorphisms in exonic and flanking intronic sequences. When polymorphic SSCP patterns were observed we sequenced the PCR products in five to 10 cases showing homozygous and heterozygous SSCP patterns. In each case the underlying polymorphism was detected and confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion of the amplified product. The efficiency of our mutation analysis strategy is demonstrated by detection of a mutation in exon 4 of PS-2 in one patient that had a unique SSCP pattern different from that of the polymorphic SSCP patterns observed for exon 4. Also, sequence analysis of the polymorphic PCR products of exon 8 of PS-1 identified no mutations..

0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	33	The onset age in the PS-1 mutation cases varied from 45 to 58 years, with three mutations (Ala79Val, Ala231Val and Glu318Gly) having onset ages above 55 years (Table 2 ). Most PS-1 mutations reported so far had onset ages between 35 and 55 years (29 ). However, the majority of these mutations were located in exons 5 and 8, coding in part for TM II and the large HL after TM VI (13 ). Here the mutations are predicted to interfere with the [alpha]-helical structure of TM II or the proteolytic processing of ps-1 occurring in HL VI (7 ). The ps-1 mutations identified in this study are located in the N-terminal region (Ala79Val in exon 4), in TM V (Ala231Val in exon 7) and in the middle part of HL VI (Glu318Gly in exon 9). Most likely these mutations have a milder effect on ps-1 functioning, possibly because the amino acid changes are semi-conserved (Ala79Val and Ala231Val) or they are located in a functionally less important region (Glu318Gly). The Glu318 mutation is located in a region of ps-1 that is less conserved in ps-2 and ps of other species (13 ). Also, co-segregation of the Glu318Gly mutation with AD could not be demonstrated, since no other relatives in family 1069 were available. High variability in onset age was observed in PS-1 family 1005 segregating the Ala79Val mutation with a mean onset age in the family of 64 years, ranging from 55 to 78 years. In one mutation carrier the disease was not yet fully penetrant at age 76 years. Possibly, the onset age in this family is modulated by other genetic and/or environmental factors. In this respect it is important to note that the non-penetrant case had an APOE [epsilon]3[epsilon]3 genotype, which may have delayed his onset age (30 ). However, APOE studies in larger samples of PS-1 cases and families are needed to conclude that the APOE genotype modulates expression of PS-1 mutations. Also, no effect of the APOE genotype on onset age was observed in chromosome 14-linked AD families with PS-1 mutations, leading to very early onset ages and severe phenotypes (31 ). Another possibility is that the PS-1-linked phenotype is modulated by a polymorphism in ps-2 or that mutations in ps-1 and ps-2 act together to express the disease phenotype (digenic effect). However, SSCP analysis as well as RT-PCR analysis of PS-2 cDNA did not detect sequence alterations in ps-2. Family 1005 is also of particular interest since in this family several patients had been identified with cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) (Fig. 2 ). However, none of them carried the PS-1 mutation, indicating that the CVAs in this family are not related to presenile AD. In contrast to the previous three PS-1 mutations, the Tyr115Cys mutation in exon 5, corresponding to HL I, was detected in chromosome 14-linked family 1066, with mean onset age of 42 years (range 39-49 years) (20 ). The latter provides evidence that some of the earlier mutation studies may indeed have been biased towards finding PS-1 mutations resulting in earlier onset ages and more severe phenotypes..

0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	35	Only one PS-2 mutation, Arg62His, was observed in a sporadic AD case with an onset age of 62 years. The two published PS-2 mutations had been identified in autosomal dominant families with presenile AD in TM II and TM V of ps-2 (4 ,5 ). The mutated Arg62 codon is not conserved in human ps-1 and ps of other mammalian species and is located in a region of the N-terminal domain that is generally not conserved between ps-1, ps-2 and the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog sel-12 (32 ). Also, the mutation itself is a conserved amino acid substitution. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that this ps-2 mutation is a rare polymorphism not related to AD pathogenesis, since the patient also had an APOE [epsilon]3[epsilon]4 genotype which may have increased her risk of developing AD (30 )..

Also, the frequency of PS-1 mutations in autosomal dominant AD families (18%) is less frequent than initially estimated. No mutations were identified in exons 16 and 17 of APP of any of the cases (33 ), suggesting that other AD genes must exist. It is possible that a fraction of the cases may be attributed to the presence of an APOE [epsilon]4 allele. In a previous study of this population-based sample we demonstrated that the risk for developing presenile AD is significantly increased in APOE [epsilon]4 homozygotes independent of family history and in APOE [epsilon]4 heterozygotes in which the family history is positive (33 ). In the sample of 101 cases there were 19 APOE [epsilon]4 homozygotes and 31 familial APOE [epsilon]4 heterozygotes..

0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	39	In contrast to previous reports (29 ), we observed several PS-1 mutations leading to AD with onset ages above 55 years. Also, one of these PS-1 mutations was identified in an autosomal dominant family with a mean onset age of 64 years (range 55-78 years). The identification of these PS-1 mutations predicts that PS-1 mutations with even milder effects on ps-1 functioning may be present in senile AD. This is of particular importance since a genetic association between an intronic PS-1 polymorphism and senile AD has been reported (25 ), although this association could not be replicated in all studies. Possibly, the association is the result of a functionally more relevant sequence variation elsewhere in the PS-1 gene. Preliminary data obtained by sequence analysis failed to demonstrate sequence variations in the coding region of PS-1 (25 ). However, the promoter and 5'-non-coding region of PS-1 had not been examined, since these sequences became available only recently. In this respect the identification by us of two polymorphisms in the 5'-non-coding region of PS-1 is of interest, since these polymorphisms may be used in genetic association studies to test whether PS-1 is also a susceptibility gene for senile and/or presenile AD. Also, the intronic and exonic polymorphisms identified in PS-2 are useful to test the role of this gene in AD, an analysis that has not yet been performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects.

To accurately examine the effect of missense mutations on APP metabolism and A[beta] production in vivo, we have introduced yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing the entire ~400 kbp human APP gene encoding APP harboring either the asparagine for lysine and leucine for methionine FAD substitution at codons 670 and 671 (APPK670N/M671L), the isoleucine for valine FAD substitution at codon 717 (APPV717I) or a combination of both substitutions into transgenic mice. We demonstrate that, relative to YAC transgenic mice expressing wild-type APP, high levels of A[beta] peptides are detected in the brains of YAC transgenic mice expressing human APPK670N/M671L that is associated with a concomitant diminution in the levels of [alpha]-secretase-generated soluble APP derivatives. Moreover, the levels of longer A[beta] peptides (species terminating at amino acids 42/43) are elevated in YAC transgenic mice expressing human APPV717I.

APP, a type I integral membrane glycoprotein of unknown function, matures through the constitutive secretory pathway and is processed by several pathways, including: cleavage by [alpha]-secretase at position 16 of A[beta], resulting in secretion of the APP ectodomain, thus precluding A[beta] formation; degradation through endosomal-lysosomal pathways; cleavage by [beta]- and [gamma]-secretases at the N- and C-termini of A[beta] respectively, resulting in production and secretion of A[beta] peptides (reviewed in 8 ). Missense mutations in APP occur in a small subset ( < 5%) of individuals with early onset FAD. In two large related FAD pedigrees in Sweden (9 ) a double mutation at codons 670 and 671 (of APP-770) results in substitution of lysine for asparagine and methionine for leucine (APPK670N/M671L).

(A) A mutation (m) is introduced in vitro into a given DNA sequence contained on a YAC (with TRPI and URA3 arms) and cloned into plasmid p680 (30), which contains the yeast Leu2 and Cyh2 genes. Cutting the plasmid DNA at a unique site (R) on one side of the mutation as well as introduction of the linear molecule into yeast containing the YAC and selection for Leu+ transformants result in targeted integration of the plasmid to the corresponding genomic sequence on the YAC. (B) Subsequent selection for Cyhr transformants results in excision of the plasmid and generation of the wt or mutated sequence. (C) High molecular weight DNA from a yeast strain containing the APP YAC and four representative ES transformants (see Table 1) were digested with HindIII, transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with a human Alu repetitive element (5).

In contrast, our efforts were designed to introduce the entire ~400 kbp human APP gene harboring the FAD mutations into the germline of transgenic mice, thus allowing for the proper spatial and temporal expression of mutant APP with appropriate splice donor and acceptor sites needed to generate the entire spectrum of alternatively spliced APP transcripts and encoded proteins.

Several mutations have been identified in the APP gene that co-segregate with affected individuals in FAD pedigrees (reviewed in 1 ). Although multiple APP transgenic mice have been generated in attempts to develop animal models of AD (reviewed in 25 ; see also 26 -28 ), the molecular mechanisms involved in altered APP metabolism and A[beta] deposition in individuals with FAD-linked mutations in APP have not been fully clarified. The present report provides insight into theeffects of the APPK670N/M671L and APPV717I FAD mutations on APP metabolism and A[beta] production in an in vivo setting that mimics the conditions occurring in individuals with the FAD mutations. We have generated lines of transgenic mice that contain the entire human APP gene carried on a 650 kbp YAC with theAPPK670N/M671L mutation, the APPV717I mutation or both mutations together. In these mice mutant human APP transcripts and protein(s) are expressed in spatial and temporal patterns similar to the endogenous mouse products in both brain and peripheral tissues. Western blot analysis and sensitive ELISAs of whole brain homogenates demonstrated that in mice expressing APPK670N/M671L cell-associated C-terminal APP fragments containing the A[beta] domain and A[beta] peptides were elevated concomitant with a reduction in the levels of release of [alpha]-secretase-cleaved APP products.

Initial experiments with exon trapping from the 650 kbp APP YAC revealed the presence of five additional exons that do not encode for APP (J.J.Yeh, B.T.Lamb and J.D.Gearhart, unpublished observations). While four of theses exons did not reveal substantial identity with sequences in the database, one trapped exon of 103 nt revealed complete identity with bp 167-269 (exon 2) and amino acid residues 1-25 of the human transcription factor GABPA (E4TF1-60) gene (GenBank accession no. D13318), consistent with the localization of this gene to chromosome 21q21.2 (31 ,32 ). This transcription factor contains an ets-related DNA binding domain which binds to DNA at CGGAAA/G sequences and forms heterodimers with other polypeptides (33 ). Although it remains unclear whether the entire GABPA gene is present on the 650 kbp APP YAC, the biochemical abnormalities observed in the mutant APP YAC transgenic mice likely reflect a property unique to the mutant APP polypeptide and not dosage imbalance for GABPA, as we have generated both wt and mutant APP YAC transgenic mice that express APP at a similar level (i.e. wt line Py8.9 and mutant line J1.96)..

Full-length PS1 and PS2 are each processed into stable proteolytic fragments after their biosynthesis in transfected cells. PS1 and PS2 have been localized by immunocytochemistry to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments, but previous studies could not differentiate between the full-length presenilin proteins and their fragments. We carried out subcellular fractionation of cells stably transfected with PS1 or PS2 to determine the localization of full-length presenilins and their fragments. Full-length PS1 and PS2 were principally distributed in ER fractions, whereas the N- and C-terminal fragments were localized predominantly to the Golgi fractions. In cells expressing the PS1 mutant lacking exon 9 (E9), we observed only full-length molecules that were present in the ER and Golgi fractions. The turnover rate was considerably slower for the E9 holoprotein, apparently due to decreased degradation within the ER. Our results suggest that that full-length presenilin proteins are primarily ER resident molecules and undergo endoproteolysis within the ER. The fragments are subsequently transported to the Golgi compartment, where their turnover rate is much slower than that of the full-length presenilin in the ER..

In a subset of cases, familial AD (FAD) occurs as an inherited autosomal dominant disease. Mutations in three different genes are associated with the familial form of AD (reviewed in Ref. 1). The first FAD gene is the -amyloid precursor protein (APP), the precursor to amyloid -protein, the major component of senile plaques seen in brains of AD individuals. The other genes, presenilin 1 (PS1) on chromosome 14 (2) and presenilin 2 (PS2) on chromosome 1 (3, 4), account for the majority of the early onset cases of FAD..

In transfected cells, both PS1 and PS2 holoprotein are rapidly turned over with a half-life of under 1 h (9, 10). However, in transfected cells and in brain tissue, stable N- (NTF) and C-terminal fragments (CTF) are apparently generated by endoproteolysis from full-length presenilin molecules (9, 11, 12). Immunolocalization studies of presenilins in transfected cells have demonstrated a predominant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi distribution (13, 14). The localization pattern is similar regardless of whether the antibodies are generated to either N- or C-terminal epitopes, raising the possibility that the NTFs and CTFs remain in proximity to each other. However, these studies cannot distinguish the full-length presenilin molecules from the stable fragments. APP is also located in the ER and Golgi, where direct or indirect interaction with the presenilins may contribute to the production of longer forms of amyloid -peptide (A) (15-17). Thus, knowledge of the processing and trafficking of presenilin molecules is important to our understanding of the pathways of A production..

Interestingly, a PS1 FAD mutation lacking exon 9 (E9) that results in the absence of conventional endoproteolysis (12) can nevertheless functionally replace an egg-laying defect resulting from a C. elegans sel-12 mutant (5). To date, neither the subcellular distribution of the holoprotein and its fragments nor the compartment where endoproteolytic cleavage occurs is known. To define the distribution of full-length forms and stable fragments of PS1 and PS2, we carried out subcellular fractionation of stably transfected cells. Our results indicate that full-length PS1 and PS2 are located mainly in the ER, while their N- and C-terminal fragments are located principally in the Golgi. Turnover rate of the E9 mutant PS1 protein was slower than wild type (WT) PS1 holoprotein. Concomitantly, the steady state subcellular distribution of E9 PS1 extends to both ER and Golgi fractions.

Thus, although sucrose, glycerol, and Ficoll are widely used for gradient fractionation of cellular membranes, they are not ideal in osmolality and viscosity.

The advantage of using Iodixanol gradient is that osmolality and viscosity remain relatively constant with changes in the density of the gradient. Under this mild iso-osmotic condition, all organelles and endosomes can be isolated intact, without loss of water as the density of the gradient increases.

Subcellular vesicles were separated on 1-20% continuous Iodixanol gradients as described under "Materials and Methods." ER-rich fractions were found, as expected, at the bottom of the gradient, using an antibody against the well characterized ER marker protein, calnexin (21) (Fig. 1, A and B). Calnexin-reactive ER vesicles were most enriched in fractions 1-4. Golgi-containing fractions were identified by assaying for -1,4-galactosyltransferase, a trans-Golgi enzyme (20), and this was principally found in fractions 4-7 (Fig. 1, A and B). Immunoreactivity against Na+/K+-ATPase, a marker for plasma membrane, was found on the top of the gradient, i.e. fractions 9-12, although lesser amounts of immunoreactivity were also present in the mid-density region (fractions 5-8) (not shown). The latter reactivity was derived from molecules transiting the Golgi. As an additional marker, CHO cells stably expressing WT APP751 were fractionated and analyzed by blotting with antibody CT15 (to the C terminus of APP). As expected, the immature (primarily N-glycosylated) forms of APP appeared in the ER-rich fractions (fractions 1-4) (Fig. 1C), whereas the mature (N- plus O-glycosylated) forms of APP appeared only in Golgi-rich fractions 4-7.

Antibody J27 raised to the N terminus of PS1 recognized a ~45-kDa PS1 holoprotein derived from the transgene mainly in gradient fractions 1-4, where it co-localized with the ER marker calnexin (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the major N-terminal endoproteolytic fragment (~29 kDa) was consistently localized to the lighter fractions toward the middle of the gradient, principally in fractions 4-7 (Fig. 2, A and B). Similarly, the major C-terminal fragment (~18 kDa) was distributed in fractions 3-8 (Fig. 2, C and D). Both PS1 NTF and CTF colocalized with the Golgi marker, -1,4-galactosyl-transferase.

Antibody J27 raised to the N terminus of PS1 recognized a ~45-kDa PS1 holoprotein derived from the transgene mainly in gradient fractions 1-4, where it co-localized with the ER marker calnexin (Fig. 2, A and B).

The signal from full-length PS1, NTF, and CTF in each fraction was expressed as a percentage of the sum of all of the fractions (B and D). PS1 holoprotein was found mainly in gradient fractions 1-4, co-localized with the ER marker calnexin. The ~29-kDa major NTF was located principally in fractions 4-7.

Full-length PS2 molecules were detected as a characteristic ~50-kDa band principally in ER-rich fractions 3 and 4 (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas the N-terminal fragment was localized primarily in Golgi-rich fractions 5-8. Moreover, as seen above with PS1 mutations, the distribution of the N141I mutant form of PS2 was identical to that of WT PS2 (data not shown).

However, E9 mutant protein, which does not undergo the conventional endoproteolytic cleavage (12), was widely distributed throughout the gradient fractions (Fig. 4, A and B). The extension of E9 PS1 into the lighter Golgi fractions was not a result of overexpression, because the same result was seen when muristerone A was reduced in this cell line to match the level of expression seen in WT PS1-transfected 293 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). As expected, we observed no conventional proteolytic fragments from E9 PS1 protein. Furthermore, as reported (22), the level of N-terminal fragment derived from endogenous PS1 decreased as the E9 PS1 expression increased with higher muristerone A induction (Fig. 4A). The distribution of the NTF in the WT PS1 and E9-transfected cell lines, the latter with or without induction, was identical; in the case of the latter cells, the NTF was derived only from endogenous PS1. Therefore, the subcellular distribution of transgene-derived PS1 fragments was not altered by the transfection or overexpression..

The cells were induced with the amount of muristerone A indicated on the left. The signals from WT and E9 PS1 cells induced with 1  microM and 0.125  microM muristerone A, respectively, were quantitated from each fraction and expressed as a percentage of the total signal. Mutant E9 holoprotein, in contrast to WT PS1, extended from ER to Golgi fractions.

Futhermore, our results showed that E9 protein, extending from ER to Golgi-rich and lighter fractions, had a distinctly different subcellular distribution as compared with WT PS1 holoprotein. To determine whether the E9 mutant has a different turnover rate, WT and E9 PS1 stably transfected 293 cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min and chased for 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 h. The half-life of WT PS1 was under 1 h (average of approximately 50 min from multiple experiments) for the holoprotein and more than 8 h for the NTF (Fig. 5, A and B). On the other hand, the half-life of E9 was consistently twice as long as WT PS1 holoprotein (Fig. 5, A and B). At steady state conditions as documented in the experiments described above, E9 protein was also present in the Golgi fractions, where stable proteolytic fragments derived from endogenous PS1 were located. Surprisingly, the distribution of the E9 mutant PS1 was not substantially altered during the chase period (Fig. 5C). After 4 h, the profile of E9 protein was similar to that seen at earlier time points, i.e. predominantly in ER fractions, whereas there was virtually no labeled PS1 WT holoprotein remaining in the cell (Fig. 5C). Therefore, diminished degradation within the ER appears to account in large part for the prolonged half-life of E9 rather than a shift of the proteins into the Golgi fractions, where the turnover rate may be slowed..

After overnight induction with 1  microM (WT PS1) and 0.125  microM (E9) muristerone A, the cells were pulse-labeled and chased for 0-8 h. An aliquot of cells at each time point was lysed and immunoprecipitated with the N-terminal antibody, J27 (A). The signal at each time point of the chase period shown in A was quantitated and expressed as a percentage of time 0 (B). In this experiment, the half-life of WT PS1 and E9 was 40 and 80 min, respectively. In C, immunoprecipitation with J27 antibody was performed from each fraction after Iodixanol separation at time 0 and after 1 and 4 h of chase. Note that the distributions of both WT PS1 and E9 holoprotein were not substantially changed during 0-4 h of chase. The gradient fractions showed that the longer half-life of E9 was due primarily to diminished turnover of protein in the ER fractions. The distribution of NTF (arrowhead) in PS1 WT cells was shifted from the dense to lighter fractions during the chase period (top). NTF derived from endogenous PS1 in E9 cells did not appear until the 4 h time point (bottom)..
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	43	Closer inspection of the NTF generated during the pulse-chase period showed that at time 0, small amounts of labeled NTF can be detected in the PS1 WT cell line (Fig. 5C). Surprisingly, at this time point, the distribution of NTF was virtually identical to the full-length protein, i.e. with the peak signal in fractions 3 and 4. After 1 h of chase, the levels of labeled NTF were increased and were distributed more widely, extending into the lighter fractions. Finally, after 4 h of chase, labeled NTF was predominantly within the Golgi-enriched fractions, similar to that seen at the steady state conditions. These findings indicated that the initial cleavage of PS1 occurred in the ER and the proteolytic fragments were subsequently transported to the Golgi. Similar localization of labeled NTF to the Golgi fractions was seen in E9 cell line at the 4-h chase time, representing fragments derived from endogenous PS1 (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, endogenous NTF in the E9 cell line was not visible until the 4-h time point, suggesting a delay in the formation of this proteolytic species..

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	45	The mechanisms by which mutations in PS1 and PS2 result in the early onset of the AD phenotype are unclear. It is hypothesized that the selective increase in the production and release of the amyloidogenic A42 as a result of the presenilin mutations is a key factor in the pathogenesis of FAD (10, 23-26). At present, the intracellular compartment where presenilin interacts directly or indirectly with APP is unknown. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of presenilins in transfected cells. Our results showed that PS1 and PS2 are similarly distributed, with holoproteins being principally located in the ER, while the stable PS1 and PS2 fragments were principally located in the Golgi. The E9 PS1 mutation results in a broader distribution of the protein in both ER and Golgi-rich fractions as well as a prolonged turnover rate due to diminished degradation within the ER. Our results also indicate that endoproteolysis to generate stable N- and C-terminal fragments occurs in the ER..

These studies, however, could not distinguish the signals derived from full-length protein versus stable NTFs and CTFs. We therefore carried out subcellular fractionations of CHO and 293 cells stably transfected with PS1 or PS2 to determine the localization of full-length presenilin and its fragments. Our results showed that full-length PS1 and PS2 were distributed in dense fractions that colocalized with the ER marker, calnexin. Both stable NTF and CTF were distributed predominantly in the lighter fractions that colocalized with the Golgi marker, -galactosyltransferase activity. In these gradient fractions, the ER and Golgi fractions overlapped with each other and did not represent distinct populations. We also cannot exclude the possibility of other organelles containing presenilins that may co-purify into same gradient fractions. Therefore, our studies can only determine the predominant localization of these presenilin protein species to these compartments. Lesser amounts of protein in other locations cannot be excluded, nor did we examine the nuclear localization of the presenilins as was reported recently (27). Nonetheless, the clear subcellular separation between the full-length presenilins and the stable fragments is noteworthy, because it is not known whether the normal physiological function of presenilin is provided by full-length molecules or proteolytic fragments..

Therefore, most mutations do not overtly alter presenilin trafficking. In contrast, the noncleavable E9 PS1 mutant was localized to a larger number of gradient fractions, being distributed to both ER and Golgi fractions. In addition, as was shown recently (22), pulse-chase studies showed that the turnover rate of E9 mutant protein was considerably slower than WT PS1 holoprotein. We initially speculated that the transport of E9 to the Golgi compartment where the stable presenilin fragments are located may underlie the decrease in turnover rate of this mutant protein species. However, pulse-chase labeling combined with subcellular fractionation showed that a significant pool of pulse-labeled E9 protein remained intact within the ER at a time when WT PS1 holoprotein was completely degraded. This result suggests that reduced proteolytic degradation of E9 within the ER is responsible for the increased half-life of this molecule. In time, a small fraction of undegraded protein, together with the endogenous NTF and CTF, are found in the Golgi compartment..

In this study, increasing expression of E9 mutant protein by muristerone A induction similarly led to progressively lower levels of endogenous PS1 stable fragments. Interestingly, in the pulse-chase/fractionation studies, the appearance of labeled endogenous fragments was delayed. Therefore, production of NTF from proteolysis of endogenous PS1 is affected both quantitatively and kinetically in the presence of E9 mutant protein. This competition is likely to occur in the ER, because E9 appeared to be largely degraded in this compartment..

Since all of these presenilin mutations have been reported to show a selective increase in A42 production (10, 17), our results suggest that perturbations in the ER to Golgi processing at this level cannot explain how mutants alter A42 generation. Like the presenilins, maturation of APP in the exocytic pathway occurs in the ER and Golgi compartments. Thus, colocalization of both APP and presenilins in the same subcellular compartments leads to the possibility of an interaction between these two molecules, as has been reported in transfected cells (15, 17). Using subcellular fractionation, we have recently detected increased levels of A42 in ER and Golgi fractions of cells expressing mutant presenilins (16). These observations suggest that understanding the molecular interactions between APP and presenilins as well as other proteins within these cellular compartments will be important in resolving the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis..

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   It has been proposed that -secretase-mediated release of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) results in nuclear translocation and signaling through a complex with the adaptor protein Fe65 and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60. Here, we show that APP and Fe65 activate transcription through a Gal4-Tip60 reporter in presenilin-1/2-deficient cells lacking generation of AICD. APP and Fe65 also activated transcription in the presence of -secretase inhibitors that prevent amyloid -peptide production in human embryonic kidney 293 and SH-SY5Y cells. In contrast to the transcriptionally active Notch intracellular domain, expression of AICD did not activate transcription. An alternative mechanism for APP signal transduction is suggested by the identification of essential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation sites in Tip60. Mutation of these Tip60 phosphorylation sites or treatment with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine blocked the ability of APP to signal through Tip60. Moreover, APP stabilized Tip60 through CDK-dependent phosphorylation. Subcellular fractionation and confocal immunofluorescence showed that APP recruited Tip60 to membrane compartments. Thus, APP may signal to the nucleus by a -secretase-independent mechanism that involves membrane sequestration and phosphorylation of Tip60..

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The amyloid precursor protein (APP)2 has played a central role in Alzheimer disease research ever since pathogenic mutations were discovered within APP over a decade ago. APP is a type 1 transmembrane protein that resembles a cell-surface receptor (1). Studies on APP biology have focused primarily on its proteolytic processing. APP undergoes two separate proteolytic pathways that have been termed the non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic pathways (reviewed in Ref. 2). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is first cleaved by -secretase, generating the C-terminal transmembrane fragment C83. The amyloidogenic pathway involves cleavage by the -secretase BACE, generating the C-terminal fragment C99, which is then cleaved by -secretase to generate the amyloid -peptide (A) and the C50/APP intracellular domain (AICD) fragment. This series of proteolytic events of ectodomain shedding followed by intramembrane cleavage is reminiscent of the processing of the Notch receptor following binding to its ligands (reviewed in Ref. 3). Both APP and Notch require the presenilins for -secretase cleavage within the membrane (4-7)..

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	7	The pathogenic autosomal dominant mutations in APP and the presenilins lead to increased generation of the fibrillogenic peptide A42, which forms amyloid plaques, one of the hallmark pathogenic lesions of Alzheimer disease (reviewed in Refs. 8 and 9). Moreover, A is neurotoxic both in vitro and in vivo (10, 11). These observations have led to the amyloid hypothesis, which proposes that the accumulation of A in the brain causes neurodegeneration and the dementia of Alzheimer disease. However, despite the significant effort spent investigating the properties of APP, its biological function and the reason for its cleavage remain enigmatic. There is evidence that APP plays a role in cell adhesion, axonal transport, neurite outgrowth, and, recently, signal transduction (12-18)..
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	8	It has been suggested that APP may signal by a mechanism similar to that of the Notch receptor, in which the intracellular tail released by presenilin/-secretase translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription. This idea was supported by the observation that APP, together with the adaptor protein Fe65, could activate the transcriptional activity of the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 (18). Thus, presenilins may mediate the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of a number of transmembrane proteins that release soluble intracellular domains that carry out signaling functions (reviewed in Refs. 19 and 20)..

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	10	The adaptor protein Fe65 contains three protein interaction domains: the WW domain, which binds proline-rich sequences, and two C-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domains, which interact with Tip60 and APP, respectively (18, 21). Fe65 and APP have been placed within a biological pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans, as the respective mutants have similar pharyngeal pumping phenotypes (22). Expression of Fe65 can lead to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of AICD, where it may induce apoptosis through Tip60 (23-25, 48). In addition, Tip60 and its histone acetyltransferase activity have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression and DNA repair (26-28). However, the mechanism underlying the ability of APP to regulate Tip60-mediated transcription has not been determined. In this study, we provide evidence that, in contrast to Notch, APP is able to activate transcription through Tip60 independently of -secretase cleavage by recruiting Tip60 to the membrane, leading to Tip60 activation through cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated phosphorylation. This is followed by nuclear translocation of Tip60 and Fe65 and activation of transcription..

The pCMV-Myc-Fe65-(128-711) plasmid was used because it was shown previously to act similarly to full-length Fe65 (18) and, in our hands, required a lower amount of DNA to allow activation of the reporter by Tip60. Additionally, this construct has a Myc tag, which facilitated confirmation of equivalent expression by Western blotting between different conditions. Approximately 20-24 h after transfection, the cells were lysed with Promega passive lysis buffer. Assays were then performed (Dual-Luciferase kit, Promega) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Luciferase activity was read with a Wallac VICTOR Model 1420 multilabel counter. To control for transfection efficiency, the activity of the firefly luciferase reporter driven by the GAL4 promoter was normalized to the activity of the Renilla luciferase reporter (PRL-TK). The -fold induction was then determined as the average of three wells per treatment normalized to the average signal of the reporter-alone wells..

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	33	     RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   APP Signaling in Presenilin-deficient Cells Activation of the Notch signaling pathway requires -secretase cleavage by the presenilins to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus and activates target genes. To determine whether APP could signal to the nucleus by a similar mechanism, we utilized embryonic stem (ES) cells deficient in both presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 (presenilin-1/2 knockout (PS-KO) cells). These cells are deficient in -secretase cleavage of APP and do not secrete A (6). To address the potential signaling function of APP, we used the Gal4-Tip60 fusion construct, previously shown to activate a Gal4-luciferase reporter upon cotransfection of both Fe65 and APP (18). This is a more physiological system for measuring the signaling ability of APP compared with APP-Gal4 assays, as it does not rely on the fusion of an artificial DNA-binding domain to APP itself. As reported previously (18), significant transactivation by Gal4-Tip60 occurred only upon coexpression of both Fe65 and APP (Fig. 1A). APP signaling was reduced by 45% in PS-KO cells relative to wild-type ES cells and was rescued upon expression of presenilin-1 (PS1) (Fig. 1A). A -secretase inhibitor reduced APP signaling in wild-type cells to a level comparable with that in PS-KO cells (data not shown). PS-KO cells were resistant to the -secretase inhibitor, consistent with the lack of -secretase activity in these cells. However, APP retained the ability to activate Tip60 in the absence of presenilins, suggesting that -secretase cleavage of APP is not required for activation of Tip60. This contrasts with Notch signaling, which was completely inhibited in PS-KO cells (Fig. 1B). These results were confirmed in two independently derived wild-type and presenilin-deficient cell lines, indicating that presenilin-independent APP signaling is not a unique property of an individual presenilin-deficient cell line. These results suggest that APP may signal through a mechanism that is distinct from that of the Notch pathway, despite similar mechanisms of proteolytic processing..

Expression of presenilin in the PS-KO cells rescued the ability of mNotchE to activate the HES1 reporter (Fig. 1B). This shows that the lack of Notch signaling in presenilin-deficient cells is due solely to the lack of presenilin-dependent -secretase cleavage of mNotchE. Further illustrating this point, a similar level of transactivation was obtained upon expression of soluble NICD in both wild-type and presenilin-deficient cells (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that both cell lines are similarly competent in signal transduction.

C50 had essentially no signaling ability (Fig. 2A, upper panel), in contrast to the signaling-competent Notch-derived NICD (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we observed that C50 had a dominant-negative effect in which it decreased APP signaling when coexpressed with APP (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Immunoblot analysis of lysates showed equivalent levels of APP expression (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Similar results were obtained in APP signaling assays in wild-type ES and PS-KO cells (data not shown). These results suggest that C50/AICD does not activate transcription through Tip60, but rather acts as a dominant-negative protein in this signaling pathway..

To address this possibility, we used the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone in another series of luciferase assays in HEK-293 cells. Inhibiting caspase activity with benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone failed to significantly affect the ability of APP to activate Tip60 (Fig. 3A). Notably, there was still no effect on APP signaling when both -secretase and caspase inhibitors were added together. Similar results were observed in the wild-type ES and PS-KO cells (Fig. 3B).

Furthermore, we attempted to elevate neprilysin levels in PS-KO cells by overexpression of PS1, C50, or C50-Myc. We did not observe any reproducible changes in neprilysin levels upon expression of any of the plasmids 24 h after transfection (Fig. 3, D and E).

Tip60 co-immunoprecipitated holo-APP (Fig. 2D). The presence of holo-APP suggests that Tip60 may form a complex with APP in a membrane compartment rather than in the nucleus as suggested previously (18). Even with longer exposures, we were unable to detect significant levels of APP C-terminal fragments or AICD in the Tip60 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that Tip60 forms a complex with holo-APP. Coexpression of Fe65 along with Tip60 and APP increased complex formation between Tip60 and APP (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that Tip60 forms a complex with holo-APP, presumably at the membrane, and support the hypothesis that APP may signal through a mechanism that involves membrane recruitment of Tip60 rather than nuclear translocation of AICD..

Two CDK sites were recently identified in Tip60 at serines 86 and 90 (34). To examine the role of these phosphorylation sites in APP-Tip60 signaling, we fused the Gal4 DNA-binding domain to a Tip60 mutant in which serines 86 and 90 were converted to alanines. We then assessed the activity of the Tip60 mutant in luciferase reporter assays of transfected HEK-293 cells. The Tip60 mutant could not be activated by coexpression of Fe65 and APP, in contrast to the strong transactivation observed with wild-type Tip60 (Fig. 4A). To further confirm the requirement of CDK phosphorylation of Tip60 in APP signal transduction, we tested the CDK inhibitor roscovitine. CDK inhibition with roscovitine significantly decreased the ability of APP to activate Tip60 (Fig. 4A). Similar results were observed in the ES cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, phosphorylation of Tip60 at serines 86 and 90 by CDKs contributes to transcriptional signaling. The Tip60 phosphorylation mutant was able to co-immunoprecipitate APP as efficiently as wild-type Tip60 when coexpressed with Fe65 (Fig. 2D). Thus, the inability of APP to activate the Tip60 mutant is unlikely to be due to an effect on complex formation between APP and Tip60..

Treatment of the cell lysates with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase led to a condensation of the multiple Tip60 bands into a single faster migrating form, suggesting that the slower migrating forms are phosphorylated forms of Tip60. The Tip60 mutant migrated at a lower apparent molecular mass compared with wild-type Tip60, consistent with lack of phosphorylation of Tip60 at the CDK sites. Alkaline phosphatase treatment also led to the condensation of the Tip60 mutant bands into a single faster migrating form that comigrated with dephosphorylated wild-type Tip60, indicating that there are additional phosphorylation sites yet to be identified. Coexpression of Tip60 with Fe65 and APP led to markedly enhanced levels of the slowest migrating phosphorylated forms of wild-type Tip60 (Fig. 4C). Densitometric analysis of the blot showed an 73% increase in the slowest migrating band relative to the fastest migrating form of Tip60. Fe65 and APP did not affect the Tip60 CDK phosphorylation mutant, suggesting that they act to specifically increase phosphorylation at the CDK sites. Coexpression of APP and Fe65 also led to significant phosphorylation of Tip60 at the CDK sites in ES cells (Fig. 4D).

The PSORTII program identified two potential nuclear localization sequences within Tip60. These were the short basic nuclear localization sequence starting at amino acid 184 (PGRKRKS) and the type 1 bipartite nuclear localization sequence beginning at amino acid 295 (RKGTISFFEIDGRKNKS). Both of these nuclear localization sequences are completely conserved in the mouse, rat, and human Tip60 proteins. We also identified a potential nuclear export sequence (LTTLPVLYL) that conforms to the classic LX2-3(L/I/V/F/M)X2-3LX(L/I) motif, which is completely conserved in the mouse, rat, and human Tip60 proteins (35).

Additionally, we have shown that, in other cell lines, APP retained the ability to activate Tip60 in the presence of -secretase inhibitors at concentrations that prevent production of A and generation of the C50/AICD fragment. Our findings suggest an alternative model of APP signaling in which holo-APP recruits Tip60 to the membrane to induce Tip60 phosphorylation and complex formation with Fe65, leading to activation of signal transduction (Fig. 8). This phosphorylation event appears to be carried out by a CDK, as signaling could be blocked by mutating the known CDK sites in Tip60 or by the CDK inhibitor roscovitine.

Our findings suggest an alternative model of APP signaling in which holo-APP recruits Tip60 to the membrane to induce Tip60 phosphorylation and complex formation with Fe65, leading to activation of signal transduction (Fig. 8). This phosphorylation event appears to be carried out by a CDK, as signaling could be blocked by mutating the known CDK sites in Tip60 or by the CDK inhibitor roscovitine. A key aspect of this model is that the signaling role of APP may lie in its ability to recruit proteins to the microdomain of the membrane, where particular kinases, such as CDK5, are active..
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	73	The model of APP signaling that we propose differs from that of the canonical Notch signaling pathway in that APP signals via activation of cytoplasmic proteins through post-translational modifications rather than by providing an intracellular domain to activate transcription. This difference is critical, as both we and another group (36) found that the C50/AICD fragment is unable to activate transcription, in contrast to the transcriptional activity of NICD. Moreover, our results indicate that overexpressed C50/AICD acts as a dominant-negative protein to inhibit APP-Tip60 signaling. However, -secretase cleavage appears to facilitate signaling in ES cells, presumably through the release of the Fe65-Tip60 complex from the membrane. One potential -secretase-independent mechanism for the dissociation of Fe65 and Tip60 from APP and the membrane could be phosphorylation of APP at threonine 668, which has been shown to decrease the interaction between Fe65 and APP (37). Interestingly, CDK5 has been shown to phosphorylate APP at this site (38), raising the possibility that CDK5 could play the dual role of activating Tip60 and releasing the complex from the membrane..

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	75	One difference between Notch and APP processing is that APP undergoes constitutive ectodomain shedding and -secretase cleavage, whereas Notch undergoes ectodomain shedding only following ligand binding. Thus, it is difficult to understand how APP signaling could be regulated if it occurs constitutively. Our findings indicate that one mechanism of regulation of this pathway is through the activity of CDKs. This is particularly intriguing, as altered activity of CDK5 has already been implicated in Alzheimer disease (39, 40). Furthermore, the CDK5 activator p35 is membrane-associated, suggesting that CDK5 could specifically phosphorylate Tip60 when it is recruited to the membrane by APP..

One intriguing potential target is the A-degrading enzyme neprilysin, which was reported to be responsive to C50/AICD in presenilin-deficient cells (33). We did not observe reproducible regulation of neprilysin expression by PS1 or C50. Moreover, we observed considerable variation in neprilysin levels between ES cell lines that did not strictly correlate with presenilin genotype. We also attempted to verify two other proposed target genes of Tip60, KAI1 and manganese-super-oxide dismutase (27, 41). In our hands, reporter constructs containing the promoters of these two genes were not responsive to Tip60, Fe65, APP, or various combinations of these constructs. Another recent study suggested that a fusion of the protein citrine to C50/AICD increases the expression of a number of genes, including APP, BACE, Tip60, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and KAI1 (42). We have been unable to confirm these results by transfection of HEK-293 cells with C50 or C50-Myc, which could reflect a different activity of the reported citrine fusion protein. Overall, we have not been able to confirm any of the proposed C50/AICD target genes that we are aware of at this time. Further work needs to be done to delineate the APP signaling pathway with primary importance being the identification of endogenous target genes that are affected by APP. Progress in this area may have been hindered thus far by the focus on AICD as the transcriptionally active form..

Presenilins have been shown to influence limited proteolysis of amyloid ss protein precursor (APP), Notch and ErbB4, and have been proposed to be -secretases that perform the terminal cleavage of APP. In this model, two conserved and apparently intramembranous aspartic acids participate in catalysis. Highly sequence-similar presenilin homologues are known in plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. In this work, we have used a combination of different sequence database search methods to identify a new family of proteins homologous to presenilins. Members of this family, which we term presenilin homologues (PSH), have significant sequence similarities to presenilins and also possess two conserved aspartic acid residues within adjacent predicted transmembrane segments. The PSH family is found throughout the eukaryotes, in fungi as well as plants and animals, and in archaea. Five PSHs are detectable in the human genome, of which three possess  protease-associated  domains that are consistent with the proposed protease function of PSs. Based on these findings, we propose that PSs and PSHs represent different sub-branches of a larger family of polytopic membrane-associated aspartyl proteases..

0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	7	Studies of PSs and their role in the development of AD have led to an appreciation that they regulate a number of diverse functions in the cell. PSs have been shown to play a role in proteolytic processing of amyloid ss protein precursor (APP) and APP family members (2,3), Notch and Notch family members (4,5), and ErbB4 (6). In all cases, PSs appear to be required to permit the release of the cytoplasmic tail of these proteins from a membrane-bound stub that is generated after ectodomain cleavage of the holoprotein.

PSs have also been shown to interact with a wide array of different proteins, and have been implicated in IP3-mediated release of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium (9), capacitative calcium entry (10,11), ss-catenin signaling (12 to 14) and protein trafficking (15)..
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	8	Studies of PSs and their role in the development of AD have led to an appreciation that they regulate a number of diverse functions in the cell. PSs have been shown to play a role in proteolytic processing of amyloid ss protein precursor (APP) and APP family members (2,3), Notch and Notch family members (4,5), and ErbB4 (6). In all cases, PSs appear to be required to permit the release of the cytoplasmic tail of these proteins from a membrane-bound stub that is generated after ectodomain cleavage of the holoprotein.

PSs have been shown to influence the final cleavage step in the release of the approximately 4 kDa amyloid ss protein (Ass) from APP, a proteolysis that is referred to as -secretase cleavage. This event generates Ass from a membrane stub of the APP, which in turn is produced by a previous hydrolysis of the APP holoprotein by a membrane-bound aspartyl protease referred to as ss-secretase. Significantly, -secretase generates Ass peptides of varying lengths, with the two species of most interest being peptides of 40 amino acids (Ass40) and 42 amino acids (Ass42). In all cases studied to date, mutant PSs increase the relative level of Ass42 production. As the longer Ass42 aggregates more rapidly than other forms of Ass and had previously been shown to be increased by AD-linked mutations in the APP, these studies not only implicated PSs as modulators of -secretase cleavage, but also convinced many in the AD field that this longer form of Ass was critical to AD pathogenesis (16)..

First, at the genetic level, PSs appear to be essential for -cleavage. PS1 knockout markedly inhibits -secretase cleavage (3,4), whereas PS2 knockout has no apparent effect on -secretase activity (17), probably owing to compensation by the more widely expressed PS1. However, a combined PS1/PS2 knockout completely abolishes -secretase activity (18,19). Second, biochemical evidence also supports the identification of PSs as -secretases. PSs co-fractionate with -secretase activity in a high-molecular-weight complex, and this in vitro activity can be recovered in the pellet after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PS1 (20). In addition, mutation of two absolutely conserved aspartate residues (D257 and D385 in PS1, and D263 and D366 in PS2) results in PSs that act in a dominant-negative fashion  to  at least with respect to -secretase activity (21,22). This leads to the hypothesis that PSs represent a novel class of intramembranous cleaving diaspartyl proteases, a hypothesis supported by inhibitor studies (23,24). Third, four groups have been able to show that inhibitors of -secretase activity bind with varying degrees of specificity to both PS1 and PS2 (25 to 28). Collectively, these experiments indicate that compounds, including some with properties of protease inhibitors, can bind to PSs. Moreover, given that two groups had specifically designed their inhibitors to be transition state analogues of aspartyl proteases, it certainly appears that, despite the lack of demonstrable homology to known aspartyl proteases, PSs may be just that..

SNPs identified by sequence analysis of PSH2      DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The newly identified PSHs could be aligned over their entire lengths with PSs, encompassing PS TM segments 2 to 8 (Fig. 2). Despite their apparent lack of TM segment 1, they appear to have the same membrane topology as PSs as a consequence of their signal peptide sequences. Regions that are highly conserved between the two families include not only the putative active site aspartic acid residues, but also TM sequences and a  PALP  motif that is reported to be obligatory for stabilization, complex formation and -secretase activities of presenilins (36). Several animal and plant PSHs were found to contain N-terminal protease-associated (PA) domains that often co-occur with peptidase domains (37). This is consistent with a hypothesis that PSHs and, also by homology, PSs possess peptidase function..

PSH2 is the most proximal gene to the MAPT gene, encoding the tau protein, on chromosome 17q21.31. Hyperphosphorylated forms of tau are often found in the brains of patients with AD, and MAPT mutations are associated with frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) (39,40). On one hand, the close proximity of a PS homologue to a gene whose dysfunction is intimately associated with neurodegenerative conditions might be coincidental. On the other hand, the close proximity (50 kb) of these genes might be significant, since sequence analysis has revealed multiple (nine) SNPs in PSH2 that are in complete linkage disequilibrium with the extended H1/H2 haplotypes in the MAPT gene (41). The H1 haplotype is a genetic risk factor for the development of the sporadic tauopathies progressive supranuclear palsy (41) and cortical basal degeneration (42).

[An E-value (or expect value) for a given alignment score x represents the number of alignments with scores x or higher that are expected purely by chance in the database search.] Similar PSI-BLAST searches determined the extent of the protein family homologous to a mouse sequence (GenInfo code 12849450). A multiple sequence alignment of this family's sequences was constructed using Clustal-W (43) and manually adjusted to minimize gap positions within secondary structures. A hidden Markov model of this alignment was constructed using HMMER (32) and compared with a second non-redundant protein sequence database (nrdb90; ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/nrdb90/; 392 089 sequences)..

The positions of PSH genes in the human genome were determined using BLAT (http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/cgibin/hgBlat?command=start). Signal peptides were detected using SignalP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), and co-occurring domains were identified using Pfam (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Pfam/). Transmembrane topologies of PSs and PSHs were predicted using algorithms such as TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) and TMPRED (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED/form.html)..

PCR primers for amplification of PSH   PCR and sequence analysis Primers were designed to generate three separate products: Product #1 was amplified using primers 1F and 3R, giving a 1126 bp product, then sequenced with 1F, 1R, 2F, 2R, 3F and 3R. Product #2 was generated using primers 3F and 5R, giving a 1088 bp product, then sequenced with 3F, 4F, 4R and 5R. Product #3 was generated using primers 5F and 7R, giving an 852 bp product, and then sequenced with 5F, 6F, 6R and 7R. The primer sequences are shown in Table 3. Reactions contained 50 ng of genomic DNA in a 50  microl mixture containing 20 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 unit of Taq with buffer and Q-solution (Qiagen, California, UK). Amplifications were performed oil-free in Hybaid Touchdown thermal cyclers (Hybaid, Cambridge, UK). Conditions were 35 cycles of 94 degrees C for 30 s, 60 degrees C to 50 degrees C touchdown annealing for 30 s, and 72 degrees C for 45 s, with a final extension of 72 degrees C for 10 min. All products were purified using the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, CA). 100 ng of product was sequenced in both directions using the Big Dye kit (Perkin Elmer).

Study of one of these large pedigrees revealed the transmission, from generation to generation, of a single point mutation in the gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP), found on chromosome 21 in family members developing early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Further studies of these families led to the discovery of other point mutations in the same gene and later the presence of mutations in two other genes, encoding presenilin-1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2 (PS-2), found on chromosomes 14 and 1, respectively. To date, 12 Alzheimer's disease-related mutations have been discovered in the APP gene, 69 mutations in the PS-1 gene and 5 mutations in the PS-2 gene. Significantly, research suggests that the different mutations in these three genes lead to a common result, an increase in ss-A4 peptide fragment of APP which forms the core of the neuritic plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease..

In cross-sectional studies the presence of a positive family history of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is a consistent risk factor for subjects with the late-onset form, but a clear autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance is rare. Both twin and family studies suggest a polygenic multifactorial mode of inheritance and as a consequence the elucidation of genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease requires different methods from those used in the early-onset disease, with its simple Mendelian patterns of inheritance. Association studies have so far dominated the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Such studies look for variation in the frequency of an allele in samples of unrelated patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease compared with unrelated control subjects. These studies have resulted in a number of candidate genes being proposed as having importance as risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and include associations with variation in genes encoding the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, PS-1 (an intronic mutation not associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease), butyrylcholinesterase, angiotensin-1 converting enzyme, 1-antichymotrypsin, the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex, 2-macroglobulin, the low-density lipoprotein-like receptor, the serotonin transporter and interleukin-1. Typically, interest in these candidates has diminished as independent replication has not been forthcoming, and little evidence now remains for an important role for genetic variation in the VLDL receptor, PS-1 or 1-antichymotrypsin genes in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The other candidate genes still have their advocates and remain hotly disputed..

The methods used for linkage studies in complex non-Mendelian diseases such as late-onset Alzheimer's disease are less powerful than those used for the early-onset form. However, such studies can reveal areas of interest in the genome that might later be explored by association studies. A complete genomic screen in a series of multiplex families affected with late-onset Alzheimer's disease has revealed five regions of interest on chromosomes 4, 6, 12, 19 and 20. Excluding the effects of the APOE4 locus, the maximum log likelihood ratio (lod) score in this study occurred in a region located on the short arm of chromosome 12 (Pericak-Vance et al, 1997). However, two subsequent studies following similar methods (Blacker et al, 1998; Wu et al, 1998) were unable to confirm linkage to this area. A large sibpair study (Kehoe et al, 1999) has revealed many possible loci showing linkage to late-onset Alzheimer's disease. These include loci on chromosomes 1, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 19 (close to APOE) and 21 (close to the APP gene). Currently, the main focus of attention is chromosome 10, with two independent studies showing evidence of a susceptibility locus in the same region (Ertekin-Taner et al, 2000; Myers et al, 2000). However, it is clear that a large number of loci are implicated and that there is some disagreement between studies in the predicted areas of interest. These findings demonstrate some of the limitations of this approach, but also serve to emphasise the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Further exploration of these areas by association studies   the positional candidate approach   is likely to dominate the genetics of Alzheimer's disease in the future..

Significantly, the importance of APOE4 was determined using a positional candidate gene approach. Since this finding, other studies (Artiga et al, 1998; Bullido et al, 1998; Lambert et al, 1998) have also suggested an association between a number of polymorphisms within the transcriptional regulatory region of the APOE gene and late-onset Alzheimer's disease that is independent of ApoE 4 status. Based on these data, it was suggested that there are two independent mechanisms by which risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease can be modified by the APOE gene: first, by variations in the coding regions, which alter the functional properties of APOE; and second, by the presence of promoter variants which result in quantitative differences in APOE expression (Artiga et al, 1998). However, this hypothesis is controversial, and more recent studies (Helisalmi et al, 1999; Zurutuza et al, 2000) have failed to support the independence of APOE promoter variants in the development of Alzheimer's disease..

Families carrying mutations in the PS-2 gene have ages of onset largely within the range 40-70 years and thus show some overlap with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.

Thus, one study of affected sib pairs suggests that shared familial effects may account for 40% of the variance (Tunstall et al, 2000). Indeed, studies have shown that in the late-onset disease the age of onset is approximately 6 years earlier in individuals who carry two copies of the APOE4 allele compared with non-carriers. This has led to the suggestion that the APOE4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease mainly because in old age Alzheimer's disease and death are competing risks. Any factor leading to an earlier age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in the elderly (and hence the development of the disease prior to death) will be associated with Alzheimer's disease. Evidence confirming this hypothesis has come from a large study of approximately 5000 individuals (Meyer et al, 1998). This study showed a clear decline in relative risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease in all subjects with increasing age but with a clear plateau beyond which no further new cases of the disease were reported. The age at which this plateau was reached was earlier in carriers of the APOE4 allele. Thus, it appears clear that the APOE4 allele has its predominant effect by determining when, but not if, an individual develops late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Meyer et al, 1998)..

It thus seems unlikely that major genetic risk factors for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease have a substantial role to play in the development of non-cognitive symptoms within the late-onset disease. However, this does not mean that these symptoms have no genetic basis, since genes may influence the phenotypic expression of the disease without being involved directly in its aetiology. Indeed, early studies have shown evidence of an association between a positive family history of depressive illness and an increase in the frequency of depressive symptoms occurring for the first time within Alzheimer's disease (Pearlson et al, 1990). These early findings are supported by a sib-pair study (Tunstall et al, 2000) showing that familial factors have a role in the development of depressive illness in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.

It thus seems unlikely that major genetic risk factors for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease have a substantial role to play in the development of non-cognitive symptoms within the late-onset disease. However, this does not mean that these symptoms have no genetic basis, since genes may influence the phenotypic expression of the disease without being involved directly in its aetiology. Indeed, early studies have shown evidence of an association between a positive family history of depressive illness and an increase in the frequency of depressive symptoms occurring for the first time within Alzheimer's disease (Pearlson et al, 1990). These early findings are supported by a sib-pair study (Tunstall et al, 2000) showing that familial factors have a role in the development of depressive illness in late-onset Alzheimer's disease. In addition, this small study also suggests a role for familial factors in a wide variety of non-cognitive symptoms, including agitation, aggression and psychosis..

For example, one study (Holmes et al, 1998) of people with late-onset Alzheimer's disease found an association between common polymorphic variations in the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C serotonin receptor genes (102-T/C and Cys23Ser polymorphisms, respectively), previously implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder, with psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. Associations were found between the presence of the C102 allele and the presence of visual and auditory hallucinations and between the presence of the Ser23 allele and visual hallucinations. Another study (Sweet et al, 1998) has found evidence to suggest an association of psychosis and aggression in patients with Alzheimer's disease who carry common polymorphisms in the dopamine receptor genes DRD1 and DRD3. These studies need to be replicated but they suggest that common receptor polymorphisms may have a role in the genesis of psychotic or other non-cognitive symptoms that are not implicated as genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease..

The majority of studies have also failed to show any relationships between possession of the APOE4 allele and increased rates of decline. This lack of association is interesting since it implies that genetic factors may determine only when the disease starts, not the rate of degeneration. Clearly, caution is required when interpreting a negative finding and it may be that associations will always be difficult to establish because of the large number of confounding factors which may influence cognitive deterioration as well as difficulties with the use of psychometric scales over short periods. Indeed, a study by Craft et al (1998) has suggested that there is an increased rate of cognitive decline in APOE4 carriers, which may be detectable by using a long follow-up period..

0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	34	Duration The mean duration of illness in families with PS-1 mutations is significantly shorter (range 5.8-6.8 years) than in families with both PS-2 (range 4.4-10.8 years) and APP mutations (range 9.0-16 years), reflecting the severity of PS-1-associated Alzheimer's disease. Studies of late-onset Alzheimer's disease suggest that the duration of illness tends to be longer in people who have a positive family history or in carriers of the APOE4 allele. However, it has since been shown that this relationship no longer holds true once the confounding effects of age of onset have been taken into account. Thus, in late-onset Alzheimer's disease, increased survival is more directly related to an earlier age of onset, which is influenced by a number of factors that are not exclusively genetic..

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Mutations in genes encoding presenilins (PS1 and PS2) are responsible for the majority of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. PS, a critical component of -secretase, is responsible for the intramembranous cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and Notch. Other physiological functions have been assigned to PS without any clear identification of the mechanisms underlying these multiple biological roles. The early embryonic lethality of PS1 and PS2 double knock-out (PS1/2 null) mice prevents the evaluation of physiological roles of PS. To investigate new functions for presenilins, we performed a proteomic approach by using cells derived from PS1/2 null blastocysts and wild type controls. We identified a presenilin-dependent cell-surface binding of albumin. Binding of albumin depends on intact caveolae on the cellular surface. Abnormal caveolin 1 localization in PS1/2 null cells was associated with a loss of caveolae and an absence of caveolin 1 expression within lipid rafts. Expressing PS1 or PS2 but not the intracellular form of Notch1 in PS1/2 null cells restored normal caveolin 1 localization, demonstrating that presenilins are required for the subcellular trafficking of caveolin 1 independently from Notch activity. Despite an expression of both caveolin 1 and PS1 within lipid raft-enriched fractions after sucrose density centrifugation in wild type cells, no direct interaction between these two proteins was detected, implying that presenilins affect caveolin 1 trafficking in an indirect manner. We conclude that presenilins are required for caveolae formation by controlling transport of intracellular caveolin 1 to the plasma membrane..

Blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells and WT controls were grown in 100-mm diameter dishes, and 2 x 107 cells were used to prepare the CEMs. Cells were washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 2 ml of MBST buffer (25 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and homogenized with a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes). The extract was adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose in MBS lacking Triton X-100 and placed in the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed by overlaying this solution with 4 ml of 38% sucrose and 4 ml of 5% sucrose (both in MBS). The tubes were centrifuged at 31,000 rpm in an SW41 Ti rotor for 17 h at 4  degrees C, and 12 fractions of 1 ml were collected manually from the top of the gradient. To determine the distribution of different proteins within the gradients, 200  microl of each fraction were precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in 20  microl of 1x Laemmli buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels followed by Western blot analyses. The primary antibodies used are as follows: anti-PS1 pAb (H70, Sc Biotechnology; anti-Cav1 pAb (N20, Sc Biotechnology); anti--adaptin mAb (Transduction Laboratories); anti-BIP mAb (Transduction Laboratories); and anti-flotillin 1 mAb (Transduction Laboratories).

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	28	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In order to identify new functions for presenilins, we used a differential proteomic approach (Fig. 1). We compared the two-dimensional profile of total extracts from WT and PS1/2 null cells. Proteins of interest were those expressed in WT cells and absent in PS1/2 null cells. We performed the differential proteomic approach with SV40-transformed blastocyst-derived cells (Fig. 1A) and blastocyst-derived cells (Fig. 1B). Several proteins corresponded to the chosen criteria, and among them a strongly expressed protein was common to blastocyst-derived cells and their SV40 counterpart. This protein was sequenced with a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer and identified as bovine serum albumin (BSA). This result shows that there is a defect in the endocytosis and/or binding of albumin from the fetal bovine serum in the absence of presenilins..

Caveolin 1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts show defects in the endocytosis of albumin but not transferrin (16). Caveolae-mediated endocytosis in endothelial cells is stimulated by the binding of albumin to a specific albumin-binding protein localized in caveolae (17). Therefore, the defect of endocytosis and/or binding of albumin observed in PS1/2 null cells (Fig. 1) could be linked to the abnormal caveolae-dependent pathway..

Fig. 2 shows that PS1/2 null cells (left panel) failed to accumulate FITC-albumin even after 30 min of continuous incubation in contrast to WT cells showing cell surface labeling with FITC-albumin within 5 min of incubation. To ensure that the lack of expression from the presenilins did not globally affect ligand binding/endocytosis, we also examined the intracellular uptake of a second fluorescent tracer, FITC-transferrin, known to be endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits. As shown in Fig. 2 (right panel), FITC-transferrin was rapidly endocytosed in both WT and PS1/2 null cells. Thus, PS1/2 null cells show a selective defect in caveolae-mediated ligand binding reminiscent of that observed in caveolin 1-deficient cells (16)..
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	33	To ensure that the defect in caveolae-dependent endocytosis observed in PS1/2 null cells was specifically because of a lack of PS proteins, we examined whether the transient expression of the presenilin cDNA was sufficient to restore albumin binding in PS1/2 null cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, the two-dimensional gel profile of proteins in PS1/2 null cells re-expressing PS1 was comparable with that of the corresponding WT cells (see Fig. 1). The presence of BSA was detected on Coomassie-stained two-dimensional gels of either SV40-transformed blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells (top) or blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells (bottom) overexpressing PS1. We confirmed this result by restoring efficient FITC-albumin uptake in blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells expressing either PS1 (Fig. 3B, top panel) or PS2 (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). These results show that caveolae functionality is dependent upon either PS1 or PS2 expression..

By Western blotting, we were able to detect caveolin 1 expression in PS1/2 null cells.2 We decided to further investigate how caveolin1 was regulated in PS1/2 null cells in comparison to WT cells. We employed the following three distinct methods to address this issue. We first explored caveolin1 localization by immunofluorescence. We then observed caveolae formation by EM.

In most of WT cells, endogenous caveolin 1 was predominantly localized at the plasma membrane with typical caveolae-associated punctated staining (Fig. 4A, I), whereas in PS1/2 null cells, endogenous caveolin 1 showed pronounced punctated perinuclear localization (Fig. 4A, II). Altered localization of caveolin 1 in PS1/2 null cells was also observed after forced expression of GFP-Cav1 (Fig. 4A, IV) and with endogenous caveolin 2.2 This result shows that there is an intracellular retention of caveolin 1 in PS1/2 null cells. To evaluate if caveolin 1 membrane localization was PS-dependent, we examined if transient expression of presenilin 2 cDNA was sufficient to induce a change in caveolin 1 localization. As shown in Fig. 4B, transient expression of FLAG-presenilin 2 (V) in PS1/2 null cells induced redistribution of endogenous caveolin 1 from its perinuclear localization (VI). Micro-injection of PS1 cDNA in GFP-Cav1 positive PS1/2 null cells (Fig. 4B, VII) allowed GFP-Cav1 to be relocalized as in WT cells (VIII). In contrast, no noticeable changes in GFP-Cav1 localization was observed after the microinjection of the Notch NICD (Fig. 4B, IX) construct in GFP-Cav1-positive PS1/2 null cells (Fig. 4B, X). These results show that caveolin 1 is mislocalized in PS1/2 null cells and that even though most of the PS1/2 null mice phenotypes are attributable to a loss of Notch 1 function (13), presenilins are involved in the subcellular localization of caveolin 1 independently from Notch activity..

We wondered if PS1/2 null cells showing mislocalized caveolin 1 were still able to form caveolae. Caveolae are well defined organelles, forming flask-shaped necks at the plasma membrane easily distinguishable by electron microscopy. The presence of caveolae in PS1/2 null cells was investigated by EM. We found a marked reduced number of caveolae at the plasma membrane of presenilin-deficient cells (Fig. 5B) in comparison to WT cells (Fig. 5A). In addition, only 20% of PS1/2 null cells showed caveolae at the plasma membrane compared with 100% of WT cells.2 These data show that presenilins are involved in caveolae formation..

Caveolae are isolated by their insolubility in Triton X-100 and their sedimentation in low density fractions over sucrose gradients (21). We performed isolation of CEM of WT and PS1/2 null cell proteins (see "Experimental Procedures"). It has been shown previously that caveolae-enriched fractions isolated in this manner exclude markers for caveolae membranes such as the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum (22, 23). Distribution of BIP and -adaptin, non-raft proteins localized in the ER and the trans-Golgi, respectively, was also examined to monitor the contamination of CEM with ER and trans-Golgi membranes (Fig. 6). Flotillins have been described as a new family of proteins associated with caveolae (24). As expected (Fig. 6A), flotillin 1 expression was restricted to fractions 4 and 5 (CEM), implying that extraction with Triton X-100 yielded good separation of lipid rafts from BIP and -adaptin not detected in CEM fractions. Caveolin 1 expression was not restricted to CEM and was also found in other fractions in WT cells. As shown previously (25 to 27), PS1 was also concentrated in raft fractions. Caveolin 1 expression was detected in fraction 5 in WT cells (Fig. 6A) but not in PS1/2 null cells (Fig. 6B). In PS1/2 null cells, caveolin 1 was only present in fraction 7 and in high density fractions (fractions 9 to 12) with Triton X-100-soluble proteins. This result shows that in the absence of presenilins, caveolin 1 was not detected in the low density fractions normally enriched in caveolae (fractions 4 and 5), further supporting the fact that caveolae do not form. Most surprisingly, flotillin 1 expression was no longer associated with lipid rafts in PS1/2 null cells, implying that not only caveolae but also other lipid rafts may be affected by a deficiency in presenilins expression..

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	49	The mechanism by which presenilins, such as chaperone proteins, will allow the correct caveolin 1 localization and caveolae formation does not involve a complex between caveolin 1 and presenilin and is independent from Notch 1 signaling (Fig. 4). Flotillin 1 always targets to the lipid raft/caveolae fractions independent of the presence of caveolin (28). Thus, the absence of flotillin 1 from lipid raft fractions in PS1/2 null cells is not because of caveolin 1 mislocalization, implying that the mechanism by which presenilins transport raft proteins to lipid rafts is more global and may directly affect a common protein involved in the targeting of raft-associated proteins to lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are multifunctional organelles playing important roles in a variety of cellular processes, and in this work, we pointed to an important new role for presenilins..

APP was found in membrane fractions with caveolae-like properties (29), suggesting that caveolae-type structures might be important in the manifestation of AD. Moreover, targeting -secretase to lipid rafts was shown to up-regulate -site processing of APP (30), and presenilins were found highly enriched in caveolin-3-positive caveolae in astrocytes surrounding senile plaques (31). Recently, -secretase complex was shown to be localized in lipid raft microdomains of post-Golgi and endosomes (32). We can thus postulate that in neurons, presenilins may be implicated in the trafficking of proteins such as flotillin 1, which is responsible for lipid raft formation. These lipid rafts would form the best environment for -secretase activity. A better understanding of how -secretase complex is formed and transported to the cell membrane may lead to the development of new pharmacological strategies to specifically target the cleavage of APP and delay the progress of AD..

In all these cases, the pathogenic mutation is in the protein that is deposited in the diseased tissue and in these cases the whole protein is deposited. In Alzheimer's disease, mutations in APP or presenilin 1 or 2 cause autosomal dominant disease and these are the substrate and proteases, respectively, which are responsible for the production of the deposited peptide, Ass. Thus, in all cases, the mutations lead to the disease by a mechanism that involves the deposition process. We briefly review this remarkably predictable biology, but also point out that it seems sporadic forms of all these diseases are predisposed to by genetic variability at the same loci, strongly suggesting that the quantity of the normal protein produced influences risk for the sporadic forms of the disease. The evidence for this assertion is strongest in Parkinson's disease (PD), where genetic variability in -synuclein expression affects risk of developing disease, although the oldest evidence for the notion that increased expression of normal sequence protein can lead to disease comes from the observation of Alzheimer's disease in trisomy 21 cases. From these observations, we make predictions concerning the etiology and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases in general..

The loci underlying the autosomal dominant forms of Creuzfeldt to Jakob disease (1), frontal temporal dementia (2) and Parkinson's disease have been identified (3). In each case, the underlying locus has encoded the protein that is often deposited in the disease. In Creuzfeldt to Jakob disease, this is the prion protein: in frontal temporal dementia, it is tau, and in Parkinson's disease it is -synuclein. In Alzheimer's disease, the situation is a little more complex in that the deposited peptide, Ass, is derived from a fragment of the APP protein when metabolized by the -secretase complex: a key component of this complex are the presenilins and mutations in either APP or presenilin 1 or 2 can lead to disease (4 to 6)..

In each of these examples, the precise  pathologic species  of protein is obscure, if there is one, and it is debated whether the deposits themselves, or some intermediate species such as an oligomer, are responsible. This has been extensively investigated, with the balance of recent data favoring smaller intermediate species as the toxic entities (8); however, the generality of the fact that the mutated protein in each example can be deposited suggests that the process of pathogenicity is related to, although perhaps separable from, the process of deposition..

It has long been recognized that homozygosity at codon 129 predisposes to sporadic disease, presumably because of the necessity of prion to prion interactions and symmetry considerations (9,10). However, in addition to this well-established risk, recent genetic data have shown that the prion haplotype confers additional risk to idiopathic disease (11), clearly suggesting that genetic variability in prion expression contributes to disease risk. While these genetic data do not establish whether high expressors or low expressors are more susceptible, and since prion knockout mice are completely resistant to disease (12), it is most parsimonious to expect that those who express high levels of prion protein, and are homozygotes at codon 129, are most susceptible to disease..

However, analysis of data from sibpairs affected with late-onset Alzheimer's disease has consistently suggested that APP is a locus for this form of disease (14,15). This suggests that genetic variability at the APP locus contributes to disease risk, although the precise variability has not been identified. Such a finding is consistent with the longstanding observation that individuals with trisomy 21 inevitably develop Alzheimer pathology by their fifth decade (16); however, those few cases of Down syndrome caused by triplication of chromosome 21 distal to the APP gene do not develop Alzheimer's disease (17). Thus, having three copies of the APP gene leads to Alzheimer pathology in the fifth decade and as yet unidentified genetic variability at the APP locus appears to contribute to disease risk..

There are many sporadic diseases in which tau pathology occurs, usually as tangles, but also as Pick bodies or Argyrophilic grains (18). There are two genetic haplotype clades in Caucasian populations, designated H1 and H2, which differ in intron sizes, promoter sequence and wobble bases (19). The H1 haplotype has a frequency of 75% in Caucasians, and thus the H1 homozygotes constitute 60% of such populations. However, individuals with one of the three sporadic tau diseases, progressive supranuclear palsy (19), corticobasal degeneration (20) and argyrophilic grain disease (21), although not Pick's disease (22) or Guam disease (23), show a robust association with H1 homozygosity, with a frequency of H1 homozygotes being 95%. These data show clearly that variability in either tau expression or tau splicing variability (or both) contribute to disease risk. In this case, it is difficult to determine whether it is control of splicing or control of expression which is the key variable because it is indeed clear that many mutations which lead to Mendelian disease do so through altering alternate splicing (2,24)..

Perhaps most convincingly, triplication of the whole -synuclein locus causes autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease/Lewy body dementia with an onset age in the fourth decade (29) and duplication of the locus leads to disease in the fifth decade (30). Thus, with Parkinson's disease, there is a clear dose relationship between synuclein expression and disease occurrence, with normal genetic variability in the promoter contributing to the risk of typical idiopathic disease and with multiplications of the locus causing Mendelian disease with an onset age determined by the precise  dose . Protein studies in cell lines from affected individuals in these kindreds reveal that the amount of -synuclein produced correlates with disease (A. Singleton et al., unpublished data; 31)..

The usual method to test variability in the control of expression is to tie an artificial and arbitrary reporter construct to a bacterially-derived reporter gene and measure its transient effect on expression in a tumor-derived cell line. Clearly such experiments are unlikely to yield data of direct relevance to subtle effects of variation on gene expression. The development of allele-specific gene expression methods (33,34) offers hope that more subtle effects can be studied although these methods are arduous and require access to large numbers of well-maintained human brain specimens (33)..

These simple observations lead to some predictions: the mutant and wild-type proteins are quantitatively different, not qualitatively different in their properties in all cases; in other diseases where protein deposition is part of the process, such as the polyglutamine diseases and ALS, genetic variability in the promoter of the gene should be considered as a factor influencing, where applicable, risk of sporadic disease or age of onset of familial disease (see 35 for suggestions that this might also be the case in Huntington's disease); in polyglutamine diseases in which the deposited fragment is cleaved from a precursor molecule, genetic variability in the cleaving proteases or other interactors which influence stability should be assessed as a risk factor loci; other loci which impact on risk for these diseases in general, may merely cause their effect through altering the levels of the primary proteins, either because they are transcription factors, or because they are responsible for protein breakdown..

Missense mutations in the APP gene causing familial AD are clustered around the ss-, - and particular -secretase cleavage sites. We systematically compare in primary neurons the effect on APP processing of a series of clinical APP mutations (two of which not characterized before) located in close proximity to the -secretase cleavage site. We confirm and extend previous observations showing that all these mutations (T714I, V715M, V715A, I716V, V717I and V717L) affect -secretase cleavage causing an increased relative ratio of Ass42 to Ass40. Taking advantage of these extended series of APP mutations we were able to demonstrate an inverse correlation between these ratios and the age at onset of the disease in the different families. In addition, a subset of mutations caused the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments indicating that these mutations also influence the stability of APP C-terminal fragments.

0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene were the first to be recognized to cause early-onset autosomal-dominant Alzheimer s disease (AD). Since the initial report of a pathogenic APP mutation (1), 10 different APP mutations have been identified in a limited number of early-onset AD families (2 to 10; C.Van Broeckhoven, unpublished data). All mutations cluster near the proteolytic cleavage sites in APP and were shown to affect the release of amyloidss (Ass) (6 to 8,11 to 18; C.Van Broeckhoven, unpublished data). Release of Ass involves successive cleavages by ss-secretase (BACE) and -secretase. BACE cleaves APP between residues 671 and 672 (codon numbering of the APP770 isoform) or between residues 681 and 682 (19), leading to the secretion of the APP ectodomain (sAPPss) in the extracellular medium and to the retention of a 12 kDa cell-bound C-terminal fragment (CTFss or C99). Further cleavage of CTFss by -secretase, predominantly occurring between residues 711 and 712 (40-cleavage), and to a lesser extent between residues 713 and 714 (42-cleavage), results in the secretion of, respectively, a 40 and 42 amino acid Ass peptide (Ass40 and Ass42). The remaining 55 to 57 residue long CTF (CTF or C55/57, or AID:APP intracellular domain), is rapidly degraded (P.Cupers, W.Annaert and B.De Stooper, manuscript submitted for publication) and is only present at extremely low levels in vitro (20,21) and in vivo (22). The function of this fragment remains elusive. Alternatively, APP can be cleaved within the Ass sequence by -secretase, leading to the secretion of the APP ectodomain (sAPP) and the retention of a 10 kDa CTF (CTF or C83). Subsequent cleavage of CTF by -secretase leads to the production of a 3 kDa N-truncated amyloid peptide, named p3..

Moreover, the finding that mutagenesis of critical aspartate residues (D257 and D385) in PS1 causes reduced Ass secretion and accumulation of APPCTFs led to the hypothesis that PS1 may exert an aspartyl protease activity and that it might be identical to -secretase (24). In addition to most APP mutations, PS interferes with -secretase activity in such a way that production of the highly amyloidogenic Ass42 is increased (25). Consequently, a leading hypothesis for AD etiology is  the amyloid cascade hypothesis  (26) stating that increased Ass42 secretion represents a gain of misfunction..

We specifically immunoprecipitated Ass40 or Ass42 from the conditioned medium using antibody FCA3340 or antibody FCA3542, respectively (28). All APP C-terminal mutations with the exception of V715M, increased Ass1 to 42 secretion (Fig. 1). The increase in Ass1 to 42 ranged from 1.54-fold for T714I to 2.71-fold for V717L (Fig. 1C). This was accompanied by an increase in the N-truncated Ass-isoforms ending at residue 42 (Assx-42). These isoforms run in the gels as doublet bands (Fig. 1B), and are presumably generated by alternative ss-secretase activity at amino acid residue 11 (19,29) or by -secretase activity at amino acid residue 17 (30) of the Ass sequence. Ass1 to 40, on the other hand, is decreased with most mutations. The T714I, V715M and V715A mutations reduce Ass1 to 40 secretion most drastically to 20, 30 and 55% of the wild-type levels, respectively. The V717I and V717L mutations affect Ass40 secretion to a lesser extent and the I716V mutation has apparently no effect on Ass40 secretion (Fig. 1C). The secretion of N-truncated Ass40 isoforms (Assx-40) was decreased to an extent comparable to Ass1 to 40..

By far the largest increase (8.20-fold) was observed with the T714I mutant, corroborating our previous data in HEK-293 cells (8). It is striking that this mutant is also clinically the most aggressive one and displays an unusually early age of onset of 34 years, compared to other APP mutations. It will be interesting to test this mutant in APP transgenic mice, anticipating the rapid development of amyloid plaques and disease in these animals. More importantly, by systematically analysing an extended series of C-terminal APP mutants in a single neuronal expression paradigm, we were able to demonstrate for the first time a clear inverse correlation between Ass42/Ass40 ratio and age of onset for the APP mutations, which strongly supports (a variant of) the  amyloid peptide hypothesis . It should be mentioned that in APP V717I families age of onset is apparently modulated by the APOE genotype with APOE4 decreasing and APOE2 increasing the age of onset (31,32). The other APP mutations were found in single families and APOE data is too sparse to allow analysis of APOE effect on age of onset (http://molgen-www.uia.ac.be/ADMutations/). Our correlation data also contrast with the observation that in PS1 families, age of onset is not inversely correlated with Ass42 secretion (33 to 35). In these families, age of onset is also not influenced by APOE genotype (36). Remarkably, the observed correlation only holds true when the relative levels of Ass42 to Ass40 are considered. It is not completely clear why absolute amounts of Ass42 do not correlate with age at onset of disease. A  protective  role of Ass40 seems unlikely since Ass40 levels by themselves are not correlated with age at onset of disease (data not shown)..

It should be mentioned that in APP V717I families age of onset is apparently modulated by the APOE genotype with APOE4 decreasing and APOE2 increasing the age of onset (31,32). The other APP mutations were found in single families and APOE data is too sparse to allow analysis of APOE effect on age of onset (http://molgen-www.uia.ac.be/ADMutations/). Our correlation data also contrast with the observation that in PS1 families, age of onset is not inversely correlated with Ass42 secretion (33 to 35). In these families, age of onset is also not influenced by APOE genotype (36). Remarkably, the observed correlation only holds true when the relative levels of Ass42 to Ass40 are considered. It is not completely clear why absolute amounts of Ass42 do not correlate with age at onset of disease. A  protective  role of Ass40 seems unlikely since Ass40 levels by themselves are not correlated with age at onset of disease (data not shown)..
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	32	At the level of -secretase processing, the different mutations apparently have slightly different effects. Mutations at codons 714 (T714I) and 715 (V715A and V715M) appear to primarily affect the 40-cleavage and cause a decreased secretion of Ass40. Mutations at codons 716 (I716V) and 717 (V717I and V717L) predominantly affect the 42-cleavage and increase Ass42 secretion. Hence, pathogenic APP mutations exert their largest effect on the cleavage site which is located two or three residues more N-terminal to the substitution (Fig. 5A). This suggests that the residues in the P3' and P4' positions are of particular importance for the exposure of the scissile bounds to the catalytic sites of the -secretase protease(s). Remarkably, the drastic decreases in Ass40 secretion observed with the mutations at codons 714 and 715 are not clearly accompanied by a large increase in Ass42 secretion. However, as we demonstrated previously for the APP T714I mutation (8), Ass isoforms ending at residues 39, 38 and to a lesser extent 37 may counterbalance the decrease in Ass40. Overall, it follows that the ratio of Ass42 to Ass40 is the best indicator of the severity of the disease in patients with APP mutations..

Arrows below the residue number indicate the effect of the mutation on secretion of the corresponding Ass isoform. (B) Top view of a spatial model for the putative -helical conformation [adapted from Lichtenthaler et al. (38)] of part of the transmembrane region of APP near the -secretase cleavage site is shown. Residues that, when mutated, mainly affect the 40 cleavage (bold line) are fully encircled. Residues that when mutated affect predominantly 42 cleavage (dashed line) are encircled with dashes.

0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	35	  Unexpectedly, APP C-terminal mutations also influence the levels of APPCTFs. The T714I, V717I and V717L mutations cause the accumulation of APPCTFs in neurons, whereas the V715A, V715M or I716V mutations have no significant effect on APPCTF levels. Both - and ss-secretase-generated APPCTFs increase approximately to the same extent. This elevation is not clearly accompanied by increased secretion of the sAPP, indicating that the accumulation of APPCTFs is not the direct result of increased - or ss-secretase processing of APP. Increased levels of APPCTFs could also result from reduced -secretase activity (23). It could be envisaged that the presence of the C-terminal APP mutation reduces -secretase activity. Since Ass40 is the major Ass isoform produced, a specific reduction of the 40 cleavage could theoretically explain the accumulation of APPCTFs while maintaining Ass42 levels at a pathogenic level. However, the APP mutations that drastically decreased Ass40 secretion (V715A and V715M) did not display APPCTF accumulation, whereas the others (V717I and V717L) did not significantly affect Ass40 secretion but accumulated APPCTFs. Therefore, the effect of the latter mutations on APPCTF metabolism must occur independently from the -secretase cleavage step. Our pulse to chase data indicated a reduced turnover rate of these mutant CTFs, suggesting that these APP mutations not only affect -secretase processing, but also the catabolic pathways that degrade these fragments. Accumulation of APPCTFs was shown before with the Swedish and London APP mutants K670N/M671L, V717I, V717F and V717G (37), in agreement with our findings. McPhie et al. (37) proposed that APPCTFss is linked to a signalling transduction pathway. Accumulation of APPCTFss was speculated to disrupt this pathway, leading to cytoskeletal abnormalities and neurodegeneration. However, our data show that accumulation of APPCTFs is not a consistent feature of all APP mutants causing AD. In fact, mutations V717I and I716V result in a very similar mean age of onset, whereas APPCTFs accumulate with the former but not with the latter. Therefore, accumulation of APPCTFs is likely a less important factor in the overall pathogenesis of the disease. It would be of interest to investigate these different mutations at the pathological level in the brain of patients. Unfortunately, no material is yet available from patients with mutations that do not cause APPCTF accumulation, i.e. mutations at positions 715 or 716 of the APP sequence..

If one presumes an -helical conformation for the transmembraneous part of APP (38) (Fig. 5B), then the mutations at residues 714 and 715, which primarily affect 40-secretase cleavage, are located at one side of the helix, whereas mutations at residues 716 and 717, which predominantly affect 42-secretase cleavage, are located at the opposite side. It should be noted that the mutations at residues 714 and 717, leading to accumulation of APPCTFs, are located at one side of the helix, whereas mutations at residues 715 and 716, which do not lead to accumulation of APPCTFs are at the other side (Fig. 5B). Our recent unpublished data (W.Annaert and B.De Strooper) demonstrated that the region in APP spanning the currently investigated clinical mutations is involved in the direct binding of APP to PS1. We speculate, therefore, that the investigated clinical mutations cause subtle changes in the binding interaction between PS1 and APP, and therefore mainly affect exposure of the scissile bonds to the catalytic site of -secretase The abnormal accumulation of APPCTFs observed with some of the APP mutants could also fit this hypothesis, since the PS1 D257A catalytic site mutant leads to accumulation of APPCTFs without the concomitant reduction in Ass production (27)..

Although a few percentage of patients are familial cases linked to mutations in amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 or presenilin 2 genes, the remainder are considered mainly sporadic late-onset cases with a complex etiology. However, changes in gene expression or other genetic features of the individual can clearly contribute to develop the illness. Consequently, in this paper we have focused on the identification of new genes, the expression of which is altered in AD. We used the technique of differential display reverse transcriptase to polymerase chain reaction (DDRT to PCR) in order to study the gene expression differences in brain tissue from patients in an advanced stage of AD. After studying medial septum and hippocampus brain areas, we found an inhibition of the KIAA0471 gene expression in three out of six AD patients, including one with a presenilin 1 gene mutation. This gene encodes for a large protein that presents, in its predicted form, 95% homology with IDN4-GGTR sequences. These results may provide significant clues for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying septohippocampal neurodegeneration. In addition, they may open a new area of research for diagnostic and therapeutic tools, the relevance of which is also considered..

The band disappeared in both hippocampus and septum of three out of the six AD patients (including one with the PS1 mutation) and was present in all the three analyzed controls. These results were confirmed after reproducing the experiments in duplicate from the RNA isolation step, validating the observed pattern of expression and suggesting that in-depth characterization of the identified gene is warranted. In addition, we found other differences in band intensities that could not be confirmed and therefore had been discarded..

Differential display analysis of gene expression in AD: Total RNA was extracted from hippocampus and septum of post-mortem AD and control patients. The autoradiogram shows the band pattern obtained from [-33P]dATP-labeled differential display reactions performed in duplicate using 5'-AAGCTTTTTTTTTTTG-3' as an anchored primer (H-T11G) and 5'-AAGCTTCCTCTAT-3' as a random arbitrary primer (H-AP53). The arrow indicates a band corresponding to a cDNA fragment that is differentially expressed in some AD patients. A to I indicates Alzheimer's patients and controls. AD is for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD*: patient with the mutation in the PS1 gene) and C for controls. Two brain areas were analyzed per case: hippocampus (1) and septum (3). The different lanes are numbered from 1 to 30, and every two lanes correspond to the same duplicated sample. Patient E is not included in the figure and gives results similar to patients B and D..

The nucleotide sequence of the most representative clones (1 and 4) was identical (Fig. 2B). To further confirm these differences, northern blot analysis was performed with some AD patients (Fig. 2C). On the basis of known sequences of GenBank database, the fragment sequence presented a high homology (98%, e-166) with the Homo sapiens gene product KIAA0471. The sequence of this mRNA is part of a human brain cDNA library included in the Japanese protein database HUGE (human unidentified gene-encoded) (13). HUGE is a database for human large proteins that aims to predict primary structures from sequences of human large cDNAs ( > 4 kb), in particular cDNA clones capable of coding for large proteins ( > 50 kDa) (14). KIAA0471 is a 6834 bp gene located on chromosome 1 that maps in the 1q24 to q25 region, having a 5309 bp 3'-UTR..

As DDRT to PCR method is a powerful technique for identifying differentially expressed transcripts between two or more tissues or cell types of interest (15), our main objective was to apply this technique to identify new genes responsible for expression changes involved in AD. In order to carry it out, we analyzed human brain samples of Alzheimer's patients and age-matched controls, whose medical history was fully documented. This fact limited the number of samples to a few but extremely well qualified patients. We followed this approach to avoid false results associated with variations in the patient conditions such as those related with agonal state (tissue pH and terminal medical conditions) (16). Differences in expression could not be due to differences in the cellular composition of the samples because all the blocks of hippocampus and septum were accurately obtained from the same area. As shown by cDNA bands, profiles displayed by all these samples, the limited differences of age and post-mortem interval did not affect the study..

0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	20	We have identified one cDNA that is not expressed in septum or hippocampus of several Alzheimer's patients (including the one with the PS1 mutation). As it was necessary to screen  > 35% of total mRNA to observe a difference in AD gene expression, this transcript could be important among the total genes potentially associated with AD. The differential mRNA was identified as KIAA0471. At this stage, this KIAA0471 mRNA cannot be directly associated with any known protein, but based on its predicted coding region it would be translated into a soluble large protein with a length of 370 amino acids (20) and a molecular weight of 43 kDa. This predicted protein presents at least 95% homology with H. sapiens aminoacid sequences of the IDN4-GGTR membrane protein, a protein associated with precancerous lesions of hepatocellular carcinoma (EMBL Bioinformatic Harvester). Recent experiments by DDRT to PCR reported an upregulation of KIAA0471 gene products in 7 out of 12 cases with esophageal tumors (21). Studies of predicted KIAA proteins indicate that having multiple domains they may participate in an intricate framework of assembly protein complexes. Their predicted functions are mainly implied in cell communication/signaling, cell structure/motility or nucleic acid management (22). This would be in agreement with an increased KIAA0471 expression in proliferative cells and its reduction in the neuronal loss associated with neurodegeneration. If true, the absence of KIAA0471 expression evidenced by our results may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of septohippocampal lesion presented in AD. At present, studies are being directly conducted to determine entire sequences of human KIAA proteins together with their biological functions and will help to better understand its involvement in a variety of diseases (23)..

A possible genetic association of presenilin 2 and KIAA0471 with AD cannot be discarded as both genes map in the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q24 to q25 KIAA0471 and 1q31 to q42 PS2). AD mutations in this chromosome result in individuals with a wide range in age of onset (24) and the same is also shown by our results. A special instability of the 1q chromosome is also suggested by the presentation of genetic abnormalities leading to gliomas (oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas) (25) and ependymomas (26). On the other hand, well-characterized diseases sometimes appear linked to genetic mutations in the same loci where KIAA0471 maps (1q24 to q25). This is the case of type 2 diabetes (27), immunoglobulin A nephropathy (28) and hereditary prostate cancer 1 (29). At present, no direct relationship with AD has been established for most of these diseases, except the recently recognized association among hyperinsulinemia, diabetes and AD (30) and the insulin-degrading enzyme activity on ss-amyloid peptides (31 to 33). Therefore, knowledge of the function of KIAA0471 protein in the future could elucidate their possible relationship. This deficiency in KIAA0471 only showed up in male individuals and, though only one AD woman was included in this study, further study will be necessary to disentangle whether there is a link to gender..

Mutations in PS1 are one of the major causes of familiar Alzheimer's disease. PSs are also involved in regulating the Wnt/ss-catenin signaling pathway, but how exactly remains a highly controversial issue (for full discussion see www.alzforum.org/members/forums/journal/catenin/index.html). In this issue, Soriano et al. 2001 provide results to tip the scales definitively in favor of the concept that PS1 operates as a negative regulator of the Wnt/ss-catenin signaling pathway..

0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	4	ss-catenin, neural plakophilin related armadillo protein (NPRAP, also called -catenin), and p0071 previously were known to bind to the large cytoplasmic loop domain of PS1 (see www.alzforum.org/members/forums/journal/catenin/index.html). These proteins are all characterized by repeats of the armadillo motif, a 42 amino acid sequence involved in protein to protein interactions, however, only the function of ss-catenin has been fairly well established. One pool of ss-catenin is bound at the cell membrane to the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin and provides a link to the actin cytoskeleton. A second pool is located in the cytoplasm in complex with axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and glycogen-synthase-kinase-3ss (GSK-3ss). Phosphorylation of ss-catenin by GSK-3ss promotes its binding to the ss-transducing repeat-containing protein (ss-TrCP), an F-box protein, and part of the E2/E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Maniatis 1999 ). Upon ubiquitination, ss-catenin becomes rapidly degraded by the proteasome (Fig 1). Binding of the soluble ligand Wnt to the membrane receptor frizzled inhibits GSK-3ss via a pathway involving casein kinases and the protein disheveled. This results in the accumulation of unphosphorylated ss-catenin in the cytoplasm and its subsequent translocation to the cell nucleus. Here, ss-catenin binds to members of the LEF/TCF (T cell-specific transcription factor 1) family of transcriptional regulators and activates Wnt target genes like cyclin D1, c-myc, and metalloproteases. Thus, a finely tuned balance between the three ss-catenin pools at the cell membrane, in the cytoplasm, and in the nucleus, determines the final outcome of the Wnt signaling pathway (Fig 1, for a detailed overview see www. stanford.edu/rnusse/wntwindow.html)..

PS1 appeared to either stabilize (Zhang et al. 1998 ) or destabilize ss-catenin (Kang et al. 1999 ). Remarkably, clinical PS mutations that cause Alzheimer's disease also affected ss-catenin stability positively or negatively. Given these contradictory results it remains unclear to what extent these observations contribute to our understanding of the disease (see www.alzforum.org/members/forums/journal/catenin/index.html). In an attempt to avoid methodological confusion, Soriano et al. 2001 have been careful not to overexpress proteins, to use primary cultures (and not large T-transformed cultures) of PS1 knockout fibroblasts, to apply rigorous controls, and to use several functional assays to make their point. They convincingly demonstrate that ss-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasmic pool and LEF/TCF gene transcription becomes activated in the absence of PS1. Their conclusion that presenilin is a negative regulator of the Wnt/ss-catenin pathway gains considerable support from recent in vivo studies in Drosophila melanogaster, showing that an accumulation of armadillo (the Drosophila homologue of ss-catenin) was observed in PS-deficient blastoderm embryos (Noll et al. 2000 ). A genetic screen for suppressors of the armadillo phenotype yielded the Drosophila PS (Cox et al. 2000 )..

0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	9	An important question is how PS1 affects ss-catenin stability. Since PS1 can bind GSK-3ss, it is tempting to speculate that it provides a scaffold for the phosphorylation of ss-catenin (Kang et al. 1999 ). Interestingly, the ss-catenin interaction site on PS1 contains a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by GSK-3ss (Kirchenbaum et al. 2000 ), suggesting that this interaction is regulated as is the interaction of ss-catenin with the axin/APC/GSK-3ss complex. However, from the data of Soriano et al. 2001 , it appears that PS1 is not needed for the phosphorylation of ss-catenin since phosphorylated ss-catenin species accumulate in PS1 deficient cells. Furthermore, in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, fewer ubiquitinated ss-catenin species are observed in PS1 deficient cells than in wild-type cells (Soriano et al. 2001 ). Instead, these results suggest that PS1 is needed for the ubiquitination of ss-catenin (but see Noll et al. 2000 ) and raise intriguing questions concerning the relationship of PS1 with the ubiquitin ligase machinery and the proteasome (Fig 1)..

0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	11	PS1 is also involved in the Notch 1 signaling pathway. Notch 1 belongs to a family of large type I integral membrane receptors involved in cell fate decisions. Upon ligand binding, Notch becomes proteolytically processed. Its intracellular domain translocates to the nucleus where it binds to transcription regulators of the CSL family and induces the expression of Notch target genes (Fig 1). PS1 functions in the proteolytic complex needed to generate the intramembranous cleavage of Notch, not unlike the cleavage of APP (Kopan and Goate 2000 ). The embryonic lethal phenotype of the mice in which the PS1 genes have been inactivated can largely be explained by deficiencies in the Notch signaling system and therefore the physiological relevance of the ss-catenin/PS1 connection in mammals remained somewhat speculative. However, as discussed in Soriano et al. 2001 , mice that specifically lack expression of PS1 in the skin have been generated (Zheng, H., unpublished results). These mice develop a spectrum of skin tumors, suggestive of increased ss-catenin activity and the concept that PS1 may act as a repressor of this pathway in adulthood..

0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	13	Inhibitory cross-talk between the Notch and the Wnt signaling pathways previously was thought to occur at the level of the Notch extracellular domain binding to Wnt (Wesley 1999 ), and at the level of the Notch intracellular domain binding to disheveled (Axelrod et al. 1996 ). PS1 seems now to provide a third level where such interaction could theoretically occur. Deleting the cytoplasmic loop domain of PS1 annihilates its binding with ss-catenin, whereas the proteolytic cleavage of Notch and APP is maintained (Saura et al. 2000 ; Soriano et al. 2001 ). The function of PS1 in ss-catenin turnover can thus be separated from its function in -secretase processing. As in many biological questions, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans could shed some light on this matter. Wu et al. 1998 provided evidence that a protein encoded by sel-10, a suppressor of the Notch signaling pathway, associates functionally and physically with SEL-12, the worm's homologue of human PS. SEL10 is related to the CDC4 family of F box/WD40 repeat containing proteins. These proteins are part of the E3-enzymes of the ubiquitin-ligation pathway and appear to function as adapters that recruit target proteins to a complex containing the E2 to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Maniatis 1999 ). More than 30 mammalian homologues including ss-TrCP have been identified (Winston et al. 1999 ). The challenge now is to find out whether PS1 provides a scaffold for ss-TrCP or other members of the F-box protein family and ubiquitin-ligase substrates like ss-catenin. It also will be important to establish whether the current findings can be extended to other proteins that bind to PS, e.g., NPRAP and p0071. In conclusion, PS1 is involved in at least two proteolytic machines regulating signal transduction cascades: regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Notch and APP on one hand (Brown et al. 2000 ), and regulated protein degradation of ss-catenin in the Wnt signaling pathway on the other (Noll et al. 2000 ; Soriano et al. 2001 )..

0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	2	   Introduction Top Introduction Panel A Panel B Panel C References   Notch signaling is both simple and complex. It is simple because no secondary messengers are required as Notch can directly report to the nucleus after contact with ligand at the plasma membrane. Notch acts as a membranebound transcription factor that is released in response to ligand binding by two proteases acting sequentially. The freed intracellular domain enters the nucleus, where it interacts with a DNA-bound protein to activate transcription of selected targets. Notch signaling is complex because it regulates an astonishingly large number of cellular decisions during development (Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999) and in the adult (Milner and Bigas, 1999). In addition, the regulation of Notch proteolysis is complex, involving an array of accessory proteins whose functions have been elucidated only recently (Kramer, 2001; Mumm and Kopan, 2000). Finally, genetic experiments indicate that Notch may also have a separate, proteolysis-independent function at the membrane, where it acts together with Wnt to affect developmental competence (Brennan et al., 1999a; Ramain et al., 2001)..

0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	6	   Panel A Top Introduction Panel A Panel B Panel C References   The core elements of the Notch signaling system include the Notch receptor, DSL ligands (Delta and Serrate/Jagged in Drosophila and vertebrates, Lag-2 in C. elegans) and CSL DNA-binding proteins (CBF1/RBPjk in vertebrates, Suppressor of hairless in Drosophila, Lag-1 in C. elegans). Only some target genes are known and the first identified are members of the HES (Hairy/Enhancer of Split) family of basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulators (not illustrated). Notch proteins (and ligands) contain extracellular EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like repeats. The repeats 11-12 of Notch (pink) interact with the DSL domain of ligands (pink). The EGF repeats in Delta-like ligands are continuous whereas in the Serrate-like ligands they are interspersed with short linker sequences. Notch can be modified in the Golgi by a glycosyltransferase called Fringe (Blair, 2000) on specific fucose-modified EGF repeats. Fringe is expressed only in a subset of cells; Notch is hyperactivated when Fringe-expressing and -nonexpressing territories abut, forming a boundary (Irvine and Rauskolb, 2001; Wu and Rao, 1999). Notch is secreted to the cell surface in a Furin-convertase-dependent step (Logeat et al., 1998). The LNR (Lin/Notch Repeat; red) domain maintains the association between the polypeptides resulting from the Furin cleavage (at site 1 or S1). The intracellular domain contains the RAM23 domain (RAM), which enhances interaction with CSL protein. The Notch intracellular domain (NICD) contains nuclear localization signals (NLS), a CDC 10/ankyrin repeat domain (ANK), which mediates interactions with CSL and other proteins, and a domain rich in proline, glutamate, serine and threonine residues (PEST). Also shown are neuralized (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), presenilin (an intramembrane cleaving protease; I-CliP) (Huppert and Kopan, 2001) and Nicastrin, a protein that interacts with presenilin and is required for plasma membrane localization and stabilization of presenilin (Kopan and Goate, 2002). Presenilin and Nicastrin are part of -secretase, an activity contributing to Alzheimer's disease (Kopan and Goate, 2000). A metalloprotease at the cell surface is also required for Notch signaling (Mumm and Kopan, 2000). In the nucleus, CSL binds SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor) and SKIP (ski-related protein). These proteins facilitate nuclear localization of CSL (Zhou and Hayward, 2001) and, together with histone deacetylase (HDAC), repress transcription from target genes (Mumm and Kopan, 2000). In Drosophila, CSL interacts with Hairless and C-terminalbinding protein (CtBP) to mediate repression (see panel 5) (Morel et al., 2001). This is the basal state of cells in which Notch is inactive or absent..

0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	10	Despite being associated with the presenilin complex, Notch cannot be cleaved since its extracellular domain somehow blocks presenilin activity. After ligand binding, neuralized adds a ubiquitin to the intracellular domain of delta and triggers its endocytosis (2) (Kramer, 2001). Ligand endocytosis triggers a conformational change in Notch that permits metalloproteases to cleave near the membrane at a second site (S2), then the extracellular domain is trans-endocytosed to the ligand-expressing cell (3) (Parks et al., 2000). This event permits presenilin to cleave Notch at a third site (S3) located within its transmembrane domain (4) (Mumm and Kopan, 2000). NICD is now free to translocate to the nucleus. In cells expressing both Notch and ligand, ligand interferes with this process by an unknown mechanism; this interference may be relieved by the neuralized protein, which targets Delta for degradation (Kramer, 2001)..

Our current understanding proposes that this conversion occurs by direct protein-protein interactions between the Notch intracellular domain, SKIP and CSL, which leads to SMRT/HDAC dissociation (reviewed by Mumm and Kopan, 2000). This alone is sufficient to express some target genes. Notch/CSL can recruit histone acetylases (HATs) to assist in chromatin remodeling, and Mastermind/Lag-3 to activate additional targets. The metabolism of NICD in the nucleus is controlled by phosphorylation and ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Sel-10 (Gupta-Rossi et al., 2001; Oberg et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2001) and Su(Dx) (Cornell et al., 1999). NICD degradation resets the cell and prepares it for the next round of Notch signaling..

The evidence for the existence of such a signaling axis in Drosophila is compelling, although still at an earlier phase of discovery compared with the Notch/CSL axis (A,B). Therefore, many of the arrows in this panel describe genetic interactions rather than biochemical mechanism..
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	15	Two specific regions of Notch are required for this activity: the `Abruptex' region of Notch (EGF repeats 17-29, dark blue) (Brennan et al., 1997; Brennan et al., 1999b; Ramain et al., 2001) and the region C-terminal to the ANK repeats that contains the PEST domain (Brennan et al., 1997; Ramain et al., 2001). This region was previously shown to bind Dishevelled (Dsh). Dsh is a mediator of Wnt signals downstream of the Frizzled (Frz) receptors (Huelsken and Birchmeier, 2001). During Drosophila neurogenesis, CSL-dependent Notch signals restrict neural competence to a small number of cells within an equivalence group (Kopan and Turner, 1996). In this newly recognized role, Notch acts to prevent cells from acquiring neural or myogenic competence earlier in development. Although it is unclear how Notch mediates this effect, or how many additional proteins are involved, this activity requires Deltex, a cytoplasmic ring finger protein (Ramain et al., 2001) and the kinase GSK3ss (Sgg) (Brennan et al., 1999b; Ramain et al., 2001). Deltex and CSL appear to be antagonistic, possibly because both compete for the ANK domain of Notch. This cytoplasmic Notch activity may not require proteolysis (1,1'), however, it has not been determined yet whether presenilin or other proteases are required for the Deltex-dependent Notch activity. Wnt acts to block Notch either directly, via the Abruptex domain (Wesley and Saez, 2000) (1-2) or, more likely, indirectly by stimulating Dsh to block GSK3 or to circumvent Deltex/Notch interaction (or both; 1',2'). Interference with Notch/Deltex activity by Dsh requires the Dsh-binding region of Notch; deletions of this region and some Abruptex mutations render Notch a constitutive repressor of neural competence (2') (Ramain et al., 2001). Removal of both Notch and wingless restores competence, suggesting that the only role of Wnt in acquisition of neural or myogenic competence is to antagonize Notch..

Linkage to the same region was obtained independently in a study of affected LOAD sib-pairs. Together, these two studies provide strong evidence for a novel LOAD locus on chromosome 10 that acts to increase Ass42. VR22 is a large (1.7 Mb) gene located at 80 cM that encodes -T catenin, which is a binding partner of ss catenin. This makes VR22 an attractive candidate gene because ss catenin interacts with presenilin 1, which has many mutations that elevate Ass42 and cause early onset familial AD. We identified two intronic VR22 SNPs (4360 and 4783) in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) that showed highly significant association (P=0.0001 and 0.0006) with plasma Ass42 in 10 extended LOAD families. This association clearly contributed to the linkage at 80 cM because the lod scores decreased when linkage analysis was performed conditional upon the VR22 association. This association replicated in another independent set of 12 LOAD families (P=0.04 for 4783 and P=0.08 for 4360). Bounding of the association region using multiple SNPs showed VR22 to be the only confirmed gene within the region of association. These findings indicate that VR22 has variant(s) which influence Ass42 and contribute to the previously reported linkage for plasma Ass42 in LOAD families..

Twin studies have suggested that as much as 74% of the risk for LOAD may be due to genetic factors (2,3). It is well established that ApoE plays an important role in the genetics of LOAD (4,5). A recent study has estimated, however, that four additional loci make a contribution to the variance in LOAD age at onset that have an effect size similar to or greater than that of ApoE (6). Given the heterogeneity that is likely if at least five loci contribute substantially to the genetics of LOAD, it is not surprising that the large number of single gene association studies that have been performed have so far failed to identify variants that associate reproducibly with LOAD. Other reasons for failure of replication are possible gene to gene, gene to environment interactions that can be difficult to account for and poor study design..

Clinical disease states such as LOAD are likely to result from an uncertain, complex sequence of pathophysiologic events whereas intermediate phenotypes may be more directly related to the action of a set of genes that are more easily identified. Thus the identification of genes with variants that contribute to specific intermediate phenotypes may be a tractable way to identify at least some of the genes that contribute to diseases governed by complex genetics.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	9	In our studies, we have focused on levels of the amyloid ss protein (Ass), specifically Ass42, as a quantitative intermediate phenotype for LOAD. Ass is a secreted protein (10 to 12) derived from a set of large precursor proteins collectively referred to as the amyloid ss protein precursor. Secreted Ass, which is produced by virtually all cells, is readily detected in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Most secreted Ass has forty amino acids (Ass40) but a small fraction (5 to 10%) has two additional amino acids at the carboxyl terminus (Ass42) (13 to 15). In the brains of all patients with AD, a large amount of Ass aggregates and is deposited in senile plaques, much of it in the form of highly insoluble amyloid fibrils. To make a definite diagnosis of AD, large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles must be demonstrated in the brain at autopsy (16). In all LOAD patients, a large amount of the Ass deposited in senile plaques ends at Ass42. In one-third of cases, Ass ending at Ass42 is essentially the only form of Ass deposited, in one-third it is the predominant form and in one-third a large amount of Ass40 is also deposited (17). It is worth noting that synthetic Ass40 and Ass42 both spontaneously assemble into amyloid fibrils in vitro, but Ass42 forms amyloid fibrils far more rapidly than Ass40 (18,19). The brain has very high levels of APP mRNA; the concentration of Ass in cerebrospinal fluid is 50 times higher than in plasma; and mixed fetal brain cultures produce far more Ass than other types of cultured cells (12,20,21). Thus it is likely that senile plaques form specifically in the brain because Ass levels are higher in the brain than in other organs..

Apart from its early onset and causation by specific mutations, EOFAD is clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from LOAD. We and others have shown that the EOFAD mutations all increase Ass42 and sometimes increase Ass40 as well (15,26 to 30). Importantly, we observed plasma Ass42 elevations both in EOFAD patients and in young, cognitively normal carriers of EOFAD mutations (31). We also observed Ass42 elevations in plasma from non-demented relatives of LOAD patients between the ages of 20 and 65 (32). Importantly, these elevations were not associated with the ApoE4 allele or with variants in any of the EOFAD genes (32). Finally, Mayeux et al.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	15	An important advantage of the variance components approach employed here is that candidate genes, identified through their likely effect on Ass42, can be evaluated systematically to determine how much various within-gene variants contribute to linkage. In this study, we analyzed VR22 for variants that contribute to the linkage signal on chromosome 10. Both its location and function make VR22 a strong candidate gene. Located at 80 cM at the peak of the previously reported linkage signal, VR22 encodes a novel catenin, -T catenin, which was recently cloned by Jannsens et al. (39). The catenins interact closely with ss catenin and play an important role in intercellular adhesion as strong intercellular adhesion depends on linkage of the cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton via the /ss catenin complex. -T catenin is closely homologous to -N catenin, which is neuron specific, and to -E catenin, which is expressed in all tissues. -T catenin is expressed at high levels in testis and heart, but it is also expressed in human and mouse brain (39). -T catenin has overall sequence identity of 56 and 58% with -E and -N catenin respectively. Importantly, Jannsens et al. (39) have shown that that -T catenin interacts with ss catenin in a functionally effective fashion. This makes VR22 a strong functional candidate because ss catenin interacts with presenilin 1 (40), which has many mutations that increase Ass42 (26,29,31) and cause early onset familial AD (24). Zhang et al. (40) has shown that loss of signalling through the ss catenin pathway leads to enhanced neuronal vulnerability to Ass. In addition, ss catenin and presenilin forms a complex that leads to stabilization of the former, such that destabilization of this complex leads to ss catenin degradation and enhanced neuronal apoptosis. Presenilin mutations were shown to lead to destabilization of the ss catenin to presenilin complex, degradation of the ss catenin and enhanced Ass production. Given that catenins provide the link between ss catenin and its binding counterparts (such as presenilins) to the actin cytoskeleton, it is possible to postulate that mutations in catenins could lead to disruption of the stability of the ss catenin to presenilin complex resulting in enhanced neuronal vulnerability of cells to Ass and increased Ass production..

These SNPs (Table 1), which spanned 465 bp, were genotyped in the 10 extended LOAD families previously analyzed for linkage (35). In order to minimize age and dementia-related environmental effects on plasma Ass42 levels, we performed all of our analyses on the 20 to 65 year age group, as in our previous studies (34,35). The effect of each of the three VR22 SNPs was analyzed by encoding it as a covariate and testing its effect on the variance of plasma Ass42 in a regression style approach implemented in SOLAR (Table 1). To control for the effect of linkage, the linkage component was included in both the null and alternative models tested. The 4360 (T/C) and 4783 (A/G) SNPs, which were in strong linkage disequilibrium, both showed strong association (P=0.0001 and 0.0006, respectively). The 4825 SNP showed only marginal association (P=0.06, Table 1). All three SNPs were also examined in a second set of 12 additional LOAD families (Table 1) (34). The VR22 4783 SNP showed significant association (P=0.04), VR22 4360 SNP yielded marginal association (P=0.08) and VR22 4825 SNP did not yield significant association (P=0.98) in this additional and smaller dataset. When all 22 families were combined, the significance of association reached P=5.9x10-6 for 4783 and 2.1x10-6 for 4360 SNPs (Table 1). Figure 1 depicts the box plots for the 10*logAss42 levels in the 22 families stratified by the most significant VR22 4360 SNP genotypes. Consistent with the association results, a genotype dependent effect on plasma Ass levels is observed, where 4360 TT genotype is associated with the highest Ass42 levels, CT with intermediate levels and CC with lowest levels..

The 4825 SNP showed only marginal association (P=0.06, Table 1). All three SNPs were also examined in a second set of 12 additional LOAD families (Table 1) (34). The VR22 4783 SNP showed significant association (P=0.04), VR22 4360 SNP yielded marginal association (P=0.08) and VR22 4825 SNP did not yield significant association (P=0.98) in this additional and smaller dataset. When all 22 families were combined, the significance of association reached P=5.9x10-6 for 4783 and 2.1x10-6 for 4360 SNPs (Table 1). Figure 1 depicts the box plots for the 10*logAss42 levels in the 22 families stratified by the most significant VR22 4360 SNP genotypes. Consistent with the association results, a genotype dependent effect on plasma Ass levels is observed, where 4360 TT genotype is associated with the highest Ass42 levels, CT with intermediate levels and CC with lowest levels..

P-values for association with plasma Ass42 in 20 to 65-year-old subjects from extended LOAD families   Bounding of the association between VR22 SNPs and plasma Ass42 To bound the region of VR22 4360/4783 association, we evaluated a total of 49 additional SNPs spaced on either side of the 4360 and 4783 SNPs. These SNPs were selected to be in several groups, which were designed to span the entire VR22 gene at 250 kb intervals as well as the region 3' of VR22. The known exons in VR22 were 43.3 kb (median) away from the closest SNP in the closest SNP group (mean=53.8 kb, 22 to 149 kb). Given that the extent of LD in the human genome was estimated in different studies to be anywhere between 10 and  > 100  kb (41 to 45); and that this extent in any one genomic region is not predictable a priori, it is possible to miss association signals due to variants in-between our SNP groups. However, given the size of VR22, and our extent of coverage throughout and outside this gene, association signals we did identify with the 4360 to 4783 VR22 SNPs will be well-bounded within VR22 with this SNP genotyping design. Three to six SNPs were analyzed in each group, and linkage disequilibrium between the most significantly associating 4360 SNP and the other SNPs was analyzed in the 22 combined families (Fig. 2A). Using a covariate style regression approach, each SNP was analyzed for association with plasma Ass42 in the 10, 12 and 22 combined LOAD families (Table 2 and Fig. 2B)..

After regressing out the effect of this SNP, the multipoint linkage signal diminished substantially in the 10 combined families (Fig. 3). This marked diminution in lod scores indicates that a substantial proportion of the linkage signal for plasma Ass42 is accounted for by the VR22 4360 association. The residual linkage signal that persisted after regressing out the VR22 4360 association indicates that there are likely to be additional variants that contribute to linkage, though this residual signal may also be due to random variation.

Variance components models depicting the effect of the 4360 SNP on multipoint and twopoint linkage      DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION SUBJECTS AND METHODS REFERENCES   In this study, we analyzed the VR22 gene on chromosome 10 to determine if it has functional SNP(s) that contribute to the linkage signal for plasma Ass42 that we previously reported in extended LOAD families. We found two VR22 SNPs, 4360 and 4783, which showed significant, robust association with plasma Ass42 in 20 to 65-year-old family members of the extended LOAD families. These two SNPs are 423 bp apart, and they are in such strong LD that they give virtually identical results. The 4360 and 4783 SNPs are located in the 177 kb intron between exons 10 and 11 at a distance of 1.4 kb from exon 11. We identified 11 additional SNPs within 6 kb of 4360/4783, eight in the intron between exons 10 and 11 and three in the intron between exons 11 and 12, but none of these SNPs gave more significant association than 4360/4783. Careful bounding showed that the large (1.7 Mb) VR22 gene is the only confirmed gene within the region of 4360/4783 association. Analyses in which 4360 was used as a covariate in both the null and linkage models reduced the multipoint lod score indicating that the VR22 4360/4783 association contributes to linkage. The large reduction observed when all 10 families were analyzed suggests that the 4360/4783 association contributes substantially to the linkage signal observed in these families. The presence of residual linkage after regressing out the effect of VR22 4360 SNP indicates, however, that the 4360 association does not entirely account for linkage. Thus our data provide substantial evidence that VR22 variant(s) contribute to the linkage signal we previously reported. Though the residual linkage signal may be due to random variation, it could also indicate that there may be additional variants that contribute to linkage. Whether these variants are in the large VR22 gene or in nearby gene(s) remains to be determined..

The results reported here are useful because they identify VR22 as a gene with variants that influence plasma Ass42, thereby increasing the likelihood that VR22 is the gene (or one of the genes) in the 80 cM region of chromosome 10 with variants that influence risk for LOAD. An important, unanswered question is how well the effect of a SNP on plasma Ass42 will correlate with its effect on the AD phenotype. It is unlikely that the change in plasma Ass42 caused by a specific genetic variant directly increases risk for AD; increased risk for AD is probably produced by a related effect that the variant has within the brain. Thus it is conceivable, perhaps even likely, that a specific variant with a strong influence on plasma Ass42 may sometimes have little or no influence on the AD phenotype and vice versa. It is only by thoroughly studying several genes and elucidating the effects of the entire set of functional variants on the plasma Ass42 and AD phenotypes that this question can be answered. It may be that effects on the two phenotypes correlate well for the variants in some genes and poorly in others..

LOAD cases, elderly control subjects and family members from the extended LOAD pedigrees were then sequenced to identify polymorphisms. The initial sequencing of the VR22 exons and the 7 kb intronic region identified three SNPs in the intronic 7 kb region (4825, 4783 and 4360). Subsequently, many additional SNPS in VR22 and flanking genes were identified using the Celera database. Our aim was to cover this region using SNP groups that are located at every 250 kb, with each group composed of 3 to 5 SNPs separated by 1 to 5 kb. A total of 51 SNPs, including VR22 4360 and 4783 were genotyped throughout VR22 and the 3 (ANXA2P3) and 5 (SIRT1) flanking genes. The SNPs within each group were found to be in strong LD with each other. The SNP locations were obtained from the Celera sequence map..

This method, described in detail elsewhere (53,54), estimates the amount of variance in a quantitative trait due to a particular genetic locus (q2), residual genetic factors (g2) and individual-specific, random environmental factors (e2), based on the phenotype covariance between arbitrary relative pairs. The covariance matrix takes the form.

This is a matrix whose ijth element is equal to 1 if individuals i and j share a specified environment, and 0, otherwise. Our family collection is largely composed of extended pedigrees, where we have measured the plasma Ass of most members from each family in a single batch of ELISAs. To rigorously account for any possible assay batch to batch variations that may affect the variance in plasma Ass42, we included a household matrix in the models. Since almost all individuals from each family were measured in one batch, the household matrix included an element=1 for those individuals from the same extended family and 0, otherwise. We realize that by doing so, we are probably being overly conservative. Since the shared-family (household) effect employed to account for potential batch to batch variance in the assay overlaps with the kinship effect (55), inclusion of the household matrix almost certainly overcorrects for batch to batch variance and underestimates the shared-genetic effect. For this reason, we performed the heritability and linkage analyses, both with and without the household matrix in the model. The multipoint results shown in Figures 2 and 3 include the household matrix. The analyses without the household matrix yielded slightly better lod scores and higher heritabilities in general..

The linkage analyses were performed by comparing the polygenic model to the linkage model where q2 was also estimated. The difference between the two log10 likelihoods for the models produces a lod score that is equivalent to the classical lod score of linkage analysis. We incorporated sex, age, age2, sex*age, and sex*age2 as covariates in the heritability estimations. None of these covariates were significant at P < 0.05 therefore, they were excluded from the multipoint linkage analysis..

Since variance components methods are based on the underlying assumption that the quantitative trait being analyzed has a normal distribution, 10log(Ass42) levels were used as the phenotypes. Extreme outliers with plasma Ass levels  plus or minus 4 standard deviations beyond the mean were excluded from the analyses. Thus the 10log(Ass42) phenotype analyzed had a normal distribution. Plasma Ass measurements were done using a well established sandwich ELISA system as described previously (15). All samples were measured in duplicate. Each ELISA plate included samples from five volunteers. The results from these five standard samples were used to normalize the values obtained so as to reduce plate-to-plate and day-to-day variance..

These IBD estimates were used to obtain the twopoint lod scores. Multipoint IBD probabilities were also estimated at each centimorgan between each pair of adjacent markers using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multipoint IBD estimation approach implemented in the Simwalk2 package (46,47). The MCMC process was run twice, once with the default length of 1000 replicates and a second time by doubling this process length. Multipoint linkage analyses using these MIBD matrices were done using the variance components methodology implemented in SOLAR. The results using the shorter and longer runs were similar. The results of the latter are presented here. Given that the computation time increases with the marker number and that our two most upstream markers yielded no evidence for linkage in any of the datasets, these two markers (D10S1435 and D10S189) were omitted from the MIBD estimations. There are two major differences between the MIBD estimations utilized in our previous report of linkage on chromosome 10 and the current study (35). The results of the previous linkage were obtained as result of genotyping seven markers in a 13 cM region, and the current study utilizes 31 markers spread from 28.3 to 165.3 cM on chromosome 10. Second, the MIBD estimation approaches that we used in the previous and current studies are different. The MCMC approach implemented in Simwalk2 (46,47) that we utilized in this study is different from the MIBD probability estimation algorithm implemented in SOLAR, which was the approach we utilized in our initial analysis of seven chromosome 10 markers. Sobel et al.

For this reason, we utilized the MCMC approach in this study..

The measured genotype approach is a classical test for differences in trait mean by genotype described theoretically previously (56,57). This approach was also utilized in previous association studies of SNPs and various quantitative traits in extended families (58,59). For individuals with an XX, XY or YY SNP genotype, we used a covariate that takes the value of 0, 1 or 2, respectively. This formulation assumes that the SNP is an additive QTL. The model that includes the covariate is tested against the model that does not include it to determine its effect on the quantitative trait of interest. Twice the difference in natural log likelihoods of these two models is distributed as a 2 distribution with 1 degree of freedom. In order to test for association above and beyond linkage, residual genetic and same-household effects, these three components were included in both the null and alternative models. We first tested for association between the SNPs and Ass42 in the 10 LOAD families that we previously used to describe linkage to chromosome 10 (35). In order to control for the effect of linkage, residual genetic effects and same-household effects in this group, we estimated the effect of each SNP on the background of a model that included our 80 cM multipoint identity-by-descent matrix, as well as kinship and household matrices. We then tested each SNP for association with Ass42 in a second, independent set of 12 LOAD families, and also analyzed the combined group of 22 families..

The 40-42-residue amyloid- peptide (A) is implicated in the early pathogenic events that lead to AD, and this peptide is carved out of the amyloid- precursor protein (APP) by - and -secretases (Fig. 1A) (1).

Ectodomain shedding by - or -secretase generates 83- or 99-residue membrane-associated C-terminal fragments (C83 or C99, respectively). Metalloproteases such as TACE and ADAM-10 appear to be -secretases, and -secretase is a membrane-tethered aspartyl protease. C83 and C99 are further processed by -secretase, which hydrolyzes these substrates in the middle of their transmembrane regions to form p3 from C83 and A from C99. Notch is processed by a Furin-like protease, producing a heterodimeric species that is trafficked to the cell surface. After ligand binding, the Notch ectodomain is shed by TACE, and the remaining membrane-associated C terminus, NEXT, is cut within the transmembrane region by a -secretase-like protease. B, topology and proteolytic processing of presenilins. Presenilins possess eight transmembrane regions and are snipped in the middle of the hydrophobic domain in the large cytosolic loop between TM 6 and TM 7, producing stable heterodimers by an unidentified "presenilinase" (PSase). Two conserved aspartates, one in TM 6 and one in TM 7, are each required for heterodimer formation and for -secretase cleavage of APP and Notch, leading to the hypothesis that presenilins are proteases activated by autoproteolysis.

Several different missense mutations in the APP gene on chromosome 21 cause familial AD (FAD), and these mutations are found immediately near the -, -, or -secretase processing sites. A Lys  Asn/Met  Leu double mutation near the -secretase cleavage site found in a Swedish pedigree leads to increased A production (both A40 and A42) (12), and indeed purified -secretase cuts peptide substrates with the "Swedish mutation" better than peptides based on the wild-type sequence (2, 4, 6). The several FAD-causing mutations in APP near the -secretase processing site also affect A production, but in these cases the mutations alter the specificity of the protease, leading to increases in the 42-residue A variant (13, 14). These findings bolstered the "amyloid hypothesis" of AD pathogenesis, because A42 is particularly prone to fibril formation (15) and is the protein initially deposited in the neuritic plaques that characterize the disease (16). Genes encoding the polytopic presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 (PS1 and PS2), found on chromosomes 14 and 1, respectively, were later identified as major loci for FAD (17, 18), and mutations in the presenilins were likewise found to increase A42 production in transfected cell lines (19-21), transgenic animals (19, 20, 22), and human plasma (23). Thus, presenilins somehow modulate -secretase activity. In fact, deletion of PS1 in mice dramatically reduced -secretase activity (24), and knockout of both PS1 and PS2 resulted in complete abolition of this APP processing event (25, 26), demonstrating that presenilins are absolutely required for proteolysis by -secretase..

The several FAD-causing mutations in APP near the -secretase processing site also affect A production, but in these cases the mutations alter the specificity of the protease, leading to increases in the 42-residue A variant (13, 14). These findings bolstered the "amyloid hypothesis" of AD pathogenesis, because A42 is particularly prone to fibril formation (15) and is the protein initially deposited in the neuritic plaques that characterize the disease (16). Genes encoding the polytopic presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 (PS1 and PS2), found on chromosomes 14 and 1, respectively, were later identified as major loci for FAD (17, 18), and mutations in the presenilins were likewise found to increase A42 production in transfected cell lines (19-21), transgenic animals (19, 20, 22), and human plasma (23). Thus, presenilins somehow modulate -secretase activity. In fact, deletion of PS1 in mice dramatically reduced -secretase activity (24), and knockout of both PS1 and PS2 resulted in complete abolition of this APP processing event (25, 26), demonstrating that presenilins are absolutely required for proteolysis by -secretase..

Indeed, a helical conformation of the -secretase cleavage site in APP can explain why nearby FAD-causing mutations specifically increase A42 production; these mutations are immediately adjacent to the amide bond processed to give A42 (27). A phenylalanine-scanning study near the -secretase cleavage site and the resulting effects on A40 and A42 production provided important experimental support for the idea that the substrate is in a helical conformation upon initial interaction with the protease (28). Other mutagenesis studies likewise indicated that -secretase has loose sequence specificity (29-31)..

This apparent paradox can be resolved by considering distance within the membrane as a key determinant of the site of proteolysis, a concept that together with the helical model suggests that -secretase might catalyze an intramembranous proteolysis. The development of substrate-based inhibitors led to further indirect characterization of -secretase; inhibition by peptidomimetic transition-state analogues suggested an aspartyl protease mechanism (27). Moreover, -secretase appears to have loose sequence specificity for its peptidomimetic inhibitors as it displays for its substrates (27). Distinctions are observed for the ability of a given compound to block A40 vis-a-vis A42, leading to the suggestion that these two A species are generated by different -secretases (32, 33).

Presenilins appear to bear no obvious sequence homology with known proteases, and their homology to Spe-4, a Caenorhabditis elegans protein apparently involved in vesicle transport in spermatozoa, initially suggested a less direct role in -secretase processing of APP (17). Furthermore, overexpression of presenilins does not lead to increased -secretase activity (20). However, presenilins themselves undergo proteolytic processing within the hydrophobic region of the large cytosolic loop between transmembrane domain (TM) 6 and TM 7 (Fig. 1B) to form stable heterodimeric complexes (39, 40). (Most studies support an eight-TM topology for the presenilins (34-36), although six- and seven-TM topologies have also been suggested (37, 38)). These heterodimers are only produced to limited levels even upon overexpression of the holoprotein (39, 41-43) and may be found at the cell surface (44). Expression of exogenous presenilins leads to replacement of endogenous presenilin heterodimers with the corresponding exogenous heterodimers, indicating competition for limiting cellular factors needed for stabilization and endoproteolysis (45)..

Upon overexpression, most PS1 E9 is rapidly degraded similar to unprocessed wild-type presenilins; however, a small portion of this PS1 variant is stabilized in cells (41, 47) and forms a high molecular weight complex like the N- and C-terminal fragments (40, 48), suggesting that it can interact with the same limiting cellular factors as wild-type presenilins. These observations are consistent with the idea that the bioactive form of presenilin is the heterodimer and that the hydrophobic region is an inhibitory domain. However, several artificial PS variants have been generated which are biologically active/inactive independent of their ability to undergo endoproteolysis (49, 50).

These aspartates appear to align with each other within the membrane and with the -secretase cleavage sites in APP (Fig. 1B).

Similar effects on APP processing were observed even when conservative mutations to glutamate (51) or asparagine (49, 52) were made, indicating the crucial identity of these two residues as aspartates and suggesting that the effects are not likely because of misfolding. These effects have been corroborated by several laboratories and have been seen for both PS1 and PS2 (48, 49, 51-54), although a recent study demonstrated that the TM 7 aspartate may be less tolerant of mutagenesis compared with the TM 6 aspartate (55)..

Upon interaction with a cognate ligand, the ectodomain of Notch is shed by a metalloprotease apparently identical to tumor necrosis factor- converting enzyme (TACE) (58, 59). Interestingly, metalloproteases such as TACE and ADAM-10 are among the identified -secretases that shed the APP ectodomain (8, 9). The membrane-associated C terminus is then cut within the postulated transmembrane domain to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which then translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with and activates the CSL (CBF1, SU(H), Lag-1) family of transcription factors (60).

Small amounts of presenilin heterodimers, however, have been found at the cell surface in complexation with the membrane-associated C terminus of Notch (44), and only small amounts of this presumably bioactive form should be needed for catalysis. Nevertheless, this "spatial paradox" still needs clear resolution. Another perplexing phenomenon is that the holoproteins of APP and Notch form stable complexes with presenilins in the ER (75-77). APP and Notch themselves are not substrates for -secretase, so why do they interact with presenilin if presenilin is the protease? However, as mentioned above, the membrane-associated C terminus of Notch likewise forms stable complexes (44), and APP-derived C83 and C99 can also complex with presenilins in the presence of a -secretase inhibitor or when either critical presenilin aspartate is mutated (78). Perhaps presenilins mature together with APP or Notch. Other unresolved issues are the site and specificity of Notch cleavage vis a vis that of APP. Although Notch appears to be cleaved within its transmembrane region, the site of cleavage is close to the cytosolic edge, whereas the APP -secretase site is apparently in the middle of the membrane. For either cleavage event, though, only one of the proteolytic products has been identified; characterizing the other fragments may clarify this issue. As for sequence specificity, a single Val to Leu change prevents proteolysis of the Notch transmembrane region (60), whereas a variety of mutations in the APP transmembrane region is tolerated by -secretase. Examination of these proteolytic events in purified enzyme assays may offer insights to resolve this problem, especially since recent data suggest that not only APP but also Notch endoproteolysis occurs largely independent of sequence (79).

0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	25	Advancing the understanding of -secretase and the role of presenilins in this activity had been hampered by the lack of an isolated enzyme assay. Recently, Li et al. (80) reported a solubilized -secretase assay that faithfully reproduces the properties of the protease activity observed in whole cells. Isolated microsomes were solubilized with detergent, and -secretase activity was determined by measuring A production from a Flag-tagged version of C99. A40 and A42 were produced in the same ratio as seen in living cells (~9:1), and peptidomimetics that blocked A40 and A42 formation in cells likewise inhibited production of these A species in the solubilized protease assay. After separation of the detergent-solubilized material by size-exclusion chromatography, -secretase activity coeluted with the two subunits of PS1. Remarkably, immunoprecipitated PS1 heterodimers also produced A from the Flag-tagged substrate, strongly suggesting that presenilins are part of a large -secretase complex..
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	26	More direct evidence that presenilins are the catalytic components of -secretases has recently come from affinity labeling studies using transition-state analogue inhibitors targeted to the active site of the protease. Shearman et al. (80, 81) identified a peptidomimetic that blocks -secretase activity with an IC50 of 0.3 nM in the solubilized protease assay and contains a hydroxyethyl isostere, a transition-state mimicking moiety found in many aspartyl protease inhibitors. While the transition-state mimicking alcohol directs the compound to aspartyl proteases, flanking substructures determine specificity. Photoactivatable versions of this compound bound covalently to presenilin subunits exclusively (82). Interestingly, installation of the photoreactive group on one end of the inhibitor led to labeling of the N-terminal presenilin subunit, whereas installation on the other end resulted in the tagging of the C-terminal subunit. Moreover, whereas these agents did not label wild-type PS1 holoprotein, they did tag PS1 E9, which (as described above) is not processed to heterodimers but nevertheless is active. Similarly, Esler et al. (83) identified peptidomimetic inhibitors containing a difluoro alcohol group, another type of transition-state mimicking moiety, and these compounds were developed starting from a substrate-based inhibitor designed from the -secretase cleavage site in APP. Conversion of one such analogue to a reactive bromoacetamide provided an affinity reagent that likewise bound covalently and specifically to PS1 subunits in cell lysates, isolated microsomes, and whole cells. Either PS1 subunit so labeled could be brought down with antibodies to the other subunit under coimmunoprecipitation conditions, demonstrating that the inhibitor bound to heterodimeric PS1. Seiffert and colleagues (84) likewise identified presenilin subunits as the molecular target of novel peptidomimetic -secretase inhibitors. These inhibitors, however, do not resemble known transition-state mimics, so it is not clear whether they would be expected to bind to the active site of the protease..

The affinity labeling studies also identify the protease responsible for the transmembrane cleavage of Notch, because substrate-based -secretase inhibitors like those used by Esler et al.

These findings reinforce the amyloid hypothesis of AD pathogenesis; all FAD-causing mutations identified to date (accounting for ~60% of all FAD cases) are either in the precursor protein leading to A (APP) or appear to be located in the proteases that catalyze the final step in A generation (presenilins/-secretases).

With such a sequestered active site and the two-dimensional fluidity of the lipid bilayer, the substrate probably first interacts with a binding site on the outer surface of the protease, with subsequent conformational changes allowing entry of the substrate to the active site within the protease interior. Further, given that the conformation of the substrate upon initial interaction with the protease is apparently an -helix, the enzyme must have some mechanism for unwinding or bending the substrate near the site of cleavage so that the catalytic water and protease residues can access the scissile amide bond..

This would explain why polytopic membrane proteases bear little or no sequence homology with soluble proteases. For instance, in the S2P family of proteases that process membrane-bound transcription factors in mammals and bacteria, each contains an essential HEXXH motif that is a consensus sequence for a number of metalloproteases (86). Otherwise, they bear little resemblance to other metalloproteases. Similarly, presenilins require two conserved aspartates for proteolytic function but otherwise do not look like typical aspartyl proteases. Apparently there are only a very limited number of efficient biochemical solutions to the problem of proteolysis, as mechanisms conferred to polytopic proteases are strikingly similar to those of soluble and membrane-tethered proteases. Interestingly, the presenilins contain a motif near one of the critical aspartates that is also found in the bacterial type 4 prepilin protease family (50, 87), polytopic aspartyl proteases that also have eight transmembrane domains and require two completely conserved aspartates (88). This finding further supports the idea that presenilins may indeed be polytopic aspartyl proteases..

For instance, in the S2P family of proteases that process membrane-bound transcription factors in mammals and bacteria, each contains an essential HEXXH motif that is a consensus sequence for a number of metalloproteases (86). Otherwise, they bear little resemblance to other metalloproteases. Similarly, presenilins require two conserved aspartates for proteolytic function but otherwise do not look like typical aspartyl proteases. Apparently there are only a very limited number of efficient biochemical solutions to the problem of proteolysis, as mechanisms conferred to polytopic proteases are strikingly similar to those of soluble and membrane-tethered proteases. Interestingly, the presenilins contain a motif near one of the critical aspartates that is also found in the bacterial type 4 prepilin protease family (50, 87), polytopic aspartyl proteases that also have eight transmembrane domains and require two completely conserved aspartates (88). This finding further supports the idea that presenilins may indeed be polytopic aspartyl proteases..

Clearly, the top priority is to identify the other critical components of the -secretase complex, allowing reconstitution of activity and development of a purified enzyme assay. Assembly of the complex into active -secretase should allow more focused structural-functional studies than the current approach of expressing mutant proteins in whole cells or organisms. Also, understanding how the more than 70 different FAD mutations in presenilins cause specific increases in A42 production might shed some light on how this deleterious function can be skewed in favor of other less noxious A isoforms. Such understanding should not only suggest novel therapeutic approaches to AD but should also undergird our appreciation of the workings of an emerging class of polytopic membrane proteases.

The specific function of PEN-2 is unclear. To explore its function and intermolecular interactions, we conducted deletion and mutagenesis studies on a series of conserved residues at the C terminus of PEN-2. These studies suggest that: 1) both the presence and amino acid sequence of the conserved DYLSF domain at the C terminus of PEN-2 (residues 90 to 94) is critical for binding PEN-2 to other components in the presenilin complex and 2) the overall length of the exposed C terminus is critical for functional -secretase activity..

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The presenilin proteins (PS1 and PS2) are evolutionarily conserved polytopic transmembrane proteins that are required for the regulated intramembranous proteolysis of several Type 1 transmembrane proteins including the -amyloid precursor protein (APP),1 Notch receptor, and p75 (1 to 4). Several different lines of evidence have revealed that the presenilins form high molecular weight complexes with at least three other proteins (APH-1, PEN-2, and nicastrin) (5 to 9) and that all of these other proteins are required for functional intramembranous proteolytic activity (10). As a result, null mutations or suppression of the expression of these genes results in loss of regulated intramembranous endoproteolysis of APP (termed -secretase cleavage), Notch (termed S3 cleavage), and the other Type 1 transmembrane protein substrates. Conversely, clinical missense mutations in PS1 and PS2 that are associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (11, 12) and selected experimental missense mutations in nicastrin (6) can all alter presenilin-dependent -secretase cleavage of APP, leading to overproduction of longer proteolytic derivatives of APP termed amyloid -peptide (A)..

Subsequent studies confirmed that it is a component of the high molecular weight presenilin complexes and that its presence within these complexes is necessary for their maturation and activity (8, 13, 14). Thus, loss of PEN-2 activity is associated with reduced presenilin levels (8, 15, 16), reduced presenilin endoproteolysis (13, 17, 18), and loss of regulated intramembranous proteolytic (-/S3 cleavage) activity (8). Analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of PEN-2 provides no clue as to its function. However, the protein is predicted to have two hydrophobic transmembrane domains (19, 20). There are also a series of residues at the hydrophilic C terminus (residues 90 to 101) that are conserved during evolution and that we hypothesize are functionally important (see Fig. 1A). In support of this, one of the three naturally occurring loss-of-function mutants in C. elegans is a stop codon mutation at residue Trp74, which truncates the protein near the beginning of this C-terminal hydrophilic loop (8) (see Fig. 1). To explore this hypothesis, we have investigated the functional effects of mutations in this C-terminal domain. Our data indicate that both the overall length of the exposed C terminus of PEN-2 and the sequence of a highly conserved DYLSF motif within this domain are important for binding of PEN-2 to other components of the presenilin complex and for proper function of the complexes during NCT maturation, presenilin endoproteolysis, and A secretion..

Mutagenesis primers 5'-CGCTGGGGTGCCCTTGGGGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCACCATACCCCTGGGCACCCCCTGACTCGAG-3' and 5'-CGCTGGCCTGCCCTTGGGACCATACCCCTGGGCACCCCCTGACTCGAG-3' were used for the generation of constructs encoding AAAAA and del90 to 94, respectively. In agreement with previous reports (8, 16) preliminary experiments (data not shown) revealed that when PEN-2 was expressed from a vector that included a C-terminal Myc/His tag, the resultant C-terminally tagged PEN-2 protein was not stable and was not fully functionally active. Consequently, all constructs were tagged with V5 at the N terminus and, following direct sequence verification, were ligated into the expression vector pcDNA4 (Invitrogen). The N-terminal V5 tag partially interferes with the recognition epitope (residues 1 to 26). However, transient transfection of N-terminal V5-tagged wild-type PEN-2 constructs into cells in which PEN-2 expression had been suppressed by RNAi (see below) confirmed that the V5-tagged protein was expressed and fully complemented the loss of endogenous PEN-2, resulting in restoration of PS1 endoproteolysis, nicastrin maturation, and A production. HEK293 cells stably expressing APPswe were transfected with these plasmids or with empty vector (as a negative control) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Stable transfectant cells were selected in 150  microg/ml zeocin. For a stable PEN-2 knock-down cell line, the oligonucleotides against PEN-2 160 to 180 were ligated with pSUP vector (Oligoengine) as per the manufacturer's instruction. After confirming the sequence, pSUP/PEN-2 160 to 180 and pCDNA6/V5 vector (Invitrogen) were stably transfected into a HEK293 clone stably expressing APPswe, using LipofectAMINE and were selected with blasticidin (10  microg/ml).

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	20	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Functional Domain Analysis To explore the function of the conserved residues at the C terminus of PEN-2, we initially created three overlapping deletion mutants: del84 to 101, del90 to 101, and del96 to 101 (Fig. 1B). When these cDNAs were stably transfected into HEK293 cells stably expressing APPswe, they produced proteins of the expected molecular weight (Fig. 2A, top panel). Immunoprecipitation with PS1 revealed that the wild-type exogenous V5-tagged PEN-2 co-precipitated with PS1 (Fig. 2B, panel 1). The wild-type V5-tagged PEN-2 protein also displaced endogenous PEN-2 (Fig. 2, A, panel 2, and B, panel 2). (Note that the N-terminal V5 tag partially interferes with the recognition epitope (residues 1 to 26), so that the V5-tagged and endogenous PEN-2 peptides can be easily distinguished by their differential affinities for anti-V5 antibodies and the antibody to residues 1 to 26 of PEN-2. Note also that the interference with the anti-PEN-2 antibody recognition sequence has no functional effect because transient transfection of N-terminal V5-tagged wild-type PEN-2 constructs into cells in which endogenous PEN-2 expression had been suppressed by RNAi (see below) fully complemented the loss of endogenous PEN-2, resulting in restoration of PS1 endoproteolysis, nicastrin maturation, and A production.) In contrast, mutant PEN-2 with a deletion after residue 96 (del96 to 101) moderately reduced the binding of the exogenous PEN-2 to PS1, nicastrin, and APH-1 and was able to partially displace endogenous PEN-2. However, deletion of residues 84 to 101 or 90 to 101 dramatically reduced the amount of exogenous PEN-2 that was co-precipitated with PS1 (Fig. 2B, panel 1). Furthermore, because these overexpressed deletion mutant PEN-2 molecules did not bind PS1 (Fig. 2B, panel 1), they also failed to displace the endogenous PEN-2 (Fig. 2A, panel 2), which therefore continued to interact and co-precipitate with PS1 (Fig. 2B, panel 2). As would be predicted, the del84 to 101 and del90 to 101 did not co-precipitate with either APH-1 or nicastrin (Fig. 2B, panels 4 and 5). These observations suggest that the C terminus, and in particular residues 90 to 96, which contain the highly conserved DYLSF motif, may either: 1) be essential for the stability of PEN-2; 2) be essential for the proper trafficking of PEN-2; or 3) be involved in binding of PEN-2 to other components of the presenilin complex..

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	22	  To explore whether these mutants caused destabilization of PEN-2, we assessed cellular PEN-2 levels following cycloheximide blockade of protein synthesis in HEK293 cells. Endogenous PEN-2, wild-type PEN-2 tagged at the N terminus, and del96 to 101 mutant constructs had equivalent stability with a half-life of 9 to 10 h (Fig. 3). In contrast, both the del84 to 101 and del90 to 101 deletion mutants were highly unstable, with a half-life of approximately 4 h. This result is not surprising because the del84 to 101 and del90 to 101 molecules are not incorporated into presenilin complexes and are therefore not stabilized. However, it is also possible that these proteins might be intrinsically unstable and that they are simply degraded before they can interact with the other components of the presenilin complexes. To exclude this possibility, we transiently expressed V5-tagged wild-type and mutant PEN-2 peptides in PS1 and PS2 double knock-out ES cells, where the stabilizing influence of presenilin complexes are not present, thereby allowing a direct comparison of the intrinsic stability of the wild-type and deletion mutant peptides. In PS1::PS2 double knock-out ES cells, the stability of transiently expressed wild-type and mutant PEN-2 proteins were equivalently reduced to less than 4 h, confirming that the mutant PEN-2 proteins were not intrinsically unstable (data not shown)..

We reasoned that this reduced rescue activity of the del96 to 101 mutant despite its only mild reduction in binding could occur if there are specific residues in the 96 to 101 domain that are critical for PEN-2 activity. There are three highly conserved residues in this domain: Ile at codon 96, Pro at codon 97, and Gly at codon 99. An alternate possibility is that the absolute length of the C terminus is critical to the function of PEN-2, and this deletion (and all of the other deletions) has altered this property. This latter possibility is supported by the prior report that exogenous wild-type C-terminally tagged PEN-2 failed to complement loss-of-function alleles in the C. elegans PEN-2 gene (8) and by our earlier observation that PEN-2 constructs tagged with C-terminal Myc epitopes were unstable (Fig. 3). To resolve this dichotomy, we made three constructs: one with alanine missense mutations at all three conserved residues, one with a four-residue (KDAS) C-terminal addition, and one with a deletion of the two non-conserved C-terminal residues, AAA (IPG), KDAS, and del100 to 101, respectively (Fig. 1D). Immunoprecipitation experiments following transient expression of these constructs in PEN-2 knock-down HEK293 cells revealed that the AAA (IPG) mutant bound to the other presenilins complex components comparably with that of wild-type PEN-2. However, the KDAS and the del100 to 101 mutant had a moderate reduction in binding that was similar in magnitude to the reduction in binding of the del96 to 101 mutant (Fig. 6, lane 15 for del100 to 101; not shown for KDAS). As would be expected from these binding assays, transient expression of the AAA (IPG) mutant nearly completely rescued both nicastrin maturation, PS endoproteolysis, and A secretion, whereas the KDAS and the del100 to  101 mutant had minimal effect (Figs. 8, lanes 14, 15, and 18, and 9A, lanes 14, 15, and 18).

A similar critical sensitivity to the length of the C terminus has been reported for both PS1 and PS2 (29). Because the C termini of both PS1/PS2 and PEN-2 are oriented in the cytoplasm, additional experiments will be needed to discern whether the C termini of these two proteins in fact interact, whether directly with each other or with a third protein. However, taken together these data raise the possibility that PEN-2 might function as an important linker/spacer molecule that maintains spatial interactions between various presenilin complex components..

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	6	Presenilins 1 and 2 are unglycosylated proteins with apparent molecular mass of 45 and 50 kDa, respectively, in transfected COS-1 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. They colocalize with proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus in transfected and untransfected cells. In COS-1 cells low amounts of intact endogeneous presenilin 1 migrating at 45 kDa are detected together with relative larger amounts of presenilin 1 fragments migrating between 18 and 30 kDa. The presenilins have a strong tendency to form aggregates (mass of 100-250 kDa) in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which can be partially resolved when denatured by SDS at 37  degrees C instead of 95  degrees C. Sulfation, glycosaminoglycan modification, or acylation of the presenilins was not observed, but both proteins are posttranslationally phosphorylated on serine residues. The mutations Ala-246  Glu or Cys-410  Tyr that cause Alzheimer's disease do not interfere with the biosynthesis or phosphorylation of presenilin 1. Finally, using low concentrations of digitonin to selectively permeabilize the cell membrane but not the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, it is demonstrated that the two major hydrophilic domains of presenilin 1 are oriented to the cytoplasm. The current investigation documents the posttranslational modifications and subcellular localization of the presenilins and indicates that postulated interactions with amyloid precursor protein metabolism should occur in the early compartments of the biosynthetic pathway..

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	8	Alzheimer's disease is a major health problem. Patients suffer from a progressive dementia caused by massive neuronal loss in cortical and hippocampal areas of the brain (1-6). Neuropathological signs of the disease are tangles and amyloid deposits in the brain parenchyma, and amyloid deposits in the brain vasculature. The cause of the sporadic form of the disease is still unknown, although an increased risk is associated with the presence of apolipoprotein allele E4 (6, 7). On the other hand, familial early onset Alzheimer's disease is caused by point mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 (8), in the presenilin 2 (PS2)1 gene on chromosome 1 (9-11), or, most frequently, in the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene on chromosome 14 (12-15). Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I integral membrane protein and is the precursor of the amyloid peptide, the main component of the senile plaques (1-3). Point mutations in exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene cause alterations in the metabolism of APP. This results in an increased production of intracellular A4 amyloid peptide containing carboxyl-terminal APP fragments and in an increased secretion of the potentially neurotoxic A4 peptide (1-3, 16). 63% of the amino acid residues in the sequences of the two presenilins are conserved, which strongly suggests that both proteins are involved in similar functions and have a similar pathogenic role in Alzheimer's disease. Based on computer algorithms, seven membrane spanning domains have been defined (9-15), although the possibility of nine transmembrane domains cannot be ruled out at this moment (17). The amino-terminal domain and the acidic loop domain, located between transmembrane domains six and seven, are hydrophilic and can be alternatively spliced (9, 13). The mutations that cause familial Alzheimer's disease are found all over the protein, but the hydrophilic loop constitutes a "hot spot" with nine different mutations described to date (5, 15). The biological function of the presenilins remains essentially unknown, but, interestingly, the 103 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of PS2 can inhibit apoptosis in a "deathtrap" assay (18). Based on the homology with Caenorhabditis elegans proteins, roles in intracellular protein sorting and/or intercellular signal transmission have been proposed as well (19, 20)..

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	10	A hypothetical final common pathway in the pathogenesis of the genetic and sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease has been postulated, based on the invariable occurrence of the amyloid deposits, the neurofibrillar tangles and the neurodegeneration in all affected brains. The central question is thus how mutations in the presenilin genes can cause this typical neuropathology. Studies indicating an increased production of more amyloidogenic A4-(1-42) peptide in fibroblasts obtained from patients with presenilin mutations would support the amyloid hypothesis that postulates abnormal A4 amyloid peptide production and plaque formation as the pivotal event in the pathogenesis of the disease (2, 21). However, the observed increases in A4-(1-42) peptide production were relatively small, and the suggested relationship between presenilin mutations and APP metabolism should be further corroborated by experiments showing directly the effect of presenilin mutations on APP processing in transfected cells or in brains of transgenic animals. Moreover, other aspects of APP metabolism such as the production of carboxyl-terminal APP fragments (16) should be investigated in greater detail. The possibility that presenilins interact with the cytoskeleton or exert their effect via apoptotic pathways should not be disregarded at this time (18). In addition to addressing these questions, basic information is needed on the subcellular localization, the posttranslational modifications, and the membrane orientation of the presenilins..

Untransfected COS-1 cells remained negative under the experimental conditions used, probably because of the very low levels of endogeneous PS present in these cells (see below). The same pattern of staining was observed with monoclonal antibody IID8 (32) against Serca 2a Ca2+-ATPase (results not shown), and with antibodies against transfected reticulon/NSP (Fig. 2b). Both proteins are located in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (24). The distribution of PS1 and reticulon/NSP remained identical in double transfected cells (compare panels a and b in Fig. 2). Transfected APP (Fig. 2e) and transfected furin (Fig. 2d), in contrast, were mainly found in the Golgi apparatus, as shown previously (33, 34).

Immunoprecipitation of detergent extracts of COS-1 cells transfected with plasmids containing the cDNA of wild type PS1, in contrast, yielded strong specific signals of radiolabeled protein migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-3). Diffuse protein bands with masses between 100 and 250 kDa were observed to a variable extent (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained with PS2 cDNA. The main PS2 species migrated, however, slightly more slowly than PS1, resulting in an apparent mass of 50 kDa (see below). Unrelated polyclonal antibodies, or untransfected cells did not yield these bands, while immunoblots of COS-1 cells transfected with Myc-tagged PS1 and stained with the Myc tag-specific mAb 9E10 revealed again the pronounced smearing (Fig. 3B). This result clearly demonstrated that the 100-250-kDa protein smears consisted of PS protein, either associated or not associated with other proteins. Essential similar patterns were observed when PS1 FAD1 (Ala-246  Glu) or PS1 NIH2 (Cys-410  Tyr) were expressed (Fig. 3A). These clinical mutations (12) therefore do not cause major alterations in the biosynthesis of PS1 protein when overexpressed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 3A).

A small amount of transfected cells (0.5  x  105) was added to the positive control samples. The immunoprecipitates were then resolved in SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. Immunoprecipitated PS1 was finally detected with mAb PS1-3 raised against peptide RRVSKNSKYNAESTERESQDTVAE in the loop domain of PS1. Weak signals representing intact endogeneous PS1 were revealed in untransfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 4). Endogeneous PS1 migrated with the same mobility (45 kDa) as transfected PS1, as is best seen in the experiments using the amino-terminal domain-specific antiserum B13 (Fig. 3C, lane 2). Since mAb PS1-3 recognizes an epitope in the carboxyl-terminally located hydrophilic loop, the combination of these antibodies is expected to detect mainly intact PS1 (Fig. 3C, lane 2). With hydrophilic loop-specific antiserum B17, in contrast, relatively pronounced 18-30-kDa fragments were visualized together with intact PS1. These fragments represent most likely carboxyl-terminal fragments of presenilin (35). Remarkably, the observed fragments were not, or only marginally, increased in COS-1 cells overexpressing PS1 (compare lanes 3 and lane 4 in Fig. 3C). Pulse-chase experiments on transfected CHO-cells (Fig. 4, A and C) and COS-1 cells (results not shown) further showed that the transfected 45-kDa PS1 species has a half-life of about 4 h. No fragments were seen at any time point of this assay, either with amino-terminal (B13) or hydrophilic loop-specific (B17) antisera. APP, immunoprecipitated from the same cell extracts (Fig. 4B), displayed a much faster turnover (half-life: 2 h), indicating that the relative high expression of PS1 did not interfere with the normal turnover of APP. --> Fig. 4.

Enzymatic digestion of immunoprecipitated PS1 and PS2 protein with glycosidase F (3 milliunits/ microl), O-glycanase (60 nanounits/ microl), endoglycosidase H (60 nanounits/ microl), sialidase (100 nanounits/ microl), or combinations of these enzymes did not affect the mobility of the proteins, indicating that no glycosylation of PS1 and PS2 occurred (results not shown). Digestions with heparinase (0.1 milliunits/ microl), heparitinase (0.1 milliunits/ microl), chondroitinase AC (5 milliunits/ microl), and chondroitinase ABC (5 milliunits/ microl) also had no effect on the mobility of the protein smears, indicating that PS1 is not modified by glycosaminoglycan chains (Fig. 5). These negative results were independently confirmed by metabolic labeling experiments using [3H]glucosamine or [35S]O4. While both radioactive precursors were incorporated in proteins in the cell extracts of the labeled cells, no signal was obtained when transfected PS1 was immunoprecipitated (results not shown). Experiments using [3H]palmitic or [3H]myristic acid demonstrated also that the presenilins did not incorporate fatty acids. --> Fig. 5. Presenilins are not modified by glycosaminoglycan chains. PS1 was immunoprecipitated using serum B16 from metabolically labeled COS-1 cells transfected with wild type PS1 and digested with heparinase, heparitinase, chondroitinase ABC, or chondroitinase AC. Digested material was resolved in 12% homogeneous SDS-PAGE. The activity of the heparinase and heparitinase was confirmed using proteoglycans immunopurified from fibroblasts (50). The activity of chondroitinase ABC and AC was demonstrated using a test solution of chondroitinesulfate which was clarified after addition of the enzymes.

Denaturation of the immunoprecipitates at 37  degrees C instead of at 95  degrees C reduced the aggregates considerably but not completely (Fig. 6, lane 2). This demonstrated that the aggregates consisted mainly, if not exclusively, of PS1 as the radiolabeled species (Fig. 6) and also suggested that the PS aggregates are at least partially produced during the processing of the samples for electrophoresis. It should be noticed, however, that even when freshly prepared material was used and heating of the samples was avoided, protein smears in the 100-250-kDa region remained visible in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6). --> Fig. 6. The presenilin aggregates are temperature-sensitive. Immunoprecipitated PS1 (antiserum B16) from transfected COS cells was denatured for 10 min with SDS and -mercapthoethanol at 95  degrees C (lanes 1 and 3) or at 37  degrees C (lane 2). In lane 3 cell extracts were prepared in the presence of 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Notice the decrease of the 100-250-kDa aggregates and the slightly increased intensity of the 45-kDa band in lane 2 as compared to lanes 1 and 3. Samples were resolved on a 4-20% SDS-PAGE.

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	46	The high level of serines, threonines, and tyrosines in the primary amino acid sequences of both PS1 and PS2 suggested the possibility that the PS proteins are phosphoproteins (12, 13). Transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 7) and CHO cells (Fig. 8B) incorporated 32P in presenilins. Acid hydrolysis of immunoprecipitated 32P-phosphorylated PS1 and PS2 yielded mainly phosphoserine (Fig. 7B). Longer exposures revealed very weak signals for phosphothreonine, while phosphotyrosine was never observed. The phosphorylation of PS1 was strongly increased, and that of PS2 slightly or not increased, by treating the cells with the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (300 nM, Fig. 8A). Okadaic acid inhibits the two major classes of serine/threonine phosphatases (49). The protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporin (300 nM) or the agonists phorbol myristic acid (1  microM) and phorbol dibutyric acid (1  microM) and the protein kinase A agonist forskolin (100  microM) had no effect on the phosphorylation extent or pattern (Fig. 8A). Attempts to phosphorylate immunoprecipitated PS1 in vitro using protein kinase A or protein kinase C remained also negative (results not shown). --> Fig. 7. Phosphorylation of PS1 and PS2 on serine residues. Panel a, transfected COS-1 cells were metabolically labeled using [32P]orthophosphate and post-nuclear cell extracts were prepared (see "Materials and Methods"). PS1 and PS2 were immunoprecipitated with antiserum B16 (PS1) or 519 (PS2). COS-1 cells transfected with pSG5 were labeled, extracted, and immunoprecipitated with the same antibodies (). Panel b, thin layer chromatography of hydrolyzed PS1 (45 kDa) and PS2 (50 kDa) identifying serine as the phosphorylated residues. The mobility of phosphoserine (S), phosphothreonine (T), or phosphotyrosine (Y), as detected by ninhydrin staining, is indicated by the dotted lines.

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	47	Cytoplasmic Orientation of the Amino-terminal Domain and Hydrophilic Loop Domain of Presenilin 1.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	48	We finally addressed the issue whether the two major hydrophilic domains in presenilin 1, i.e. the amino-terminal domain and the hydrophilic loop domain (12) are oriented toward the cytoplasmic or the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Current models for the orientation of the presenilins in membranes are based on theoretical predictions (see "Discussion"). Both domains are candidate regions for interactions with other proteins, and their orientation determines whether this interaction occurs with cytoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum proteins. To analyze this question, we used low concentrations of digitonin to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane (see "Materials and Methods") and antibodies against the amino-terminal domain (antiserum B14), against the Myc tag introduced at the amino terminus (mAb 9E10), against the second loop domain (antibody 519), and, finally, against the hydrophilic loop domain (antiserum B16) of PS1. To monitor the permeabilization procedure, rat monoclonal antibody against the luminal endoplasmic reticulum retention signal KDEL was used (30, 31). Antibodies against the amino-terminal domain of PS1, against the amino-terminally inserted Myc tag (Fig. 9a) or against the hydrophilic loop (Fig. 9e) reacted with PS1 in digitonin-permeabilized cells under conditions in which the KDEL-specific monoclonal antibody did not result in labeling (Fig. 9, a and e). On the other hand, antibodies against the second hydrophilic loop domain (519) reacted with PS1 when saponin (Fig. 9d), but not when digitonin (Fig. 9c) was used to permeabilize the cells, suggesting a luminal localization of this domain. --> Fig. 9. Cytoplasmic orientation of the amino-terminal domain and the hydrophilic loop of PS1. COS-1 cells transfected with PS1Myc (panels a and b) or with PS1 WT (panels c-f) were permeabilized using digitonin (panels a, c, and e) or saponin (panels b, d, and f) and immunostained with anti-Myc mAb 9E10 (panels a and b), with polyclonal antibody 519 against the second loop domain (panels c and d), with polyclonal antibody B16 (panels e and f) and with rat monoclonal antibody against the KDEL sequence (panels a-f). PS1 immunoreactivity is observed as red/yellow staining, while KDEL immunoreactivity is green. Panels a and b show that the amino terminus of PS1 is oriented to the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Cells that express PS1Myc stain strongly with the amino-terminal domain directed 9E10 mAb both in digitonin (a) or saponin (b) permeabilized cells. When saponin is used, the untransfected cells are stained with the KDEL antibody (green) since it reacts with endogenous proteins (b). When digitonin is used, no staining is observed (a), indicating that the endoplasmic reticulum membrane is not permeable for antibodies under the conditions used. In panels c and d, similar experiments are displayed but using antiserum 519 against the second loop domain. Staining is only observed when saponin is used, indicating a luminal orientation of this domain (panel d). Panels e and f demonstrate that antiserum B16 against the hydrophilic loop domain of PS1 react both with digitonin (e) or saponin (f) permeabilized cells, indicating a cytoplasmic orientation of the hydrophilic loop.

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	49	The current investigation provides a detailed characterization of the biosynthesis of presenilins overexpressed in COS-1 cells and CHO cells. The results show that the PS proteins are unglycosylated phosphoproteins with apparent molecular masses of about 45 and 50 kDa in SDS-PAGE. They have a strong tendency to form SDS-resistant complexes with apparent molecular masses between 100 and 250 kDa. Double immunofluorescence studies showed that PS1 is mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus and that its amino-terminal domain and the hydrophilic loop domain are oriented to the cytoplasmic side..

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	51	The localization of transfected PS1 in the endoplasmic reticulum of COS-1 cells or CHO cells is not a simple consequence of overexpression of the protein or nonspecific general effects on the biosynthetic pathway in these cells. First, endogeneous presenilins are located in the endoplasmic reticulum of untransfected cells as demonstrated in Fig. 1A using confocal laser microscopy. Second, using identical transfection conditions, APP and furin were found to accumulate in the Golgi apparatus, as demonstrated before (33, 34). Third, the turnover (Fig. 4) and the secretory processing of APP3 in CHO cells stably expressing human APP770 was not affected by transfection of PS1, ruling out general inhibitory effects on protein transport and processing. On the other hand, the levels of endogeneous presenilin in COS-1 cells are apparently very low. Only the combination of immunoprecipitation to concentrate PS1 from detergent extracts of 10  x  106 cells, followed by immunoblotting using mAb PS1-3, allowed us to detect endogeneous PS1 migrating at the same molecular weight as transfected PS1. The disadvantage of this approach is that the antibodies from the immunoprecipitation step interfere with the consecutive detection of possible PS-aggregates in the immunoblotting step (Fig. 3C). This assay also precludes a dynamic analysis of the metabolism of the presenilins using metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments. On the other hand, it allowed us to demonstrate the presence or absence of particular antibody epitopes on PS1 fragments. Importantly, the use of hydrophilic loop-specific antibodies in the immunoprecipitation step resulted in the detection of relative large amounts of, presumably proteolytic, fragments of PS1 in the 18-30-kDa range (Fig. 3C). The level of these fragments was not, or only slightly, increased in COS-1 cells that overexpressed PS1, which explains why they were not readily detected in the transfection experiments. The proteolytic process involved is probably easily saturated or even inhibited by PS overexpression (35, 36). Our data therefore do not allow us to speculate any further on the exact nature or the biological significance of this process. We can only conclude that overexpression studies of the type used here are not suitable to study this particular aspect of presenilin metabolism. On the other hand, it is clear that untransfected cells (Fig. 3) and brain tissue in vivo (36, 37) contain detectable amounts of intact presenilin. Since this endogeneously expressed PS1 has the same mobility as transfected PS1, the conclusion that transfected PS1 (and PS2) are not subject to glycosylation, sulfation, glycosaminoglycan modification, palmitoylation, or myristoylation also holds apparently true for the endogeneous protein. These posttranslational modifications are thereby also excluded as contributing to the formation of the high molecular mass, SDS-resistant aggregates (100-250 kDa) in SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. These aggregates were observed to a variable extent in all our experiments, and were noticed by others using other cell types or brain tissue (36, 38, 39). Since the smears were detected with three different antibodies recognizing three different epitopes, and by a Myc-directed mAb using a Myc-tagged PS1 construct, the aggregates must contain presenilin core proteins, alone or associated with unidentified components. Denaturation of immunoprecipitates at 37  degrees C instead of 95  degrees C, resulted in less aggregates and increased amounts of the 45-kDa PS1 band (Fig. 3C). The aggregates therefore probably consist mainly of oligomers of presenilins. It is unclear whether this property to form SDS-resistant aggregates in vitro has any physiological significance in vivo, but immuno-electron microscope observations suggest that clustering of presenilins also occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum of untransfected cells.2 It should be envisaged that in pathological conditions exacerbated aggregation of presenilins could become a problem. In this context, it should be mentioned that antibodies against PS1 stain amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (40)..

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	53	Importantly, the two point mutations causing Alzheimer's disease that were studied here, i.e. PS1 Ala-246  Glu (FAD1 kindred) and PS1 Cys-410  Tyr (NIH2 kindred), did not alter the biosynthesis or level of expression of the PS1 protein in COS-1 cells and CHO cells. These mutations must cause therefore more subtle effects. The possibility that they interfere with the fragmentation of PS1, as was shown recently for two other mutations (35, 36), cannot be excluded from the current data. Analysis of brains of transgenic mice expressing the PS1 Ala-246  Glu mutant indicate, however, that at least this mutation does not interfere with the proteolytic processing of PS1.4 Since all PS mutations known to date act in a dominant way in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, a gain of function is most likely. Evidence that fibroblasts derived from patients with presenilin mutations produce more and longer forms of the A4 amyloid peptide suggests that the mutations exert their effect on cellular metabolism or trafficking of amyloid precursor protein (21). The localization of PS1 in the early compartments of the biosynthetic pathway makes it unlikely that the presenilin mutations directly influence - and/or -secretase activity, since these operate in the late-Golgi and transport vesicles, at the cell surface and in endosomes (27, 41-43). The possibility that PS mutants influence the balance between amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic processing of APP in an indirect way by changing its intracellular trafficking should now be further explored in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and neurons (16, 44, 45)..
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	54	Our study demonstrates furthermore that the presenilins are phosphorylated on serine residues. Phosphorylation of PS1 and PS2 was evident both in COS-1 cells and CHO cells, but the phosphorylation of PS1 was less intense and more variable than of PS2. The observation that okadaic acid enhanced the PS1 phosphorylation suggests that PS1 is more prone to phosphatase activity than PS2 (Fig. 8A). Protein kinase C is not responsible for PS phosphorylation, since neither stimulation of cells by phorbol esters nor purified kinase added to immunoprecipitated PS1 or PS2 resulted in increased labeling. It is therefore unlikely that the presenilins are directly involved in the regulation of APP secretion by protein kinase C (46, 47)..

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	56	Finally, we showed that the hydrophilic NH2-terminal and the major loop domain of PS1 are exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Digitonin at low concentrations selectively permeabilizes the cell membrane, but not the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (29). Antibodies directed toward the amino-terminal domain of PS1 (Fig. 9) displayed similar immunofluorescent staining patterns in digitonin and saponin permeabilized cells. Control experiments with antibodies against a luminal epitope, i.e. the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (30, 31), showed that digitonin did not permeabilize the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. For the major hydrophilic loop domain, essentially identical results were obtained. The conclusion therefore is that the two major hydrophilic domains in PS1 are oriented to the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum, which directs the search for candidate proteins interacting with these domains toward the cytoplasm. Consistent with this conclusion, antibodies against the second loop domain reacted with PS1 after saponin, but not after digitonin permeabilization. This not only confirms the luminal localization of the recognized epitope, but also validates the approach as it was used..

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	58	While more detailed studies, including electron microscopy and enzymatic digestion protection assays, are required to settle definitively the orientation of the presenilins in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, our results clarify already two important issues. The first problem is the orientation of the first transmembrane domain in PS1, which determines in fact the topology of all the following transmembrane domains (46). The positive charge difference between the 15 carboxyl-terminal and the 15 amino-terminal residues flanking the first membrane spanning domain suggests a luminal orientation of its amino terminus (48). However, several exceptions to this rule are known, mainly of proteins of which the amino-terminal domain contains more then 17 charged amino acid residues (48). In PS1, this domain contains 29 charged residues, which would explain its cytoplasmic orientation. The second issue, which has been pointed out by others before (9, 13, 17), is whether two putative hydrophobic stretches in the PS amino acid sequence flanking the hydrophilic loop, can additionally span the membrane, which would make the presenilins nine transmembrane domain proteins. Our data are compatible with a seven-transmembrane domain model with the amino-terminal domain and the hydrophilic loop located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 10; see also Note Added in Proof). In conclusion, the current study has analyzed the biosynthesis and the subcellular localization of the presenilins and provides a basis for the further study of their cell biology and their possible interactions with integral membrane and cytoplasmic proteins such as APP or Tau, both implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (4). --> Fig. 10.

PS1 is inserted in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane with both its amino-terminal (NH2-) and hydrophilic loop domain at the cytoplasmic side.

DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and... ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Alzheimer's disease is associated with characteristic neuropathology that includes the deposition of extracellular beta-amyloid (Ass) in neuritic plaques and intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles. Adults with Down's syndrome have high levels of Ass deposition by age 40 years and early onset of dementia. However, the average age at onset of clinical dementia is 55 years, and varies widely. The neuropathological manifestations of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome have been attributed to triplication and over-expression of the gene for beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), located on chromosome 21, but the factors influencing age at onset of dementia are unresolved. Factors which influence formation and deposition of Ass are reviewed, including atypical karyotypes, susceptibility genotypes, gender and oestrogen deficiency, and individual differences in Ass peptide levels. Factors which modify the rate and degree of Ass deposition, rather than over-expression of APP, may be important determinants of risk for dementia in Down's syndrome..

DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and... ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Although there has been controversy about the relative importance of plaques versus tangles in the development of Alzheimer's disease, there is increasing evidence that altered metabolism of Ass peptides and amyloid deposition in neuritic plaques causes Alzheimer's disease by triggering a complex pathological cascade that produces dementia. The Ass peptides Ass1-40 and Ass1-42, the two major species of Ass, are generated from APP by sequential proteolytic cleavage by ss- and - secretases. These enzymes are not the only ones involved in the breakdown of APP: -secretase cleaves the full-length APP, producing soluble sAPP and, subsequently, p3. Because processing by -secretase precludes production of full-length Ass peptides, it is anti-amyloidogenic (Younkin, 1998)..
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	14	Several lines of evidence suggest that deposition of Ass-42 is an important initial step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Ass1-42 aggregates more rapidly and is deposited earlier in Alzheimer's disease plaques than Ass1-40 (Iwatsubo et al, 1994). Mutations in the gene for APP and in presenilin (PS1/2) genes are associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease and with a selective increase in Ass1-42 (Borchelt et al, 1996; Mann et al, 1996; Scheuner et al, 1996; Kosaka et al, 1997; Younkin, 1998). Brain levels of Ass1-42 increase early in the development of Alzheimer's disease and are strongly correlated with cognitive decline (Cummings  and  Cotman, 1995; Naslund et al, 2000), and plasma levels of Ass1-42 are higher in elderly people who subsequently develop Alzheimer's disease than in those who remain free of dementia (Mayeux et al, 1999)..

0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	16	Virtually all individuals with Down's syndrome have neuropathological changes consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by the time they reach 40 years of age, including deposition of Ass in diffuse and neuritic plaques (Wisniewski, H. et al, 1995; Mann, 1988), and most will develop dementia by the end of their seventh decade of life (Lai  and  Williams, 1989). Despite the nearly universal occurrence of Alzheimer's disease pathology by middle age, there is wide variation in age at onset of dementia. The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease at age 65 has ranged between 30% and 75% (Zigman et al, 1997). Most studies have shown that the average age at onset of dementia is between 50 and 55 years, with a range from 38 to 70 years (Lai  and  Williams, 1989; Prasher  and  Krishnan, 1993). Methodological problems may account for some of the variation in estimated prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome. Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in this population requires both documentation of clinically significant decline in cognitive and adaptive competence from previously attained levels of performance and documentation of the absence of any other condition that might cause declines in performance (Aylward et al, 1997). Both these requirements are particularly difficult to address for adults with Down's syndrome, given their lifelong intellectual disability. The wide range of premorbid levels of performance associated with differences in level of intellectual disability requires specific criteria for clinically significant decline indicative of dementia for each level of function, and these are just beginning to be developed. There is, as yet, no consensus on a set of cognitive assessment tasks or on diagnostic criteria for existing cognitive assessment batteries that can differentiate adults with Down's syndrome who do and do not have dementia in its early stages. Presently, most diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome are made clinically, at relatively late stages of the disease, without systematic cognitive or functional testing over time..

Recent neuropathological studies have shown that diffuse plaques, the most prevalent Alzheimer-type lesion seen in individuals with Down's syndrome before age 50, are not associated with dementia. Diffuse plaques contain non-fibrillar amyloid, appear at younger ages than do neuritic plaques, are not associated with neuronal degeneration, and do not appear to affect the structure and function of neurons. In contrast, increases in the numbers of neuritic plaques, containing substantial amounts of fibrillised Ass peptides, are observed in adults with Down's syndrome predominantly after 50 years of age and are associated with neuronal degeneration and loss of function (Wisniewski, T. et al, 1995). Examination of the age-specific prevalence of dementia in Down's syndrome supports the hypothesis that the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome are closely associated with the development of these fibrillised plaques (Lai  and  Williams, 1989; Visser et al, 1997; Holland et al, 1998; Lai et al, 1999) (see Fig. 1). Although prevalence studies have employed varying sampling and diagnostic methods, there is remarkable agreement across studies that risk of Alzheimer's disease increases primarily after 50 years of age. In addition, not all adults with Down's syndrome will develop dementia even if they reach ages when the presence of high densities of neuritic plaques can be presumed. Thus, while triplication of the gene for APP may serve to increase diffuse plaques in adults with Down's syndrome, factors distinct from APP triplication must account for individual differences in susceptibility to the formation of fibrillised plaques and for the wide range in age at onset of dementia. A central task of the epidemiology of dementia in Down's syndrome is to identify factors that may influence risk of Alzheimer's disease by accelerating formation of Ass. Several avenues of investigation are suggested by existing findings and I will review the role of (a) atypical karyotypes; (b) genetic susceptibility factors; (c) gender and oestrogen deficiency; and (d) individual differences in Ass peptide levels..

DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and... ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   There is evidence from case studies of adults with Down's syndrome that atypical karyotypes, including translocations, partial trisomies and varying degrees of mosaicism, are associated with improved survival and decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Prasher et al (1998) presented an interesting case of a 78-year-old woman with partial trisomy 21 [46,XX,rec(21)dup q, inv(21)(p12q22.1)] and conducted a comprehensive analysis of the clinical and molecular genetic correlates of the partial trisomy. While her general appearance was suggestive, but not typical, of the Down's syndrome phenotype, she experienced several of the common age-related medical conditions characteristic of Down's syndrome, including hypothyroidism, cataracts, hypotonia and hearing impairment. Analysis of gene sequences on chromosome 21 using fluorescent in situ hybridisation showed that the partial trisomy excluded the region containing the gene for APP, which was present in only two copies. There was no evidence of decline in cognitive or adaptive competence for the 5 years preceding her death from pneumonia, and no evidence of Alzheimer's disease found on magnetic resonance imaging or neuropathological assessment. Similarly there are two reports of women with Down's syndrome with 25% and 86% disomy for chromosome 21, respectively (Chicoine  and  McGuire, 1997; W. B. Zigman, personal communication, 2000). Both women had a characteristic Down's syndrome phenotype and typical age-related medical conditions, including hypothyroidism and cataracts. The woman with 25% disomy for chromosome 21 died at age 83 following hospitalisation for a hip fracture and was free of dementia at her death, while the woman with 86% disomy is still living at age 74 and shows no evidence of dementia based on evaluations of cognitive and adaptive behaviour..

DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and... ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Four genes that increase risk of Alzheimer's disease have been identified. Mutations in three genes, APP, presenilin-1 (PS1) and presenilin-2 (PS2), are associated with early-onset familial forms of Alzheimer's disease that are transmitted as an autosomal dominant (Goate et al, 1991; Levy-Lehad et al, 1995; Sherrington et al, 1995). Homozygosity for a common variant of PS1, the 1-allele, has been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in some, but not at all, studies (Higuchi et al, 1996; Kehoe et al, 1996; Scott et al, 1996; Wragg et al, 1996). Only one study has examined the influence of PS1 alleles on risk of dementia in Down's syndrome. In that study of adults with Down's syndrome, there were no significant differences in allele frequencies between individuals with dementia and age-matched individuals without dementia (Tyrrell et al, 1999)..
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	24	Polymorphisms in the gene for apolipoprotein E (APOE) have been associated with risk for the more common late-onset Alzheimer's disease, that is, with onset after 65 years of age. There are three common variants of the gene for APOE, encoded for by three alleles, 2, 3 and 4. In numerous cross-sectional and case control studies, patients with Alzheimer's disease have been found to be significantly more likely than their peers to have one or more copies of the APOE 4 allele (Corder et al, 1993; Mayeux et al, 1993; Saunders et al, 1993). The APOE 4 protein may act by increasing the rate of the process which leads to Alzheimer's disease, predisposing to greater accumulation of Ass in those with and without Alzheimer's disease (Roses et al, 1994; Hyman et al, 1995; Polvikoski et al, 1995). The presence of the least common allele, APOE 2, has been associated with a delay in disease onset or even protection by most investigators (Corder et al, 1994; Roses et al, 1994)..

All studies have consistently found that the presence of the APOE 2 allele increases longevity and reduces the risk of dementia but the role of the 4 allele has been controversial (Hardy et al, 1994; Royston et al, 1994; Martins et al, 1995; van Gool et al, 1995; Cosgrave et al, 1996; Lambert et al, 1996; Schupf et al, 1996; Prasher et al, 1997; Schupf et al, 1998; Sekijima et al, 1998; Tyrrell et al, 1998; Lai et al, 1999; Rubinszstein et al, 1999; Deb et al, 2000). Small sample sizes and, importantly, failure to consider differences in the age at onset of dementia among those with and without an 4 allele may account for some of the negative findings. Since the effect of the 4 allele is not expressed until midlife, inclusion of sufficient numbers of adults over 50 years of age and analysis using survival methods that can adjust for age and years of follow-up are important methodological considerations. Our group used survival methods for analysis and found that the presence of the 4 allele was associated with earlier onset of dementia and greater decline in adaptive behaviour (Schupf et al, 1996). Compared with those with the APOE 3/3 genotype, adults with Down's syndrome with an 4 allele were five times as likely to develop dementia by age 65, while no one with an 2 allele developed dementia (see Fig. 2). Among affected individuals, mean age at onset of dementia was 53.3 years for those with the 4 allele and 58.0 years for those with the 3/3 genotype. Four other studies found an increased frequency of the 4 allele in adults with Down's syndrome and dementia compared with those with Down's syndrome without dementia (Martins et al, 1995; Sekijima et al, 1998; Rubinsztein et al, 1999; Deb et al, 2000)..

Several studies that found that the APOE 2 allele decreased risk of dementia had sample sizes that were too small to demonstrate a significant effect of the 4 allele (Hardy et al, 1994; Royston et al, 1994; Wisniewski, T., et al, 1995). Two case control studies of adults with Down's syndrome compared allele frequencies in individuals with and without dementia and found no significant association between APOE genotype and Alzheimer's disease but did not adjust for age (van Gool et al, 1995; Prasher et al, 1997). One large study examined 100 adults with Down's syndrome (40-70 years of age) and used survival analyses to examine age at onset of dementia by APOE genotype (Lai et al, 1999). The cumulative incidence of dementia by age 65 was 55% for those with the APOE 2/3 genotype, 88% for those with the APOE 3/3 genotype and 100% for those with any 4 allele. The effect of the 4 allele was stronger at younger ages, consistent with findings from studies in the general population that the effect of the 4 allele is to accelerate onset of Alzheimer's disease (Corder et al, 1993; Saunders et al, 1993; Meyer et al, 1998). Cumulative incidence to age 55 was 0.71 among those with an 4 allele and 0.40 among those with the APOE 3/3 genotype. The authors suggested that the 4 effect in their study may have been attenuated by the high rates of dementia at more advanced ages. They concluded that the effect of the 4 allele may be dependent on the age of the study sample..

Several studies that found that the APOE 2 allele decreased risk of dementia had sample sizes that were too small to demonstrate a significant effect of the 4 allele (Hardy et al, 1994; Royston et al, 1994; Wisniewski, T., et al, 1995). Two case control studies of adults with Down's syndrome compared allele frequencies in individuals with and without dementia and found no significant association between APOE genotype and Alzheimer's disease but did not adjust for age (van Gool et al, 1995; Prasher et al, 1997).

Before menopause, oestrogen promotes the growth and prolongs survival of cholinergic neurons in brain regions serving cognitive function (Toran-Allerand et al, 1992), increases cholinergic activity, has antioxidant properties and regulates the metabolism of the APP to protect against the formation of Ass (Jaffe et al, 1994; Goodman et al, 1996; Petanceska et al, 2000)..

Few studies have presented results separately for men and women. Studies that have compared women with men have found conflicting results, with different studies showing earlier onset (Raghaven et al, 1994; Lai et al, 1999), later onset (Farrer et al, 1997; Schupf et al, 1998) or no difference in age at onset (Visser et al, 1997; Lai  and  Williams, 1989) by gender. Two studies employed survival methods to examine age at onset distributions by gender, adjusting for both age and level of learning disability, and found conflicting results. My colleagues and I found that men with Down's syndrome were three times as likely as women to develop Alzheimer's disease by age 65 (see Fig. 3a); the effect of gender was observed in all age groups over 50 years (Schupf et al, 1998). Both men and women with Down's syndrome show elevations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone at puberty indicative of primary gonadal dysfunction, which appear to progress with age and be more frequent in men than in women (Hasen et al, 1980; Campbell et al, 1982; Hsiang et al, 1987; Hestnes et al, 1991). Thus, older men may not benefit from the relative preservation of oestrogen proposed to account for lower risk of Alzheimer's disease in men in the general population. In contrast, another study found that women with Down's syndrome were approximately twice as likely to develop dementia as men (Lai et al, 1999) (see Fig. 3b). In that study, the effect of gender was seen primarily at younger ages. In both studies, gender differences were largest in those with the APOE 3/3 genotype, suggesting that the high risk associated with the presence of the APOE 4 allele can mask gender effects.

DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and... ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   In Down's syndrome, as in Alzheimer's disease, deposition of Ass1-42 precedes the appearance of Ass1-40 (Iwatsubo et al, 1995). Ass1-42 was the predominant species in the brains of young (age  < 50 years) individuals with Down's syndrome; Ass1-40 deposits were observed only a decade or more later. Compared with age-matched controls from the general population, plasma levels of both Ass1-42 and Ass1-40 are increased in adults with Down's syndrome (Tokuda et al, 1997; Mehta et al, 1998), but one study found that this increase was not related to dementia status (Tokuda et al, 1997). Our group studied plasma Ass1-42 and Ass1-40 levels in 108 adults with Down's syndrome with and without dementia and compared them with plasma levels in 64 adults without dementia from the general population (Schupf et al, 2001). Ass1-42 and Ass1-40 levels were significantly higher in the adults with Down's syndrome than in controls from the general population (P=0.0001), and highest in adults with dementia and Down's syndrome, mean plasma levels of Ass1-42, but not Ass1-40, were higher in individuals with the APOE 4 allele than in those without an 4 allele, regardless of dementia status (see Fig. 4). The effect of the APOE 4 allele on Ass1-42 levels may be related to acceleration of the rate of amyloid fibril formation (Ma et al, 1994) or diminished clearance of Ass (McNamara et al, 1998)..

DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and... ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Factors that influence the formation of Ass, such as the APOE 4 allele, oestrogen deficiency and high levels of Ass1-42 peptides, are associated with earlier onset of dementia in Down's syndrome, while factors that decrease the formation of Ass, such as the APOE 2 allele or atypical karyotypes that reduce APP gene dose, are associated with lower mortality and reduced risk of dementia. An important task for future work will be to identify the sources of individual variation in premorbid Ass levels. Since 95% of people with Down's syndrome have triplication of APP associated with free trisomy, overexpression of APP cannot account for the differences in age at onset of dementia within this population. Rather, the joint effects of a variety of factors, including those reviewed here and others not yet identified, must influence the development of Alzheimer's disease. This suggests that we will need to focus on younger adults with Down's syndrome to identify causes of individual differences in lifespan development and to determine when they begin to exert their effects..

The C-terminus of Ass40/42 is generated by -secretase, whose activity is dependent upon presenilin (PS 1 or 2). Missense mutations in PS1 (and PS2) occur in patients with early-onset familial AD (FAD), and previous studies in transgenic mice and cultured cell models demonstrated that FAD-PS1 variants shift the ratio of Ass40 : 42 to favor Ass42. One hypothesis to explain this outcome is that mutant PS alters the specificity of -secretase to favor production of Ass42 at the expense of Ass40. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we studied Ass40 and 42 levels in a series of transgenic mice that co-express the Swedish mutation of APP (APPswe) with two FAD-PS1 variants that differentially accelerate amyloid pathology in the brain. We demonstrate a direct correlation between the concentration of Ass42 and the rate of amyloid deposition. We further show that the shift in Ass42 : 40 ratios associated with the expression of FAD-PS1 variants is due to a specific elevation in the steady-state levels of Ass42, while maintaining a constant level of Ass40. These data suggest that PS1 variants do not simply alter the preferred cleavage site for -secretase, but rather that they have more complex effects on the regulation of -secretase and its access to substrates..

APP is also a substrate for other endoproteases (-secretase and BACE2), and collectively these cleavages generate a range of amyloid (Ass) peptides (for review see 1). The most pathogenic of these peptides, Ass40 and 42, share a common N-terminus (+1) and differ by two residues at their C-terminus (2 to 7). Mutations in APP identified from familial AD (FAD) kindreds alter the protein's normal processing, causing either increased production of both peptides or a specific elevation in Ass42 (8 to 11). The longer Ass42 peptide is more prone than Ass40 to aggregate in vitro (12,13), and is the major species detected immunocytochemically in the brains of AD patients (14)..

Subsequent work in cell models demonstrated that co-expression of FAD-mutant PS1 with APP reproduced the rise in Ass42 relative to Ass40 that had been seen in patients with PS1-associated AD (39 to 41). This shift in Ass40 : Ass42 ratio was also found in the brains of transgenic mice co-expressing one of several FAD PS1 mutations (M146V, M146L, A246E or M286L) with the Swedish mutation of APP (39,42 to 44). Similar shifts in the steady-state ratios of mouse Ass40 : Ass42 were also noted in mice expressing only FAD-variant PS1 (45) or PS2 (46). Transgenic mice co-expressing mutated PS1 and APP developed amyloid pathology much earlier than mice expressing only APP; the acceleration in amyloid formation directly correlated with the change in the Ass40 : Ass42 ratios (42,47,48).

Subsequent work in cell models demonstrated that co-expression of FAD-mutant PS1 with APP reproduced the rise in Ass42 relative to Ass40 that had been seen in patients with PS1-associated AD (39 to 41). This shift in Ass40 : Ass42 ratio was also found in the brains of transgenic mice co-expressing one of several FAD PS1 mutations (M146V, M146L, A246E or M286L) with the Swedish mutation of APP (39,42 to 44). Similar shifts in the steady-state ratios of mouse Ass40 : Ass42 were also noted in mice expressing only FAD-variant PS1 (45) or PS2 (46).

Moreover, because some of these inhibitors coordinately depress both Ass40 and Ass42 production, it has been assumed that one enzyme complex is responsible for the production of both peptides (50,51). In such a setting, FAD mutations in PS1 might alter the ratio of Ass peptides produced from APP simply by shifting the specificity of -secretase to favor cleavage at residue 42 over that at 40. In this scenario, mutations that increase the output of Ass42 should be accompanied by a decrease in the generation of Ass40..

Each PS1 variant accelerated the rate of amyloid deposition to differing extents. After quantifying the levels of Ass40 and Ass42 in the brains of young, pre-symptomatic animals, we found that co-expression of either PS1A246E or PS1-dE9 in APPswe transgenic mice specifically increased Ass42 levels without altering Ass40. From these data, we defined a direct correlation between the age of amyloid onset and Ass42 levels. Based on work from cultured cell models suggesting that mutant PS1 alters the production of Ass42 (39 to 41), we conclude that changes in the steady-state level of this peptide in our transgenic mice were most likely due to alterations in the processing of APP.

By contrast, co-expression of wild-type human PS1, even at very high levels, has no effect on the rate of amyloid deposition (44). Here we extend this work to compare the effects of two FAD PS1 variants which hasten amyloid onset to differing degrees. As shown previously (47), transgenic mice from line C3-3 do not develop amyloid deposits until well beyond 18 months of age (Fig. 2A to C). Co-expression of PS1-A246E (line N-5) halves this time, with C3-3/N-5 mice developing amyloid deposits by 9 to 12 months (Fig. 2D to F) (47). Plaque burden in the C3-3/N-5 mice worsens with age, and by 20 to 24 months the hippocampus and cortex show high amyloid burdens. A similar acceleration in amyloid deposition has been noted when mice from a different line of PS1-A246E (line I2-4) are crossed to C3-3 mice (44). When mice from line C3-3 are crossed with mice expressing the exon-9-deleted variant of PS1 (line S-9) (56), substantial amyloid deposition is visible by 6 months of age (Fig. 2G) (57). As with PS1-A246E, amyloid burdens in the C3-3/PS1-dE9 mice increase throughout life (Fig. 2H and I). The early appearance of amyloid deposits was observed in offspring of C3-3 mice mated with two different lines of PS1-dE9 mice (line S-9 shown here and line O-7, data not shown), confirming that the effect was due to the PS1-dE9 transgene and not to an artifact of integration site..

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	34	Mutant PS1 specifically increases the steady-state levels of Ass42 By two independent approaches, we have demonstrated that the earlier appearance of amyloid in mice co-expressing APPswe (line C3-3) with PS1-A246E (line N-5) or PS1-dE9 (line S-9) is associated with a change in the ratio of Ass40 : Ass42 to favor Ass42 (Fig. 3) (39). In both of these studies, however, variance in the efficiency of Ass peptide captured by either immunoprecipitation or ELISA made it difficult to distinguish whether Ass42 levels were increased at the expense of Ass40, or whether the level of Ass42 increased independently while Ass40 remained unchanged. In the course of our study, a refined ELISA approach (58) was developed that allowed us to address this issue..
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	35	Using the refined ELISA assay, we studied the levels of Ass peptides in the brains of young, pre-deposit animals from each of the double transgenic lines described above (Fig. 5). Tissue was processed using a two-step extraction method: following sonication in 0.2% diethylamine (DEA) and high-speed centrifugation, soluble Ass was recovered in the supernatant, and the pellet was then re-extracted with 70% formic acid (FA) to recover all remaining insoluble species. The two fractions were assayed separately; data for total Ass were calculated by addition of the DEA and FA fraction values obtained for each animal. We noted that approximately 50% of Ass40 was extracted by DEA, while a lower, and more variable, percentage of Ass42 was extracted by this solvent (Table 1). Because all of the samples were prepared from young, pre-deposit animals, especially in the case of the mice transgenic for only APPswe, we do not believe that the relative insolubility of Ass42 was due to oligomerization of this peptide, but rather to an inherent difference in the solubility of the two peptides in DEA. Our comparisons across genotypes in each transgenic series therefore focus on total Ass values rather than DEA- or FA-soluble fractions to accommodate the differential solubility of the two peptides..

Mutant PS1 specifically elevates the levels of Ass42 and proportionately decreases the age at which deposits first appear in APPswe transgenic mice. (A) The levels of Ass40 and 42 were measured in the brains of mice from five distinct genotypes (noted below graph) by ELISA as described in Materials and Methods. Values for Ass40 and 42 in each genotype were normalized to the levels in C3-3 single transgenic mice, so that the value of each peptide in the C3-3 mice is set to 1, and the values for Ass40 and 42 in other genotypes are related to C3-3 mice (see Table 1). Statistical significance among genotypes was calculated pair-wise using a two-tailed Student's t-test (pairs noted by brackets on figure). The asterisk denotes a significant difference in Ass40 levels between C3-3xPS1-A246E and C3-3xPS1-dE9 (P < 0.0015). There were no statistical differences in Ass40 levels within the remaining C3-3 pairs. By contrast, levels of Ass42 were significantly increased in mice co-expressing mutant PS1. (B) The relationship between brain concentration of Ass42 and the age of amyloid onset for the genotypes analyzed in (A). As in (A), all Ass42 values are normalized to the levels measured in C3-3 single transgenic animals. Co-expression of Hu PS1dE9 induces the greatest relative increase in Ass42 and the largest decrease in age of amyloid onset. Note that the onset of amyloid lesions for line Q2-2 is estimated from the age at which plaques appear in Q2-2xPS1dE9 animals, and would be difficult to observe in the normal mouse lifespan. (C) The levels of Ass40 and 42 in the brains of Q2-2 APPswe mice crossed to PS1 mice were measured in a separate ELISA assay. The concentration of each peptide was normalized to the value measured in Q2-2 single transgenic mice (set to 1). As in the C3-3 series, the co-expression of PS1A246E and PS1dE9 in the Q2-2 mice significantly elevated the level of Ass42 without decreasing that of Ass40.

Mutant PS1 specifically elevates the levels of Ass42 and proportionately decreases the age at which deposits first appear in APPswe transgenic mice. (A) The levels of Ass40 and 42 were measured in the brains of mice from five distinct genotypes (noted below graph) by ELISA as described in Materials and Methods. Values for Ass40 and 42 in each genotype were normalized to the levels in C3-3 single transgenic mice, so that the value of each peptide in the C3-3 mice is set to 1, and the values for Ass40 and 42 in other genotypes are related to C3-3 mice (see Table 1). Statistical significance among genotypes was calculated pair-wise using a two-tailed Student's t-test (pairs noted by brackets on figure). The asterisk denotes a significant difference in Ass40 levels between C3-3xPS1-A246E and C3-3xPS1-dE9 (P < 0.0015). There were no statistical differences in Ass40 levels within the remaining C3-3 pairs. By contrast, levels of Ass42 were significantly increased in mice co-expressing mutant PS1. (B) The relationship between brain concentration of Ass42 and the age of amyloid onset for the genotypes analyzed in (A). As in (A), all Ass42 values are normalized to the levels measured in C3-3 single transgenic animals. Co-expression of Hu PS1dE9 induces the greatest relative increase in Ass42 and the largest decrease in age of amyloid onset. Note that the onset of amyloid lesions for line Q2-2 is estimated from the age at which plaques appear in Q2-2xPS1dE9 animals, and would be difficult to observe in the normal mouse lifespan. (C) The levels of Ass40 and 42 in the brains of Q2-2 APPswe mice crossed to PS1 mice were measured in a separate ELISA assay. The concentration of each peptide was normalized to the value measured in Q2-2 single transgenic mice (set to 1). As in the C3-3 series, the co-expression of PS1A246E and PS1dE9 in the Q2-2 mice significantly elevated the level of Ass42 without decreasing that of Ass40. The asterisk denotes a small but significant difference in Ass40 found between Q2-2xPS1-A246E and Q2-2. None of the remaining pairs showed significant differences in Ass40..
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	38	  View this table:    Table 1. Normalized fractions of brain Ass extracted into DEA and formic acid   Two separate series of experiments were performed. In one series we compared Ass40 and Ass42 levels in the brains of C3-3 APPswe mice with the levels in C3-3xPS1-A246E, C3-3xPS1-dE9, APPswe/PS1dE9 line 85 and Q2-2 mice (Fig. 5A and Table 1). In the first series, all values were normalized to Ass levels in the C3-3 mice. Graphing the relative levels of each peptide in these animals revealed that the addition of mutant PS1 increases the concentration of Ass42 without causing a proportionate decrease in Ass40. The case for this conclusion is stronger in the second series of mice described below, but even in the C3-3 series our measurements show that, compared with APPswe single transgenic mice, co-expression of PS1A246E caused a 50% increase, and PS1-dE9 a 150% increase, in the concentration of Ass42 without consistently lowering the level of Ass40. In mice co-expressing the PS1dE9 variant with APPswe, the levels of Ass42 exceeded that of Ass40 (Fig. 3), hence it is difficult to argue that the lack of change in Ass40 levels might be due to a far greater abundance of Ass40 relative to Ass42..
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	39	Comparison of these values with the ages at which amyloid deposits first appear in each genotype suggests an immediate relationship (Fig. 5B). The age of onset in each cross directly correlates with the concentration of Ass42 in the brain. This correlation extends beyond the C3-3 series. Line 85 mice, made by co-injecting APPswe and PS1dE9 vectors, were very similar to C3-3xPS1-dE9 mice in both their peptide levels and in their age of amyloid onset (Fig. 5A and B). At the other end of this spectrum, Q2-2 single transgenic mice accumulate even less Ass42 than C3-3 single transgenic mice, and show no sign of amyloid pathology at ages when deposits have already begun in C3-3 animals (Fig. 5A and B)..

The concentrations of Ass values for each genotype were normalized to levels in the Q2-2 single transgenic animals. Again, we found that the addition of mutant PS1 specifically elevates Ass42 levels without lowering Ass40 levels (Fig. 5C and Table 1). Collectively these data demonstrate that when mutant PS1 is present, then there is a specific increase in Ass42 without a proportionate decrease in Ass40. These data also demonstrate that the concentration of Ass42 is the driving force behind changes in the rate of amyloid deposition that occur in the double transgenic mice..

By comparing Ass measurements in APPswe/PS1-dE9 double transgenic mice to animals expressing APPswe, alone or with the less pathogenic PS1-A246E mutation, we have gained insight into the mechanisms by which mutations in PS1 cause early-onset AD. Our data show that FAD variants of PS1 selectively increase the levels of Ass42 without affecting Ass40 levels. Thus, co-expression of PS1 variants increases the amount of total Ass derived from a constant level of APPswe protein, suggesting that mutant PS1, either directly or indirectly, makes more substrate available for -processing, and that this additional substrate is specifically cleaved at residue 42. We further demonstrate that small changes in the levels of Ass42 can have considerable impact on the rate of amyloid deposition, highlighting the potential therapeutic benefit that might be gained by lowering Ass42 levels, even partially, early in the clinical course of AD..

In contrast, the co-expression of wild-type human PS1 has no impact on the rate of amyloid formation (44). All previous studies have been two-point comparisons between one line of mice expressing mutant APP mice and mice expressing one FAD-PS1 variant. The present study is the first to analyze different combinations of APP and PS1 variants that show distinct courses of amyloid pathology. Our data demonstrate that the age at which amyloid deposits first appear correlates directly with the concentration of Ass42 in the brain. As demonstrated in mice from line Q2-2, not all animals over-expressing APP, nor even those co-expressing PS1, will form amyloid deposits in their 2-year lifetime. While co-expression of PS1-A246E was able to dramatically accelerate the appearance of plaques in C3-3 APPswe transgenic mice, its effect was not strong enough to induce plaques by 20 months of age in the lower-expressing Q2-2 APPswe mice. Instead, plaques were only observed in mice from line Q2-2 when the highly pathogenic PS1-dE9 variant was introduced. Quantitative ELISA analysis in mice from each genotype revealed that both PS1 variants altered the concentration of Ass42 in the brain: animals expressing either PS1 variant contained more Ass42 than Q2-2 single transgenic mice. However, co-expression of PS1-dE9 led to substantially higher Ass42 levels than did PS1-A246E, consistent with its ability to induce amyloid formation earlier than PS1-A246E..

This complex is required for active -secretase, which is responsible for proteolytic processing of APP to generate the C-termini of Ass peptides (28,33). Studies with chemical inhibitors of -secretase have shown that the cleavage of APP at the 40 site and 42 sites are coordinately suppressed, suggesting a single activity is responsible for both cleavages (50,51,68 to 70). In this setting, the simplest explanation for the elevation of Ass42 relative to Ass40 in the presence of mutant PS1 was a simple shift in the enzyme specificity to favor cleavage at residue 42 with no net change in the amount of total Ass. However, our results indicate that the expression of FAD PS1 variants specified increases in the steady-state levels of Ass42 without altering Ass 40 levels. Expression of mutant PS1 thus leads to a net increase in total Ass. A similar finding was reported by Oyama and colleagues in their study of mice transgenic for PS2-N141I, which also show a specific increase in Ass42 levels (46)..

We note that if the PS1/Nicastrin/PEN-2/Aph-1 protein complex were responsible for the delivery of substrates to -secretase but not their proteolysis, inhibition of the PS1 complex, either genetically or pharmacologically, would diminish -secretase activity in a manner indistinguishable from inhibiting -secretase itself.

Within the limits imposed by the mouse lifespan, these small changes in Ass42 levels can make the difference between the appearance and absence of amyloid pathology. We show here that this dichotomy is determined by a threshold concentration of Ass42, and that once this minimum is surpassed further elevations in Ass42 act to hasten the onset of amyloid aggregation. These findings suggest that even partial reductions of Ass42 levels by pharmacological agents may substantially delay the onset of amyloid lesions in patients at risk for AD. Our study is also the first to demonstrate that the presence of mutant PS1 results in more Ass42 by specifically increasing the concentration of this peptide without altering that of Ass40. We suggest that mutant PS1 may act to recruit new pools of APP ss-CTF substrate to a -secretase that favors cleavage at residue 42. Altering the subcellular trafficking of APP substrates could therefore be another therapeutic approach to diminish the concentration of Ass42 the brains of patients with AD..

These findings suggest that even partial reductions of Ass42 levels by pharmacological agents may substantially delay the onset of amyloid lesions in patients at risk for AD. Our study is also the first to demonstrate that the presence of mutant PS1 results in more Ass42 by specifically increasing the concentration of this peptide without altering that of Ass40. We suggest that mutant PS1 may act to recruit new pools of APP ss-CTF substrate to a -secretase that favors cleavage at residue 42. Altering the subcellular trafficking of APP substrates could therefore be another therapeutic approach to diminish the concentration of Ass42 the brains of patients with AD..

OTHER HOMOLOGS MODELS OF CLEAVAGE CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   Recent studies demonstrate that presenilins (PSs) and signal peptide peptidase (SPP) are members of a novel protease family of integral membrane proteins that may utilize a catalytic mechanism similar to classic aspartic proteases such as pepsin, renin and cathepsin D. The defining features of the PSs and SPP are their ability to cleave substrate polypeptides within a transmembrane region, the presence of two active site aspartate residues in adjacent membrane-spanning regions and a conserved PAL motif near their COOH-terminus. PSs appear to be the catalytic subunit of multiprotein complexes that possess -secretase activity. Because this activity generates the amyloid ss peptide (Ass) deposited in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), PSs are considered therapeutic targets in AD. In contrast to PSs that are not active unless part of a larger complex, SPP does not appear to require protein co-factors. Because of its requirement for hepatitis C virus maturation and a possible immune modulatory role, SPP is also considered a potential therapeutic target. Four additional PS/SPP homologs have been identified in humans; yet, their functions have not been elucidated. Herein, we will review the recent advances in our understanding of the PS/SPP family of proteases as well as discuss aspects of intramembrane cleavage that are not well understood..

OTHER HOMOLOGS MODELS OF CLEAVAGE CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   In order to more accurately reflect their catalytic activities, proteases have been referred to as peptide peptidohydrolases. This terminology reflects the catalytic mechanism in which a water molecule plays an essential role in cleaving a peptide bond. Until recently, all characterized  classic  proteases had been shown to have an active site domain located in the aqueous environment of the cytoplasmic, lumenal or extracellular space. Thus, cleavage of peptide bonds buried within the hydrophobic interior of a cellular membrane was postulated to require either breakdown of the membrane or transport of substrate out of the lipid bilayer to an aqueous environment. The recent identification of several families of membrane proteases that seem capable of cleaving peptide bonds present within the lipid bilayer has dramatically changed the concept of how transmembrane regions of proteins may be cleaved (1,2)..
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	5	Three families of proteases that carry out  intramembrane proteolysis  are recognized (1,2). Though exact catalytic mechanisms remain elusive, there is evidence that the active site of these proteases could lie within the plane of the lipid bilayer, and that proteases within each family may utilize conserved catalytic mechanisms analogous to those found in classic proteases. The first family, whose prototypic member is the human site-two protease (S2P) that cleaves and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), appears to be a group of metalloproteases (3). The second family, the rhomboids, whose prototypic member Drosophila Rhomboid-1 cleaves and liberates several EGF ligands, appears to be a group of serine proteases (4). A third family, whose prototypic members are the presenilins (PSs) involved in cleavage of the amyloid ss protein precursor (APP) and Notch, appears to be a group of aspartic proteases (5,6). Collectively these proteases have been referred to as intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs). For several reasons a great deal of attention has focused on the aspartic I-CLiP family. First, the prototypic members of this family, the human PSs, are therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Second, a new member of this family, signal peptide peptidase (SPP), was recently identified and shown unequivocally to possess proteolytic activity and have biological functions that may also make it a therapeutic target. Herein, we will discuss these recent advances with respect to the presenilin/signal peptide peptidase family of I-CLiPs..

OTHER HOMOLOGS MODELS OF CLEAVAGE CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   PSs are integral membrane proteins with 6 to 8 predicted transmembrane regions. They were first identified through genetic linkage analysis in families with early onset autosomal dominant forms of AD (7,8). PSs are synthesized as 50 kDa proteins, but are rapidly endoproteolyzed into NH2- (30 kDa) and COOH- (20 kDa) terminal fragments, which remain associated along with other proteins in a high molecular weight complex (9,10). To date, 100 AD-linked mutations have been found in presenilin 1 (PS1) and several more in presenilin 2 (PS2) (11). Almost concurrent with the identification of mutations in PSs as genetic causes of AD, there was some evidence linking PSs to the proteolytic activity referred to as -secretase (12). This activity is involved in the production of the amyloid ss peptide (Ass) from its precursor, APP. Following cleavage of APP by ss-secretase, -secretase cleaves the membrane bound COOH-terminal APP fragment within its transmembrane region generating both the 4 kDa Ass peptide and a cognate COOH-terminal cleavage product. The cut in the membrane is heterogeneous with multiple Ass species produced ranging in length from 32 to 42 amino acids (13). The most prevalent form of Ass is one of 40 amino acid residues (Ass40); under typical circumstances Ass40 represents  > 50% of the Ass secreted from a cell.

To date, all AD-linked mutations in PS1 and PS2 have been shown to increase the relative production of Ass42 even in asymptomatic carriers, and expression of a mutant PS gene in transgenic mice overexpressing human APP, accelerated accumulation and aggregation of Ass in the brain (12,14)..

PSs did not bear homology to classic proteases; thus, it was proposed that PSs influenced -secretase activity indirectly. Over the past few years, genetic and biochemical evidence has emerged demonstrating that PSs are in fact -secretases. Knockout studies of PS1 and PS2 demonstrated an essential role of these proteins in -secretase cleavage. PS1 knockout decreased -secretase activity by 80%, a PS2 knockout had little or no effect, and a combined PS1 and PS2 knockout abolished -secretase activity (15 to 18). Biochemical studies showed that PS1 co-fractionates with -secretase activity in a high molecular weight complex and this in vitro activity could be recovered in the pellet after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PS1 (19). Significantly, mutation of conserved aspartate residues (D257 and D385 in PS1, and D263 and D366 in PS2) present in two adjacent transmembrane regions produced dominant negative forms of PS that inhibited -secretase activity in cells (5). These studies together with inhibitor studies suggested that PSs might be aspartic type proteases (20). Finally, inhibitors of -secretase activity have been shown to directly target both PS1 and PS2 (21 to 24). Moreover, given that two groups had specifically designed their inhibitors to be transition state analogs of aspartic proteases (21,22), it certainly appears that despite the lack of demonstrable homology to known aspartic proteases, PS may be just that..

OTHER HOMOLOGS MODELS OF CLEAVAGE CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   The second, more recently identified member of the aspartic I-CLiP family is the SPP of higher eukaryotes (31). Typical for an aspartic I-CLiP, SPP is a predicted multispanning membrane protein containing two putative active site aspartates that are located in the centre of adjacent transmembrane regions. The latter feature is consistent with the observed cleavage of substrate peptides in the centre of their membrane-spanning portion. In addition, SPP contains two endoglycosidase H-sensitive N-glycans and an ER retrieval signal, KKxx, ascribing SPP a function in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (31)..
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	15	The role of SPP in cell function is poorly understood. The SPP substrates identified to date, represent a variety of signal peptides and a viral protein (Table 2) (31 to 34). They do not unequivocally demonstrate to a role of SPP either in the degradation of signal peptides that may otherwise accumulate in the ER membrane, or in the activation of signaling or regulatory molecules, or both. Potential orthologs of SPP are found in the genomes of animals and plants but not fungi and bacteria (31,35). Therefore, the prime role of SPP may not necessarily be the clearance of membranes from signal peptides, which are produced in all organisms, and a more basic mechanism may exist to fulfil that function. We may thus speculate that SPP, in analogy to other I-CLiPs, may promote the liberation of bioactive peptides or proteins from the ER membrane. The generation of HLA-E epitopes in humans represents the first example of such an SPP-dependent production of a bioactive peptide, which in this case functions as a reporter. HLA-E epitopes that play a key role in immune surveillance, are produced from the signal sequences of the antigen presenting MHC class I molecules in a process that depends on SPP (36). The epitopes are eventually presented at the cell surface of most of our cells, where they are recognized by the natural killer (NK) cells of the immune system. Presentation of these signal peptide-derived epitopes is an indirect indication that the probed cell is healthy and had properly synthesized MHC class I molecules. If such epitope presentation is defective or otherwise disturbed, e.g. due to a virus infection or transformation to a tumor cell, these impaired cells are thought to be recognized and eliminated by the NK cells (37)..

SPP substrates   The substrate spectrum of SPP may not be restricted to classic signal peptides, which typically are short, NH2-terminal extensions of a precursor protein. The finding that SPP is exploited by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) for the processing of the viral core protein, implies that the protease may also catalyse intramembrane cleavage of membrane anchored proteins, similar to other I-CLiPs (34). During biosynthesis of viral proteins in HCV infected cells, the immature HCV core protein is transiently anchored in the ER membrane via a COOH-terminal, signal peptide-like sequence. Intramembrane proteolysis by SPP promotes the final processing of core protein and its release from the ER membrane into the cytosol. Likewise, we may speculate that proteins anchored in the ER membrane by a signal peptide-like sequence, may be liberated from the ER membrane and activated upon cleavage by SPP..

OTHER HOMOLOGS MODELS OF CLEAVAGE CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   Despite limited areas of direct sequence homology, PSs and SPP are membrane proteins whose sequences can be aligned almost throughout their entire lengths (31,35). PSs and SPP share identical active site motifs, YD and LGLGD (Table 3). In addition, they contain a third conserved region, PAL, which seems characteristic for the entire aspartic I-CLiP family. Moreover, the YD and LGLGD motifs, which contain the catalytic aspartate residues, are unusual in that they are present within predicted adjacent and opposing transmembrane regions. The similarities between PSs and SPP, particularly the identity of the active site motifs, point to a common catalytic mechanism. Indeed, a series of protease inhibitors including aspartic protease transition state analogues, targeted to the active site of SPP and PSs, inhibited both activities (38). Because both enzymes are potential targets for therapeutic intervention PSs for the treatment of AD and SPP for the anti HCV therapy it will be a challenging task for the future to define compounds and conditions for the selective inhibition of either protease..

PS and PSH family members   Another common feature, and one that is typical of many I-CLiPs, is that both PS and SPP activity appear to require prior cleavage of the substrate to remove its ectodomain. SPP substrates are first cleaved by signal peptidase (33), whereas PS/-secretase substrates are first cleaved by shedding proteases (e.g. ADAM family members and ss-secretase) (39 to 41). In most cases studied to date, this initial cleavage is essential for the intramembrane cut to occur. Thus, substrate specificity of PS/-secretase and SPP may be determined as much by this priming cleavage as the respective substrate sequence itself..

The reconstitution of human SPP in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which does not express an orthologous  signal peptide peptidase , suggested that human SPP does not require additional proteins for activity (31). In contrast, PSs appear to require at least three additional protein partners for activity. PSs undergo endoproteolytic activation, which may depend on these components and, together with these additional proteins, forms an active -secretase complex. Such activation and complex formation may provide means of control of the protease's intramembrane-cleaving activity, and regulate substrate delivery and/or trafficking to the intracellular site of action. In the case of SPP, there is no indication for endoproteolysis or any another activation step. Nevertheless, its activity is almost certainly regulated in some fashion; SPP does not appear to randomly attack membrane proteins in the ER. Rather than the protease activity, properties of the substrates may account for controlled proteolysis by SPP (33)..

OTHER HOMOLOGS MODELS OF CLEAVAGE CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   Shortly after the identification of human PSs, homologs were recognized in plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. Some of the close homologs such as those found in C. elegans and Drosophila, have been extensively studied and shown to function as aspartic I-CLiPs in high molecular weight complexes like the human PSs (reviewed in 2). More recently, in addition to SPP, a number of other potential aspartic I-CLiPs with less obvious homology to PSs have been recognized by database searching (Table 3) (31,35,43). These proteins have no identified function and have been referred to by various names. Herein, they will be referred to as presenilin homologs/signal peptide peptidase-like proteases (PSH/SPPL), although with future functional assignment we propose that they would be renamed to more accurately reflect their function. In humans, four PSH/SPPLs with unknown functions have been recognized. PSH/SPPLs are predicted to be integral membrane proteins with multiple membrane spanning regions, and to contain both the conserved transmembrane aspartates in the motifs YD and LGhGD, and the PAL motif near the COOH-terminus. In addition, several members of the family contain a protease-associated domain near their NH2-terminus. When found in some classic protease, this domain is involved in substrate binding (44)..

OTHER HOMOLOGS MODELS OF CLEAVAGE CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   Although much has been learned about intramembrane cleavage, the exact manner in which these reactions occur remains a mystery. The conservation of putative active site motifs between I-CLiPs and classic proteases indicates that the catalytic mechanism of I-CLiPs most likely involves hydrolysis. If this is the case, then water must somehow gain entry into the active site of these proteases and the labile bonds within the substrate's transmembrane region must at some point be exposed to an activated water molecule. In Figure 1, theoretical models that might fulfill these two requirements are shown. The first model (Fig. 1A) is one in which the multiple transmembrane regions of the protease form a hydrophilic pocket or groove at one face of the membrane. This model is compatible with I-CLiP cleavage sites that lie close to the cytosolic or lumenal face of the membrane, such as those that release the cytoplasmic tail of APP and Notch. However, cleavage events such as those that generate Ass and appear to occur in the middle of the membrane, might either require some perpendicular movement of the substrate or protease within the membrane, or possibly a very deep hydrophilic pocket. A variant of this model might be that the transmembrane regions of the I-CLiP adopt a horseshoe like structure. Upon association of the substrate to the active site, a channel or pore might be formed allowing access of water to the site of hydrolysis. Such a model might require distinct initial binding sites of the substrate followed by transfer into the active site. Another model (Fig. 1B), that might be suggested by recent data showing that both PSs and SPP may form dimers in vivo, is one in which the initial binding of substrate occurs in one active site. This binding could then induce a conformational shift resulting in the merger of the two subunits that together form a pore like structure. Alternatively, a distinct substrate-binding site on one subunit could result in presentation of the substrate to the active site of the other subunit. Additional models of cleavage that combine various aspects of these models are possible. Finally, it is possible that a given I-CLiP may utilize a novel mechanism of catalysis that is compatible with cleavage of a peptide bond in a lipid environment..

OTHER HOMOLOGS MODELS OF CLEAVAGE CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   The aspartic I-CLiPs represent a newly recognized and biomedically important family of proteases. Intense study of PSs and -secretase has led to the development of potent inhibitors of -secretase activity several of which have entered phase I trials in humans. Distinct -secretase inhibitors have overlapping activity against SPP (38), it is highly expected that many of those compounds may also target the other PSH/SPPLs. Thus, the specificity of -secretase inhibitors must be questioned. Because of the potential clinical significance of -secretase inhibitors, there is urgent need to increase our understanding of these proteins. Even with the experience gained by studying PSs and SPP, this will remain a difficult task. To date, there is no easily identifiable strategy that is assured of identifying function or substrate for these novel aspartic I-CLiPs. Nevertheless, because inhibitor specificity may prove instrumental, if inhibitors of aspartic I-CLiPs prove to be of therapeutic utility, this assignment of function and development of activity assays for each is extremely important..

To bypass the early lethality of the Psen1- and Psen2-double (PSEN) null embryos, we used a human PSEN1 transgene to rescue the somite patterning defects in PSEN-null animals and to allow a determination of the function of presenilins in late embryogenesis. We report here that expression of the human PSEN1 transgene supported the survival of PSEN-null embryos to the perinatal stage. However, presenilin deficiency in the kidney led to severe nephrogenesis defects and virtually no comma- or S-shaped bodies, or mature glomeruli were formed. We document that the mesenchyme was induced which could further progress to renal vesicles in the PSEN-null kidney, indicating that the presenilins are not essential for the inductive interactions and mesenchyme to epithelium transition. However, renal vesicles failed to pattern to form proximal tubules and glomerular epithelium. A presenilin-dependent, signaling-competent form of Notch1 was detected in mesenchymal derivatives but not in the ureteric buds of wild-type mice. Consistent with an obligatory role of presenilins in Notch processing and activation, the active form of Notch1 and its downstream target Hesr1 were absent in the PSEN-null kidney. Importantly, sustained Notch1 signaling was required for the maintenance of Notch ligand Jag1 expression. These results identify presenilins as one determinant of renal vesicle patterning in the developing mouse kidney, and we hypothesize that they act through the Notch signaling pathway..

Autosomal dominant inheritance of mutations in PSEN1 and PSEN2 leads to familial Alzheimer's disease and these mutations are known to affect the -secretase activity and to foster the ss-amyloid plaque pathology (Selkoe, 1998). Through similar mechanisms, presenilins are required for the proteolytic cleavage of Notch (De Strooper et al., 1999), molecules that are crucial in various cell-fate specification processes, and this activity is highly conserved (Levitan et al., 1996; Levitan and Greenwald, 1995; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Ye et al., 1999). In mammalian systems, the two presenilins play compensatory roles in the Notch signaling pathway, as revealed by gene knockout studies. Specifically, Psen1-null mice die pre- or perinatally, exhibiting a Notch1-associated somite segmentation defect (Shen et al., 1997; Wong et al., 1997). Although the Psen2 knockout does not have overt impairment, Psen1- and Psen2-double (PSEN) null embryos die at embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) with complete absence of somite patterning, which resembles a complete Notch1 loss-of-function, or more precisely, Notch1- and Notch4-double knockout phenotypes (Conlon et al., 1995; Donoviel et al., 1999; Herreman et al., 1999; Krebs et al., 2000). The redundant activities of PSEN1 and PSEN2 may be the explanation for the lack of overt organogenesis defects in each of the single knockouts. The early lethal phenotype of the PSEN-null embryos prevents the evaluation of potential physiological roles of presenilins in mid-to-late embryogenesis..

In mammals, organogenesis initiates after the body axes are established. Kidney organogenesis in mice begins at E11 and involves reciprocal inductive interactions between the ureteric bud epithelium and metanephric mesenchyme. The tips of the ureteric bud induce nephrogenic mesenchyme to form condensates followed by pretubular aggregates, which then undergo mesenchyme to epithelium transition (MET) to progress into polarized epithelia of renal vesicles and comma- and S-shaped bodies (Saxen, 1987). Morphogenesis and patterning of the epithelial structures then leads to the formation of distal and proximal tubules and the glomerulus; the latter consists of podocytes, mesangial cells and endothelial cells (Saxen, 1987)..

Relevant to this study, Ret is expressed at the tips of the newly formed branches of the ureteric bud and is crucial for the inductive interactions through binding to its ligand GDNF, which resides in the condensing mesenchyme (Moore et al., 1996; Pachnis et al., 1993; Schuchardt et al., 1994). The paired box genes Pax2 and Pax8 are expressed in various mesenchymal derivatives and ureteric bud epithelium (Dressler et al., 1993; Plachov et al., 1990; Rothenpieler and Dressler, 1993), and together they regulate and define the nephric lineage (Bouchard et al., 2002). Wnt4 has been documented as an essential signaling molecule from the metanephric mesenchyme for the mesenchymal to epithelial cell conversion (Kispert et al., 1998; Stark et al., 1994). WT1 is expressed in both uninduced mesenchyme and podocyte precursor cells of S-shaped bodies and mature glomeruli. It is required in the earliest phase of kidney formation (Armstrong et al., 1993; Kreidberg et al., 1993). The winged helix transcription factor BF2 is specifically expressed in the interstitial stromal mesenchyme and has been shown to modulate the transition of condensed mesenchyme into tubular epithelium (Hatini et al., 1996)..

Specifically, Notch1 and Notch2 and their ligands Delta-like1 (Dll1) and Jag1 are expressed in the maturing nephron and glomerulus (Beckers et al., 1999; McCright et al., 2001; Weinmaster et al., 1991; Weinmaster et al., 1992). In the Xenopus pronephros, Notch signaling has been proposed to be involved in both the early determination of duct versus tubule fate as well as in controlling tubule patterning (McLaughlin et al., 2000). Furthermore, mice with a hypomorphic expression of Notch2 exhibit a kidney glomerulogenesis defect (McCright et al., 2001)..

To bypass the early lethality of the PSEN null embryos, we bred the transgene onto the Psen1- and Psen2-double knockout background. We showed that expression of the human PSEN1 transgene supported the survival of the PSEN-null embryos to the perinatal stage. However, loss of presenilins resulted in profound nephrogenesis defects prior to development of comma- and S-shaped bodies. We provide evidence that presenilins play an important role, probably through the Notch signaling pathway, in the patterning of renal epithelial structures..

This result suggests that the inductive interactions between the ureteric bud epithelium and the metanephric mesenchyme proceeded normally in the absence of presenilins. However, at E13.5, while the kidney development was further advanced in the control, as evidenced by the appearance of pretubular aggregates/renal vesicles (distinguished upon further analysis, see Fig. 4) and comma- and S-shaped bodies (Fig. 2C, thin arrow and arrowheads respectively), only pretubular aggregates/renal vesicles (Fig. 2D, thin arrow) could be found in the PSEN-null kidney but no comma- and S-shaped bodies were identified.

At E13.5, Ret expression was comparable in the control and the mutant (Fig. 3D, compare a with b), indicating that the primary branching was not affected by the loss of presenilins at this stage. As impaired nephrogenesis was unambiguously documented at this stage, this result suggests that the ureteric bud signaling is not the primary cause for the defect. The reduced number of Ret-positive tips in the mutant at E15.5 (Fig. 3D, compare c with d) would thus probably be the result of impaired secondary or tertiary branching morphogenesis at this and later stages..

Immunostaining for WT1, which is highly expressed in the podocyte precursor cells of S-shaped bodies and mature glomeruli (Ryan et al., 1995), revealed a complete absence of WT1 expression in PSEN-null kidney as well (Fig. 5B).

Close up examination of the ureteric bud tips showed that, in PSEN-null culture, weak pan-cytokeratin positive renal tubules were formed and at least some appeared to have fused with the ureteric bud, which were strongly positive for pan-cytokeratin (Fig. 5C, part d).

Double staining with the anti-NCAM (Fig. 6A, parts c,d) and cytokeratin 8 antibodies (not shown) indicated that the proliferation rate of renal and ductal derivatives, respectively, were also similar. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that minor differences in cell proliferation in renal structures affected the tubule growth and patterning in presenilin mutant. This finding is not unexpected because much of the mesenchymal derivatives that required active cell division have already formed in the PSEN-null kidney..

0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	55	Analysis of Notch pathway molecules in kidney development Because an impaired Notch signal transduction is considered the leading mechanism for the somite patterning defect of PSEN-null mice, we assessed the expression of Notch pathway molecules in E14.5 PSEN-null kidneys. First, we examined cell types exhibiting the presenilin -secretase activity by immunostaining with an antibody that recognizes a PSEN-cleaved and activated form of Notch1, the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (Fig. 7A). Co-staining with an anti-cytokeratin 8 antibody (CK8) marked the ductal derivatives. NICD was not expressed above background in ureteric bud epithelium in both the control and PSEN-null samples (Fig. 7A). In the control kidney, NICD immunoreactivity could be detected in pretubular aggregates/renal vesicles (Fig. 7Aa), and comma- and S-shaped bodies (data not shown). PSEN-null kidney was devoid of NICD although pretubular aggregates were present (Fig. 7A, part b). Notch activation was correlated with expression of its downstream target Hesr1 (Hey1  to  Mouse Genome Informatics) (Kokubo et al., 1999) in the control (Fig. 7B, part a). By contrast, Hesr1 expression cannot be detected in PSEN-null mutant (Fig. 7Bb), consistent with an obligatory role of presenilins in Notch processing and signaling. The residual signal probably results from staining of blood vessels that also express Hesr1. These results support the idea that a presenilin-mediated nephrogenic signal is derived from the mesenchyme, and that presenilin-dependent Notch activation and signaling is the mechanism in operation..

At E14.5, Jag1 was not expressed in condensed mesenchyme (Fig. 7C, part a,b, asterisks), but its expression was turned on in pretubular aggregates in both the PSEN-null kidney and the control (Fig. 7C, part a,b, arrows) and in comma-shaped bodies of the control kidney (Fig. 7C, part a, arrowhead). Interestingly, at E16.5, although Jag1 was strongly expressed in the control kidney (Fig. 7C, part c, arrowhead), its expression was almost undetectable in the mutant (Fig. 7C, part d). The loss of Jag1 is not caused by the absence of mesenchymal derivatives as NCAM-positive pretubular aggregates and renal vesicles could be readily identified in PSEN-null at this stage (Fig. 4A, part d). Therefore, this result suggests that Notch signaling is required for the maintenance of Jag1 expression during kidney organogenesis..

This negative staining could be attributed by the lack of Dll induction caused by defective Notch signaling or by the absence of comma- and S-shaped bodies in PSEN-null mutant kidney. It is interesting to note that Dll1 expression seems to be restricted to a specific region of comma- and S-shaped bodies (Fig. 7D, part a, arrowheads), although the fate of these cells is not clear.

0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	60	   Discussion TOP SUMMARY Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion REFERENCES   Role of presenilins in nephrogenesis Histological examination at various stages of kidney development showed that presenilin deficiency does not affect the reciprocal inductive interactions between the ureteric bud epithelium and the metanephric mesenchyme. At E12.5, the mutant kidney was indistinguishable from that of littermate controls, as evidenced by the formation of condensed mesenchyme surrounding the ureteric buds. However, the difference became apparent at E13.5. While the control kidney undergoes further development to form pretubular aggregates, renal vesicles and comma- and S-shaped bodies, only pretubular aggregates and renal vesicles can be found in the PSEN-null kidney. In situ hybridization analyses of kidney development markers revealed that Gdnf and Bmp7 were normally expressed in PSEN-null kidney (data not shown), demonstrating that the uninduced mesenchyme was not affected by the loss of presenilins. The positive staining of Pax2, Pax8 and Wnt4 in the mutant established that the metanephric mesenchyme was competent in receiving signals from the ureteric bud to form condensates and aggregates. Last, the fact that Ret, which is a marker for the newly formed ureteric bud tips, was expressed similarly in the control and mutant at E13.5 suggests that presenilins do not exert a direct effect on primary branching morphogenesis. The reduced levels of mesenchymal markers Pax2, Pax8 and Wnt4 in the mutant at E13.5 and E15.5 are likely caused by the absence of comma- and S-shaped bodies. The combined effect led to impaired secondary and tertiary branching, as evidenced by the decreased number of Ret-positive tips in the mutant at E15.5. This notion is supported by kidney organ culture experiments in which loss of presenilins only affected branching in a minor fashion while formation of glomeruli were completely blocked. Limited secondary and tertiary branching and increased apoptotic cell death at later stages may in turn be the result of the failed progression through nephrogenesis in the PSEN-null kidney. These results, combined with our finding that presenilin -secretase activity is restricted to the mesenchymal derivatives, support a role for presenilins in the differentiation from pretubular aggregates and renal vesicles towards comma- and S-shaped bodies within the mesenchyme..

Analysis of cell adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix proteins, NCAM and E-cadherin, revealed that renal vesicles and tubular derivatives were partially formed in the PSEN-null kidney. Importantly, laminin stained these renal structures suggesting that they developed polarized cells with basement membranes. Thus, presenilins are not essential in the mesenchyme to epithelium transition. However, despite the formation and apparent fusion of some E-cadherin positive distal renal tubule structures to the bud epithelium, mature proximal tubules and glomeruli were completely absent in PSEN-null kidney. This conclusion was supported by the negative binding to LTL and lack of expression of WT1, respectively. From these data, we conclude that presenilins play an indispensable role in the patterning and differentiation of renal vesicles leading to proximal tubules and glomeruli..

This activity is highly conserved and likely accounts for the role of presenilins during somite patterning (Donoviel et al., 1999; Takahashi et al., 2000). Our analysis showed that the presenilin -secretase activated form of Notch1 (NICD), Notch downstream target Hesr1 and ligands Dll1 and Jag1 were expressed in mesenchymal derivatives and that their expressions were critically impaired in PSEN-null kidneys. Thus, the Notch pathway, particularly signaling through Notch1, may be the underlying mediator for presenilin activity in kidney development. It is noteworthy that mice expressing a hypomorphic allele of Notch2 exhibit kidney glomerulogenesis defects (McCright et al., 2001). As all four mammalian Notch proteins are presenilin substrates in vitro (Saxena et al., 2001), a defective Notch2-mediated pathway may also account for the PSEN-null kidney phenotype. However, the presence of glomeruli in Notch2 mutant kidneys, albeit structurally abnormal, indicates that Notch2 functions downstream of tubule patterning (McCright et al., 2001)..

The differences may be caused in part by variations of the systems of study; as ligand expression seems to be subjected to strict temporal-, spatial- and cell type-specific regulation..

Interestingly, although pretubular aggregates and renal vesicles still exist in PSEN-null mutant at E16.5, Jag1 expression is lost.

In the control kidney, Dll1 expression seems to be restricted to a specific region of the comma- and S-shaped bodies at E14.5. Although the origin of these cells is not known, this spatiotemporally restricted expression pattern may imply functional significance. Indeed, during somite patterning, caudally restricted expression of Dll1 has been shown to be important for prefiguring somite identity, and proper Dll1 induction requires presenilin-dependent Notch signaling (Takahashi et al., 2000). Equally possible, however, the absence of Dll1 expression could also be due to the physical lack of comma- and S-shaped bodies in the PSEN-null kidney..

Although the physiological significance is not clear, impaired processing of these molecules cannot be excluded as a potential mechanism for the kidney defects. Through processing-independent mechanisms, PSEN1 has been shown to interact with ss-catenin and to facilitate its turnover (Kang et al., 2002; Xia et al., 2002). Therefore, it is possible that deregulation of the ss-catenin pathway in the PSEN-null may contribute to the kidney phenotype. The Wnt pathway has been implicated in the inductive phase of kidney development (Dressler, 2002), but is essentially unaffected in the PSEN-null. In addition, we have created mice with a deletion of exon 10 of the endogenous Psen1 essential for ss-catenin interaction. Homozygous exon 10-deleted mice, when crossed onto the Psen2-null background, are viable and do not exhibit kidney defects (H.Z., unpublished). These observations thus argue against a potential ss-catenin involvement in the PSEN-null kidney..

These defects were apparently corrected by the human PSEN1 transgene presumably because of its early expression in mesoderm and in relevant cell derivatives. Indeed, the human Thy-1 promoter has been shown to be active in endothelial cells (Gordon et al., 1987), and expression of Hesr1, although absent in developing nephrons of the PSEN-null kidney, can be detected in blood vessels. The analysis of mechanisms leading to these phenotypes is currently ongoing..

Substrates: type I and... Conclusion References   Regulated intramembrane proteolysis is a novel mechanism involving proteases that hydrolyze their substrates in a hydrophobic environment. Presenilin (PS) 1 and PS 2 are required for intramembrane cleavage of an increasing number of type I membrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein of Alzheimer's disease and the Notch receptor, which signals during differentiation and development. Mutagenesis, affinity labeling, biochemical isolation, and reconstitution in cells reveal that PS, in complex with co-factors nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2, apparently contains the active site of -secretase, a novel membrane aspartyl protease. In addition, other related aspartyl proteases have been identified. These include members of the type-4 prepilin peptidase family in bacteria, which are known proteases and carry a GD motif conserved in PS. A group of multi-pass membrane proteins found in eukaryotes also contain YD and LGXGD motifs in two transmembrane domains that are conserved in PS and postulated to constitute an aspartyl protease active site. Among these is signal peptide peptidase (SPP), which cleaves remnant signal peptides derived from signal-peptidase-mediated ectodomain shedding. SPP cuts type II membrane proteins, illustrating that PS-like proteases play a key role in intramembrane proteolysis of single-pass membrane proteins oriented in either direction..

Substrates: type I and... Conclusion References   The deposition of the amyloid ss protein (Ass) in the form of neuritic plaques is a primary pathological lesion of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mounting evidence points to the 38-43 residue Ass as an initiator of pathogenesis and not just a molecular bystander. Strong evidence for this hypothesis comes from genetics: early-onset, dominant forms of familial AD (FAD) are caused by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and in presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2), and these mutations affect Ass production. The 42 residue form of Ass (Ass42) is the predominant Ass species deposited in the limbic and association cortices of both sporadic and familial AD patients (Gravina et al., 1995; Iwatsubo et al., 1994; Lemere et al., 1996; Mann et al., 1996a; Mann et al., 1996b). Increased amounts of Ass42 are produced from stably transfected cells and transgenic mice overexpressing mutant presenilin (PS) genes (Borchelt et al., 1996; Citron et al., 1997; Duff et al., 1996; Xia et al., 1997), and in the plasma of mutant gene carriers (Scheuner et al., 1996). Mutations in PS genes account for  > 50% of early-onset FAD (Levy-Lahad et al., 1995; Rogaev et al., 1995; Sherrington et al., 1995). Although FAD cases represent a minority of all AD cases, the mechanism by which PS mutations affect Ass production and cause FAD should provide insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of sporadic AD as well..
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	5	The production of Ass from APP involves sequential proteolysis by ss- and -secretases. Cleavage by -secretase is heterogeneous and generates C-terminal variations in Ass. Because FAD mutations in PS increase Ass42 levels in particular, PS must affect the selectivity of -secretase. Deletion of PS1 in mice is lethal, producing a major disruption of somite segmentation (Shen et al., 1997; Wong et al., 1997). Neurogenesis is impaired, and massive neuronal loss is observed in specific regions (Shen et al., 1997). The developmental abnormalities and embryonic lethality can be rescued by both wild-type and FAD-mutant PS1 (Davis et al., 1998; Qian et al., 1998), which indicates that disease-causing PS mutants are at least partially functional. Cleavage of APP by -secretase in cultured PS1-knockout neurons is markedly inhibited (De Strooper et al., 1998; Herreman et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2000), and PS-/- PS2-/- neurons produce undetectable levels of secreted Ass. This clearly demonstrates that PS is required for -secretase activity and Ass generation..

0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	7	Studies with inhibitors have shown that -secretase has characteristics of an aspartyl protease (Shearman et al., 2000; Wolfe et al., 1999a). Identification of two conserved aspartate residues in transmembrane (TM) domains 6 and 7 of PS critical for -secretase activity (D257 and D385 in PS1) provided the conceptual basis for the novel hypothesis that PS is the aspartyl -secretase (Wolfe et al., 1999b). When either aspartate residue in PS1 (Wolfe et al., 1999b) or PS2 (Kimberly et al., 2000; Steiner et al., 1999) is mutated, -secretase activity is blocked, and Ass levels are significantly reduced in cultured cells. This was also observed in transgenic mice overexpressing aspartate D257A mutant PS1 (Xia et al., 2001). Further evidence summarized below suggests that not only is PS an aspartyl protease but an entire class of PS-like proteases is involved in intramembrane proteolysis of both type I and II membrane proteins..
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	8	   PS: the active site of -secretase Top Summary Introduction PS: the active site... From bacterial proteases to... PS homologues with putative... Signal peptide peptidase: PS... Substrates: type I and... Conclusion References   PS1 and PS2 are 467 and 448-residue polypeptides, respectively, and share 60% sequence similarity. Full-length PS undergoes endoproteolysis to form stable N-terminal (NTF) and C-terminal (CTF) fragments, which remain associated (Borchelt et al., 1996; Capell et al., 1998; Thinakaran et al., 1996). Transition state analogue -secretase inhibitors that were designed to target the active site of the protease and efficiently decrease Ass generation in vivo and in vitro bind to both members of the PS NTF-CTF heterodimeric complex, which suggests that the active site lies between the two associated fragments (Esler et al., 2000; Li et al., 2000). Although the aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin A binds to both full-length PS and NTF-CTF complexes (Evin et al., 2001), more potent -secretase inhibitors bind only to associated NTF-CTF but not to full-length PS (Esler et al., 2000; Li et al., 2000; Seiffert et al., 2000). The same inhibitors bind to PS1E9, a PS1 variant that lacks the processing site but is nevertheless functional (Li et al., 2000). These findings suggest that a conformational change in PS caused by endoproteolysis or deletion of this processing site produces the active protease that is susceptible to exogenous inhibitors..
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	9	Besides endoproteolysis of PS to form functional NTF-CTF, its association with other components is apparently also critical for -secretase activity. Investigation of the PS-containing high-molecular-weight (HMW) complex indicates that additional cofactors intimately associate with PS to form the active -secretase complex. Nicastrin, which was initially identified from PS1 co-immunoprecipitates (Yu et al., 2000), binds specifically to an immobilized transition state analogue -secretase inhibitor (Esler et al., 2002). Nicastrin and PS1 NTF-CTF are capable of binding to this immobilized -secretase inhibitor under conditions that also maintain the -secretase activity; conditions disrupting the association of these proteins with the inhibitor also render the complex inactive. In common with anti-PS1 antibodies, anti-nicastrin antibodies can precipitate the functional -secretase complex (Esler et al., 2002). Although glycosylation of nicastrin is not absolutely required for -secretase activity (Herreman et al., 2003), mainly the mature form of nicastrin was identified in the HMW -secretase complex, and levels of nicastrin in cells closely correlate with PS levels (Arawaka et al., 2002; Kimberly et al., 2002; Leem et al., 2002; Tomita et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2002). Reduction of PS levels leads to a concomitant reduction in nicastrin levels, and downregulation of nicastrin expression decreases the levels of stabilized PS molecules. Thus, reduction in the amount of either protein decreases Ass generation (Edbauer et al., 2002)..

Proper Notch signaling is critical to a wide variety of cell fate determinations during embryonic development and adulthood. Notch is a type I integral membrane protein that has a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain. After translation, the receptor is proteolyzed in the trans-Golgi as part of its maturation into a heterodimeric cell surface receptor. Notch then suffers a second proteolysis as a result of ligand activation, leading to shedding of the extracellular domain of the receptor. The remaining membrane-bound C-terminal stub is subsequently cleaved within its transmembrane domain to release the Notch intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression. This final intramembrane proteolysis is mediated by the multi-component -secretase complex (Fortini, 2002)..

PEN-2 has two predicted TM domains. It does not contain any known protease motif and does not carry a signal peptide. Interestingly, its chromosomal location (chromosome 19) is close to the ApoE gene. The ApoE4 allele is the major risk factor associated with AD. Inactivation of APH-1 or PEN-2 in cultured Drosophila cells significantly reduces the -secretase cleavage of APP and Notch, and PS NTF-CTF levels are also reduced (Francis et al., 2002). In mammalian cells, PEN-2 protein levels are significantly reduced in the absence of PS; downregulation of nicastrin synthesis similarly causes a reduction in PEN-2 levels. Downregulation of PEN-2 synthesis likewise decreases the levels of stabilized PS molecules and mature nicastrin, with a concomitant reduction in -secretase activity (Steiner et al., 2002). Reduction of APH-1 levels in mammalian cells also reduces -secretase activity (Lee et al., 2002b). Recent studies have demonstrated that APH-1, PEN-2 and nicastrin directly associate with PS (Gu et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2003; Kimberly et al., 2003) and overexpression of these four proteins enhances -secretase activity (Edbauer et al., 2003; Kimberly et al., 2003; Takasugi et al., 2003). Increased levels of APH-1, PEN-2 and PS1 facilitate PS heterodimer formation, as well as glycosylation of nicastrin (Edbauer et al., 2003; Kimberly et al., 2003; Takasugi et al., 2003). Thus, nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2 regulate one another and are indispensable for -secretase activity. Although reconstitution of PS, nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2 in yeast leads to PS endoproteolysis and Ass/AICD production (Edbauer et al., 2003), definitive evidence for PS as a protease requires in vitro reconstitution assays using purified PS and substrate..

Conclusion References   The catalytic apparatus of the classical aspartyl protease consists of two aspartic acid residues. The two aspartate residues coordinate a water molecule, activating it for cleavage of peptide bonds. Unlike serine or cysteine proteases, aspartyl proteases do not use nucleophilic attack as part of their mechanism. Thus, there is no covalent intermediate formed between the enzyme and the substrate (Beynon and Salvesen, 2001). Because PS lacks the classic D(T/S)G motif of an aspartyl protease, the conserved D257 and D385 residues may either be critical for the aspartyl protease activity of the HMW -secretase complex or themselves constitute the active site of a novel aspartyl protease that does not carry the classic D(T/S)G motif. Studies of bacterial aspartyl proteases have shown that the multi-pass type-4 prepilin peptidases (TFPP) likewise lack the D(T/S)G motif but have a conserved GD motif that is also conserved in presenilins and includes the second critical aspartate residue (D385 of PS1). D385A, G384P and G384K mutations in PS1 block proteolysis of the APP and Notch TM region. A FAD-causing mutation at this position in PS1 (G384A) instead causes a six-fold increase in Ass42 generation compared with wild-type PS1-expressing cells, but it does not prevent proteolysis of the Notch TM domain (Steiner et al., 2000). The conserved GD motif lies in TM7 of PS1. This motif is likewise found on the C-terminal side of the active site of bacterial TFPP, and mutation of the aspartate residue of the GD motif blocks its ability to remove leader peptides from certain substrates (LaPointe and Taylor, 2000). Although the primary sequences of PS and TFPP are not highly similar overall, the similar requirement for the aspartate-containing motifs for proteolysis from bacteria to humans suggests that TFPP and PS are novel polytopic membrane aspartyl proteases (Steiner et al., 2000)..

PS homologues with putative... Signal peptide peptidase: PS... Substrates: type I and... Conclusion References   Database searches for PS homologues led to the identification of another group of multipass transmembrane proteins that contain aspartyl-protease-like domains similar to those proposed for PS (Ponting et al., 2002). Except for the TM1 domain of PS, the sequences of these PS homologues, termed PSHs, loosely align with the PS sequence. These proteins thus appear to have topologies similar to that of PS. The YD motif in TM6 and the LGXGD motif in TM7, containing the two key aspartate residues, are conserved in almost all reported PSHs. In addition, all known PS proteins contain a proline-alanine-leucine-proline (PALP) motif starting at P433 (amino acid numbering based on human PS1) at the C-terminus, and mutation of the first proline of the PALP domain of PS leads to destabilization of the PS high-molecular-weight complex (Tomita et al., 2001). Interestingly, this PALP domain is also conserved in PSHs. Several animal and plant PSH's also contain N-terminal protease-associated (PA) domains that often co-occur with peptidase domains (Mahon and Bateman, 2000; Ponting et al., 2002)..
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	19	Rogaev and colleagues independently found the same group of PS-like proteins, which they collectively name IMPAS (for intramembrane-protease-associated activity) or IMPs (Grigorenko et al., 2002). For example, IMP1 is identical to PSH3, which is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 20. Furthermore, the sequence of IMP1/PSH3 is identical to that of signal peptide peptidase (SPP), the protease involved in cleaving signal peptide remnants (Grigorenko et al., 2002; Ponting et al., 2002; Weihofen et al., 2002) (see below)..

PS homologues with putative... Signal peptide peptidase: PS... Substrates: type I and... Conclusion References   SPP has a membrane topology like that of PS (Weihofen et al., 2002). After signal peptides are cleaved from pre-proteins by signal peptidase, the remnant signal peptides anchored in the ER membrane become substrates for SPP. Human SPP is predicted to have seven TM domains, its N-terminus facing the ER and its C-terminus facing the cytoplasm (Fig. 1). The active site motif YD is located in the center of TM 4, whereas the other active site motif, LGXGD, is located in the center of TM 5. When the cDNA encoding human SPP is expressed in yeast, SPP activity in microsomal vesicles can be solubilized with CHAPS (Weihofen et al., 2002), a detergent capable of solubilizing -secretase activity (Esler et al., 2002). In vitro, SPP mediated cleavage of its substrate has clearly demonstrated the critical role of the conserved aspartates in SPP: mutation at D265 in the LGXGD motif prevents cleavage of the substrate. Addition of a specific inhibitor of SPP, TBL4K, which reversibly binds to the active site of the protease, completely blocks in vitro SPP proteolytic activity. Indeed, Weihofen et al., have used a photocrosslinkable version of this inhibitor to purify and identify SPP (Weihofen et al., 2002). Therefore, SPP represents a novel class of PS-like aspartyl protease..

Signal peptide peptidase: PS... Substrates: type I and... Conclusion References   PS is predicted to have eight TM domains, the N-terminus, TM6-TM7 loop and C-terminus all oriented towards the cytoplasm (Fig. 1) (Doan et al., 1996; Li and Greenwald, 1998). Thus, the orientation of TM6, which contains the YD motif, is lumen to cytoplasm, and the orientation of TM7, which contains the LGXGD motif, is cytoplasm to lumen. This contrasts with the orientations of TM regions containing the YD and LGXGD motifs in SPP but is consistent with the orientations of their respective substrates (Fig. 1): SPP substrates (signal peptides), are type II membrane proteins whose N-termini face the cytoplasm, whereas -secretase substrates are type I membrane proteins whose C-termini facing the cytoplasm. All of the known -secretase substrates (APP, Notch, ErbB-4, E-cadherin, CD44, LRP and nectin1) are type I membrane proteins and are cleaved in their TM domains in a PS-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Some of the cleavage sites have been fully characterized, others remain to be determined. Both products of -secretase-mediated cleavage have been characterized in the case of APP and Notch. These substrates are cut in the middle of their TM domains and at a residue close to the interface of the membrane and cytoplasm, and both cleavages can be inhibited by -secretase inhibitors and are fully dependent on PS (De Strooper et al., 1999; Okochi et al., 2002). In the cases of other -secretase substrates, only one product at best has been fully characterized. ErbB-4 undergoes -secretase cleavage between residue A672 and the conserved residue V673, several residues from the membrane-cytoplasm boundary (Lee et al., 2002a; Ni et al., 2001). Cleavage of E-cadherin occurs between residues L731 and R732, apparently right at the membrane-cytoplasm interface (Marambaud et al., 2002). CD44 is cleaved in a fashion similar to APP: a cleavage occurs in the middle of the TM domain (between residues A278 and L279), releasing an Ass-like molecule (CD44-ss; and another cleavage releases the CD44 intracellular domain (CD44-ICD) (Lammich et al., 2002). Ectodomain shedding of full-length low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (May et al., 2002) or nectin 1 (Kim et al., 2002) in each case leads to the formation of a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment and is followed by PS-dependent -secretase-like cleavage in the TM domain to release the intracellular domain. Although both LRP and nectin 1 have a conserved valine residue close to the membrane-cytoplasm boundary, the actual cleavage sites of LRP and nectin 1 have yet to be determined. None of these known PS/-secretase substrates appears to be cleaved by PSHs, since -secretase cleavage of these substrates does not occur in PS1-/- PS2-/- cells..

Sequence comparison of these substrates suggests that residues having a tendency to disrupt the helix of the TM domain are required for SPP cleavage. Importantly, signal peptidase cleavage of pre-proteins to form a signal peptide is a prerequisite for SPP cleavage, which is consistent with the requirement for ectodomain shedding in -secretase substrates.

Substrates: type I and... Conclusion References   Although the majority of experimental results support the idea that PS is an aspartyl protease, definitive evidence from in vitro reconstitution assays using purified PS and substrate is needed. This approach is complicated owing to the existence of at least three necessary co-factors for protease activity: nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2. Although the functions of these co-factors are under extensive investigation, database searches for protease motifs have not revealed any candidates for protease domains in these co-factors. By contrast, relatives of PS have emerged as potential proteases carrying the unique putative active site motifs in two TM domains, and these proteins appear to function without the need for other co-factors. The TFPPs, for example, are known proteases carrying the conserved GD motif of PS, but the primary sequences of TFPPs share no other similarity with PS. The multipass PSH (IMPAS) TM proteins share some sequence similarity with PS, possessing both YD and LGXGD motifs of the postulated active site. SPP (PSH3/IMP1) has a PS-like membrane topology and has protease activity. Although ectodomain shedding by substrates of PS/-secretase/SPP is a necessary prerequisite for subsequent proteolysis, the detailed molecular events involved in proteolysis of TM domains are not clear. As more -secretase substrates are discovered, related molecules will be examined for possible cleavage by PS-like proteases. Searches for YD and LGXGD motifs in genome sequences may also reveal additional PS-like proteases similar to SPP. Further biochemical characterization of these proteases will help us to elucidate the molecular mechanism of intramembrane proteolysis..

0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	13	The C. elegans genome encodes three presenilin genes, sel-12, hop-1 and spe-4 that are homologous to human PSEN1 and PSEN2. spe-4 is the most divergent member of the presenilin family and appears to have a specific role in spermatogenesis (Arduengo et al., 1998; L'Hernault and Arduengo, 1992). The two other presenilins are much more similar to the human homologs and are absolutely essential for signaling through the two C. elegans Notch-type receptors LIN-12 and GLP-1 (Levitan and Greenwald, 1995; Li and Greenwald, 1997; Westlund et al., 1999). The absence of both sel-12 and hop-1 genes leads to a completely penetrant lethal phenotype that resembles either a complete loss of GLP-1 or a complete loss of LIN-12 signaling [the exact phenotype depends on how the double mutants are constructed as both sel-12 and hop-1 have partial maternal effects (Westlund et al., 1999)]. On their own, mutations in hop-1 have no obvious phenotype, while mutations in sel-12 lead to an egg-laying defect (Egl) (Levitan and Greenwald, 1995; Westlund et al., 1999). sel-12 and hop-1 seem to have largely overlapping roles, as hop-1 can rescue the sel-12 Egl defect when expressed from a sel-12 promoter (Li and Greenwald, 1997; Westlund et al., 1999). Not only the sequence, but also the function of presenilins is evolutionarily conserved, as both human presenilins PSEN1 and PSEN2 can also rescue the sel-12 Egl defect when expressed under the control of appropriate promoters (Baumeister et al., 1997; Levitan et al., 1996)..
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	14	In order to understand more about the biological role of presenilins, we have been studying the sel-12 gene in C. elegans. Mutations in sel-12 were first identified for their ability to suppress a lin-12 gain-of-function mutation (Levitan and Greenwald, 1995). This suggests that sel-12 mutations reduce lin-12 signaling and that the SEL-12 protein normally facilitates lin-12 signaling (Levitan and Greenwald, 1995). However, mutations in sel-12 do not completely eliminate lin-12 signaling, presumably owing to residual presenilin activity supplied by hop-1 (Li and Greenwald, 1997; Westlund et al., 1999). Different levels of LIN-12 activity are required to control at least five post-embryonic signaling events (Eimer et al., 2002a). In sel-12 null mutants, only two of these are affected to a varying degree (Eimer et al., 2002a; Cinar et al., 2001). This indicates that the presenilin activity supplied by hop-1 is sufficient for most lin-12 signaling events and that some lin-12 signaling events appear to be more sensitive to presenilin dosage than others (Eimer et al., 2002a)..
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	15	To elucidate the function of the sel-12 gene further, one can study mutations that bypass the need for sel-12. Mutations in four genes, sel-10, spr-1, spr-2 and spr-5, have already been shown to suppress the sel-12 egg-laying defect. Mutations in sel-10 were first found in a screen for genes that suppress a weak lin-12 loss-of-function mutant (Hubbard et al., 1997). sel-10 is similar to the yeast gene CDC4, and acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the intracellular domains of LIN-12 and GLP-1 proteins for degradation (Gupta-Rossi et al., 2001; Hubbard et al., 1997). sel-10 mutations also weakly suppress mutations in sel-12, but do completely bypass the need for sel-12. In a screen similar to the one reported here, Wen et al. have identified four genes that strongly suppress the Egl defect of sel-12 (suppressors of presenilin) and have described the cloning and characterization of one of them, spr-2 (Wen et al., 2000). Mutations in spr-2 almost completely bypass the need for sel-12. The biochemical role of SPR-2 is presently unclear, but it may affect chromatin structure and/or transcription (Wen et al., 2000)..

0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	17	In this paper, we report the results of several screens for strong suppressors of sel-12 and the isolation of 25 independent mutations. These mutations lie in several of the same complementation groups identified by Wen et al. as well as in some additional genes, indicating that neither screen has reached saturation. We also report the cloning and characterization of two suppressor genes, spr-3 and spr-4, that code for C2H2 zinc-finger proteins similar to the transcriptional repressors REST/NRSF. spr-3 and spr-4 mutants bypass the need for sel-12 by upregulating the transcription of the other presenilin, hop-1. As two other presenilin suppressors that were also identified in this screen, spr-1 and spr-5, encode proteins of the CoREST/HDAC complex (Eimer et al., 2002b; Jarriault and Greenwald, 2002) that interacts with REST, we propose that the Spr proteins assemble into one or more repressor complexes that normally repress the hop-1 locus in the early larval stages. Mutations in components of these complexes remove a repressor activity leading to a higher basal level of hop-1 presenilin activity..

These mutations lie in several of the same complementation groups identified by Wen et al. as well as in some additional genes, indicating that neither screen has reached saturation. We also report the cloning and characterization of two suppressor genes, spr-3 and spr-4, that code for C2H2 zinc-finger proteins similar to the transcriptional repressors REST/NRSF. spr-3 and spr-4 mutants bypass the need for sel-12 by upregulating the transcription of the other presenilin, hop-1.

However, on staged northern blots (see Fig. 2, Fig. 4A) and by RT-PCR on each developmental stage, only a single transcript, similar in length to yk64e9, could be detected (data not shown). In the process of sequencing the cDNAs, we also discovered a sequencing error in the genomic sequence from the cosmids F46H6 and C07A12 near the 5' end of spr-3, which put the first ATG out of frame (data not shown). This error was communicated to the C. elegans sequencing consortium and the genomic sequence has been updated. To determine the 5' end of the spr-3 transcript we performed PCR on a random primed cDNA library, kindly provided by Bob Barstead, using SL1 and SL2 forward primers (Spieth et al., 1993) and gene specific reverse primers (RB1080 CATACTTGACGGCATCATCGG; RB1079 CATCTGCTTCTCGCTCGAGAATCG).

ORFs on F46H6 are named and indicated by lines with arrows. Two spr-3 alleles generated by UV/TMP mutagenesis are large rearrangements. byDf1 deletes 31 kb of the cosmid F46H6, while by136 is a complex rearrangement that affects the promoter of C07A12.5. By injecting a series of restriction fragments, subclones and PCR products (see thick bars below F46H6) the minimal rescuing region was narrowed down to a 4.1 kb fragment (using RB950 CAGTATACAACTACGCTCTCC and RB951 ATCCAACACTCCTAAGTCCG), which contains only the C07A12.5 open reading frame.

Twenty out of the 25 mutations fall into only three complementation groups, defined by the alleles by108, by105 and by101. by101 was mapped to the right arm of chromosome I between unc-101 and unc-59 very near to unc-59, by105 was mapped genetically to the cluster on LGI between daf-8 and unc-55, while by108 was mapped to LGX between dpy-23 and lon-2 (see Table S1 at http://dev.biologists.org/supplemental/)..

Wen et al. mapped spr-1, spr-2, spr-3 and spr-4 to chromosomes V, IV, X and I, respectively. By complementation analysis with spr-3(ar209) and spr-4(ar208) (kindly provided by I. Greenwald, New York), we determined that by108 and by105 were alleles of spr-3 and spr-4, respectively. Consequently, we defined a new gene, spr-5, with the reference allele by101 (Eimer et al., 2002b). We examined the remaining five suppressor mutations found in our screens to see if they could be spr-1 or spr-2 alleles. None of the remaining five alleles had a mutation in the coding region of spr-2. However, by133 showed close linkage to dpy-11 on chromosome V and mapped to a similar region as spr-1 (see Table S1 at http://dev.biologists.org/supplemental/). spr-1 has recently been cloned (Jarriault and Greenwald, 2002) and we have found that by133 contains a mutation in this gene (Eimer et al., 2002b). The remaining four suppressor mutations have not been pursued in detail, but by complementation tests define three additional genes (data not shown). The fact that we found no spr-2 alleles and that we have found mutations in genes not identified by (Wen et al., 2000) indicates that saturation was not reached in either screen. The rest of this paper will report the cloning and characterization of two of the major complementation groups, spr-3 and spr-4..

Almost all sel-12 animals retain too many eggs in the uterus (an egg-laying defective or Egl phenotype) and these eggs hatch and develop within the mother, leading to a terminal `bag of worms' (Bag) phenotype (Fig. 1). The Egl defect severely limits the number of progeny generated (Table 1). Mutations in spr-3 completely suppress all aspects of the sel-12 egg-laying defect (Fig. 1). sel-12(ar171) spr-3 double mutants also display a nearly wild-type brood size (Table 1), indicating that spr-3 mutations restore normal egg-laying behavior and normal fertility. They also respond to neurotransmitters that stimulate egg laying (data not shown). spr-4 mutations, however, lead to a less completely penetrant suppression of the sel-12 phenotype and in all alleles, 5% of spr-4; sel-12(ar171) animals still become Egl (Fig. 1). This Egl phenotype is similar to sel-12(ar171), except that no Pvl animals are seen. This suggests that in these remaining Egl animals at least part of the sel-12 phenotype was rescued. However, those spr-4; sel-12(ar171) double mutant animals that do lay eggs display a nearly wild-type brood size (Table 1). Mutations in spr-3 and spr-4 also suppress all other sel-12 alleles tested (ar131, by125, lg1401 for spr-3, and ar131 for spr-4; Table 1 and data not shown). On their own, mutations in spr-3 and spr-4 have no obvious phenotype, except perhaps a slightly reduced brood size (Table 1; data not shown). For spr-3, we examined a clear null mutation (by131 also known as byDf1) in more detail. Surprisingly even this mutation, a 31 kb deletion that deletes five genes including spr-3 and both its upstream and downstream neighbor (Fig. 2B), has no obvious phenotype (Table 1; data not shown), indicating that none of the deleted genes is essential. Taken together these results show that spr-3 and spr-4 are potent and specific suppressors of sel-12 that are able to suppress all aspects of the sel-12 phenotype..

Garriga, personal communication). We started sequentially injecting the sequenced cosmids from F02E8 to the right. spr-3 was completely rescued by the cosmid F46H6 but not by the partially overlapping cosmid C07A12 (Fig. 2B). We then injected a series of purified restriction fragments, subclones and PCR products from F46H6 (Fig. 2B). All injected products containing the entirety of the predicted gene C07A12.5 produced complete rescue of spr-3 (Fig. 2B, Table 1 and data not shown). The minimal rescuing fragment was narrowed down to 4.1 kb containing C07A12.5 as the only predicted open reading frame..

The only recognizable domains in SPR-3 are seven putative C2H2 zinc-finger and several regions that may act as nuclear localization signals (Fig. 3A,B). The spr-3 alleles ar209, by108, by110 and by137 are all amino acid to stop codon mutations at various positions in the protein (Fig. 3B). The by135 mutation is a single base pair deletion, which shifts frame after amino acid 183 and truncates the protein at 210 amino acids. The by109 mutation is a C596Y transition in the second cysteine of the sixth zinc finger, indicating that this finger is essential for SPR-3 function. by131 is a deletion of 31,069 bases from position 3052 of F46H6 to position 6698 of C07A12 with a single A base pair insertion. This mutation deletes F46H6.2/dgk-2, F46H6.4, F46H6.1/rhi-1, C07A12.5/spr-3 and part of C07A12.7, and is clearly null for spr-3 function (Fig. 2B). As by131 deletes several genes, we have renamed it byDf1. By a combination of PCR, Southern blotting and sequencing, we determined that there are no alterations in the coding sequence of by136. However, by136 has a complex promoter rearrangement in C07A12.5 (data not shown). Using northern analysis, a single transcript is detectable in by108, by109, by110, by135 and by137 lanes at nearly wild-type levels although no transcript is detectable for byDf1 and by136 (Fig. 2C) indicating that by136 is also null for spr-3 function..

If this were the case, then we would expect that most mutations that result in amino acid substitutions would have no phenotypic consequences. Consistent with this, only one out of eight spr-3 alleles is a missense mutation, and this mutation affects a conserved cysteine of one of the zinc fingers. SPR-3 contains three pairs of adjacent zinc fingers and one lone zinc finger separated by non-conserved linkers. Therefore, to analyze the zinc finger regions of the protein, we concatenated the sequences of just the zinc fingers, along with the short linkers between tandem fingers, and searched the databases for similarity. This sequence is similar to many C2H2 zinc-finger proteins and is most similar to members of the REST family of transcriptional repressors (Fig. 3C).

McCarter, personal communication). SPR-4 also has strong similarity (e=3x10 to 43) to C28G1.4 in C. elegans (NM 077098.1). Twenty-one of the first 34 amino acids are identical between SPR-4 and C28G1.4. This region is followed in both proteins by a highly acidic stretch suggesting that this region forms a functional domain (Fig. 5C). The central region of C28G1.4 does not resemble any other protein but C28G1.4 is 34% identical to SPR-4 in the N-terminal section from ZNF13 to the end of the protein and contains all zinc fingers in this region except ZNF15, suggesting that SPR-4 and C28G1.4 may have a related function (Fig. 5C). However, RNA interference by feeding (Kamath et al., 2001) of C28G1.4 has no obvious effects on the wild-type strain N2 nor does it influence the Egl defect of sel-12(ar171) and sel-12(ar131) (data not shown). dsRNAi against C28G1.4 also fails to produce any synthetic effect in either a spr-4(by105); sel-12(ar171) or a spr-4(by105) background (data not shown). These results may suggest that an RNAi effect was not induced by the bacterial feeding approach; however, RNAi by injection of purified double stranded RNA from yk356a2, a C28G1.4 cDNA, also induced no phenotype (Maeda et al., 2001). Interestingly, there is no C28G1.4 homolog present in the draft C. briggsae assembly, suggesting that C28G1.4 may have recently diverged from an ancestral spr-4 like gene or that this gene is under very low selective pressure or can be lost without phenotypic effects..

Surprisingly, hop-1 has a very dynamic expression. It is most strongly expressed in the adult stage, more weakly in the embryo and is almost undetectable in the L1 stage (Figs 6A,C). hop-1 expression slowly increases through the remaining larval stages..

As the egg-laying defect in sel-12 animals is due to developmental defects occurring in the mid-larval stages, the suppression of sel-12 by Spr genes could be explained by stage specific alterations in gene expression. To confirm this result, and to directly compare different strains, we prepared a northern blot with L1 RNA from N2, sel-12(ar171) and several Spr strains and probed it with hop-1. As the expression of hop-1 is lowest in the L1 stage, we reasoned that increased expression in this stage might be easiest to detect. We increased the amount of total RNA used from 5  microg/lane to 20  microg/lane because the expression of hop-1 in wild-type worms is near the detection level. We tested L1 RNA prepared from N2, sel-12(ar171), four spr-5 alleles, one spr-4 allele and three spr-3 alleles (Fig. 7). In all Spr strains tested, hop-1 is upregulated. This suggests that all Spr genes may use the same mechanism to bypass the requirement for sel-12. spr-4 upregulates hop-1 expression 11-fold, whereas spr-3 alleles upregulate hop-1 between four- and 12-fold (Fig. 7). These data were confirmed by separate experiments in which we looked at hop-1 expression in the L1 stage in: 1) all seven spr-3 alleles isolated in our screens; and 2) one spr-5 allele and two spr-3 alleles without sel-12 in the background. In all spr alleles, hop-1 was more strongly expressed than in the controls (see Figs S1 and S2 at http://dev.biologists.org/supplemental/)..

0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	83	  spr-3 and spr-4 do not suppress the synthetic lethality of hop-1; sel-12 double mutants If the Spr genes bypass the need for sel-12 by upregulating the expression of hop-1, then spr-3 and spr-4 mutations should not suppress the synthetic lethal phenotype induced by reducing both hop-1 and sel-12 activity. This is exactly what we find. RNAi by feeding of the hop-1 gene in a sel-12(ar171) spr-3(by108) strain or a spr-4(by105); sel-12(ar171) strain induces the same range of phenotypes as seen when one induces RNAi of hop-1 in sel-12(ar171) (Table 2) (Li and Greenwald, 1997). Most animals display a lethal phenotype (Emb, Lag, Ste), consistent with a strong reduction of lin-12 and/or glp-1 signaling, but those few animals that do produce progeny are Egl. This indicates that spr-3 and spr-4 mutations do not bypass the need for presenilins per se, but only for sel-12 and that this effect is dependent on the activity of hop-1. We confirmed this result by constructing hop-1; sel-12 spr-3 triple mutant strains (Table 3). Similar experiments with spr-4 have not been performed because of the genetic proximity of spr-4 and hop-1. We find that spr-3 does not affect the phenotype of hop-1; sel-12 double mutants as has also been shown for spr-1, spr-2 and spr-5 (Eimer et al., 2002b; Jarriault and Greenwald, 2002; Wen et al., 2000). Furthermore, 43% of all hop-1(lg1501)/dpy-5(e61) I; sel-12(ar171) spr-3(by108) animals with only one remaining copy of hop-1 and no functional sel-12 gene display an Egl phenotype (Table 3). As sel-12(ar171) spr-3(by108) animals are never Egl (see Fig. 1) this indicates that in a sel-12 spr-3 background hop-1 is haploinsufficient. In sel-12 spr-3 mutants, presenilin activity is very near the threshold necessary for correct egg laying and reducing hop-1 activity by half brings the worms below this threshold. Taken together, all of these results are consistent with spr-3 and spr-4 suppressing sel-12 by upregulating hop-1..

The different phenotypes may be explained by their different expression patterns. sel-12 is strongly and uniformly expressed, while hop-1 expression is dynamic and very low throughout most of the larval stages. Thus, in the absence of hop-1 expression, there is still enough of (sel-12) presenilin activity at all times of development and, consequently, hop-1 mutants have only a very mild phenotype.

Similarly, we have shown recently that SPR-1 and SPR-5 proteins interact, and that spr-5 upregulates hop-1 expression at the same developmental stages as mutations in spr-3 and spr-4 (Eimer et al., 2002b). This suggests that spr-1, spr-3, spr-4 and spr-5 all suppress sel-12 by upregulating hop-1, replacing one presenilin with another. Similarly, mutations in spr-2 genetically bypass the need for sel-12, but do not bypass the need for both sel-12 and hop-1 (Wen et al., 2000). Although hop-1 activity is required for the suppression mechanism, Wen et al. did not find evidence for hop-1 transcriptional de-repression (Wen et al., 2000). However, the stage specific de-repression of hop-1 transcription we have seen would not be detectable on a mixed-stage northern blot. Thus, we propose that spr-2 may also bypass the need for sel-12 by the same mechanism as spr-3, spr-4 and spr-5..

However, even in the suppressor strains, the absolute hop-1 transcript levels in the early larval stages are still much lower than in the adult stage. We believe that the stage-specific increase in hop-1 expression is sufficient to explain why spr-3 and spr-4 suppress sel-12. Even in a strong, putative null sel-12 mutant, there is sufficient HOP-1 protein in the larval stages to enable most lin-12-dependent developmental decisions to occur correctly. In sel-12 mutants, the ventral uterine/anchor cell decision, lateral inhibition in the vulval precursors and the sex myoblast/coelomocyte decision are not affected (Levitan and Greenwald, 1995), indicating that there is sufficient presenilin activity, provided by HOP-1, present in many cell types. In sel-12(ar131) even the cell fate is executed correctly in the vast majority of animals and in sel-12(ar171) it is executed correctly in some animals, while in a sel-12 hop-1 double mutants, 100% of animals have a defective vulval uterine connection (Cinar et al., 2001; Eimer et al., 2002a). This indicates that in sel-12 mutants the expression of hop-1 is almost sufficient for wild-type cell induction. Therefore, it is likely that small increases in hop-1 expression could be sufficient to compensate completely for the loss of sel-12 in all developmental decisions..

Presenilins are normally found as part of a high molecular weight complex (Capell et al., 1998; Li et al., 2000; Thinakaran et al., 1998; Yu et al., 1998). This complex is assembled in the ER and Golgi, and proteins that are not incorporated into this complex are not targeted to the cell membrane and are rapidly degraded (Ratovitski et al., 1997). Presenilins may be required in small amounts because the amount of other components of the complex are limiting for assembly (Edbauer et al., 2002). Consequently, it has been found that, in cell culture, presenilins cannot be overproduced (Thinakaran et al., 1996). Furthermore, as the presenilin complex is thought to have enzymatic activity, the levels of the complex necessary for its biochemical function may normally be in vast excess of what is required. Thus, even if the amount of the complex present at the cell membrane in spr; sel-12 double mutants should be slightly lower than the wild-type levels, the wild-type phenotype of the double mutants indicates that it suffices to ensure sufficient levels of lin-12 signaling..

We have several reasons to believe this is the case. First, the cell signaling events that lead to the cell induction and the correct alignment of the sex muscles, occur prior to the developmental changes (Cinar et al., 2001; Eimer et al., 2002a) and presenilin activity is presumably required at the time of signaling. Second, our initial experiments suggested that the relative expression of hop-1 is increased in the L1, L2 and L3 stages in both spr-3 and spr-4 mutants. We chose to pursue this further at the L1 stage because we thought the upregulation of hop-1 expression might be most obvious at this stage. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in cell culture that, once assembled, the high molecular weight presenilin complex is very stable over a long time period (Edbauer et al., 2002; Ratovitski et al., 1997). Finally, we have indications that the presenilin complex is necessary in small amounts and can persist for up to 24 hours in C. elegans because we see rescue of sex myoblast/coelomocyte cell-fate decision in hop-1;sel-12 double mutants with maternally provided hop-1 (Eimer et al., 2002a).

Although SPR-3 and SPR-4 do not have clear mammalian homologs, they may be performing a similar function to known transcriptional repressors. Both SPR-3 and SPR-4 resemble known transcriptional repressors, especially REST/NRSF (Re1 silencing transcription factor/neural-restrictive silencing factor) in different vertebrates. The C2H2 zinc-finger factor REST mediates repression of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells, by recruiting the co-repressor complexes Sin3 and CoREST (Humphrey et al., 2001). Both of these co-repressor complexes contain multiple proteins, including histone deacetylases, and presumably repress transcription in part by removing activating acetyl groups from histones H3 and H4 at the target locus. It is possible that SPR-3 and SPR-4 may also function by recruiting conserved co-repressor complexes to the hop-1 locus. Three other Spr genes, spr-1, spr-2 and spr-5, encode proteins similar to components of known co-repressors (Eimer et al., 2002b; Jarriault and Greenwald, 2002; Wen et al., 2000). SPR-2 is a member of the Nucleosome Assembly Protein (NAP) family and is most similar to the human oncogene SET (Wen et al., 2000). Human SET was purified as part of the INHAT (inhibitor of acetyltransferases) co-repressor complex, which helps to repress transcription by binding to histones and masking them from being acetyltransferase substrates for p300/CBP and PCAF (Seo et al., 2001). Recently, it has been shown that upregulation of SET also inhibits demethylation of methylated DNA and may integrate the epigenetic states of DNA and associated histones (Cervoni et al., 2002). In another paper, we have reported the identification and characterization of SPR-5 that encodes a polyamine oxidase-like protein most similar to a known component of the CoREST co-repressor complex (Eimer et al., 2002b). The core CoREST complex contains only six proteins (Hakimi et al., 2002). spr-1 encodes a homolog of the MYB domain-containing protein CoREST (Eimer et al., 2002b; Jarriault and Greenwald, 2002), an additional component of the CoREST co-repressor complex. We have shown that SPR-1 and SPR-5 interact biochemically in vitro and in vivo (Eimer et al., 2002b). This suggests that a similar complex is present in C. elegans and functions to repress hop-1 transcription. Interestingly, CoREST has been found to associate with at least two large, basic C2H2 zinc-finger proteins, ZNF217 and REST (You et al., 2001), and may be a general co-repressor complex that is recruited to different loci in different cell types by binding to a different C2H2 zinc-finger proteins. Recent work also suggests that CoREST may interact with components of the SWI-SNF complex (Battaglioli et al., 2002) and may be involved in silencing of chromosomal regions (Lunyak et al., 2002)..

The data now available on Spr gene function suggest that INHAT and CoREST complexes can be studied both genetically and biochemically in C. elegans. We suggest that through C. elegans genetics we may identify additional genes that interact with these complexes and we may help to elucidate their biological function..

However, apart from a role in early development, neither the normal function of the presenilins nor the mechanisms by which mutant proteins cause AD are well understood. We describe here the properties of a novel human interactor of the presenilins named ubiquilin. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) interaction, glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments, and colocalization of the proteins expressed in vivo, together with coimmunoprecipitation and cell fractionation studies, provide compelling evidence that ubiquilin interacts with both PS1 and PS2. Ubiquilin is noteworthy since it contains multiple ubiquitin-related domains typically thought to be involved in targeting proteins for degradation. However, we show that ubiquilin promotes presenilin protein accumulation. Pulse-labeling experiments indicate that ubiquilin facilitates increased presenilin synthesis without substantially changing presenilin protein half-life. Immunohistochemistry of human brain tissue with ubiquilin-specific antibodies revealed prominent staining of neurons. Moreover, the anti-ubiquilin antibodies robustly stained neurofibrillary tangles and Lewy bodies in AD and Parkinson's disease affected brains, respectively. Our results indicate that ubiquilin may be an important modulator of presenilin protein accumulation and that ubiquilin protein is associated with neuropathological neurofibrillary tangles and Lewy body inclusions in diseased brain..

The majority of AD cases are late-onset, appearing in people over the age of 65. However, a small percent (5%) of cases, termed early-onset, arise at an unusually young age, as early as the third decade of life. Molecular genetic analysis has linked early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) to the autosomal dominant inheritance of mutations in three genes: the ss-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and two homologous genes, presenilin-1 and -2 (PS1 and PS2) (Hardy 1997 ; Price et al. 1998 ). The mechanisms by which mutations in these three genes cause AD are unresolved..

The topology of presenilins is debatable, though the most widely drawn models show proteins that weave through the membrane eight times, with the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains and a large "loop" between transmembrane domains six and seven all oriented towards the cytoplasm (see Fig 1 A) (Haass and De Strooper 1999 ). Although both proteins share extensive sequence identity along their entire lengths, their NH2-terminal domains and the second half of their loops are highly divergent, suggesting that these unique regions could modulate different functions of the two presenilins. An examination of presenilin-linked FAD mutations mapped so far reveals that most are missense mutations in identical residues spread throughout the polypeptide in both presenilins, suggesting that the conserved residues are important for the function of the proteins..

Mutation of the Caenorhabditis elegans presenilin gene, sel-12, produces defects in vulva development linked to cell signaling defects involving Notch-based receptors (Levitan and Greenwald 1995 ; Haass and De Strooper 1999 ). Disruption of the Drosophila melanogaster presenilin gene results in embryonic lethality, with embryos displaying severe Notch-like phenotypes (Struhl and Greenwald 1999 ; Ye et al. 1999 ). Mammalian presenilins also play important roles in early development, as disruption of the mouse PS1 gene leads to death shortly after birth, with embryos displaying central nervous system defects together with abnormal patterning of the axial skeleton and spinal ganglia (Shen et al. 1997 ; Wong et al. 1997 ). Interestingly, PS1-/- mice can be rescued by a human transgenes containing FAD-linked mutations, indicating that the FAD mutations do not affect presenilin functions related to embryo development (Davis et al. 1998 ; Qian et al. 1998 ). In contrast, disruption of the mouse PS2 gene produces no obvious defects, but PS1/PS2 double knock-out mice die earlier at embryonic day 9.5 and, like PS1-/- mice, display severe misexpression of proteins involved in Notch signaling (Donoviel et al. 1999 ; Herreman et al. 1999 ). These results indicate that there is functional redundancy between PS1 and PS2; PS1 can compensate for PS2, but PS2 cannot compensate for PS1, at least during early mouse development..

In brain the proteins are more highly expressed in neurons than glia (Price et al. 1998 ). Knowledge of where presenilin proteins localize in cells is important for understanding their function. However, uncertainties exist regarding their precise subcellular localization. In neurons, endogenous PS1 and PS2 have been localized to the ER and to vesicular structures of the somatodentritic compartment and axons (Price et al. 1998 ; Haass and De Strooper 1999 ). When overexpressed, the proteins predominantly localize to the ER, the Golgi complex, and the nuclear envelope (Kovacs et al. 1996 ; Janicki and Monteiro 1997 ; Haass and De Strooper 1999 ). However, in nonneuronal cells, endogenous presenilins have been localized to the ER, Golgi complex, centrosomes, centromeres, and cell surface (Georgakopoulos et al. 1999 ; Haass and De Strooper 1999 ; Raina et al. 1999 ). It is not known to what extent these diverse locations reflect true sites of presenilin function..

Interestingly, some of these cellular functions are compromised or altered by the expression of PS genes containing FAD mutations. The presenilin proteins have been shown to play important roles in apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, cell cycle regulation, regulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, and cleavage of APP (Guo et al. 1997 ; Janicki and Monteiro 1997 , Janicki and Monteiro 1999 ; Cotman 1998 ; Mattson et al. 1998 ; Haass and De Strooper 1999 ; Katayama et al. 1999 ; Leissring et al. 1999 ; Niwa et al. 1999 ). Further clues regarding presenilin functions are emerging from a growing list of proteins with which presenilin interacts. Previously, we identified and characterized calmyrin, a newly discovered calcium-binding protein, which preferentially interacts with the PS2 loop and modulates presenilin-induced cell death (Stabler et al. 1999 ). Here, we describe a novel human presenilin-interacting protein, which we have named ubiquilin. We describe evidence that indicates ubiquilin modulates presenilin protein levels and is associated with neuropathological lesions such as NFTs and Lewy bodies in AD and PD affected brains..

The PS2 COOH-terminal 39-amino acids (residues K410 to I448) (see Fig 1a and Fig b) were used as bait to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library. Out of 107 primary yeast transformants, 50 clones were selected for further analysis based on growth in the absence of leucine and a substantial blue color change when grown on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-ss-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) plates. False positives were subsequently eliminated based on their interactions with negative-control baits, such as LexA alone, nuclear lamin B, and CENP-C centromere protein. Plasmid DNAs were isolated from clones that fulfilled the above requirements, and the DNA sequences of their inserts were determined and compared with the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ databases using the BLAST search program. Two of the interactors contained overlapping portions of the 3' end of a novel human transcript, which we named ubiquilin. Interaction of ubiquilin proteins with various PS1 and PS2 baits were quantified in liquid culture assays by the enzymatic conversion of o-nitrophenyl-ss-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) to o-nitrophenol and D-galactose by ss-galactosidase enzyme encoded by a Y2H reporter plasmid..

The PCR reactions were carried out according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer, using an AP1 adaptor to ligated human adult brain cDNA library as template and the Advantage cDNA Polymerase Mix (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). The procedure resulted in the isolation of 1,053 additional bps of the 5' sequence, with respect to the longest original Y2H clone. The full-length ubiquilin open reading frame (ORF) was subsequently obtained by sequencing a human expressed sequence tag (EST) clone (American Type Culture Collection), which provided an extra 108 bps of 5' sequence, including the ATG start codon, a Kozak consensus sequence, and an upstream in-frame stop codon. In addition, comparison of the sequence with the TIGR Tentative Human Consensus database returned another independent EST sequence (THC296552), which corroborated the ATG start codon..

After centrifugation, the pellet was discarded, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated from the remaining supernatant by adding rabbit antisera (preimmune, anti to PS2-NH2 terminus, or anti to PS2-Loop) and protein A to Sepharose CL-4B beads (Stabler et al. 1999 ).

Blots were probed with primary anti to ubiquilin-B antibodies, which were subsequently detected with 125I-protein A. Soluble, insoluble, Triton X-100 to soluble, and Triton X-100 to insoluble protein fractions of untransfected or PS2-transfected HeLa cells were prepared according to the procedure described previously (Stabler et al. 1999 ).

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	55	Identification of Human Ubiquilin, a Novel Interactor of the Presenilin Proteins A novel human protein, which we named ubiquilin, for a protein with ubiquitin-related protein domains that interacts with the presenilins, was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen (Y2H) for proteins that interact with the PS2 COOH-terminal sequence (Fig 1a and Fig b). Two overlapping clones encoding the COOH-terminal 203 and 218 residues of ubiquilin were isolated in the screen. To clone the entire ubiquilin ORF, 5' RACE was performed. This yielded 1,053 bps of additional upstream sequence, including an in-frame methionine codon located at the beginning of a ubiquitin-like (UB) domain. Conceptual translation from this methionine predicted a 559-amino acid protein. However, this methionine was unlikely to be the authentic start codon since translation from it produced a protein that was noticeably smaller, as seen by SDS-PAGE, than endogenous ubiquilin detected using pAb raised to the COOH-terminal 218 residues of ubiquilin (data not shown). Subsequent EST database searches and sequencing of putative overlapping clones yielded a clone with a longer 5' end, which included an upstream in-frame methionine codon (corresponding to a 595-amino acid protein). Several lines of evidence indicate that this methionine codon was the authentic start methionine of ubiquilin. (a) This start methionine contained a Kozak consensus sequence and an upstream in-frame stop codon. (b) Polypeptides translated from this start codon matched the endogenous ubiquilin protein in size, which was 66 kD in HeLa and other human cell types. (c) Mammalian overexpression of the complete ubiquilin ORF (see Fig 3, D to F), in vitro transcribed and translated ubiquilin in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (see Fig 3 G), and human ubiquilin protein synthesized in bacteria (see Fig 3 H) all generated 66-kD proteins. These data indicated that we had cloned the complete ubiquilin ORF and that the protein is probably not extensively modified in mammalian cells, since bacterially and eukaryotically expressed human ubiquilin proteins have similar molecular masses when separated by SDS-PAGE..

However, this methionine was unlikely to be the authentic start codon since translation from it produced a protein that was noticeably smaller, as seen by SDS-PAGE, than endogenous ubiquilin detected using pAb raised to the COOH-terminal 218 residues of ubiquilin (data not shown). Subsequent EST database searches and sequencing of putative overlapping clones yielded a clone with a longer 5' end, which included an upstream in-frame methionine codon (corresponding to a 595-amino acid protein). Several lines of evidence indicate that this methionine codon was the authentic start methionine of ubiquilin. (a) This start methionine contained a Kozak consensus sequence and an upstream in-frame stop codon. (b) Polypeptides translated from this start codon matched the endogenous ubiquilin protein in size, which was 66 kD in HeLa and other human cell types. (c) Mammalian overexpression of the complete ubiquilin ORF (see Fig 3, D to F), in vitro transcribed and translated ubiquilin in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (see Fig 3 G), and human ubiquilin protein synthesized in bacteria (see Fig 3 H) all generated 66-kD proteins. These data indicated that we had cloned the complete ubiquilin ORF and that the protein is probably not extensively modified in mammalian cells, since bacterially and eukaryotically expressed human ubiquilin proteins have similar molecular masses when separated by SDS-PAGE..

However, the longer ubiquilin clone interacted less strongly with the PS1 to COOH-terminal bait. This interaction nevertheless was still >12-fold compared with the negative-control baits (Fig 1 D). We also tested whether ubiquilin would interact with portions of the loop regions of the presenilins (Fig 1a and Fig b) that we had used in another Y2H study (Stabler et al. 1999 ). Interestingly, the near full-length ubiquilin construct also interacted well with both PS2 and PS1 loop sequences, and, surprisingly, the interaction was approximately twice as strong as with the PS2 to COOH-terminal bait (Fig 1 D). This suggested that two separate regions within the presenilin proteins could interact with ubiquilin..

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	65	Ubiquilin Contains Ubiquitin-related Protein Domains and Is a Member of a Highly Conserved Gene Family The complete ubiquilin ORF consists of 595 residues, with a sequence rich in glutamines and serines, 10.9% and 11.1%, respectively, but lacking any cysteines (Fig 4). The protein has a calculated isoelectric point (pI) of 4.97 and is predicted to be soluble, based on having a high hydrophilic profile using MacVector 6.5 software (Oxford Molecular Group; data not shown). Currently known protein structural motifs residing within ubiquilin include an NH2-terminal UB domain and a COOH-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, both of which have been implicated in targeting and degradation of proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The predicted ubiquilin protein also contains numerous regularly spaced asparagine-proline (Asn-Pro) repeats of unknown function (Fig 4). When first sequenced, no apparent mammalian homologue for ubiquilin had been deposited in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ databases. However, there was significant homology to several full-length genes of unknown function: the C. elegans F15C11.2 gene (36% identical) and two related genes in Arabidopsis thaliana (34 and 35% identical). In addition, the protein had weak homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DSK2 gene (31% identical), which can suppress a KAR1 defect (Biggins et al. 1996 ). KAR1 is an essential gene involved in the duplication of the yeast microtubule organizing center known as the spindle pole body. Interestingly, ubiquilin homology to DSK2 was primarily confined to the UB and UBA domains. However, since both UB and UBA domains are present in many other proteins, it is uncertain whether ubiquilin and DSK2 are true orthologs..

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	68	At about the time the ubiquilin sequence was deposited in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ, a Xenopus laevis protein involved in inhibiting cyclin A to protein degradation, called XDRP1, and having 60% identity to ubiquilin had just been submitted (Funakoshi et al. 1999 ). Since then, two Mus musculus proteins that are thought to interlink integrin-associated proteins with the vimentin cytoskeleton, called PLIC-1 and PLIC-2 (84 and 69% identical, respectively) (Wu et al. 1999 ), and human Chap1 protein (renamed ubiquilin 2; 79% identical), which binds Hsp70-like Stch and can complement a DSK2 yeast mutant (Kaye et al. 2000 ), have been described. The high degree of homology among these protein sequences can be seen when aligned by the MacVector 6.5 ClustalW protein alignment program (Fig 4). This comparison revealed that the human, mouse, and Xenopus sequences are more closely related to one another than the C. elegans, A. thaliana, and S. cerevisiae sequences, as would be expected for higher eukaryotes. The former group of proteins all shared extensive homology across the entire length of the ubiquilin polypeptide. The four regions of highest homology include the UB and UBA domains and two stretches rich in Asn-Pro repeats (residues G157 to P326 and P375 to P482) located between the two ubiquitin-related domains. Differences in the divergent regions are instructive, especially the insert between residues L485 to T527 in Chap1, which is conserved in PLIC-2 but missing in ubiquilin, PLIC-1, and XDRP1. Based on the homology between human and mouse sequences, it appears that ubiquilin is more closely related to PLIC-1, whereas Chap1 is more closely related to PLIC-2. Collectively, the proteins are likely to be members of a related multigene family, since at least two independent genes are known to exist in humans, mice, and A. thaliana..

Interestingly, slower migrating forms of both presenilins were much more tightly bound than the full-length forms. Whether the slower migrating forms are more ubiquitinated, extensively modified, or merely hydrophobic aggregates is not known. As expected, GST alone (Fig 5A and Fig B, lane L) did not bind either presenilin. No other region of ubiquilin tested was able to pull-down either of the presenilins, indicating that binding of presenilin to ubiquilin is mediated by sequences spanning the UBA domain and the COOH-terminal tail.

PS2-transfected HeLa cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with two different anti-PS2 specific antibodies, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti to ubiquilin-B antibodies. Ubiquilin protein coimmunoprecipitated with both of the anti-PS2 antibodies, one raised against the loop and the other to the NH2-terminal sequences, but did not coimmunoprecipitate when the preimmune sera was used (Fig 5 C). Additional verification of ubiquilin binding to PS2 was obtained in cell fractionation studies. Untransfected and PS2-transfected HeLa cells were fractionated either in the absence or presence of Triton X-100 detergent into soluble and insoluble fractions. Equivalent amounts of the fractions were then immunoblotted to determine the amount of ubiquilin protein in the two fractions. In untransfected cells, almost all of the ubiquilin protein was present in the soluble fraction, independent of detergent treatment (Fig 5 D, lanes S- and S+). This is consistent with the predicted hydrophilic nature of ubiquilin protein. However, in PS2-transfected cells, 30% more ubiquilin protein separated with the pellet fraction in the absence of detergent treatment (Fig 5 F, lane P). This change in solubility is likely a consequence of ubiquilin binding to overexpressed membrane-bound PS2, which also fractionated in the insoluble membrane-containing pellet fraction (Fig 5 E, lane P-).

Both antisera detected endogenous and overexpressed 66-kD ubiquilin polypeptides, which were not detected by the preimmune sera (Fig 3 D). Although one antiserum reacted with an unknown protein of 55 kD (Fig 3 E), this reactivity was subsequently removed by affinity purification of the antibody (Fig 3 F). Immunofluorescence staining of ubiquilin within cells was performed with the specific anti-ubiquilin antibodies. Compared with the preimmune sera (Fig 6A and Fig D), both antibodies revealed similar staining patterns (Fig 6B and Fig E). Indirect immunofluorescence, as well as laser confocal microscopy, revealed endogenous intracellular localization of ubiquilin in HeLa cells to both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig 6B, Fig E, and Fig G). In some cells, endogenous ubiquilin staining was stronger in the nucleus (Fig 6 E, arrowheads). Furthermore, in a small subset of cells, ubiquilin within the cytoplasm was localized to punctate structures (Fig 6B and Fig E, arrows). The frequency of these structures dramatically increased upon overexpression of full-length untagged ubiquilin (Fig 6C and Fig F). To corroborate the anti-ubiquilin staining pattern, we performed additional localization studies on myc- and GFP-tagged ubiquilin proteins in HeLa cells (Fig 2 IV, O and N, respectively). Overexpressed myc-tagged ubiquilin stained with anti-myc mAb exhibited the same intracellular structures (Fig 6 I) as overexpressed wild-type ubiquilin (Fig 6C and Fig F). Finally, the same fluorescent staining pattern was reproduced upon overexpression of GFP-ubiquilin (Fig 6 H). Since the GFP-ubiquilin image in Fig 6 H was captured from live and unfixed cells without antibodies, this established that the anti-ubiquilin structures seen previously were not artifacts of the paraformaldehyde fixation or immunofluorescence staining procedures..

Indeed, there was a dramatic change in ubiquilin staining in HeLa cells coexpressing either PS1 or PS2 and ubiquilin, resulting in almost complete colocalization of the presenilin and ubiquilin intracellular staining patterns, as seen by laser confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig 7A and Fig B). Careful examination of the colocalized proteins revealed ubiquilin staining to be punctate, whereas presenilin staining could be traced to an ER-like pattern. Particularly striking was colocalization of ubiquilin with irregularly shaped presenilin-enriched structures within the cytoplasm of overexpressing cells. In contrast, there was little colocalization in the nucleus where ubiquilin, but not presenilin, staining could be found..

In the first, PS2(C), the 39-amino acid COOH-terminal domain was deleted (Fig 1 A, arrowhead), whereas in the second, PS2(LC), the large hydrophilic loop and all sequences downstream were deleted (Fig 1 A, arrow). When expressed in HeLa cells, PS2(C) still colocalized with ubiquilin (Fig 7 C), presumably since the PS2 loop region that remained could bind ubiquilin, as suggested by the strong interaction between the two in Y2H assays (Fig 1 D). However, once the hydrophilic loop region and COOH terminus were both removed, PS2(LC) no longer colocalized with ubiquilin (Fig 7 D), suggesting that the NH2 terminus and the first six transmembrane domains of PS2 do not contain additional ubiquilin binding sites.

Treatment of mock-transfected and PS2-transfected HeLa cells with proteasome inhibitors lactacystin (20  microM) or MG-132 (40  microM), as expected, increased the overall amount of ubiquitinated proteins in cells (Fig 8 A, lanes 2 and 3, 5 and 6, and 8 and 9 versus lanes 1, 4, and 7, respectively). However, these conditions did not markedly increase PS2 protein levels (Fig 8 B, lanes 4 to 6). Remarkably, coexpression of ubiquilin with PS2 caused a substantial (>10-fold) increase in PS2 protein accumulation (Fig 8 B, lanes 7 to 9) compared with overexpression of PS2 alone (Fig 8 B, lanes 4 to 6). This effect was independent of treatment with lactacystin or MG-132, as it also occurred just as robustly in cells not treated with the proteasome inhibitors. Particularly striking was the increased accumulation in SDS-PAGE gels of full-length uncleaved PS2 protein (Fig 8 B, arrowhead) and higher molecular weight complexes that PS2 forms. Increasing the amount of transfected ubiquilin plasmid DNA, whereas maintaining constant levels of transfected PS2 plasmid DNA, revealed a dose-dependent effect by ubiquilin on PS2 accumulation within the cells (Fig 8 E, lanes 1 to 5). This effect was specific for ubiquilin expression, since cotransfection of increasing amounts of GFP plasmid DNA with PS2 did not increase PS2 protein accumulation (Fig 8 F, lanes 1 to 5). The blot in Fig 8 E was exposed for a shorter time than that in Fig 8 F to optimally illustrate the subtle changes in PS2 protein levels. In these experiments, we routinely observed the accumulation of full-length PS2 protein, but not the endoproteolytic cleaved forms of the protein (Haass and De Strooper 1999 ). In fact, recent reports have indicated that cleavage of presenilins is not essential for biological function of the presenilins, namely by its ability to rescue PS activity in C. elegans (Jacobsen et al. 1999 ; Steiner et al. 1999 ). The absence of detectable endoproteolytic cleaved forms of PS2 is more clearly illustrated in Fig 8 G, which shows that an antibody specific for PS2-loop sequences downstream of the proposed endoproteolytic cleavage site recognized the same 54 kD and higher PS2 species (as the PS2 NH2-terminal specific antibody). Interestingly, though ubiquilin caused a dose-dependent increase in presenilin accumulation, it did not alter the accumulation levels of various other endogenous HeLa proteins, such as lamin B, calreticulin, calnexin, BiP, and -tubulin (Fig 8 H). Similar experiments repeated with PS1 indicated that ubiquilin also promoted a dose-dependent increase in PS1 protein accumulation in HeLa cells (data not shown)..

The former was raised against ubiquilin polypeptides that were devoid of the UB domain, whereas the latter was raised against ubiquilin polypeptides lacking the UBA domain as well (Fig 2 III, B and C, respectively). Compared with the preimmune sera, which showed no specific staining (Fig 10A and Fig C), both antibodies strongly stained neurons with little, if any, staining of glia (Fig 10B, Fig D, and Fig E). In general, the anti to ubiquilin-C antibody stained neurons with greater clarity and intensity. As with cultured cells, anti-ubiquilin staining in neurons was to the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In addition, there is clear evidence for ubiquilin staining within long axonal processes (Fig 10 D). Interestingly, neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) from AD affected brains seemed to stain more intensely compared with control neurons (Fig 10 E and F). Moreover, examination of ubiquilin staining in brains afflicted with PD (not shown) and diffuse LB disease revealed robust staining of Lewy bodies (Fig 10 H)..

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	100	Here, we describe a novel human presenilin-interacting protein named ubiquilin. Y2H interaction, GST pull-down experiments, coimmunoprecipitation studies, changes in the cellular fractionation of proteins, and colocalization of the proteins expressed in vivo provide compelling evidence that ubiquilin and the presenilins interact with one another. Ubiquilin is an important protein because it contains multiple ubiquitin-related domains typically thought to be involved in targeting proteins for degradation, yet ubiquilin promotes increased presenilin protein accumulation. Moreover, ubiquilin is highly expressed in neurons of human brain and is associated with NFTs and Lewy bodies of AD and PD brains, respectively..

By conducting pulse-chase experiments, we found that ubiquilin induced an increase in presenilin protein maturation, but did not dramatically affect presenilin protein turnover. The net effect over time from increased presenilin protein synthesis and undisturbed turnover rate would eventually lead to an elevation of the intracellular pool of presenilin proteins. This modulation of presenilin levels by ubiquilin may have important consequences to cellular functions, as presenilins have been linked to various biological processes, including Notch signaling, calcium regulation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, unfolded-protein response, as well as APP-associated gamma secretase activity (see Introduction)..

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	104	It will be interesting to determine the precise mechanism by which ubiquilin induces increased presenilin protein synthesis. Ubiquilin could increase presenilin synthesis by simply increasing presenilin transcription, increasing presenilin translation, or facilitating correct polypeptide folding, maturation, and intracellular targeting of the polytopic transmembrane presenilin protein. Based on its various properties, we are especially intrigued by the possibility that ubiquilin may act as a molecular chaperone. (a) Studies of the Xenopus ubiquilin homologue, XDRP1, have suggested that ubiquilin can act posttranscriptionally like a molecular chaperone and prevent degradation of in vitro translated cyclin A protein (Funakoshi et al. 1999 ). (b) Chap1 (ubiquilin 2) has been shown to bind Stch, an Hsp70-like protein (Kaye et al. 2000 ). In turn, many heat-shock proteins have been shown to function as molecular chaperones, preventing protein aggregation and protein degradation (Warrick et al. 1999 ; Krobitsch and Lindquist 2000 ). (c) Recent evidence has linked ubiquilin proteins to the proteasome (Kleijnen et al. 2000 ). Meanwhile, the 19S regulatory subunit of the 26S proteasome (the degradation complex for ubiquitin-tagged proteins) has been shown to possess protein-unfolding activity (Braun et al. 1999 ). (d) Indirect evidence that ubiquilin may aid in presenilin protein folding or targeting comes from our observation that the presenilin construct PS2(LC), with deletions of both the loop and COOH-terminal ubiquilin-interaction sites (as demonstrated by Y2H assays and lack of colocalization with ubiquilin within cells), frequently accumulated into large cytoplasmic aggregates. In contrast, presenilin molecules, which contained ubiquilin interaction sites, rarely formed large protein aggregates. The connection between aggregate accumulation and loss of ubiquilin interaction may be entirely coincidental. However, the possibility that the two are interconnected cannot be discounted. Finally, presenilins proteins have themselves been linked to molecular chaperones of the ER, which are involved in the unfolded-protein response (Katayama et al. 1999 ; Niwa et al. 1999 )..

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	106	Another mechanism by which ubiquilin might increase presenilin accumulation is to alter presenilin degradation rates, especially that of the ubiquitinated forms of presenilins. In fact, a recent report by Kleijnen et al. 2000 found evidence that overexpression of human ubiquilin proteins, hPLIC-1 (ubiquilin 1) and hPLIC-2 (ubiquilin 2), interfered with ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 and IkB. Although we did not find any significant change in the turnover rate of the major 54-kD PS2 polypeptide species (corresponding to full-length PS2), we cannot exclude the possibility that certain ubiquitinated forms of presenilins may have altered turnover rates. The ubiquitinated forms of presenilins migrated as a smear on the SDS-PAGE gels, which made quantification of the turnover rates of these species difficult. It will be important in future studies to determine if ubiquilin is involved in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of presenilins..

This sequence was both necessary and sufficient to bind PS1 and PS2 in vitro. The UBA domain is a recently recognized motif present in one or two copies in a variety of proteins involved in the ubiquitin/proteasome folding/degradation pathway, UV excision repair, and phosphorylation (Hofmann and Bucher 1996 ). The UBA domain consists of 55 total residues of which 45 appear to be core residues. 15 of the core residues are extremely well conserved, suggesting they may be important for determining the overall structure of the domain. Through nuclear magnetic resonance, the structure of the COOH-terminal UBA domain of the human DNA repair protein HHR23A (RAD23 homologue) has been determined. It is a compact three-helix bundle with an exposed hydrophobic surface predicted to be involved in protein to protein interactions (Dieckmann et al. 1998 ). The strong binding of the ubiquilin UBA domain to presenilins may be facilitated by similar protein to protein interactions. It will be important to determine if sequence variation of the UBA domain in different proteins influences binding specificity to different target proteins..

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	110	In vitro binding assays indicated that the UB domain in the NH2-terminal portion of ubiquilin was not required for binding presenilins. Although this domain shares high homology to the conserved 76-amino acid ubiquitin polypeptide, it is unlikely to be involved in covalent linkage to lysine residues of target proteins, since it lacks the obligate COOH-terminal glycine residue required for cleavage and conjugation. Another possibility could be that the UB domain is modified by conjugation by either ubiquitin or other small ubiquitin-like proteins (e.g., SUMO, NEDD8, etc.) to its lysine group (or groups) forming ubiquitin-conjugates (Pickart 1998 ). This is also unlikely to occur, as ubiquilin immunoblots did not show the expected ladder of ubiquitin-conjugated bands. Therefore, the UB domain may play a role in some other function. For example, in yeast RAD23 and its human homologues (HHR23A and HHR23B), the UB domains are involved in binding subunits of the proteasome, whereas in XDRP1, the UB domain is necessary for binding cyclin A. Clearly, insight into ubiquilin's function will emerge from an understanding of protein to protein interactions and the roles of its different domains..

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	112	Using a combination of immunological and GFP-tagging approaches, we have demonstrated that ubiquilin is localized to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in HeLa cells. The intensity of nuclear staining was variable, with some nuclei staining very brightly. The variability may be related to cell cycle changes of cyclin A (a protein to which ubiquilin's homologue XDRP1 has been shown to interact) levels within the nucleus. The cytoplasmic distribution of ubiquilin was also variable. In untransfected cells, endogenous ubiquilin had a fine punctate appearance, with hints of association to a network-like pattern, possibly the ER. In some of these cells, ubiquilin accumulated in larger spherical structures throughout the cytoplasm, whose number and size were variable. Upon ubiquilin overexpression, the cells formed even larger and more numerous ubiquilin-containing structures. Under confocal microscopy, the ubiquilin staining pattern colocalized almost perfectly with the presenilin staining pattern. Considering that the two presenilin interaction sites (COOH terminus and loop domains) both face the cytoplasm according to the predicted topology of presenilins in membranes, it is not surprising that ubiquilin colocalized with ER membrane-bound presenilin. Still, many other proteins have also been shown to interact with these two domains of presenilins. Clearly, understanding the dynamics of the different protein to protein interactions should provide clues regarding presenilin functions. A study of mouse PLIC-1 and PLIC-2 suggested an involvement in linking integrins via integrin-associated proteins to the vimentin cytoskeleton (Wu et al. 1999 ). We have not observed any significant staining of ubiquilin to the cell periphery and do not know if this is in any way related to the lack of expression of particular integrin-associated proteins or integrins in HeLa cells. Nevertheless, it is interesting that vimentin and presenilins have been linked to one another in aggresomes, structures involved in the cellular response to misfolded proteins (Johnston et al. 1998 ). Moreover, recent evidence indicates that aggresomes are involved in the recruitment of the proteasome Hsp70 and chaperones (Garcia-Mata et al. 1999 ), which circumstantially suggests a mechanism by which ubiquilin could be associated with proteins of the misfolded protein response..

First, presenilin proteins are thought to be ubiquitinated, since treatment with proteasome inhibitors cause the accumulation of large complexes, which migrate in SDS gels in a manner consistent with modification by ubiquitin (Kim et al. 1997 ; Fraser et al. 1998 ; Honda et al. 1999 ). Second, it is well known that ubiquitin immunoreactivity is strongly associated with the NFTs and senile plaques of AD, hallmark lesions of AD pathology (Mori et al. 1987 ; Perry et al. 1987 ). The strong ubiquilin immunoreactivity associated with NFTs and Lewy bodies is intriguing, considering that these lesions are known to contain misfolded proteins. At present, our results do not provide clues as to whether ubiquilin is acting in a causative role or as an end result of association with misfolded and accumulated proteins.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Most of the highly publicised advances in the genetics of Alzheimer's disease have concerned those very rare families with autosomal dominant forms of the disease, so-called familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) kindred, in which 50% of each generation, regardless of gender, succumb to Alzheimer's disease, usually by early mid-life (reviewed by Selkoe, 1999). The identification of causative mutations within the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) has probably overinflated the public's perception of the role of genes in causing the far more common forms of Alzheimer's disease that do not show autosomal dominant transmission. Yet, it is important to be able to recognise FAD because it is possible to offer such kindreds definitive genetic counselling, provided that the causative mutation can be identified. Furthermore, a study by Campion et al (1999) suggests that FAD may occur at a frequency of around 40 per 100 000 persons at risk, which implies that there are some 600 affected individuals to be found in England and Wales, a number that suggests that a psychiatrist or neurologist will encounter an individual from a FAD pedigree at some time in their working life..

GENETIC COUNSELLING AND... RECOMMENDATIONS Clinical Implications and... ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   The function of the psychiatrist is straight-forward. The first step is to confirm that the diagnosis is actually one of Alzheimer's disease and not one of the other, often familial, dementias such as Huntington's disease, frontal-temporal dementias, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Next, the clinician should take as detailed a family history as possible in order to try to determine whether the sufferer comes from a pedigree with autosomal dominant FAD: the occurrence of numerous individuals with early-onset disease ( < 55 years) in several generations is highly suggestive. The presence of many affected individuals in one generation may also raise suspicion because it should not be forgotten that early death from other causes might prevent manifestation of the disorder in carriers of a disease gene. In practice, we recommend that families containing three members with a history of early-onset Alzheimer's disease occurring before the age of 60 years should, if they request advice, be referred to a clinical geneticist. Some forms of FAD linked to PSEN2 mutations occur after the age of 65 years, and so the psychiatrist should have a low threshold for discussing a pedigree with a clinical geneticist..

Probably pathogenic mutations were found in the PSEN1 gene in 19 families, mutations within the APP gene in another 5 and no mutations in the PSEN1, PSEN2 or APP genes in the remaining 10 families. Thus, individuals from FAD pedigrees need to be informed that there is a 30% chance that, with the current state of our knowledge, no causative mutation will be found. If no mutation is found then, if the pedigree is strongly suggestive of an autosomal dominant disorder, the geneticist may choose to go on to search for mutations in genes associated with similar conditions   prion protein (PrP) in CJD and tau in frontal temporal dementias, for example. Yet another factor to consider is that there has been one report of apparent non-penetrance of a PSEN1 mutation in a healthy 68-year-old member of a FAD pedigree (Rossor et al, 1996). Notwithstanding these caveats, in the absence of any preventive treatment, the take-up for predictive testing is likely to be low, as has been the case in Huntington's disease (Binedell et al, 1998)..

The large Rotterdam study suggests that the risk at age 55 years of developing dementia in the following 35 years is 0.26 for a woman and 0.15 for a man (Ott et al, 1998). In this study 73% of dementia was wholly or partially attributable to Alzheimer's disease. The large continuing Framingham study yields somewhat lower lifetime risks of Alzheimer's disease after the age of 65 years: 6.3% for men and 12% for women, with a corresponding risk for all dementia of 10.9% and 19%, respectively (Seshadri et al, 1997). Many epidemiological studies suggest that women are at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. The reasons for this are not clear, but increased longevity compared to men, increased survival with the disease and some increase in intrinsic vulnerability probably all play a part..

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a protein with roles in lipid metabolism and tissue repair. Its primary site of biosynthesis is the liver, but the second major site of synthesis is the brain. Like APP, the synthesis of apoE is up-regulated after the nervous system has been damaged. There are three commonly occurring polymorphic forms of apoE, known as apoE2, apoE3 and apoE4, which originate from the APOE 2, APOE 3 and APOE 4 alleles of the gene. The key observation, originally made by Strittmatter et al (1993), is that the frequency of APOE 4 in patients with Alzheimer's disease (namely 0.3-0.5) is greater than the APOE 4 frequency of 0.1-0.15 in age-matched or population controls. Some studies suggest that the APOE 2 allele is under-represented in Alzheimer's disease and may, by inference, be protective (reviewed by Farrer et al, 1997). Consistent with this idea is the finding that healthy centenarians have a higher APOE 2 frequency than general population controls (Schachter et al, 1994; Kehoe et al, 1999)..

For APOE 4 heterozygotes the last onset of Alzheimer's disease was at 99 years, with four long-term survivors. The last onset of dementia in individuals without the APOE 4 allele was at age 95 years, with 31 surviving free of dementia for a combined total of 100 years thereafter.

It seems that even individuals with the APOE 4/APOE 4 genotype have, on average, a greater than 50% chance of escaping the disease. Therefore, APOE genotyping currently has no role in predicting the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease..

The data show that whereas the demonstration of one or more APOE 4 allele in a person suspected of suffering with dementia slightly increases the accuracy of a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, the absence of an APOE 4 allele has little value in either endorsing or refuting a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

These issues include not only whether to test, but how to counsel patients and issues regarding confidentiality and consent, research ethics and concerns regarding insurance (Tunstall  and  Lovestone, 1999).

A proteolytic activity called -secretase cleaves APP in the transmembrane domain and is required for Ass generation. Aberrant -secretase cleavage of APP underlies the majority of early onset, familial AD. -Secretase resides in a large multi-protein complex, of which Presenilin, Nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2 are four essential components. Thus, identifying components and pathways by which the -secretase activity is regulated is crucial to understanding the mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis, and may provide new diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets. Here we describe the generation of Drosophila that act as living reporters of -secretase activity in the fly eye. In these reporter flies the size of the eye correlates with the level of endogenous -secretase activity, and is very sensitive to the levels of three genes required for APP -secretase activity, presenilin, nicastrin and aph-1. Thus, these flies provide a sensitized system with which to identify other components of the -secretase complex and regulators of its activity. We have used these flies to carry out a screen for mutations that suppress -secretase activity and have identified a small chromosomal region that contains a gene or genes whose products may promote -secretase activity..

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	5	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease of the brain that manifests as a decline of memory and other cognitive functions. A critical pathogenic event leading to AD is the progressive accumulation of amyloid plaques consisting primarily of the amyloid ss peptide (Ass) (reviewed in 1,2). Ass is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a type 1 transmembrane protein, through the action of two proteolytic activities known as ss-secretase and -secretase (Fig. 1A). The sequential action of ss-secretase, which cleaves APP in the extracellular domain, and -secretase, which cleaves APP within the transmembrane domain, generates Ass peptides and releases the intracellular domain of APP (AICD) from membrane association (Fig. 1A, reviewed in 1 to 4). -Secretase generates two major Ass peptides of 40 or 42 to 43 residues in length, differing in the length of their C-termini. The longer forms of Ass, Ass42 to 43, are prone to aggregate and are thought to seed the formation of amyloid plaques (reviewed in 3 to 5). Understanding how -secretase-mediated APP cleavage is achieved is crucial to understand AD pathogenesis. -Secretase also cleaves other signaling proteins within their transmembrane domains (reviewed in 6). One of the most notable ones is Notch, a key transmembrane receptor that plays important roles in cell to cell communication both during development and in adulthood (reviewed in 7). Cleavage of Notch by -secretase is essential for Notch function and this function of -secretase is evolutionarily conserved (6,7)..

Recent observations indicate that the activity of four proteins, Presenilin, Nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2, are necessary for -secretase activity (reviewed in 10). The human genome encodes two Presenilins, Presenilin 1 (PS1) and Presenilin 2 (PS2). Presenilins bind APP and probably provide the active catalytic core of -secretase or act as intimate cofactors (reviewed in 2,6,11 to 14). Mutations in PS1 and PS2 are associated with the majority of familial AD cases (4). Nicastrin is a transmembrane glycoprotein isolated via its ability to bind PS1 (15) and to promote Notch signaling in C. elegans (16). APH-1, a polytopic membrane protein originally identified as a regulator of Notch signaling in C. elegans (17,18), binds to Presenilins and Nicastrin (19 to 21). PEN-2, a small protein that spans the membrane twice, was also first identified as a regulator of Notch signaling in C. elegans (18). These four proteins, when coexpressed in S. cerevisiae, which lacks endogenous -secretase activity, are sufficient to create an active -secretase complex (22; reviewed in 10). This finding suggests that these four proteins are the minimal core components of the -secretase, although it does not exclude the possibility that factors in yeast may also contribute to formation of the active -secretase complex. These four proteins regulate the stability and maturation of each other in tissue culture (19 to 26). How this regulation occurs is unknown. It is also unknown if other signaling pathways regulate -secretase activity by modifying the assembly or activity of these proteins..

Positional cloning of familial AD genes resulted in identification of PS1 and PS2. Biochemical purification of PS1-associated proteins led to the identification of Nicastrin (reviewed in 3 to 5). Function-based in vivo genetic screens conducted in model systems such as C. elegans and Drosophila for phenotypes that are suggestive of an alteration in -secretase activity provide an important complementary strategy for identifying new genes regulating -secretase. For example, screens for C. elegans mutants with Notch-like or presenilin-like developmental defects identified the -secretase regulators aph-2 (nicastrin) (16), aph-1 and pen-2 (17,18). The advantage of the in vivo genetic approach is that it does not rely on direct physical binding to existing proteins such as Presenilins, and thus will not be limited by the low affinity or abundance of important interacting components. In addition, it has the potential to identify components of the regulatory pathways of -secretase activity that may not bind to Presenilin. Below, we describe a reporter that allows determination of the endogenous levels of -secretase activity in an easy to visualize, nonessential neuronal tissue, the adult fly eye. This reporter is designed to identify changes in -cleavage of APP. This is in contrast to previous C. elegans and Drosophila-based screens which used presenilin and Notch mutant phenotypes during development as surrogate markers (16 to 18).

The N-terminus of the protein has a cleavable signal sequence which is followed by a fragment of human APP just C-terminal to the ss-secretase cleavage site. The yeast transcription factor GAL4 is appended to the APP C-terminus. This protein, known as APP to GAL4, is targeted to the secretory pathway by the N-terminal signal sequence. Cotranslational cleavage of this signal sequence as APP is inserted into the membrane generates a protein that is C-terminal to the ss-secretase cleavage site. We specifically expressed APP to GAL4 in the eye under the control of the eye-specific GMR promoter (38). The reporter flies also carry a -secretase reporter output construct that consists of a GAL4-responsive transcriptional cassette driving the expression of the Drosophila cell death activator GRIM (39). In the absence of -secretase, GAL4 remains tethered at the membrane and therefore is unable to enter the nucleus and activate transcription. In the presence of -secretase activity, cleavage of APP releases from the membrane a fragment consisting of the intracellular domain of APP (AICD) and GAL4. This fragment migrates to the nucleus and activates GRIM transcription, thereby promoting cell death in the eye (Fig. 1B). Cells and organisms that act as reporters for caspase family proteases, as well as Notch or APP -secretase activity, have been generated previously (40 to 43). In these reporters a proteolytic cleavage event is linked to the transcriptional activation of a reporter such as LacZ or luciferase. Our strategy utilizes retinal cell death as a readout to generate a visible and quantifiable eye phenotype in living animals, and hence facilitates in vivo genetic screens..

Any screen, genetic or chemical, generates false positives, i.e. mutations that act as modifiers but that are not interesting for the project at hand. In our case sources of such modifiers include mutations that affect the efficiency of GMR- or GAL4-dependent transcriptional activation, or the efficacy of GRIM-dependent cell death signaling. We intended to use GMR to GAL4, UAS to GRIM to eliminate these false positives. However, since GMR to GAL4, UAS to GRIM flies are lethal, we chose to utilize two strains of flies that act as reporters for false positives. The first strain is GMR to GRIM which expresses GRIM directly under GMR control and has small eyes (Fig. 2D). The second strain is GMR-GAL4, UAS-GRIM G/REAPER (45). This chimeric protein, G/REAPER, has the N-terminus of Grim, and the C-terminus of a second cell death activator, Reaper (Rpr) (46). GMR to GAL4, UAS to G/RPR flies also have a small eye phenotype, due to induction of caspase-dependent cell death (45) (Fig. 2G). True modifiers of -secretase activity should alter the eye size of reporter flies, but not those of the false positive reporter flies. False positives, on the other hand, should modify eye size similarly in the presence of both the reporter and false positive reporters. As an example of the latter, reduction in the levels of glass, which encodes a transcription factor that drives GMR-dependent expression (47), results in suppression of the small eye phenotype of reporter flies, as well as those of the false positive reporters (data not shown)..

We used two approaches to decrease Psn levels: in the first we made reporter flies heterozygous for a psn null mutation, psnC1 (35), thereby decreasing the psn genetic dose by 50%; in the second we generated and expressed a dominant negative version of Drosophila Psn under GMR control (GMR to PSNDN flies; see Materials and Methods for details).

We screened the second chromosome using a publicly available  deficiency kit  that contains 85 stocks that in total delete about 80% of this chromosome, which makes up about two-fifths of the Drosophila genome. Heterozygous deletion-bearing flies were crossed to the reporter flies and progeny bearing the deletion and reporter identified. These were then scored for suppression as compared to flies carrying the reporter alone. Several regions that contained strong suppressor activity were identified (Table 1). One of these, at 55A-55F, defined by Df(2R)1547, contains the pen-2 gene (55C1-5) which encodes the fourth component of mammalian and Drosophila -secretase complex. A second strong suppressor region was identified at 23A1-C5, as defined by the deficiency Df(2L)90 (Fig. 5A and C). This region contains aph-1 (23A6). Df(2L)3910 (23A6-B1) also removes aph-1. This deficiency acted as a reporter suppressor, but a much weaker one than Df(2L)90 (Fig. 5D). This suggested that the region deleted by Df(2L)90 contains additional -secretase suppressor loci. We used smaller deficiencies in the region to further map the suppressor activity. Df(2L)97 (23C3 to D2), Df(2L)4954 (23D2 to 23E3) and Df(2L)6875 (23C5 to 23E2) did not suppress the reporter phenotype.

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	39	Here we described the generation of flies that function as living reporters for APP -secretase activity. In these flies, -secretase-dependent cleavage of an APP-tethered transcription factor (a protease substrate), expressed specifically in the developing eye, leads to transcriptional activation of a cell death activator, Grim. Thus, the levels of endogenous -secretase activity are read out as a function of Grim-dependent cell death, which manifests itself as flies that have decreased eye size. The Drosophila eye is particularly useful as a screening system for regulators of -secretase activity since its cell population is dominated by neurons, and the eye is dispensable for viability and fertility. Importantly, the reporter small eye phenotype is easily quantifiable, and is regulated in a dose-dependent manner by modest changes (roughly 2-fold) in the levels of psn, nct and aph-1, which encode known components of the -secretase-containing complex. Thus, these flies constitute a very sensitized background in which to carry out genetic screens for other regulators of -secretase activity..

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	41	It is important to point out that it is not surprising that modest changes in the levels of -secretase components (2-fold reductions associated with heterozygosity) alter the reporter eye phenotype, but have no effect on -secretase-dependent developmental processes in the eye, such as Notch signaling. Our reporter is specifically designed to be sensitive to, and to be able to report on, levels of -secretase activity within the normal physiologic range. Thus, the reporter flies have been engineered to display a dominant eye phenotype in response to wild-type levels of -secretase activity. This is brought about in several different ways. The reporter protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence that is removed cotranslationally, generating a protein that has the N-terminus of ss-secretase-cleaved APP. Therefore, in contrast to endogenous substrates, the reporter protein does not require -or ss-secretase cleavage in order to become a suitable substrate for -secretase. To the extent that these prior cleavage events are rate-limiting, the reporter will become the preferred substrate. In addition, in the reporter flies APP to GAL4 is expressed at high levels, probably much higher than those of endogenous -secretase substrates such as Notch. Therefore, it is likely that the reporter protein becomes, on a molar basis, the dominant substrate. Finally, the output of our reporter, cell death in the eye, requires GAL4-dependent transcriptional activation from the UAS to GRIM element. Five optimized GAL4 binding sites are present in this construct (49), thereby conferring a significant level of transcription-dependent amplification. In this sensitized background modest changes in the level of -secretase activity brought about by changes in the levels of its components would be expected to result in modification of the eye phenotype. In contrast to this engineered situation, heterozygosity for almost all genes in the fly genome (including psn, nct, and aph-1) does not result in observable phenotypes during normal development because the residual 50% gene activity is sufficient to mediate normal signaling within and between cells. In other words, endogenous cellular signaling pathways such as Notch are normally buffered against phenotypic variability in response to modest changes in the activity of genes required for Notch processing (reviewed in 50)..

However, it is important to note that several other sorts of interesting modifiers may be identified. These include factors that influence the stability and subcellular localization of APP to GAL4, AICD and -secretase components. They could also include factors that regulate proteolysis of the reporter outside the -secretase target site. In particular, regulators of a recently identified -cleavage which is C-terminal to the -cleavage site and is also regulated by Psn (51 to 54) may also be detected. Many of these factors would be of potential relevance to the understanding of Alzheimer's disease mechanisms..

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	45	This reporter has several advantages for conducting genome-wide genetic screens. First, the small eye phenotype of the reporter flies acts as a readout of the endogenous, physiological levels of -secretase. This stands in contrast to the situation with many eye-based dominant modifier screens, in which the sensitized background results from hyperactivation of a signaling pathway (55). Thus modification of the reporter small eye phenotype by genetic manipulations or chemical compounds directly reflects modifications of the endogenous, physiologically relevant level of -secretase activity. Second, this reporter allows us to conduct screens that are focused specifically on identifying genes that regulate cleavage of APP. It makes no assumption about the role of psn in -secretase function, and thus constitutes an unbiased approach to identifying factors regulating APP processing. Again, this stands in contrast to screens focused on identifying genes that use Notch or psn loss-of-function phenotypes during development as a surrogate marker. Third, the sensitivity of the reporter allows us to conduct F1-dominant modifier screens. Since a large number of flies can be screened in a short period of time (F1, first generation), this sets the stage for a genome-wide search for mutations affecting -secretase. Moreover, disruption of one copy of almost all genes in the fly genome leads to flies that are viable and fertile. Thus, a function of these genes can be tested for even though homozygous deletion of the gene might be lethal earlier in development. Finally, the reporter flies are also useful for exploring the roles of candidate genes in -secretase regulation. In particular, the fact that levels of specific genes in the eyes of reporter flies can be selectively decreased using GMR-RNAi constructs, as illustrated here for nct and aph-1, provides a rapid method to test candidate -secretase regulators in a neural tissue in vivo..

Mutations that truncate the extracellular domain of Notch receptors can cause aberrant signaling and promote unregulated cell growth. We have examined two types of truncated Notch oncoproteins that arise from proviral insertion into the Notch4 gene (Notch4/int-3) or a chromosomal translocation involving the Notch1 gene (TAN-1). Both Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 oncoproteins lack most or all of their ectodomain. Normal Notch signaling requires -secretase/presenilin-mediated proteolytic processing, but whether Notch oncoproteins are also dependent on -secretase/presenilin activity is not known. We demonstrate that Notch4/int-3-induced activation of the downstream transcription factor, CSL, is abrogated in cells deficient in presenilins or treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of -secretase/presenilins. Furthermore, we find that both Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 accumulate at the cell surface, where presenilin-dependent cleavage occurs, when -secretase/presenilin activity is inhibited. -Secretase/presenilin inhibition effectively blocks cellular responses to Notch4/int-3, but not TAN-1, apparently because some TAN-1 polypeptides lack transmembrane domains and do not require -secretase/presenilin activity for nuclear access. These studies highlight potential uses and limitations of -secretase/presenilin inhibitors in targeted therapy of Notch-related neoplasms..

0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	7	In vertebrates, full-length Notch proteins are part of a family of four receptors (Notch1 to 4) and five ligands that include members of the Jagged and Delta families. Notch receptors have an extracellular (EC) domain consisting largely of multiple epidermal growth factor-like repeats within which are binding sites for ligands. The Notch receptors also have a cytoplasmic region containing the RAM domain, seven ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal PEST domain. Newly synthesized Notch receptors are processed initially in the trans-Golgi by a furin-like convertase, generating a ligand binding ectodomain and a transmembrane signaling domain that remain associated during transport to the plasma membrane (6 to 8). Ligand binding to the ectodomain induces several successive proteolytic cleavage events in the transmembrane subunit that result in release of its intracellular domain from the cell membrane. An initial cleavage by ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease)-type metalloproteases occurs just external to the transmembrane (TM) domain (9, 10) and serves to facilitate additional cleavages by -secretases/presenilins within the TM domain (11). Mammalian presenilins (PS-1 and PS-2), are polytopic membrane proteins that appear to function as aspartyl proteases within a high molecular mass multiprotein complex that also includes the proteins nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 (12 to 15). Presenilins provide the active site of the -secretase proteolytic activity (16)..
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	8	In vertebrates, full-length Notch proteins are part of a family of four receptors (Notch1 to 4) and five ligands that include members of the Jagged and Delta families. Notch receptors have an extracellular (EC) domain consisting largely of multiple epidermal growth factor-like repeats within which are binding sites for ligands. The Notch receptors also have a cytoplasmic region containing the RAM domain, seven ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal PEST domain. Newly synthesized Notch receptors are processed initially in the trans-Golgi by a furin-like convertase, generating a ligand binding ectodomain and a transmembrane signaling domain that remain associated during transport to the plasma membrane (6 to 8). Ligand binding to the ectodomain induces several successive proteolytic cleavage events in the transmembrane subunit that result in release of its intracellular domain from the cell membrane. An initial cleavage by ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease)-type metalloproteases occurs just external to the transmembrane (TM) domain (9, 10) and serves to facilitate additional cleavages by -secretases/presenilins within the TM domain (11).

Notch1 cleavage is prevented by the addition of -secretase inhibitors or mutations within critical aspartate residues of presenilin (20, 21). Delta-1-induced signaling through Notch1 is also reduced in cells deficient in presenilins or in cells treated with -secretase inhibitors (21 to 23). Presenilins have recently been recognized as having multiple substrates in addition to Notch, including -amyloid precursor protein, ErbB4, N- and E-cadherins, and CD44 (24 to 28). Presenilins are necessary, after ectodomain shedding, for the cleavage and subsequent nuclear translocation of the intracellular domains of each of these polypeptides (11, 25, 27 to 29). In the case of Notch, presenilin-mediated cleavage allows the Notch intracellular domain (IC) to gain access to the nucleus, where it binds the transcription factor CBF1/CSL. This binding event converts CSL from a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator, leading to expression of target genes (30)..

Truncated forms of Notch containing deletions spanning most, or all, of the EC domain bypass the need for ligand binding and signal constitutively. Two such Notch deletions, involving mouse Notch4 and human Notch1 (initially named TAN-1 for translocation-associated Notch homolog-1), were originally identified as oncogenes. The int-3 oncogene, which we refer to as Notch4/int-3, arises from retroviral integration of the mouse mammary tumor virus into the Notch4 locus and causes murine mammary tumors (31 to 33). In all cases, viral integration results in the production of a truncated transcript that encodes both the TM and the IC domain of Notch4 (see Fig. 8). In a similar fashion, the TAN-1 oncogene associated with T-ALL is generated from a truncation in human Notch1 caused by a recurrent (7, 9) chromosomal translocation involving the Notch1 gene and the T cell receptor gene (34). All breakpoints identified to date occur within the intron just prior to the exon encoding the 34th epidermal growth factor repeat and result in fusion of the 3'-end of Notch1 to T cell receptor promoter/enhancer elements. The fusion gene drives expression of multiple truncated mRNAs that encode a series of N-terminally truncated TAN-1 polypeptides ranging in size from slightly larger to slightly smaller than the normal Notch1 transmembrane subunit (35). The precise structure and origin of these polypeptides have not been defined..

Ligand binding of full-length Notch may induce structural changes that allow tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE) and presenilin cleavage and the release of NotchIC from the membrane. Notch4/int-3 lacks most of the ectodomain but is inserted into membranes and traffics to the cell surface where it is cleaved readily by presenilins. Blockade of presenilin-mediated activity can inhibit signal induction through both Notch4/int-3 and FL-Notch. TAN-1 polypeptides demonstrate partial dependence on presenilins. Like Notch4/int-3, some TAN-1 polypeptides are inserted into membranes and depend on proteolytic cleavage by presenilins (mTAN-1); some TAN-1 polypeptides, however, may not be localized to the cell surface and are targeted to the nucleus in a presenilin-independent manner (cTAN-1)..

These engineered Notch proteins include forms either consisting of only the IC, or the IC linked to the TM domain, a small portion of the EC domain, and the leader peptide (NotchE). Both of these forms are active in a variety of assays and are oncogenic (36 to 38), but only NotchE depends on presenilin for activity (18, 39). For instance, pharmacologic inhibition of presenilin suppresses the growth of Notch1E-induced T-ALLs, but not T-ALLs induced by the Notch1 IC domain (N1IC) (40)..

To address this issue, we used a pharmacological inhibitor of -secretase, CpdE (46), in conjunction with an in vitro cocultivation assay in which ligand and receptor were expressed independently on two different cell types and then cocultured. CpdE has been shown to bind to both PS-1 and PS-2 at the cell membrane (46). Additionally, CpdE blocks the cleavage event that releases Notch1E from the cell surface (27) and also blocks the growth of T-ALL cells, which were transformed by membrane-tethered Notch1E (40). Ligand-mediated signaling through Notch1 and Notch2 was assessed via a reporter construct encoding six CSL binding sites which was transfected into the Notch-expressing cells to assess Notch activation. CSL-mediated signaling was observed through both Notch1 and Notch2 by Jagged1 (Fig. 1A) and also by Delta-1 and Delta-4 (data not shown). Jagged1 stimulated Notch1 activity  > 8-fold over control and stimulated Notch2 activity  > 10-fold over control. When CpdE was added to the in vitro coculture assays 16 h prior to harvest of cells, CSL reporter activity was reduced through both Notch1 and Notch2 via the different ligands tested (Fig. 1B). CpdE caused a 3-fold inhibition in Jagged1-induced signaling and a 5-fold inhibition in Delta-4-induced signaling through both Notch1 and Notch2. Additionally, Delta-1-induced signaling was reduced 5-fold and  < 4-fold through Notch1 and Notch2, respectively. Thus, attenuation of signaling by a -secretase/presenilin inhibitor demonstrates the requirement of -secretase/presenilin activity in both Notch1 and Notch2 signaling whether it is via the ligand Jagged1, Delta-1, or Delta-4..

We determined whether blocking -secretase/presenilin activity would affect reporter activity induced by these constitutively active Notch proteins. Notch4/int-3 and N1IC were each expressed independently in HeLa cells or MEFs in the presence or absence of CpdE. In both cell lines, CpdE attenuated the activity of Notch4/int-3; 1.7-fold in HeLa cells and 3.8-fold in MEFs (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, CpdE did not inhibit N1IC-induced activity (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, Notch4/int-3 activity, in a MEF line deficient in both PS-1 and PS-2, was almost completely abrogated compared with the activity in wild type MEFs (Fig. 2C). The level of N1IC signaling was similar in wild type or PS-1,2-/- MEFs. These results indicate that presenilins are necessary for Notch4/int-3-induced CSL signaling and are most consistent with an intramembrane cleavage by presenilin in the TM domain of Notch4/int-3. N1IC does not encode for the TM domain and therefore is not dependent on presenilin for cleavage and subsequent nuclear translocation..

Transient expression of Notch4/int-3 in transfected 293 cells led to the appearance of multiple closely spaced Notch4 isoforms that are phosphorylated differentially (47). Treatment with two different presenilin inhibitors, CpdE or L-685,458, shifted the protein band pattern toward a higher molecular mass (Fig. 3, A and B). After drug treatment, there was a decrease in levels of the lowest molecular mass band and an increase in levels of the two higher molecular mass bands that became more pronounced with increasing drug concentrations. This up-regulation of the higher molecular mass Notch4/int-3 proteins can likely be attributed to the accumulation of the unprocessed larger forms of Notch4/int-3 that would arise if the protein were not cleaved in the TM domain by presenilin. Consistent with this result, a similar shift in the Notch4/int-3 proteins was observed in 293 cells stably coexpressing dominant-negative forms of presenilin (D385A-PS1 and D366A-PS2) (48) relative to 293 cells stably coexpressing the wild type forms of the presenilins (Fig. 3C). To demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of CpdE and L-685,458 were specific to -secretase activity, experiments were performed with two unrelated protease inhibitors, AEBSF and pepstatin A, which should not affect -secretase/presenilin cleavage at the indicated concentration. Use of these nonspecific inhibitors at relatively high concentrations (1  microM) did not alter the processing of Notch4/int-3 (Fig. 3E) or Notch1E (Fig. 3F), as was observed with CpdE (Fig. 3, E and F)..

In murine T-ALL cell lines transformed by Notch1E, which require presenilin cleavage for nuclear access, treatment with CpdE led to growth arrest and apoptosis of these cells (40). Similarly, dominant-negative inhibitors of the CSL/N1IC nuclear complex cause G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of SUPT1 cells (40), indicating that nuclear Notch1 is also needed for growth and survival of human T-ALL cells. Despite this requirement, treatment of SUPT1 cells for up to 7 days with 5  microM CpdE had no effect on growth, as assessed by cell number (not shown) or cell cycle analysis (Fig. 6)..

To study the extent to which nuclear access of TAN-1 polypeptides is -secretase/presenilin-dependent, SUPT1 cells treated with CpdE or carrier were immunostained with an antibody specific for a C-terminal portion of the intracellular domain of Notch1 (anti-TC) (Fig. 7). Nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was observed in the absence of drug (Fig. 7A), but nuclear staining was decreased preferentially by treatment with CpdE (Fig. 7B). This was documented further by analysis of anti-Notch1IC (TC) staining in control and treated SUPT1 cells with a spectral imager, which confirmed a substantial redistribution of TAN-1 polypeptides from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of cells treated with CpdE (Fig. 7, C and D). In contrast, the distribution and intensity of anti-Notch1IC (TC) staining was unchanged in CpdE-treated Jurkat cells, a control T cell leukemia cell line that expresses normal Notch1 polypeptides at modest levels (Fig. 7, E and F). These data are consistent with the existence of two pools of TAN-1 polypeptides, a major pool dependent on -secretase/presenilin for nuclear access, and a minor pool that can access the nucleus in a -secretase/presenilin-independent fashion (see Fig. 8). Support for the existence of the latter type of TAN-1 polypeptide is seen in Western blots (Fig. 3C), in which one TAN-1 polypeptide of slightly smaller size than the membrane-associated presenilin-sensitive polypeptides is unaffected by drug treatment. This polypeptide also fails to appear at the cell surface (Fig. 4B), presumably because it lacks a TM domain, and thus would not be expected to require -secretase/presenilin activity for processing and nuclear access. This same TAN-1 polypeptide may generate sufficient constitutive Notch activity to maintain the growth of SUPT1 cells in the presence of -secretase/presenilin blockade..

We demonstrate that -secretase/presenilin cleavage is a general requirement for the activation of the Notch signaling pathway via both Notch1 and Notch2. This conclusion is based on the finding that -secretase/presenilin inhibition greatly reduced the ability of Notch1 and Notch2 receptors to activate CSL upon exposure to the ligand Jagged1, Delta-1, or Delta-4. Our studies are consistent with the observation that Notch1 to 4E polypeptides all require -secretase/presenilin to activate CSL (17, 18). The Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 oncoproteins are also truncated and lack most of the EC domain. However, unlike the engineered NotchE proteins, Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 do not possess signal peptides, and it was thus unclear whether these polypeptides would be inserted into membranes and require -secretase/presenilin for downstream signaling. Our studies demonstrate that both Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 polypeptides are inserted in membranes and that treatment with a -secretase/presenilin inhibitor results in the accumulation of Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 proteins at the cell surface..

After insertion, truncated Notch would be competent for transport to the cell surface as part of a complex containing presenilin. This is consistent with coimmunoprecipitation experiments showing that most Notch proteins targeted to the membrane are associated with presenilin (50). Presenilins are expressed at the membrane in a biologically active complex with nicastrin (15, 56), and membrane-tethered Notch has also been observed in a complex with nicastrin (14).

Aberrant processing of -amyloid precursor protein by presenilin is associated with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to this role, presenilins are also necessary in the trafficking of -amyloid precursor protein from the trans-Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (57) and from the cell surface to endosomes (56). Additionally, presenilins are required for the proper maturation and trafficking of nicastrin to the cell membrane (58 to 60). Presenilins may serve a similar function in the trafficking of Notch. Such a function would be independent of proteolytic activity because mutations of critical aspartate residues abrogate the proteolytic activity of presenilin without affecting trafficking of Notch to the cell surface (21)..

The biological activity of Notch4/int-3 was examined in a bioassay established to detect endothelial sprouting from HUVEC. Notch4/int-3 induced a strong sprouting response in this assay, demonstrating a role for Notch4 signaling in the initial processes of angiogenesis, an effect that was almost completely inhibited by a -secretase/presenilin inhibitor.

SUPT1 cells contain increased levels of nuclear Notch1 and required persistent Notch1 signaling for growth, based on the effect of dominant-negative inhibitors of N1IC/CSL function (40). However, SUPT1 cell growth is unaffected by CpdE, despite evidence of altered TAN-1 processing and accumulation of TAN-1 polypeptides at the cell surface. The unresponsiveness of SUPT1 cells may be the result of the expression of TAN-1 polypeptides that are not dependent on presenilin-mediated proteolysis for nuclear access. Specifically, the smallest TAN-1 polypeptide detected in SUPT1 whole cell lysates was unaltered by CpdE (Fig. 3D). This polypeptide may arise from a cryptic translational start site downstream of the region encoding the extracellular domain. Such aberrant initiation codons have been demonstrated within the TM domains of murine Notch1 (61) and feline Notch2 (62). Whether such sites are purely pathophysiologic or utilized under some normal circumstances is unknown. We hypothesize that this TAN-1 polypeptide accesses the nucleus in a presenilin-independent fashion, accounting for the refractoriness of SUPT1 cells to presenilin blockade..

These models propose that the Notch receptor is normally inhibited from proteolytic processing because of conformational constraints imposed by the EC domain. Ligand binding may induce structural changes that allow for proteolytic cleavage by TACE (tumor necrosis-alpha-converting enzyme) and other metalloproteases and the consequent shedding of most of the EC domain. This then enables the subsequent proteolysis mediated by presenilins. Gain of function mutations of Notch could either act independently of presenilin or function only after presenilin-mediated cleavage. Our studies indicate that there are both presenilin-dependent and -independent forms of the TAN-1 oncoproteins..

All four Notch receptors are cleaved by presenilin at a conserved valine within the TM domain, and mutation of this valine residue within Notch1 and Notch4 greatly reduces the efficiency of cleavage (18). However, Notch cleavage is also observed at another site within the TM domain N-terminal to the conserved valine (19). Additionally, studies in Drosophila show that it is the size of the Notch EC domain that is critical to whether presenilin can cleave, such that the shorter the EC domain the more efficient the cleavage (63). This lack of cleavage site specificity was also observed for other substrates and suggests that presenilins may serve a general role in facilitating the cleavage of particular single-pass TM proteins with short EC domains..

The authors performed a meta-analysis of 14 studies (16 comparisons) with CTSD genotyping (3,174 Alzheimer s disease cases and 3,298 controls). Overall, the random effects odds ratio for the T versus the C allele was 1.17 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95, 1.44), with some between-study heterogeneity (p  <  0.01). There was significant between-study heterogeneity but no evidence of a significant association when the first hypothesis-generating study was excluded from the calculations (odds ratio (OR) = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.35; p = 0.29). The summary odds ratio for T carriers versus T noncarriers was similar in subjects carrying or not carrying an apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4). The increased susceptibility to Alzheimer s disease conferred by APOE*4 carriage tended to be more prominent in the presence of the T allele (random effects OR = 6.07, 95% CI: 4.19, 8.79, and OR = 4.09, 95% CI: 3.15, 5.31, in T carriers and noncarriers, respectively). The meta-analysis shows that the CTSD polymorphism is not a major risk factor for Alzheimer s disease, although a small effect or an enhancement of the APOE*4 effect cannot be excluded..

The cathepsin D gene (CTSD) is located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p15.5) and consists of nine exons. The synthesis of beta-amyloid peptide is a putative key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer s disease. Beta-amyloid derives from its precursor protein via proteolytic cleavage by secretases. Therefore, it has been postulated that variants in the genes coding for enzymes involved in the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein or in the degradation and clearance of beta-amyloid from the central nervous system may be potential risk factors for Alzheimer s disease..

There is also controversy on whether this polymorphism may interact with the apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4), which is the best known genetic determinant for sporadic Alzhei-mer s disease (20). Single studies may have been underpowered to detect interactions or even overall effects. Given the amount of accumulated data, we deemed it important to perform a quantitative synthesis of the evidence using rigorous methods. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of all available studies relating the CTSD polymorphism to the risk of Alzheimer s disease..

Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1, and presenilin 2 genes account for 5 percent of the cases and result in an autosomally dominant pattern that is expressed with complete penetrance and early manifestations (23). Alzheimer s disease is probably slightly more common in females (24). Other proven or postulated risk factors include head injury (in particular among males) (25), as well as family history, low income, low education, low occupational status, depression, exposure to aluminum in drinking water, hypertension, and Down s syndrome (26, 27). Conversely, the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to treat arthritis has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzhei-mer s disease, as has been estrogen use by postmenopausal women (27). Physical activity, diets with high levels of vitamins B6, B12, and folate, and red wine in moderate quantities may be protective (27). The prevalence of Alzheimer s disease varies considerably among different population groups (28). At least a few dozens of polymorphisms have been examined in relation to sporadic Alzheimer s disease, and published reviews are available (23, 29). Among them, there is conclusive evidence from several studies and meta-analysis thereof that APOE*4 is a strong risk factor for developing Alzheimer s disease for both male and female subjects and for both early onset ( < 65 years) and late-onset disease (20), with an approximately fivefold increase in the odds of developing Alzheimer s disease. Single studies have also implicated other polymorphisms as being important, although the reported odds ratios are much smaller than those seen for APOE*4, and attempts at replication in subsequent research have not been conclusive. Meta-analyses for some other polymorphisms have already appeared in the literature (30 to 35). They suggest no significant overall associations for several of these polymorphisms, including the myeloperoxidase gene promoter polymorphism (30), intronic or promoter region polymorphisms of presenilin 1 (for late-onset disease) (31), an insertion-deletion polymorphism or a missense mutation in the alpha-2 macroglobulin gene (32), and several polymorphisms of the protein tau gene (33). Associations of modest effect size (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.30 to 1.35) have been claimed in meta-analyses of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein gene exon 3 polymorphism (34) and of an insertion-deletion polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme I gene (35)..

For each genetic contrast, we estimated the between-study heterogeneity across all eligible comparisons using the chi-square-based Q statistic (36). Heterogeneity was considered significant for p  <  0.10. Data were combined using both fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) and random-effects (DerSimonian and Laird) models (37). Random effects incorporate an estimate of the between-study variance and tend to provide wider confidence intervals, when the results of the constituent studies differ among themselves. In the absence of between-study heterogeneity, the two methods provide identical results. Random effects are more appropriate when heterogeneity is present (37)..

It should be noted that it is not clear whether the CTSD polymorphism has functional consequences for the mature form of the enzyme.

Our analyses addressed interactions with APOE*4, the major known genetic determinant of Alzhei-mer s disease. Interactions with other genetic or environmental factors have not been studied. The trend for a stronger effect of APOE*4 in the presence of T allele carriage is interesting in the light of data suggesting that T carriage may affect the general intelligence (5). However, subgroup and interaction analyses should be interpreted cautiously, since differences between subgroups may occur by chance (49) and their validation would require studies with even larger sample sizes than the several thousand included in this meta-analysis. Finally, population stratification may theoretically have affected the results of the constituent studies in the meta-analysis (50), since we documented that the frequency of the T allele varied considerably among the different ethnic groups or even among the different ethnic groups of European descent. However, most studies were strictly ethnically defined, so the population stratification effect is unlikely to have been of any considerable magnitude..
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	54	Because of the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer s disease worldwide, it is crucial to identify genetic risk factors for this neurodegenerative disease. Thus, the list of identified polymorphisms that may influence the risk of Alzheimer s disease is continuously expanding (23, 29), but most of the reported associations of candidate genes to date remain nonreplicated or at least controversial after subsequent investigation. Early and small genetic association studies may come up with spurious findings (41, 51, 52).

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	55	Because of the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer s disease worldwide, it is crucial to identify genetic risk factors for this neurodegenerative disease. Thus, the list of identified polymorphisms that may influence the risk of Alzheimer s disease is continuously expanding (23, 29), but most of the reported associations of candidate genes to date remain nonreplicated or at least controversial after subsequent investigation. Early and small genetic association studies may come up with spurious findings (41, 51, 52). Even when genetic associations are replicated, usually they do not have a major public health impact that would lead to screening recommendations (53). Nevertheless, such knowledge could improve our understanding about the pathogenesis of complex diseases such as Alzheimer s disease..

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	5	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Presenilins are the catalytic components of -secretase, an intramembrane-cleaving protease whose substrates include -amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the Notch receptors. These type I transmembrane proteins undergo two distinct presenilin-dependent cleavages within the transmembrane region, which result in the production of A and APP intracellular domain (from APP) and the Notch intracellular domain signaling peptide. Most cases of familial Alzheimer's disease are caused by presenilin mutations, which are scattered throughout the coding sequence. Although the underlying molecular mechanism is not yet known, the familial Alzheimer's disease mutations produce a shift in the ratio of the long and short forms of the A peptide generated by the -secretase. We and others have previously shown that presenilin homodimerizes and suggested that a presenilin dimer is at the catalytic core of -secretase. Here, we demonstrate that presenilin transmembrane domains contribute to the formation of the dimer. In-frame substitution of the hydrophilic loop 1, located between transmembranes I and II, which modulates the interactions within the N-terminal fragment/N-terminal fragment dimer, abolishes both presenilinase and -secretase activities. In addition, by reconstituting -secretase activity from two catalytically inactive presenilin aspartic mutants, we provide evidence of an active diaspartyl group assembled at the interface between two presenilin monomers. Under our conditions, this catalytic group mediates the generation of APP intracellular domain and A but not Notch intracellular domain, therefore suggesting that specific diaspartyl groups within the presenilin catalytic core of -secretase mediate the cleavage of different substrates..

In addition, by reconstituting -secretase activity from two catalytically inactive presenilin aspartic mutants, we provide evidence of an active diaspartyl group assembled at the interface between two presenilin monomers. Under our conditions, this catalytic group mediates the generation of APP intracellular domain and A but not Notch intracellular domain, therefore suggesting that specific diaspartyl groups within the presenilin catalytic core of -secretase mediate the cleavage of different substrates..
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	7	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Presenilins (PS)1 are components of a high molecular weight multimeric enzymatic complex, the -secretase (1, 2). This enzymatic activity, whose identity has been elusive for some years, is responsible for the production of the A40/42 peptides. The deposition of insoluble aggregates of A40/42, mainly A42, results in the generation of amyloid plaques, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. A peptides are produced after a series of proteolytic cleavages of the precursor APP, a type I transmembrane (TM) protein. Cleavage of APP by - and -secretases generates the and C-terminal fragments (-CTF and -CTF, respectively), which are the substrates of -secretase. The intramembrane proteolytic cleavage by -secretase on -CTF generates the soluble p3 peptide, whereas the same cleavage on -CTF generates the A peptides. The more abundant A peptide forms, A40 and A42/43, are produced in a 9:1 ratio (reviewed in Ref. 3). Mutations in the presenilin 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2) genes cause familiar autosomal dominant AD (FAD), and to date, up to 145 missense mutations have been reported (available on the World Wide Web at molgen-www.uia.ac.be/ADMutations/). These mutations, scattered throughout the coding sequence, trigger a shift in the ratio of A40/42 production in favor of the longer peptide form (A42/43) (4, 5), which is less soluble and serves as the core for amyloid plaque formation (6). In addition, -secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) by cleavage at the site (7, 8). AICD translocates to the nucleus, where, together with other recruited proteins, it initiates transcriptional events (9, 10). Another type I TM substrate, the Notch receptor, is cleaved at the S3 site by -secretase. This proteolytic cleavage, also within the TM region, is a key step in Notch signal transduction, since it releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (11). The analogous Notch S3 and APP sites are located within the TM region near the cytoplasmic domain (7, 8). In addition, Notch also undergoes an additional -secretase-mediated proteolysis in the middle of the transmembrane region (S4 site), analogous to the A-producing -secretase cleavage (12)..

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	9	It is now widely accepted that PS1 and PS2 are the catalytic components of the -secretase complex, which appears to be an aspartyl protease whose activity resides at the interface between two presenilin fragments, the N-terminal (NTF) and the C-terminal (CTF) fragments (13, 14). The NTF and CTF presenilin moieties are most probably produced by autocatalytic presenilinase activity and are more stable than the PS holoprotein (15, 16). NTF and CTF heterodimerize with a 1:1 stoichiometry within the -secretase complex (17, 18), a complex that also contains nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 at an as yet undetermined stoichiometry (2, 19, 20)..

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	11	Many biochemical properties of -secretase activity are poorly understood, the most perplexing being its ability to cleave at two different sites within the transmembrane region of its substrates (the and cleavages of APP and the S3 and S4 sites of Notch) and the heterogeneity of the cleavage at the -site, which yields A peptides ranging from 32 to 43 amino acids (21). Although the presenilin catalytic center is composed of a diaspartyl group, the different inhibitory profiles of -secretase inhibitors obtained for A40, A42, and Notch cleavage suggest the presence of distinct catalytic activities (22 to 24). In addition, some presenilin FAD and non-FAD mutations behave as gain-of-function mutations with respect to A production and as loss-of-function mutations with respect to AICD and NICD release (25, 26), supporting the hypothesis that both activities can be separated (25, 27 to 30). Nonetheless, and despite the wealth of information gathered, there is still a lack of knowledge about the mechanism(s) by which FAD presenilin mutations, mainly located far from the catalytic site, are translated into subtle modifications in -secretase cleavage preferences. Studies with different inhibitors have shed some light on the presenilin catalytic mechanism (31 to 35). However, many issues related to substrate specificity, cleavage site specificity, and substrate binding site (or sites) remain to be clarified. Several scenarios have been postulated to explain these intriguing findings. Some reports argue that -secretase catalytic properties are incompatible with a single catalytic activity and propose that Notch and APP are cleaved by different proteases or by a protease with different catalytic sites (36 to 39). In contrast, other authors propose that -secretase activity is performed by a unique, albeit particularly complex, enzyme. This latter model has been recently expanded, since several newly described isoforms of some components of -secretase might allow the formation of more than four different variants of the -secretase complex (40)..

Vaquero) to drive the expression of HA-PSN from a Drosophila actin 5C expression cassette. For the expression constructs bearing the N-terminal c-Myc-tagged Psn, a forward strand oligonucleotide (5'-CATGGAGGAACAAAAGCTGATTTCTGAAGAAGACTTGG-3') and its complementary reverse strand oligonucleotide (5'-AATTCCAAGTCTTCTTCAGAAATCAGCTTTTGTTCCTC-3'), coding for the c-Myc epitope, were annealed and cloned into the NcoI and EcoRI sites of pAS2 to 1-Psn. The entire c-Myc-Psn fusion was subcloned into pActPPA expression vector. The aspartic mutant PSNs were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the Psn template as described elsewhere (45). For the in-frame substitution of HL1 (amino acids 123 to 154) by HL5 (amino acids 261 to 267), a two-step cloning strategy was used. The resulting Psn cDNA, containing an N-terminal HA tag and the HL5 region after TMI, was cloned into a pActPPA expression plasmid to generate pActPPA-HA-PsnHL1 to 5. The pActPPA expression plasmids containing two Psn expression cassettes were obtained by subcloning the SalI fragment, containing the actin 5C expression cassette driving the expression of a c-Myc-tagged PSN, into the unique BstZ17I site of the plasmid pActPPA-HA-Psn..

After an exhaustive analysis of presenilin domain interactions by the yeast two-hybrid assay, our results highlighted the contribution of the hydrophilic loop connecting transmembranes I and II (HL1) to the NTF/NTF homodimerization, although no similar domains could be defined for CTF/CTF or NTF/CTF interactions (41). Presenilins show a very complex topology with eight transmembrane domains, which may also interact among them and contribute to the dimer formation. To dissect the possible contribution of transmembrane domains, not only to NTF/NTF but also to CTF/CTF and NTF/CTF dimerization, we relied on an alternative strategy that had been specifically designed to test protein/protein interactions between proteins anchored to the membrane, the split ubiquitin system (44). In this system, each of the proteins assayed for interaction is independently fused to either the N-terminal (Nub) domain, or to the C-terminal (Cub) domain of ubiquitin, which is in turn attached to the transcription factor LexA-VP16. If the two assayed proteins did interact, they would bring together the two ubiquitin moieties, reconstituting the ubiquitin entity, which would be then recognized and cleaved by the cellular deubiquitinating enzymes, thus triggering the transcription of several sensitive reporter and selective genes (the his3 and lacZ genes) (44). This strategy has already been successfully applied to detect and dissect membrane protein interactions of several proteins, including presenilin (41, 52). Several requirements have to be met in order to analyze a series of transmembrane deletions in frame. One of the requisites of this approach is that the Nub and Cub moieties of the ubiquitin have to be localized in the cytosol and that the Cub-LexA-VP16 fusion has to be at the end terminus of the protein fusion (44). In addition, the presenilin molecule should maintain the topology in the membrane. These requisites limited the number and combination of presenilin transmembrane domains that could be tested as they should be deleted in frame in even numbers..

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	44	  In our previous work, we proposed that HL1 played an important role in dimer formation and, probably, in the conformation of the presenilin -secretase complex due to homomeric protein/protein interactions mediated by this domain. In support of this, 14 of the 145 mutations in PS1 and PS2 cluster in this 32-amino acid loop, and all of the FAD mutations that we analyzed altered HL1/HL1 dimerization (41). Nonetheless, the results depicted in Fig. 1, A and B, suggested that the region comprising the N terminus-TMI-HL1-TMII domains was not required for NTF/NTF or NTF/CTF interactions, given that its deletion did not affect the strength of the NTF/NTF or NTF/CTF interactions compared with that of wild-type fragments (as assessed semiquantitatively by growth on selective medium). To further address the role of HL1 in NTF/NTF homodimerization, we undertook a new series of experiments to analyze whether the NTF/NTF interaction and dimerization would be altered when the HL1 loop sequence was substituted by another connecting loop so that the topology and relative position of all transmembrane domains were still maintained. To this end, we generated an NTF variant, named NTF1 to 5, in which HL1 (amino acids 123 to 154 of PSN) was replaced by HL5, a shorter ER-facing connecting loop peptide of PSN (amino acids 261 to 267 of PSN). This in-frame substitution did not alter the number of transmembranes or the connecting loops, and the general NTF topology should be preserved. To directly test NTF/NTF interaction in the membrane, we again resorted to the split ubiquitin system, which we had previously shown allowed presenilin to be properly anchored in the membrane. The interaction between different combinations of wild type NTF and NTF1 to 5 were assessed by quantification of the lacZ reporter activity (Fig. 1D). According to these results, replacement of HL1 increases the strength of the NTF/NTF interaction, thus confirming the contribution of other domains to the formation and stability of the dimer and indicating that the HL1 may have a modulatory role on NTF/NTF interaction and thus in presenilin dimerization. In contrast, none of the hydrophilic domains of the CTF domain seemed to be a determinant for any structural interactions, since they could be deleted without affecting CTF/CTF or NTF/CTF interactions (Fig. 1, A and C)..

As already mentioned, the in-frame substitution of the HL1 did not alter the number of TMs or connecting loops of the resulting PSN (Fig. 2A). Using Drosophila SL2 cells as a homologous expression system, we stably transfected and overexpressed several constructs, bearing either wild-type or mutant N-terminal HA-tagged PSNs (wtPSN or PSNHL1 to 5), and assessed their expression and processing by Western blot analyses of protein lysates (Fig. 2B). The addition of the HA tag at the N terminus of PSN did not alter presenilinase processing of wtPSN, which was endoproteolytically cleaved in both transient and stable transfectants. In contrast, PSNHL1 to 5 did not generate the corresponding NTF fragment and behaved like the null presenilin mutants of the catalytic aspartic acid residues (Fig. 2B), thus demonstrating that HL1 is essential for PSN endoproteolysis..

To avoid the background by endogenous presenilin, we designed and performed RNAi experiments with dsRNA (250 bp) corresponding to the fused 5'- and 3'-UTR sequences of the Drosophila PSN gene. This dsRNA was co-transfected along with the assay constructs in order to specifically knock-down endogenous PSN without altering the levels of the tagged exogenous PSN expression (as confirmed by Western blot analysis; data not shown). Treatment with dsRNA targeting the endogenous presenilin produced a significant decrease in -galactosidase activity in stably vector-transfected cells, whereas the -galactosidase activity of the stably wtPSN-transfected cells remained unaltered (data not shown). To assess whether the 5'-UTR-3'-UTR dsRNA reduced cleavage at the -site of the C99 substrate by the endogenous presenilin and therefore decreased A production, SL2 cells were transiently transfected with an SC100 construct encoding the C99 substrate (48) along with dsRNA. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, medium was replaced to quantify de novo produced A peptides after RNAi treatment. The production of A40 and A42 peptides was clearly reduced after dsRNA treatment (Fig. 3A, left), indicating an efficient disruption of endogenous presenilin activity. Interestingly, the dsRNA treatment did not alter the production of the A42 peptide relative to total A, and thus, the A40/42 ratio remained unaffected in dsRNA-treated cells (Fig. 3A, right). This decrease in the endogenous presenilin activity (as measured by A production) correlated with the accumulation of -CTF stubs generated by -secretase cleavage (Fig. 3B).

After several timing controls, cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection to allow both efficient RNA interference and endogenous presenilin protein turnover. The -galactosidase activity, which measured AICD production (-cleavage), was obtained in mutant stably transfected cells and compared with that of wtPSN (which was considered 100%). Remarkably, the -secretase activity in PSNHL1 to 5 stable cell lines, assessed on the C99-GVP substrate, was completely abolished, yielding values similar to those of the TMVII aspartic mutant presenilin, PSND461A (Fig. 3C). This result showed that HL1 appears to be essential for the -cleavage of APP and, consequently, for AICD production. We next tested whether the PSNHL1 to 5 mutant cleaved the APP-derived substrate to produce the A40 and A42 peptides (-cleavage). Stable cell lines expressing different presenilin variants were transiently transfected with the SC100 construct, and A production in the cell medium was subsequently analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3D, the expression of the PSNHL1 to 5 mutant resulted in a significant 10-fold decrease in A production. The impairment of -secretase activity correlated with the accumulation of - and -CTF stubs (Fig. 3E). These results demonstrate that the HL1 of PSN is required for both - and -cleavages of APP..
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	57	  To assess the activity of the PSNHL1 to 5 mutant, we analyzed the production of AICD (-cleavage), NICD (S3 cleavage), and A (-cleavage) in HA-PSNHL1 to 5 stably transfected cells using the aforementioned quantitative reporter-based strategy. After several timing controls, cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection to allow both efficient RNA interference and endogenous presenilin protein turnover. The -galactosidase activity, which measured AICD production (-cleavage), was obtained in mutant stably transfected cells and compared with that of wtPSN (which was considered 100%). Remarkably, the -secretase activity in PSNHL1 to 5 stable cell lines, assessed on the C99-GVP substrate, was completely abolished, yielding values similar to those of the TMVII aspartic mutant presenilin, PSND461A (Fig. 3C). This result showed that HL1 appears to be essential for the -cleavage of APP and, consequently, for AICD production. We next tested whether the PSNHL1 to 5 mutant cleaved the APP-derived substrate to produce the A40 and A42 peptides (-cleavage). Stable cell lines expressing different presenilin variants were transiently transfected with the SC100 construct, and A production in the cell medium was subsequently analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3D, the expression of the PSNHL1 to 5 mutant resulted in a significant 10-fold decrease in A production.

A Drosophila Notch-derived substrate lacking the extracellular domain (NECN) and fused to the transcription factor Gal4Vp16, NECN-GVP, was co-transfected with the aforementioned reporter constructs in SL2 cells. The -galactosidase activity was significantly decreased in the PSNHL1 to 5 mutant (as it was in the PSND461A mutant) compared with wtPSN (Fig. 3F). Altogether, these results confirmed that indeed the HL1 domain plays a modulating role in the presenilin dimerization and showed that substitution of HL1 by another connecting domain resulted in a complete loss of -secretase function concerning presenilinase activity, the - and -cleavages of APP, as well as the S3 cleavage of Notch, without affecting PSN stability..

Presenilin dimerization would bring together four aspartic residues, two from each monomer, thus allowing different combinations of functional aspartyl groups at the catalytic core of -secretase. Several points are raised by this model, not the least being whether the presenilin dimer is a requirement for -secretase activity and, if so, whether all four aspartic residues are required for -secretase activity or only two aspartic residues will be sufficient for cleavage. If the latter was the case, new questions are posed, such as whether any diaspartyl combinations are equally functional or whether specific diaspartyl groups mediate substrate recognition and/or cleavage site preferences. The proposed presenilin quaternary conformation (26, 41, 42) enables the formation of up to six catalytic diaspartyl groups within the -secretase complex (Fig. 4A; some reciprocal diaspartyl combinations are not shown for simplicity). The assembly of functional diaspartyl groups involving either two TMVI aspartic residues (Asp257 in human PS1, corresponding to Asp279 in Drosophila PSN) or the two aspartic residues from TM VII (Asp385 in human PS1, corresponding to Asp461 in Drosophila PSN) can be discarded (Fig. 4A, schemes on the left), since PS aspartic mutants D257A and D385A have been clearly shown to impair presenilinase and -secretase activities (reviewed in Ref. 56), and expression of either NTF or CTF peptides in PS-deficient cells is not able to cleave an APP-derived substrate (55). Therefore, besides the expected diaspartyl groups formed between the NTF and the CTF within each monomer (Fig. 4A, second scheme on the right; the reciprocal diaspartyl group is not shown), two other -secretase catalytic centers may be assembled in trans at the interface between two presenilin monomers, each contributing with one different aspartic (Asp257 and Asp385 in human PS1) to the catalytic core (Fig. 4A, last scheme on the right; again the reciprocal diaspartyl group is not shown)..

A, scheme of the PSN dimer model, depicting only the TMs VI and VII with the potential functional diaspartyl groups (black boxes) acting (arrows) on a potential substrate. Diaspartyl groups formed between two TMVI 257 aspartic residues (left), two TMVII 385 aspartic residues (second scheme on the left), the aspartic residuesof the NTF and CTF from the same PSN monomer (second scheme on the right), and the aspartic residues of the NTF and CTF from different PSN monomers (right). The numbering is according to human PS1. B, protein lysates from SL2 cells stably expressing the indicated PSN variants immunodetected with anti-HA (left) or anti-c-Myc (right). C, SL2 cells stably expressing the indicated PSN variants were transiently transfected with the C99-Gal4Vp16 construct, the -galactosidase and luciferase reporter plasmids, and dsRNA (n = 10, in four independent experiments). D, A production quantified by sandwich ELISA in SL2 cells stably transfected with the PSN variants indicated and transiently transfected with the SC100 construct along with dsRNA (n = 3, all independent transfections and normalized against protein concentration). The last lane indicates endogenous activity (end) of cells untreated with dsRNA. E, the %A42 of the total did not differ between the wtPSN, the reconstituted -secretase activity (HA-PSND279A/Myc-PSND461A), and the endogenous PSN. F, Western blots of protein lysates from the cells analyzed in D, immunodetected with an antibody specific for the C terminus of APP (amino acids 665 to 695) and their relative quantification.

Statistical significance according to the U-Mann Whitney Test was as follows: *, p  <  0.05; ***, p  <  0.005..
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	63	  We designed an experimental approach based on genetic complementation between two different aspartic mutants to assess whether the TMVI aspartic residue (Asp279 in Drosophila PSN/Asp257 in human PS1) from one monomer formed a functional diaspartyl group with the TMVII aspartic residue (Asp461 in Drosophila PSN/Asp385 in human PS1) from the other. If this were the case, we should be able to reconstitute -secretase activity from the two catalytically inactive aspartic mutants, thus providing further evidence that presenilins functions as a dimer in vivo and that at least two aspartic residues are required. To our knowledge, this possibility has not been formally tested before. We constructed a double cassette expression plasmid to stably co-express two presenilin mutants, HA-PSND279A and c-Myc-PSND461A, in SL2 cells. To assess -secretase activity, we analyzed the production of AICD, A, and NICD using the corresponding substrates. In cells stably expressing both PSN mutants, we predicted the formation of three different complexes: the inactive homodimers containing the same mutation and thus containing either two 461 or two 279 aspartic residues (HA-PSND279A/HA-PSND279A and Myc-PSND461A/Myc-PSND461A, respectively) and the heterodimeric complex with one aspartic 461 and one aspartic 279 (HA-PSND279A/Myc-PSND461A), at a 1:1:2 ratio. If a functional catalytic site were formed between the two mutant monomers, we would expect that the presenilin heterodimer PSND279A/PSND461A would produce one or more of the presenilin-dependent cleavage products (AICD, NICD, and A40/42)..

Interestingly, we observed that, in contrast to the -galactosidase activities of the single and double aspartic D279A and D461A mutants, co-expression of both single mutant presenilins resulted in a significantly higher -secretase activity (Fig. 4C), amounting to 50% of the wild-type presenilin value. This result shows that co-expression of the two mutants, PSND279A and PSND461A, restores AICD production, providing strong evidence that an active catalytic site is formed between the NTF and the CTF aspartics from different presenilins within the same complex. Similarly, the production of A40/42 from the C99 substrate was determined. Again, and in contrast to the abolition of A40 and A42 production in cells expressing only one single (either PSND279A or PSND461A) or double (PSND279A+D461A) aspartic mutants, coexpression of the two PSN mutants restored the production of the A40 and A42 to the same level as endogenous PSN in cells untreated with dsRNA (Fig. 4D), around 25 to 30% of that achieved by overexpression of wtPSN. Furthermore, the A40/42 ratio in cells expressing the combination of both aspartic mutants was similar to that of wtPSN (Fig. 4E). The rescue of -secretase activity due to the co-expression of the two aspartic mutants was further confirmed by a significant reduction of -CTFs levels in these cells compared with cells expressing each mutant, PSND279A and PSND461A, alone (Fig. 4F). Note the statistical significance of the decrease in the -CTF levels when co-expressing the two mutants (lane 5), compared with those of the single or double mutants expressed on their own (lanes 2 to 4, which were not statistically different among them)..

In fact, the null values obtained were comparable with those for the single PSND461A mutant. Taken together, these results indicate that the functional diaspartyl group formed between the NTF and CTF from two different presenilins restore -secretase activity, at least to mediate and cleavages of C99, but also that this diaspartyl group may display substrate specificity, since it is able to discriminate between the two substrates, C99 and NECN..

Nonetheless, exhaustive analysis of in situ interactions performed in membrane-anchored presenilin domains to study the contribution of the hydrophobic transmembranes to dimerization was missing. The split ubiquitin system (44) allowed us to design a test for assaying different combinations of TM regions, grouped by even numbers in order to preserve the general presenilin topology and the cytosolic/lumen direction of the domains. Our results show that presenilin transmembrane domains are relevant for interactions within the NTF/NTF, CTF/CTF, and NTF/CTF dimers, either for assembly or stabilization, and therefore for the maintenance of the tertiary and quaternary presenilin structure. In this context, the fact that the hydrophobic domains are the most evolutionarily conserved presenilin regions and that FAD mutations are mainly concentrated on these transmembrane domains indicate that even conservative changes may cause subtle disturbances in dimerization and final quaternary structure, which are then reflected in shifts of the substrate cleavage sites..

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	75	Previous results from our group showed that the HL1 domain (the hydrophilic loop connecting TMI and TMII) from two NTFs interacted and were involved in NTF/NTF homodimerization (41). In addition to being the largest ER-facing loop, the highly evolutionarily conserved HL1 domain is the presenilin hydrophilic region that clusters the highest number of FAD mutations. Remarkably, the FAD mutations analyzed altered the formation of the HL1 HL1 complex (41). The substitution of this domain increased NTF/NTF interaction, thus indicating that, more than being a requirement for interaction, it may rather play a modulatory role in dimerization as a means to achieve a correct presenilin tertiary or quaternary structure. We therefore focused on this domain to assess its contribution to presenilin structure and function. Interestingly, substitution of HL1 for another ER-hydrophilic connecting loop, HL5, which presumably generates a topologically equivalent presenilin protein, totally inhibited presenilinase activity. In addition, production of AICD, A, and NICD was completely absent in cells expressing this PSN variant. This abrogation of presenilinase and -secretase activities was not due to increased presenilin instability, since the PSNHL1 to 5 mutant holoprotein was still detected after 10 h of cycloheximide treatment, thus proving to be much more stable than the wtPSN holoprotein. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the inhibition of the -secretase activity in this PSN mutant is a secondary effect of the lack of presenilin endoproteolysis, we do not favor this explanation, since presenilinase and -secretase activities do not necessarily correlate (30, 57). Another presenilin variant lacking HL1 has been analyzed. The TM1 to 2 PS1 mutant (with a deletion comprising the TMI-HL1-TMII regions) was able to generate the A peptides (30), although the maturation and trafficking of the -secretase complex components were highly altered. A similar effect of our PSNHL1 to 5 mutant could be assumed. However, we deem it unlikely, since the presenilin transmembrane regions, integrally maintained in the PSNHL1 to 5 but not in the TM1 to 2 mutant, mediate the interactions within the -secretase complex (58 to 60). Recently, it has been suggested that presenilin endoproteolysis is a regulatory event that causes a cleavage-induced conformational change by which presenilin becomes an activated enzyme (61). According to this report, the presenilinase cleavage would retrieve the loop encoded by exon 9, which would otherwise occupy the presenilin substrate-binding site. If this was the case, we should then surmise that the TM1 to 2 mutant adopted a conformation that relieved the exon 9 peptide from the binding pocket, whereas the conformation of the PSNHL1 to 5 variant allowed neither endoproteolysis processing nor the retrieval of exon 9 peptide; hence, -secretase activity might be severely compromised..

Here, we show that the alteration of a region located far from the catalytic site and not involved in presenilin stability causes inhibition of presenilinase and -secretase functions. Hence, substitution of HL1, which plays an important role on PSN structure and assembly, has devastating functional effects and suggests that proper presenilin dimerization and assembly within the -secretase complex is essential for its proteolytic function. In this context, FAD mutations located in HL1 may subtly alter presenilin dimerization and positioning of transmembranes and, thus, generate a shift on the substrate cleavage site preferences..

In this context, FAD mutations located in HL1 may subtly alter presenilin dimerization and positioning of transmembranes and, thus, generate a shift on the substrate cleavage site preferences..
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	79	One prediction of the presenilin dimer in the -secretase core is the formation of more than one catalytic diaspartyl group. We addressed whether all the diaspartyl combinations were functional. Our results showed reconstitution of active -secretase when two different presenilin aspartic mutants were co-expressed, as a functional diaspartyl group was formed with the TMVI Asp279 aspartic residue (Asp257 in human PS1) from one PSN monomer and the TMVII D461 aspartic residue (Asp385 in human PS1) from the other (Fig. 4, C and D). Not only did this diaspartyl group cleave the C99-APP-derived substrate at both - and -sites, but it also produced A40 and A42 peptides in the same ratio as the wtPSN, thus suggesting that a similar diaspartyl combination is responsible for APP - and -cleavages in vivo. Remarkably, the fact that in the same experimental conditions this catalytic group does not generate NICD by S3 cleavage supports the idea that different requirements have to be met for APP and Notch cleavages, in agreement with previous reports (25, 27 to 29, 63). In addition, our results suggest that presenilinase activity requires the formation of a diaspartyl group between the NTF and CTF from the same monomer. According to our results, endoproteolytic processing is no longer a requirement for presenilin activation when co-expressing the two presenilin aspartic mutants. These presenilin aspartic mutants might adopt a slightly different conformation that would not need to retrieve exon 9 from the binding substrate site (61)..

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	81	We have ruled out some possible concerns about the reconstitution of -secretase activity in our experimental conditions on the following grounds: (i) we discarded any domain swapping between the two mutant presenilin molecules, first because this event has already been ruled out in presenilins by several authors in previous reports (26, 64, 65), and, moreover, in our case presenilin domain swapping was completely prevented, since the expressed mutants were not endoproteolytically cleaved into the NTF and CTF fragments; (ii) even if considering some residual endogenous presenilin-dependent or -independent -secretase activity after RNAi treatment and the fact that not all presenilin mutants might be equally effective in replacing this residual activity, the fact that each individual mutant abrogated -secretase activity, as measured by loss of A, AICD, and NICD production (Fig. 4, C, D, and G), whereas in the same experimental conditions co-expression of the two mutants restored between 30 and 50% of the wild-type activity (in accordance with the heterodimer PSND279A/PSND461A representing only one-half of the dimer population), indicated that genetic complementation between the two mutants occurred, and a functional diaspartyl group was assembled in trans; and finally, (iii) this reconstituted -secretase activity only cleaved the APP-derived substrates, whereas the activity on Notch-derived ones was completely impaired. Were other presenilin-independent activities to account for the APP processing but not for Notch cleavage, these activities should be detected in all of the mutant controls, which obviously was not the case..

We concluded that the reconstituted presenilin catalytic function was due to the bona fide formation of a diaspartyl group in trans at the interface of the two mutant presenilins, each providing one different aspartic residue. Our results are also completely consistent and provide a feasible explanation for the recent report on the rescue of presenilinase and -secretase activity on a C99 substrate by co-expression of an inactive C-terminally truncated presenilin mutant with wild-type CTF, but not by a mutant aspartic CTF, in PS-deficient cells (54)..

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	85	Based on our results, we propose a model in which the catalytic diaspartyl groups responsible for cleaving these substrates partially overlap within the same presenilin -secretase complex. Thus, the Asp257/Asp385 group formed in trans at the interface of the two presenilin monomers would cleave a C99 substrate, whereas the Asp257/Asp385 group in cis between the NTF and CTF moieties of the same molecule would process an NECN substrate (Fig. 5). The experimental approach with the two aspartic mutants did not allow to test the second possibility. This hypothesis is consistent with the divergent transmembrane sequences of both substrates, which, according to our model, would be cleaved by different diaspartyl combinations. It should be noted that the observations presented here are fully compatible with the recently proposed models in which -secretase may contain separated docking and catalytic sites (26, 35, 66 to 68). Other scenarios are also compatible with our observations. One is that the conformation of the HA-PSND279A/Myc-PSND461A heterodimer hinders the access to the catalytic site of the NECN substrate, but not that of the C99. In this context, if the conformations of the mutants were slightly different from the wild-type protein, mutations on the catalytic site could alter in turn the accessibility to the binding site, allowing the access of C99 but still hampering that of the NECN substrate. A second alternative might be that the mutant presenilins are addressed to a cellular compartment different from the wild type, allowing access to the APP-derived substrate while precluding that of the Notch substrate. Another alternative is that recognition and/or cleavage of the NECN substrate requires at least three aspartic residues of the presenilin dimer, similar to what has been suggested (26). Finally, other authors have proposed that different isoforms (PS-1, PS-2, aph-1aL, aph-1aS, and aph-1b) assemble in different -secretase complexes to provide substrate specificity (40). This does not apply to our model because the components of the -secretase complex are encoded by single copy genes in Drosophila (2). Notwithstanding, and irrespective of the number and composition of the -secretase complexes, once the substrate has reached the catalytic center, it may be cleaved by a specific diaspartyl group, which could differ between different substrates..

All of these FAD mutations alter the A42/40 ratio, whereas their effects on NICD and AICD production are more variable. According to our model, each presenilin FAD mutation would have a specific effect on each diaspartyl combination, thus entailing a shift in cleavage site preferences or even substrate affinity..

Remarkably, another of its members, the signal peptide peptidase, has been recently reported to form a homodimer that is labeled by inhibitors directed against the active site of -secretase (71). The finding that two aspartyl I-CLiPs, signal peptide peptidase and presenilins, function as dimers that are recognized by the same active site inhibitor suggests that dimerization may be a general requirement for function or regulation of this family of proteases and provides new insights on how regulated intramembraneous proteolysis may take place..

In the majority of these pedigrees, PS-1 and [beta]-amyloid precursor protein ([beta]APP) gene mutations had been excluded. While no additional PS-2 pathogenic mutations were detected, four silent nucleotide substitutions and alternative splicing of nucleotides 1338-1340 (Glu325) were observed. Analysis of additional members of a pedigree known to segregate a Met239Val mutation in PS-2 revealed that the age of onset of symptoms is highly variable (range 45-88 years). This variability is not attributable to differences in ApoE genotypes. These results suggest (i) that, in contrast to mutations in PS-1, mutations in PS-2 are a relatively rare cause of FAD; (ii) that other genetic or environmental factors modify the AD phenotype associated with PS-2 mutations; and (iii) that still other FAD susceptibility genes remain to be identified.

Analysis of a number of large data sets have revealed that missense mutations in the presenilin I (PS-1) gene are a frequent cause of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), accounting for perhaps as much as 50% of all cases of early onset FAD (1 ,2 ,4 -6 ). In order to determine the frequency of mutations in the presenilin II (PS-2) gene, we undertook a survey for mutations in the open reading frame (ORF) of the PS-2 gene in 60 pedigrees with FAD. The disease in these families was characterized by the occurrence of AD consistent with the NINDS-ADRDA criteria in at least three closely related subjects, often in more than one generation. In these pedigrees, the age at onset (range: 35-82 years; 36 with mean age at onset  < = 64 years; 14 with mean age at onset  > = 65 years; 10 with insufficient reliable data on age at onset) overlapped that observed in the pedigrees with known PS-2 mutations (onset between 45 and 72 years). To determine the penetrance of PS-2 mutations, we also examined several additional members of the FLO10 pedigree previously described with the Met239Val missense mutation in the PS-2 gene (2 ). Our data suggest that missense mutations in the PS-2 gene are a rare cause of AD and that these missense mutations may be subject to the modifying action of other genes or environmental influences.

Specific screening just for the Asn141Ile and Met239Val mutations in a supplemental set of genomic DNA samples from affected probands of 81 Swedish FAD pedigrees also failed to identify further instances of either mutation. However, although no pathogenic nucleotide sequence differences were observed, four `silent' nucleotide substitutions were detected (T - >  C at 626 bp/codon 23; C - >  T at 806 bp/codon 147; C - >  T at 1571 bp/codon 402; and G - >  A at 1670 bp/codon 435-sequence numbering from Accession no. L44577). All of these substitutions occurred at the third nucleotide position of a codon, and would therefore be predicted not to cause a change in the amino acid sequence. A fifth sequence variant-the variable presence of nucleotides 1338-1340 encoding the Glu325 residuewas found in transcripts from most tissues. Transcripts with and without nucleotides 1338-1340, which reflects the use of an alternate splice donor sequence, were of approximately equal abundance in brain, fibroblasts and leukocytes..

Surprisingly, this subject was aged 87 years and had had no evidence for cognitive or memory impairment on serial follow-up over several years until age 84 years when she was noted to become mildly demented, and is now profoundly demented (Mini Mental Status Examination score 4/30) with clinical features that sustain a diagnosis of probable AD by the NINDS-ADRDA criteria. A review of clinical data on additional members of the extended pedigree also uncovered two other subjects in the direct lineage of the family who had either historical evidence for late onset AD (subject I-2, the affected grandfather of III-20 who died at 75 years with dementia) or who currently have clinical features consistent with probable AD using the NINDS-ADRDA criteria (subject III-39 onset at 88 years). We and others have previously reported that the genotype at the Apolipoprotein E gene can modulate the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with the Val717Ile mutation in [beta]APP (7 ,8 ). However, in the FLO10 family with the Met239Val mutation in PS-2, ApoE genotypes do not correlate with age of onset (Table 1 ). Thus, the very elderly symptomatic subject III-20 (onset 84 years) has the same ApoE genotype ([epsilon]3/[epsilon]3) as three other affected carriers of the Met239Val mutation, all of whom developed symptoms at a younger age (onset 45-72 years). Moreover, the affected carrier IV-21, with the ApoE genotype of [epsilon]3/[epsilon]4 developed symptoms at an age (48 years) similar to that of his affected sibling IV-18 with an ApoE genotype of [epsilon]3/[epsilon]3 (onset = 45 years) (Table 1 , Fig. 1 ). Our sample size is too small to draw reliable conclusions about the presence or absence of interactions between the ApoE genotype and the Asn141Ile mutation (Table 1 )..

0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	15	Although the large cadre of FAD pedigrees reported here does not represent an unbiased survey, the paucity of missense mutations in the PS-2 gene amongst FAD pedigrees in our data set suggests that, in contrast to mutations in the ORF of PS-1, mutations in the ORF of this gene are a rare cause of FAD, at least in Caucasian populations. We can confidently exclude mutations in intronic sequences associated with RNA splice sites [indeed only one such mutation which affects splicing of exon 10 of PS-1 has been found in FAD affected subjects (T. Miki et al., in preparation)]. However, until the 5' UTR and 3' UTR sequences have been searched for pathogenic mutations, we cannot exclude the formal possibility that mutations might exist in these sequences in some of our pedigrees. Nevertheless, there are two corollaries to the conclusion that PS-2 ORF mutations are rare. First, unless a phenotype uniquely associated with or at least enriched in subjects with PS-2 mutants can be found, screening programs for mutations in the ORF of PS-2 are likely to have a low yield. Second, and more importantly, other as yet unidentified FAD susceptibility loci must exist..

0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	18	The age of symptom onset or current age of PS-2 mutation carriers are displayed along with each subject's ApoE genotype..
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	19	The other conclusion to be drawn from our data is that the age of symptom onset in subjects with PS-2 mutations is generally older (45-88 years) than that observed for most PS-1 mutations (25-65 years), and is highly variable even amongst affected members of the same pedigree. This contrasts sharply with the experience with PS-1 mutations, where the age of onset is generally quite similar amongst affected members of the same family, and often amongst members of different families with the same mutation (1 ,2 ,4 -6 ). Because to date all subjects with AD in the FLO10 pedigree have inherited the Met239Val mutation, it is unlikely that the late onset cases represent phenocopies and/or that it represents a polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with a nearby pathogenic mutation. Consequently, the most parsimonious explanation is that there is a single cause of the disease (the Met239Val mutation) and that the phenotype is modified by other genetic or environmental factors. The limited number of subjects with the Asn141Ile mutation in our data set prevents rigorous conclusions about any interactions between the ApoE genotype and this mutation. However, analysis of a larger data set by T. Bird and G. Schellenberg also reveals no obvious interaction between the genotypes at ApoE and PS-2 Asn141Ile (manuscript in preparation). This absence of a close correlation between the ApoE genotype and age of symptom onset in subjects with PS-2 mutation has two implications. First, in view of parallel observations showing no apparent interaction between ApoE genotype and mutations in PS-1 (7 ,9 ,10 ), together with the structural and amino acid sequence similarities of the PS-1 and PS-2 proteins (1 -3 ), it is likely that the functional effect of PS-1 and PS-2 mutations are similar and are either remote from the functional effect of the ApoE [epsilon]4 allele, or affect a biochemical pathway leading to AD which is different from that influenced by ApoE [epsilon]4. Second, the variation in age of onset in PS-2 mutation carriers argues that other modifying environmental or genetic factors (e.g. other polymorphisms within the presenilin genes or differences in other genes) must exist. The nature of these other factors remains to be determined. However, if these modifying factors can be identified, they might be exploitable as a therapeutic tool. MATERIALS AND METHODS.

All subjects provided informed consent using institutionally approved protocols. The diagnosis of AD was made in affected pedigree members by direct clinical examination and standard laboratory procedures which met or exceeded the stringency of the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (11 ,12 ). Evidence of AD in deceased family members was ascertained through the investigation of medical and family records as previously described (13 ). Additional FAD pedigree samples were obtained from the Cornell Institute (Camden, NJ) (N = 4) and from the Indiana University Alzheimer's Disease DNA Bank (Indianapolis, IN) (N = 6)..

0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	23	Mutations were sought in the ORF of the PS-1 gene (47/60 pedigrees) and in exon 16 and 17 of the [beta]APP gene (51/60 pedigrees) using the methods previously described (1 ,14 ,15 ). The PS-2 gene ORF was investigated in the North American and Italian pedigrees by isolating complimentary DNA fragments by amplification using RT-PCR and the oligonucleotide primer sequences and reaction conditions as previously described (2 ). In the French families, RT-PCR was performed using primers F1: 5'-caggaaacagctatgaccgagctgaccctcaaatacgg and F2: 5'-tgtaaaacgacggccagtgagatcatacacagagatgg to recover codons 85-257, and primers F3: 5'-caggaaacagctatgacctcaagtacctcccagagtgg and F4: 5'-tgtaaaacgacggccagtagcctgtggcacaccatgtc to recover codons 251-448. The nucleotide sequence of the RT-PCR products for each affected pedigree member was determined using fluorescent dye terminator or dye primer cycle sequencing. Mutations were detected by analysis of the resultant chromatograms for heterozygous nucleotidesubstitutions using both direct inspection and the Factura (ver 1.2.0) and the Sequence Navigator (ver 1.0.1b15) software packages ABI, Foster City, CA..
