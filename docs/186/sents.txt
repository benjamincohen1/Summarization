0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	5	Received June 13, 1997; Revised and Accepted August 13, 1997.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	6	We report a novel mutation in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP I716V) which probably leads to familial early onset Alzheimer's disease with an onset age in the mid 50s.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Cells transfected with cDNAs bearing this mutation produce more A[beta]1-42(43) than those transfected with wild-type APP and this effect is additive with that of the previously reported APP V717I mutation thus providing a novel approach for further increasing A[beta]1-42(43) in model systems.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	8	Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) that cause early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) have previously been identified (1 ).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Those which lead solely to AD have been reported at two sites: at codon 717 and a double mutation at codons 670/1 (K/M670/1N/L) (for review see ref.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These mutations, and the presenilin mutations which also lead to FAD, have in common the feature that they increase the concentration of A[beta] ending at A[beta]42(43) (2 -8 ).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Here we report the identification of a novel mutation in APP which is associated with an Alzheimer phenotype and show that it too results in an increased extracellular concentration of A[beta]42(43).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	12	Here we report the identification of a new mutation in the APP gene (I716V) and demonstrate that this mutation also increases the relative concentration of A[beta]1-42(43) in both transfected cells and in plasma, providing additional support for the hypothesis that alterations in A[beta] concentration are a critical and early feature in the development of AD.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Further, we demonstrate an additive increase in the relative concentration of A[beta]1-42(43) from cells transfected with constructs containing both the I716V and the V717I mutations.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This finding provides a novel approach for further increasing A[beta]1-42(43) concentration in model systems.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	15	All the families with AD caused by APP mutations have disease onset ages from 45-60 years: most typically, with an onset age in the mid-50s.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In this context, the family we report here, in which the mean documented onset age was ~53 years, was a candidate for having an APP mutation.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Sequencing revealed a mutation changing the predicted amino acid at codon 716 from isoleucine to valine.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This mutation is likely to be pathogenic due to its proximity to the previously identified V717I mutation and it has not previously been observed in any of the hundreds of normal samples that we and others have previously sequenced.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The only other living affected family member did not wish to be sampled and this precluded segregation analysis of the mutation.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	20	A common feature of early onset FAD-linked mutations is to increase the concentration of A[beta] ending at A[beta]42(43).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	21	 To determine whether the I716V mutation also affected the extracellular concentration of A[beta]1-42(43), we performed transient transfection analysis in both CHO and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The results obtained from a representative experiment are shown in Table 1 .
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Relative to wild-type and the vector control, the I716V mutant cDNA caused a 30-60% increase in the proportion of A[beta]1-42(43) in both of the cell lines examined.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This increase was similar to the effects of the V717I mutation analyzed in parallel in these series of experiments and as reported previously (3 ,8 ).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Importantly, the increase in the absolute concentration of A[beta]1-42(43) produced by I716V transfected cells was observed even when the absolute concentrations of A[beta]1-40 were essentially identical.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In order to both increase the `n' number for statistical analysis and account for variance in transfection efficiency between experiments we focused our subsequent analysis on the ratio of A[beta]1-42(43) to A[beta]1-40 as this has previously been shown to be elevated invariably in both the APP (V717I) and the presenilin mutations (2 -8 ).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The ratios obtained from three additional independent transient transfections in both HEK 293 and CHO cells have been combined with the ratios obtained from the experiment in Table 1 to produce Figure 1 .
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	28	 These results demonstrate an ~2-fold increase in the ratio of A[beta]1-42(43) to A[beta]1-40 when compared with the wild-type control (P = 0.

0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	33	 These data show that the I716V and the V717I mutations increase the proportion of A[beta]1-42(43) and that the double mutant I716V/V717I increases the proportion of A[beta]1-42(43) more than each mutant individually.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The ratio (%) shows [A[beta]1-42(43)]/[A[beta]1-40] as a percentage.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The effect of I716V on the ratio of A[beta]1-42(43)/Ab1-40 compiled from four independent experiments.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The ratio represents the [A[beta]1-42(43)]/[A[beta]1-40] expressed as a percentage.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	37	We have previously reported elevations in plasma A[beta]42(43) concentration in patients with FAD-linked mutations (3 ).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The availability of only a single living identified carrier of the I716V mutation precluded an in depth analysis of plasma A[beta] concentration in this kindred.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	39	 An increase in the absolute concentration of A[beta]42(43) was however observed in the plasma from this patient when compared with the average concentration of five non-demented, control subjects analyzed in parallel (Table 1 ).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In fact, this individual had the highest concentration of A[beta]42(43) in this series despite having the second lowest concentration of A[beta]1-40.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Thus, this mutation causes a clear increase in the absolute concentration of A[beta]42(43) in vivo.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	42	Thus, mutations at adjacent residues in APP, I716V and V717I, result in similar increases in the relative concentration of A[beta]1-42(43).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Due to the proximity of these mutations and the nature of the amino acid changes we were interested in exploring the effect of the combination of these mutations on the A[beta]42 phenotype.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	44	 To address this question we constructed a cDNA containing both the I716V and V717I mutations in the pcDNA3 vector.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Our analysis of cells transiently transfected with this artificial double mutant construct demonstrated an increase in the ratio of A[beta]1-42(43) to A[beta]1-40 when compared with each individual mutation either separately (P = 0.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	46	 This feature may be useful in designing constructs which maximize A[beta]1-42(43) concentration for modeling the disease process.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	47	In conclusion, the results reported here extend the sites at which pathogenic APP mutations have been observed to five.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Importantly, these pathogenic mutations continue to follow the established pattern that they increase the extracellular concentration of A[beta]1-42(43).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Thus, these results provide further support for the hypothesis that alterations in the concentration of A[beta] play an early and critical role in the pathogenesis of AD.

0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The diagnosis was `probable AD' (15 ).

0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Her maternal grandmother also had probable AD with an uncertain age of onset and death.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The clinical features (age of onset, slow progression of disease and preservation of social graces) were reminiscent of the first family, F23, in which I717V was discovered (16 ): indeed the similarity was so pronounced that exon 17 of the APP gene was sequenced immediately.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	69	Exon 17 of the APP gene was sequenced as previously described, except that a Pharmacia ALF automated sequencer was used.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	70	 DNA sequencing revealed a heterozygote A - >  G transversion at codon 716 changing the predicted amino acid sequence from isoleucine (ATC) to valine (GTC).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Resequencing in the opposite orientation revealed the corresponding change.

0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Screening for this change in the proband confirmed the alteration and failed to find this change in a further 50 normals.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	75	 In addition, this exon of the APP gene has been sequenced by our group on the order of 500 times without finding this, or other changes except in cases where AD was segregating as an autosomal dominant disorder with an onset age in the 50s.

0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	78	 To evaluate the effect of mutant APP cDNAs on A[beta] concentrations we employed a transient transfection paradigm coupled with the well characterized BAN50/BA27 and BAN50/BC05 sandwich ELISA systems to determine the extracellular concentration of A[beta]1-40 and A[beta]1-42(43), respectively (Table 1 ).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Cells were transfected with the pcDNA3 vector alone or with pcDNA3 containing APP695 wild-type, APP695 (I716V), APP695 (V717I), or APP695 (I716V,V717I) using DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim) for 293 cells and Lipofectamine (Gibco BRL laboratories) for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at DNA concentrations previously determined to yield maximal transfection efficiency in these cell types (data not shown).

0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The fresh medium was conditioned for 24-48 h to facilitate the measurement of A[beta] by sandwich ELISA.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Due to variation in transfection efficiency we focused our analysis on the ratio of A[beta]1-42(43)to A[beta]1-40.

0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	3	The -amyloid precursor protein (APP)1 undergoes a series of proteolytic processing events (Fig.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	4	 One processing event, which is mediated sequentially first by -secretase and then by -secretase, generates several proteolytic fragments, including a 40-42-amino acid fragment termed A and a number of C-terminal fragments (CTFs) that contain the cytoplasmic tail of APP.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	5	 These CTFs have been variously termed "-stubs," "-stubs," or "APP intracellular domain" (AICD).
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Detailed analysis of these products has revealed that the cleavage events that give rise to the C terminus of A occur after residues 40 or 42 of the -secretase stub (Fig.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, those that give rise to the predominant, stable CTFs have an N terminus at residues 49, 50, or 52, which are located 2-5 residues inside the cytoplasmic membrane boundary (1-7).
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These latter cleavage events and the S3-cleavage of Notch occur at approximately the same position relative to the inner surface of the membrane (i.

0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	139	 The reduction in S3-cleavage of Notch is modest, which provides an explanation for why FAD-associated mutations in PS1 do not have clinical evidence of embryonic defects in humans, who are usually heterozygous for PS1 mutations, and for why transgenes encoding FAD-linked PS1 mutants are able to rescue the Notch phenotype of PS1/ mice (27).
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	140	 (We are, however, aware of one case with a compound heterozygote mutation in PS1 (M146V/S365T) in which the affected proband did have several minor congenital malformations (28)).
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Our data are also in accord with previously published data indicating that when the C.

0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	143	Finally, the reciprocal relationship between 42-secretase and the -secretase/S3-cleavage suggests that the molecular events leading to the production of A peptide are probably more complex than a single proteolytic cleavage.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	144	 It seems likely that both the -secretase and the -/S3-cleavage functions are presenilin-dependent.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	145	 However, it remains unclear whether both - and -secretase cleavages are necessary for the generation of A, and if so, in which order these cleavage events occur.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	146	 The fact that an authentic -stub (containing residues 43-99) has never been observed has been taken to support the view that -cleavage may be the initial and necessary cleavage followed by a carboxyl-exopeptidase degradation back to residue 42.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	147	 However, our data suggest that these two activities are more likely to be separate events.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Indeed, the most parsimonious explanation for our data is that there are two pathways: a physiological pathway mediating - and S3-cleavage (to generate signal transduction molecules such as AICD and NICD) and a default pathway that generates A42.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	149	 These functionally distinct pathways, however, could still be subserved by the same catalytic machinery.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Thus, in the absence of the presenilin complex, neither pathway would be active.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	151	 However, functional modulation of the presenilin complex (for instance, by missense mutations or by post-translational modification of the presenilins themselves) or of other components of the presenilin complex (e.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	152	 glycosylation of nicastrin) might alter the relative balance of - and -cleavage pathways.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	153	 We cannot, of course, preclude the alternate possibility that distinct structural components are involved in these two pathways.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Our data, in agreement with previously published data, show that although many missense mutations in the substrate for -/-secretase cleavage (C99-APP) can alter A production, they do not modulate -cleavage (1, 29).
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Such observations are compatible with the hypotheses that 1) the molecular mechanisms of substrate:catalysis interactions for A generation and -stub/NICD production are different and 2) PS1 mutations might primarily affect a regulatory function rather than directly execute catalytic cleavage.

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	47	 When the initial cell lysates of HEK293 cells expressing APPSwedish were prepared using 1% CHAPSO as the solubilizing detergent, at least two distinct PS1 immunoreactive spots were identified at 440 and 670 kDa, together with a smear pattern at even higher masses (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The 440- and 670-kDa complexes both contained maturely glycosylated nicastrin, aph-1, pen-2, PS1-NTF, and PS1-CTF.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	49	 However, only the 670-kDa complex contained APP-CTFs.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	50	 These observations are unlikely to simply represent idiosyncrasies of the gel electrophoresis methodology because a broad distribution of complexes ranging from 150 to 670 kDa were also seen when these lysates were resolved on glycerol velocity gradients (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Because the resolution of individual complexes is less robust on unidimensional glycerol velocity gradients, and because the glycerol velocity gradients resolve proteins according to relative buoyancy rather than by charge and mass as in gel electrophoretic separations, the predicted mass measurements are not identical between the 2D gel studies and the velocity gradients.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Nevertheless, in general agreement with the result of the 2D gels, immature nicastrin and one of two peaks of aph-1 are enriched in lower molecular weight fractions at 100 to 200 kDa (Fig.

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	60	 These studies confirm the existence of a low molecular mass (150 kDa) complex enriched in aph-1 and immature nicastrin (lanes 3 and 4) and one or more higher molecular weight complexes (200 to 670 kDa) containing PS1, and varying amounts of mature nicastrin (NCT), aph-1, and pen-2 (lanes 5 to 11).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Like the 2D gel studies, the 670-kDa complexes (lanes 8 to 11) were essentially absent when membranes were solubilized in 1% digitonin.

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Compared with control fractions incubated at 0  degrees C (top left), -stubs were actively generated by CHAPSO-solubilized fractions 5 to 6, 7 to 8, 9 to 10, and 11 to 12 incubated at 37  degrees C for 4 h (middle left); the highest specific activity relative to starting amount of PS1 was in fractions 9 to 10 and 11 to 12 (lower left).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	64	 PS1 complexes from digitonin-solubilized fractions failed to co-immunoprecipitate APP-CTFs and consequently failed to generate -stubs (right).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The failure to generate -stubs by digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes could not be reversed by adding additional exogenous APP-CTFs (see Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	66	 3D), and addition of digitonin to CHAPSO-solubilized PS1 complexes (with docked substrate) also resulted in loss of -secretase activity (data not shown), arguing that digitonin alters the conformation and/or componentry of PS1 complex, rendering it non-functional.

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Pooled fractions containing proteins with molecular mass less than 600 kDa (fractions 3 to 6 or 3 to 8) had less -secretase activity than did fractions with proteins of molecular mass of greater than 600 kDa (fractions 9 to 12).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	70	 D, addition of exogenous substrate (APP-C99) resulted in robust generation of -stubs in CHAPSO-solubilized PS1 complexes (CHP) incubated at 37  degrees C, but failed to induce -stub production at 4  degrees C (negative control) in digitonin-solubilized membranes (DIG) at any temperature.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	71	 This result argues that the absence of -stub generation by digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes (B, right) is caused by the failure of digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes to dock -secretase substrates.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	72	  The 150 kDa aph-1-nicastrin complex is unlikely to subserve catalytic activity because it is present in PS1 to / to  cells, which do not support -secretase activity.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	73	 From these experiments alone, it is not possible to conclude which, if any, of the other higher mass complexes are associated with functional -secretase activity.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Attempts to measure the activity of specific complexes isolated from the 2D gels were not successful, presumably because of the low abundance of properly folded complexes being recovered.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	75	 To circumvent this problem, we elected to use three complementary strategies, which might, when taken together, indirectly infer which of these complexes were necessary for functional activity.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	76	 These three approaches were: 1) direct ascertainment of functional -secretase activity from glycerol velocity gradient fractions; 2) analysis of the differential effects of detergents on -secretase activity, complex composition, and complex size; and 3) analysis of the differential effects on PS1 mutations on -secretase activity, complex composition, and complex size.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	77	To estimate the -secretase activity of these complexes, we used a cell-free assay (16) to investigate the generation of -stubs by anti-PS1 immunopurified membranes that were solubilized in 1% CHAPSO and that had then been resolved by size on the glycerol velocity gradients.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The highest specific -secretase activity relative to the amount of PS1-NTF in each fraction was found in the higher mass fractions ( > 500 kDa) of the glycerol velocity gradient (specific activity, 34.

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	81	Previous in vitro studies have shown that CHAPSO is the optimum detergent for preserving -secretase activity in cell-free membrane preparations and that -secretase activity is significantly reduced by digitonin and completely abolished by Triton X-100, n-octyl glucoside, and many other detergents (18, 19).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	82	 When the glycerol velocity and 2D gel electrophoretic experiments were repeated using digitonin, there was a significant (100-fold) reduction in the abundance of the high molecular weight presenilin complexes on both the 2D gel electrophoreses (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	83	 2, right) and on the glycerol velocity fractionation experiments (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Furthermore, these fractions contain very little co-immunoprecipitating APP-CTFs and failed to generate significant quantities of -stubs in the cell-free -secretase assay (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	85	 To confirm that the absence of -secretase activity in digitonin-solubilized fractions was caused by failure of docking and cleavage of APP-CTFs by the digitonin-solubilized complexes (as opposed to artifacts such as simple degradation of APP-CTFs during the assay), we performed two additional experiments.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	86	 First, we immunopurified CHAPSO-solubilized PS1 complexes, and split the product into two aliquots.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	87	 One aliquot was then submitted directly for -secretase assay, whereas digitonin was added to the other aliquot to a final concentration of 0.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	88	25%, and then submitted for -secretase assay.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	89	 No -stubs were generated by the aliquot containing digitonin (data not shown).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In the second experiment, we simply added additional purified APP-C99 to CHAPSO-solubilized and to digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Again, despite the abundant presence of substrate, the digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes failed to generate -stubs (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Taken together, these experiments suggest that digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes have undergone either a conformational shift and/or have lost a substrated adaptor protein.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	93	 When the presenilin complexes were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 or in 1% n-octyl glucoside (neither of which support -secretase activity), the very high molecular weight presenilin complex species were essentially abolished and only monomeric species were found (data not shown).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	94	Functional -secretase activity is also modulated by selected mutations in the presenilin proteins.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	95	 In particular, mutation of either or both of the two aspartyl residues within membrane-embedded hydrophobic domains (PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A) have been associated with loss of proteolytic activity (20 to 22).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	96	 We therefore investigated the structure and relative abundance of presenilin complexes isolated from cells overexpressing either wild-type PS1 or the PS1 D385A loss-of-function mutant.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	97	 We have shown previously that the PS1 D385A mutation causes a reduction in the abundance of higher MW species on glycerol velocity gradient fractionation (23).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	98	 We have also shown that this reduction is not caused by the simple failure of endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 (23).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Thus, high molecular weight complexes comparable in size with those of wild-type PS1-NTF/CTFs were observed in cells expressing the holoprotein of the PS1 Exon 9 deletion mutant (which causes increased 42-secretase activity but impaired PS1 endoproteolysis) (23).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	100	 In agreement with these prior observations, in the current 2D gel analyses, the PS1 D385A mutation was again associated with an altered distribution of complexes and components (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Thus, the 670-kDa complex was absent in digitonin-solubilized lysates of PS1 D385A-expressing cells, which displayed only the 440-kDa complex, and monomeric bands for nicastrin (110 kDa) and the PS1 D385A holoprotein (65 kDa) were observed (Fig 4A, right).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Similar but less profound changes in relative abundance of the 670- and 440-kDa complexes were also apparent after CHAPSO solubilization (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Thus, in cells expressing wild-type PS1 (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	104	 4, B, left, and C to F), there was greater abundance of the 670-kDa complex relative to the 440-kDa complexes (670 kDa/470 kDa ratio, 1.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	105	 However, in PS1 D385A overexpressing cells (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	106	 4, B, right, and C to F), there was a significant loss of the 670-kDa complex and a corresponding overabundance of the 440-kDa complex (670 kDa/440 kDa ratio, 0.

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	114	 C to F, to confirm the results of direct visual interpretations, the intensity profiles of Western blotting signals were plotted using NIH Image software (solid line, wild-type PS1; dotted line, PS1 D385A).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Peak heights were then computed for the 440- and 670-kDa complexes, and these data were then used to compare the effects of detergents and PS1 mutations using the 670 kDa/440 kDa peak height ratio.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	116	 In wild-type PS1-expressing cells, the 670-kDa complex predominated, whereas in PS1 D385A mutant cells, the 440-kDa complex predominated (p  <  0.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	117	There are two potential explanations for our results.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	118	 The first and most straightforward explanation is that these complexes reflect the evolution of the presenilin complexes as they are assembled.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	119	 The lower mass (150 and 440 kDa) complexes might then represent initial and intermediary complexes, whereas the low abundance, high mass complexes (670 kDa) could represent functional complexes that contain either additional components or contain the four known components in a higher order stoichiometry (e.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Direct experiments analyzing the composition of these complexes will be required to resolve this possibility.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	121	 There are, however, two caveats to this hypothesis.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	122	 First, small, but measurable amounts of the 670-kDa complexes are still present in CHAPSO lysates of PS1 D385A cells (although these complexes are considerably reduced in abundance relative to the 440-kDa complexes).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	123	 This does not completely negate our hypothesis that the 670-kDa complexes are the functional conform because a substantial proportion of the PS1 D385A molecules are clearly in an aberrant conformational 440-kDa state in CHAPSO and nearly all of the PS1 D385A molecules are in the 400-kDa complex in digitonin.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	124	 As a result, it is probable that the PS1 D385A molecules in the 670-kDa complexes in CHAPSO do not have an entirely normal conform.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	125	 The second caveat concerning our postulated hierarchy of complexes arises from the observation that PS1 D385A-expressing cells do not assemble a robust nicastrin-aph-1 150-kDa complex.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	126	 It could be argued that the 150 kDa nicastrin:aph-1 complex is not a precursor complex as we have postulated, but represents a downstream catabolic product of the 440- or 670-kDa complexes.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	127	 The stable presence of the 150-kDa complex in PS1 to / to  cells makes this hypothesis unlikely.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	128	 An alternate explanation for the disappearance of the 150-kDa complex in PS1 D385A cells, but not in PS1 to / to  cells, is that the 150-kDa complex could have a dual role.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	129	 This complex could be involved in presenting new nicastrin molecules to the 440-kDa complexes, and involved in recovering and re-presenting used nicastrin molecules back to the 440-kDa complex.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	130	 It is conceivable that in the presence of the PS1 D385A mutant, all available aph-1 might become locked-up in the PS1 D385A mutant 440-kDa complex, which fails to further mature, thereby causing disappearance of the 150 kDa nicastrin-aph-1 complex.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	131	A second observation of note in our results is the fact that the C-terminal fragments of APP arising from - and -secretase cleavage of the APP holoprotein (which are the substrates for presenilin-dependent -secretase cleavage) are not uniformly present in all of the presenilin complexes (see Figs.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	132	 In fact, the APP C-terminal stubs are most abundant in complexes associated with functional -secretase activity.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The increase in apparent molecular mass between the non-functional complexes and the functional complexes cannot be accounted for by the simple addition of one molecule of C-terminal APP stubs per complex (although we cannot exclude the possibility that multiple APP stubs are docked onto functional complexes).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	134	 However, the differential presence of APP-CTFs raises the intriguing and more plausible possibility that detergents and mutants associated with loss of -secretase activity have either: 1) altered the conformation and/or complex stoichiometry in a way that precludes efficient docking of substrates or 2) perturbed the binding of adapter molecules that might be required to allow substrate docking.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	135	 In keeping with this hypothesis, recent cross-competition assays with different classes of -secretase inhibitors has supported the notion that the substrate binding and catalytic sites of -secretase may be physically separate and that correct conformational shifts are required to bring bound-substrate into the catalytic site (24).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	136	In conclusion, our experiments suggest that the maturation and functional deployment of the presenilin proteins is more complex than has previously been thought.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Our data raise the possibility that additional components may exist in the high molecular mass functional complexes.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Our results also require a more detailed assessment as to whether all of the substrates that undergo presenilin dependent proteolysis are dependent on the same set of presenilin complexes or whether there are specialized complexes subserving cleavage of specific proteins.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	139	 For instance, it is conceivable that the complexes may differ in componentry according to their subcellular distribution (e.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	140	 lipid-rich raft domains, plasma membrane, endosomal-lysosomal pathway, or autophagic vacuoles (25 to 29)).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	141	 If this were the case, such site-specific composition of the complex might confer either substrate specificity or preferred proteolytic cleavage sites within transmembrane domains and might therefore be potentially exploited therapeutically.

0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	6	Abstract Millions of patients suffer from Alzheimer's disease, and intensive efforts to find a cure for this devastating disorder center on the proteases, which release the deadly amyloid ss-peptide from its precursor.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The cutting procedure is thought to be cholesterol dependent and strategies to lower cholesterol as therapeutic treatment are under intensive investigation.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Recent findings suggest that the complete proteolytic machinery required for amyloid ss-peptide generation is located within lipid rafts.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Data by Dotti and colleagues (Abad-Rodriguez et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	10	, 2004), in this issue, suggest that rafts isolate the cutting machinery away from its deadly substrate.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These findings describe a novel mechanism for controlling proteolytic activity by building a lipid boundary between proteases and their substrates.

0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	13	In all developed countries, humans live longer and longer.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Although we all wish to enjoy increased longevity, a longer life is unfortunately associated with a dramatic increase for the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This has been widely recognized for years and numerous scientists have studied the cellular mechanisms causing AD with the goal of finally identifying targets for treatment.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Indeed, it is likely that all genes directly involved in the generation of the deadly amyloid ss-peptide (Ass), which forms the disease-defining amyloid plaques, have now been identified (Haass, 2004).
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Currently, it is clear that Ass is generated by proteolytic processing of ss-amyloid precursor protein (APP), and two amyloidogenic secretases, ss- and -secretase, are involved (Fig.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The ss-secretase, ss-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE), is a typical aspartyl protease.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	19	 -Secretase, however, is an unusual aspartyl protease complex composed of four individual proteins (presenilin, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2), with presenilin carrying the protease active site (Haass, 2004).
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	20	 -Secretase is uncommon not only in its molecular composition but also in its proteolytic activity, since it is able to cleave its substrate within the membrane (Fig.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	21	 A prerequisite of this intramembrane cut is the release of the ectodomain of APP via cleavage by BACE or -secretase.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Removal of the ectodomain by BACE results in the production of Ass following -secretase cleavage, whereas ectodomain cleavage by -secretase is nonamyloidogenic since it cuts within the Ass domain (Fig.

0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	25	 -Secretase cleavage occurs within the Ass domain and prevents amyloidogenesis.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	26	 However, a small peptide (p3) is generated by the subsequent cleavage of the C83 fragment by -secretase.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Besides p3, the large ectodomain (APPs-) is secreted.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	28	 A shorter APPs species is secreted upon cleavage by BACE (APPs-ss).
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The resulting C99 fragment is cleaved by -secretase to produce Ass.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The -secretase cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which may be involved in nuclear signaling.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	31	  Amyloidogenesis is known to be dependent on cholesterol levels (Simons et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	32	, 2001), and moreover, this seems to have a direct relevance for AD, since high cholesterol is correlated with an increased risk for the disease (Kuo et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In addition, the apolipoprotein 4 allele is known as a major genetic risk factor for AD (Corder et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	34	 At the cellular level, Ass generation was found to occur in special cholesterol-rich membrane subdomains called DRMs (detergent-resistant membranes), and lowering cholesterol levels by treatment with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitors, statins, resulted in a strong decrease in Ass production (Simons et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This is likely due in part to an increase in nonamyloidogenic cleavage by -secretase (Kojro et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In animal models, statin treatment was also associated with a significant drop in Ass load (Fassbender et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Furthermore, a clear correlation between cholesteryl-ester levels and Ass generation was reported in cultured cells (Puglielli et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	38	 More recently, it was demonstrated that inhibition of the enzyme that regulates the conversion of free cholesterol into cholesteryl-esters not only leads to a dramatic lowering of AD pathology in animal models but is also associated with a reversion of cognitive deficits (Hutter-Paier et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Not surprisingly, efforts are under way to use cholesterol-lowering drugs in patients to decrease Ass production.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Indeed, preliminary epidemiological studies and small clinical trials suggest that lowering cholesterol levels may reduce the risk for AD (Wolozin et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	41	The strong cholesterol dependency of Ass generation suggested that secretases might be located within DRMs and this may regulate the processing of APP.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	42	 (2003) demonstrated that antibody cross-linking induced BACE and APP to copatch within cholesterol-rich microdomains, and this resulted in increased Ass production.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	43	 This proposed localization of secretases is supported by the recent findings of two different laboratories.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	44	 (2004) report that they were able to identify endogenous BACE within DRMs of primary hippocampal neurons.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	45	 (2004) recently demonstrated that the completely assembled, biologically active -secretase complex consisting of the presenilin fragments APH-1, mature Nicastrin, and PEN-2 resides within DRMs.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Moreover, -secretase was found in syntaxin 6 to , syntaxin 13 to , and VAMP4-positive vesicles, demonstrating that -secretase accumulates in the DRMs of late Golgi and endosomes (Vetrivel et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	47	, 2004), exactly where BACE is thought to be biologically active (Haass et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Similarly, monomeric and oligomeric Ass were concentrated in DRMs in the brains of a mouse model for AD (Lee et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Thus, it appears that the complete Ass generating proteolytic machinery coexists within DRMs of the same vesicles.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	50	In this issue, the researchers provide a novel and unexpected explanation for why secretases are localized to cholesterol rich membrane domains.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	51	 They present data suggesting that the DRM association of BACE restricts its access to APP, which they demonstrate accumulates in detergent sensitive membrane domains outside of DRMs (see Fig.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	52	 This may indicate aberrant access of APP to DRMs, and hence aberrant Ass production, during AD or it may indicate that even under physiological conditions some APP molecules come into close contact with DRMs.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The latter seems more likely, since Ass is a physiologically normal product and not produced just in the brains of AD patients (Haass, 2004).
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	54	 These findings also demonstrate a completely novel cellular mechanism for controlling protease activity.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Cells undergo major efforts to prevent proteases from contacting proteins not destined to be digested.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	56	 This is accomplished by numerous mechanisms including synthesis of inactive proforms to be activated at appropriate sites, tagging protease substrates with ubiquitin, sequestering proteases in membrane surrounded environments (endosomes/lysosomes), or hiding the active sites of proteases within narrow tunnels (proteasomes).
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	57	 (2004) add yet another control mechanism.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	58	 They show that lipids can build an invisible boundary, corralling the -secretase complex and BACE away from their substrate, APP.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Certainly, this mechanism did not evolve to protect us from AD.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	60	 So why do the secretases concentrate within DRMs? A probable explanation is that -secretase is involved in several signaling pathways including Notch signaling (Selkoe and Kopan, 2003; Haass, 2004) and concentrating the proteolytic machinery in small membrane domains facilitates these processes.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	61	 This would, however, imply that physiological substrates such as Notch and others must gain access to DRMs, an observation yet to be made.

0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	64	  There is, however, one obvious discrepancy between the results of the current study and earlier ones that must be addressed.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	65	 (2004) demonstrate that, upon moderate lowering of cholesterol, Ass generation surprisingly increased, whereas a large body of previously published data (see above) clearly demonstrated reduced Ass generation upon cholesterol reduction.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	66	 How could that be the case, and does that mean that all previous approaches were simply wrong? The truth may be found on both sides.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The findings Dotti and colleagues (Abad-Rodriguez et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	68	, 2004) are indeed in apparent disagreement with studies showing that lowering cholesterol inhibits amyloidogenesis, both in cultured cells and in animal models (Simons et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	69	 However, in these studies, cholesterol was always strongly depleted and the cells that were used overexpressed APP.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	70	 In contrast, the current study investigated neurons, the cells most affected by the deadly activity of Ass.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Moderate reduction of cholesterol led to increased Ass levels, whereas a strong cholesterol reduction resulted in a significant drop in Ass generation (Fig.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	72	 2), similar to that observed before (Simons et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Thus, the effects of cholesterol reduction are dose dependent, and two apparently independent cellular mechanisms are affected.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	74	 A moderate reduction in cholesterol causes a disorganization of DRMs, allowing more BACE to contact APP and resulting in enhanced Ass generation (Fig.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	75	 A strong reduction in cholesterol inhibits BACE/-secretase activity and results in a dramatic drop in Ass generation, even though BACE and -secretase can now contact APP directly (Fig.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	76	 In clear contrast to this model, Ehehalt et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	77	 reported that BACE cleavage of APP occurs within lipid DRMs (Ehehalt et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	78	, 2003), This discrepancy might be due to the fact that when overexpressed a fraction of APP may be mislocalized to DRMs, and then cleaved by BACE, an observation also made by Abad-Rodriguez et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	79	 More work is needed to settle this controversy since the effects of lowering brain cholesterol on the production of endogenous Ass in mouse neurons or in human brains have not been directly demonstrated.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Although the current findings raise some interesting questions, they do not necessarily challenge cholesterol-lowering tactics as AD therapy/prevention since animal studies to date are in clear favor of this strategy (Fassbender et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Moreover, cholesterol lowering drugs are taken by numerous patients with enormous beneficial effects on cardiovascular disorders and no side effects concerning Ass generation or dementia have been reported.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Cholesterol-dependent processing of APP provides a striking example how disease-based research can dramatically advance basic knowledge in cell biology, and vice versa.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Who would have thought, only 10 years ago, that DRMs might contain and regulate the deadly machinery responsible for the most abundant human neurodegenerative disorder and that this machinery might function via a novel and totally unexpected mechanism of intramembrane proteolysis?.

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	6	Several lines of evidence have led to the hypothesis that PS is the -secretase.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	7	 First, -secretase cleavage of APP and Notch is inactivated partially in PS1-deficient cells and completely in PS1/PS2 double to deficient cells (De Strooper et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	8	, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Herreman et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Moreover, mutagenesis of one or two aspartyl residues located in transmembrane domain 6 or 7 results in dominant negative to like effects on -secretase cleavage, suggesting that these aspartates contribute to the active site of PS (Wolfe et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Some similarities with the prepilin peptidases has been taken as further evidence that the PS are proteases (Steiner et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	11	 However, the strongest argument in favor for this idea comes from the observation that several compounds that inhibit -secretase bind specifically to PS (Esler et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Nevertheless, direct proof that the PS can hydrolyze peptide bounds is still lacking.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	13	Remarkably, both Notch and APP apparently first need proteolytical trimming of their extracellular domain by TACE and -/ss-secretase, respectively, to become a substrate for PS/-secretase (De Strooper et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	14	, 2000; Struhl and Adachi, 2000).
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These proteases are located downstream in the biosynthetic pathway and therefore both Notch and APP first have to leave the ER to become a substrate for PS/-secretase.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Despite significant advances in our understanding of -secretase processing, it remains unclear how APP, after its cleavage by - or ss-secretase, becomes exposed to PS.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Moreover, Ass appears to be produced mainly in the endosomal compartment (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Hartmann et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	18	, 1997), whereas PS is abundantly present in the ER and intermediate compartment (Walter et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	19	 This problem can be summarized as "the spatial paradox" (Annaert and De Strooper, 1999) and we now tackle this problem further by analyzing the processing of a series of APP-trafficking mutants in primary cortical neurons derived from PS1+/+ or PS1-/- mice.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	20	 We analyzed the consequences of restricting APP trafficking to certain subcellular compartments for the generation of total Ass and Ass42.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Constructs tested: (a) APP with deleted cytosolic tail (APP-ct); (b) APP with a double lysine ER retention motif in its cytoplasmic tail (APP-KK); (c) APP with a cytoplasmic tail from the LDL receptor (APP-LDL); (d) APP truncated at the ss-secretase cleavage site (APP-C99); and (e) APP-C99 with a double lysine (KK) motif.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The APP-ct is poorly reinternalized and stays for longer times at the cell surface (Tienari et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The KK motif acts an ER-retrieval signal (Jackson et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	24	, 1994) and therefore APP-KK colocalizes abundantly with endogenous PS1 (Peraus et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The APP-LDL recycles between the endosomal system and the cell surface (Annaert et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	26	 APP-C99 is a direct substrate for -secretase and after addition of the KK ER retention motif (APP-C99-KK) we anticipated creating an excellent substrate for PS1/-secretase.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Overall, our data confirm the spatial paradox in the PS-is--secretase hypothesis and provide evidence that the transfer of APP-C99 in a compartment downstream of the ER is needed in addition to processed PS1 to obtain -secretase activity in primary cultures of neurons.

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	54	 The intermediate band running between Ass and p3 in cells transduced with APP-WT corresponds to the truncated Ass generated by ss-secretase cleavage at the Glu11 position (Creemers et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	55	  The reduction of ss-cleaved APP-CTF in the APP-ct to transduced wild-type neurons is accompanied by an 80% decrease in secretion of total Ass and Ass42 (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Moreover, no relative accumulation of ss-cleaved APP-CTF in PS1-/- neurons was observed.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	57	 All this can be explained by a predominant -secretase cleavage of APP-ct at or near the plasma membrane, as reflected by the increased secretion of APPs cleaved at the -secretase site and the concomitant fivefold increase in p3 secretion (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Interestingly, secretion of p3 is dramatically inhibited in the absence of PS1 (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	59	 3, bottom), indicating that -stubs generated near or at the cell surface are still substrates for PS1-dependent -secretase processing.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Therefore, the data on APP-ct and APP-LDL clearly demonstrate that PS1 is needed for normal -secretase processing in the late Golgi region, at the cell surface, and in the endosomal compartments.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	61	In contrast to the other mutants, the levels of APPs and of the COOH-terminal ss-stubs generated from APP-KK are very low, confirming the low - and ss-secretase activity in the ER (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Accordingly, the total Ass (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	63	 2 C) secretion was also strongly reduced by 90%.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	64	 However, when overexpressed in PS1-/- neurons, secretion of Ass peptides was inhibited to the same extent as observed for peptides derived from APP-WT (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	65	To circumvent the need for "preactivation" of APP-KK by - or ss-secretase, we generated APP-C99-KK, corresponding to APP truncated at the ss-secretase site (Lichtenthaler et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	66	, 1999) and containing the KK-ER retention motif.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	67	 When expressed in neurons, APP-C99-KK migrated with the same apparent molecular weight (10 kD) as the ss-stub coming from APP-WT or the APP-C99 without KK motif (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	68	 APP-C99, like APP-WT, can be processed by -secretase as reflected by the generation of -APPCTF (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	69	 APP-C99-KK, in contrast, is either not processed or processed very little by - or ss-secretase, confirming the specific retention of APP-C99-KK in the ER and cis-Golgi region.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	70	 In line with the prediction that APP-C99 does not require - or ss-secretase cleavage to become a substrate for -secretase, an estimated sevenfold increase in total Ass secretion (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	71	 This effect is also observed with Ass42, as detected by ELISA (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The -secretase cleavage of APP-C99 is strongly inhibited in the absence of PS1 (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Most surprisingly, however, was the observation that APP-C99-KK, which was also expected to be a substrate for PS1--secretase because it is retained in the ER, turned out to yield little if any Ass peptides (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	74	 It is unlikely that the KK motif directly interfered with the recognition of C99 by the -secretase complex, since the cytoplasmic tail of APP can be removed without affecting -secretase cleavage (Fig.

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Occasionally minor colocalization with ERGIC-53 could be observed (arrowheads in D to F).
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	129	  To test the hypothesis that a component of a more downstream subcellular compartment is needed to process APP-C99-KK in the ER, we treated neurons expressing APP-C99 or APP-C99-KK with brefeldin A (BFA), a drug that causes a rapid redistribution of the Golgi apparatus into the ER (Lippincott-Schwartz et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	130	 This treatment resulted in a drastic reduction in APP-C99 to derived Ass secretion, whereas no difference was observed in the case of APP-C99-KK (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	131	 However, addition of BFA resulted in a strong increase in intracellular Ass generated from APP-C99-KK, towards levels indistinguishable from those obtained in BFA-treated APP-C99 to transduced cells.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	132	 This suggests that some unknown factors required for -secretase activity are redistributed from the Golgi region to the ER, which appears to be sufficient to partially restore Ass production from APP-C99-KK.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	133	 It has been suggested that Ass generated in the endoplasmic reticulum consists mainly of Ass ending at residue 42 (Chyung et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Remarkably, although we detect little intracellular Ass under our experimental conditions (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	135	 7, A and B), treatment with BFA induces the generation of Ass peptides, ending at residue 40 as well as at residue 42 (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	136	APP-LDL expression selectively increased Ass40 secretion, as predicted from its preferential localization in the endosomes (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Peraus et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Again, in the absence of PS1, Ass generation from APP-LDL strongly decreased, demonstrating that -secretase processing of APP in the endosomes depends on PS1.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	138	 It should be noted that we have not been able to detect any endogenous PS1 immunoreactivity at the cell surface or in the endosomes of the neuronal cells used in the current study (Annaert et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	139	We next investigated whether we could increase -secretase processing of APP in the ER and the intermediate compartment, which contain the bulk of PS1 immunoreactivity in these neurons.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Although several authors have provided evidence that the ER is a production site of this peptide, in particular Ass42 (Chyung et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	141	, 1997), we and others have not been able to confirm these observations (Annaert et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	142	 2, a severe decrease in both Ass40 and Ass42 secretion is observed when APP is retained in the ER by means of the double lysine retention motif (APP-KK).
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Since the retention of APP in the ER implies that cleavage by - and ss-secretase (residing in the TGN, cell surface, and endosomes) becomes strongly compromised, and since proteolytic trimming of the APP ectodomain is a prerequisite for further -secretase processing (Struhl and Adachi, 2000), it seems logical that the APP-KK mutation results in a strongly decreased -secretase cleavage and inhibition of Ass generation.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	144	 It is by consequence difficult to interpret the data obtained with APP-KK in regard to -secretase sensitivity.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Therefore, we generated the APP-C99 construct, which is a direct substrate for -secretase (Lichtenthaler et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	146	, 1999), and added to it the double lysine ER retention motif.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	147	 5, this construct is indeed retained in the ER, where it codistributes abundantly with PS1.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Although we expected increased Ass production, no significant amount of Ass could be precipitated from the wild-type neurons (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	149	 This result was even more significant, as neurons expressing APP-C99 secreted about seven times more total Ass, or specifically Ass42, than those expressing APP-WT.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	150	 The possibility that the Ass generated from APP-C99-KK is retained in the cells was ruled out, since no significant accumulation of cells associated Ass could be demonstrated (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	151	 7 A, lane 9, and B, lanes 2 and 5)The possibility that the KK motif directly interfered with -secretase cleavage was ruled out by two observations.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	152	 First, it is clear from the results with APP-ct that the cytoplasmic domain of APP is not involved in the processing of APP by -secretase.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Second, treatment of the cell cultures with BFA could restore the processing of C99-KK, clearly demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of the KK mutations is a trans, and not a cis phenomenon (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	154	 It should be pointed out here that PS1 in the ER is already proteolytically processed by the "presenilinase" and present as PS1-CTF and PS1-NTF (Annaert et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	155	, 1999), thus in the putative active conformation.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	156	 It follows from these data that the simple colocalization of a substrate (APP-C99-KK) with its putative protease (PS1) is not sufficient for proteolytic cleavage.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	157	We conclude that Ass production, including Ass42, can not occur directly in the ER and requires at least one factor derived from a post-ER compartment.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	158	 This conclusion is corroborated by two important pieces of evidence from the current work.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	159	 First, APP-C99, which is a good substrate for -secretase, is mainly localized in a PS1-, BIP-, and ERGIC53-negative subcellular compartment (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Although the characterization of this compartment requires further experimentation, this result suggests that at least the proteolytic cleavage of the APP-C99 substrate occurs in a non-ER compartment.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The second, more important argument comes from the experiments using BFA.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	162	 BFA is a drug that causes the redistribution of post-ER compartments into the ER (Lippincott-Schwartz et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Treatment with this drug was sufficient to restore partially -secretase processing of APP-C99-KK proving that at least one non-ER component is needed to activate -secretase in the ER (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	164	 BFA treatment results in -secretase processing of APP at position Ass42, something which could possibly be anticipated based on current knowledge (Chyung et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Surprisingly, however, cleavage at position Ass40 is also observed (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	166	 7 B), which is believed to occur mainly in the late compartments of the secretory and in the endosomal limbs of the subcellular trafficking pathways (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Hartmann et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	167	Summarizing, our data indicate that efficient -secretase cleavage of APP can occur in compartments that contain little, if any, PS1, and that no or little -secretase activity is observed in compartments where abundant (maturated) PS1 is residing.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	168	 This is a surprising result since most of the data currently available imply that PS1 is closely involved in -secretase type enzymatic activity (De Strooper et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	169	, 1999, 2000; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Wolfe et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The spatial paradox between PS1 localization and -secretase activity can be explained by two hypotheses: (a) the minute amounts of PS1 in post to cis-Golgi compartments are the active enzymes.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	171	 This implies that in addition to activation by presenilinase, additional proteins from these compartments are needed to make PS1 enzymatically active; and (b) PS1 is actually not the -secretase but acts, probably in concert with other proteins in the ER and intermediate compartment, to dispatch APP or -secretase to the subcellular compartment where cleavage will occur.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	172	 In this hypothesis, BFA treatment results in the relocalization of the catalytic subunit(s) of -secretase to the ER.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	173	In support for the first hypothesis, evidence for the presence of minute amounts of PS1 in other compartments than the ER has been provided.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	174	 In some studies, the specificity of the antibodies used can be questioned (Dewji and Singer, 1997), but in polarized cell types like MDCK cells (Georgakopoulos et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	175	, 1999) or in specialized cell membranes like growth cones or lamellipodia (Schwarzman et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	176	, 1999), some PS1 seems to be located near or at the cell surface.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	177	 (1999) provided evidence that PS1 can travel in complex with Notch to the cell surface, albeit that this conclusion was based on a single type of experimental approach, i.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Furthermore, the hypothesis that PS travels together with its substrates from the ER to the cell surface and becomes activated there is probably not tenable if one takes into account that the relative amount of PS1 to its substrates is extremely low (Thinakaran et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	179	 If PS1 needs to accompany every substrate that it will cleave from the ER to the cell surface, it becomes, given the limited amounts of PS available in any cell type, difficult to understand why strong overexpression of APP does not saturate the system and does not lead to inefficient -secretase processing.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	180	Although it remains impossible to exclude that minute amounts of PS1 in the endosomes or at the cell surface are the active enzymes, it is clear that this hypothesis raises several new questions that need to be addressed.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	181	 In addition, the function of the "inactive" pool of PS1 in the ER also remains to be explained.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	182	 From the BFA experiments it follows that at least one other component of a non-ER compartment is needed to obtain activated PS1.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	183	 This component is not the elusive protease called "presenilinase" responsible for PS maturation, and most probably not nicastrin, since this protein is present in the ER (Yu et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	184	The second hypothesis, that PS1 is needed for the correct trafficking of -secretase and its substrates, finds some theoretical support in the analogy with the sterol regulatory element to binding protein (SREBP) to SCREB cleavage to activating protein (SCAP) complex and the regulation of the proteolytical cleavage of SREBP (Brown et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	185	 SCAP is, like PS1, an ER resident, multitransmembrane domain to containing protein and regulates the trafficking of the membrane-bound transcription factor SREBP to post-ER compartments.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Upon cholesterol depletion, SREBP travels to the cis-Golgi, where a site 1 protease cleaves SREBP in its luminal domain.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The remaining NH2-terminal, membrane-bound fragment then becomes a substrate for a site 2 protease that cleaves in the transmembrane domain of SREBP (Rawson et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The coupling of vesicular protein transport and proteolysis provides a stringent control on the activation of the system and it could be envisaged that PS1, like SCAP, provides a similar control on APP (and Notch) processing.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	189	 However, it should be pointed out that in case of SREBP processing, SCAP regulates its luminal cleavage and that the site 2 intramembraneous cleavage occurs by default.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	190	 In case of PS1, its role is limited to the regulation of the intramembraneous -secretase cleavage (De Strooper et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	191	In conclusion, our data indicate a complex relationship between APP trafficking and its processing by -secretase.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Moreover, they directly question the exact role of PS1 in -secretase processing and demonstrate that at least one cofactor (in the first hypothesis) or the protease (in the second hypothesis) is located in a compartment downstream of the ER.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In the future, reconstitution of -secretase processing of APP, by mixing extracts of purified ER fractions and post-ER compartments, should allow us to further define at a molecular level this highly intriguing proteolytic system.

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	3	Mutations in genes encoding presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 account for the majority of cases of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The presenilins have been localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, but which of the multiple hydrophobic segments of the polypeptide chain span the lipid bilayer is unclear.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To address this question, we have constructed a series of chimeric molecules in which a topologically neutral reporter protein (a C-terminal fragment of prolactin) containing three artificial glycosylation sites is fused to presenilin 1 following each of the 10 potential transmembrane domains identified in hydrophobicity plots.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We have expressed these chimeras by translation in reticulocyte lysate containing canine pancreatic microsomes and by synthesis in transfected COS cells.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Based on utilization of the glycosylation sites and sensitivity of the reporter to protease digestion, we provide evidence that presenilin 1 has six transmembrane segments with the N and C termini in the cytoplasm.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This model provides important clues to the potential functions of different parts of the presenilin molecule and how these might relate to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	9	Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by dementia, neuronal loss, and accumulation in the brain of extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (1).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Familial forms of AD have been linked to mutations in three different genes, encoding the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), and presenilin 2 (PS2) on chromosomes 21, 14, and 1, respectively (2-5).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Over 50% of the cases of early-onset familial AD are attributable to mutations in the presenilin genes.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The mutations that have been described include over 35 different amino acid substitutions, as well as an in-frame deletion of exon 9 (reviewed in Ref.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	13	PS1 and PS2 are polypeptides of 467 and 448 amino acids, respectively, that have multiple hydrophobic segments (2, 4, 5).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These proteins are expressed in a number of tissues in addition to brain and are encoded by several alternatively spliced mRNAs (4, 7, 8).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The presenilins exhibit significant homology to a protein from Caenorhabditis elegans called SEL-12, which, based on genetic evidence, modulates signaling by the LIN-12/Notch pathway (9).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	16	 They show weaker homology to SPE-4, a membrane protein of C.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Immunofluorescence localization studies of transfected cells indicate that the protein is present at steady-state primarily in the ER, and perhaps in the Golgi also, but probably not on the plasma membrane (11).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In a neuronal cell line, PS1 expressed using a viral vector is localized to the cell body and dendrites (12).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Recent evidence indicates that PS1 is proteolytically cleaved between amino acids 260 and 320 in transfected cells as well as in brain tissue, although the significance of this cleavage is unclear (13).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	20	 There are reports that recombinant forms of PS2 can positively regulate apoptosis in lymphocytes and PC12 cells, but whether the endogenous protein normally functions in this way is unclear (14, 15).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Taken together, none of the available evidence clearly identifies the physiological role of the presenilins.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	22	 However, analysis of patient fibroblasts, transfected cells, and transgenic mice that co-express PS1 and APP indicate that pathogenic mutations in the presenilin protein enhance production of the amyloidgenic A42 fragment by 1.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	23	Determination of the membrane topology of the presenilins, in other words defining which parts of the polypeptide chain traverse the lipid bilayer, is of enormous importance in understanding the function of these proteins and their role in AD.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	24	 There are several reasons for this.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	25	 First, knowing which domains of the polypeptide lie in the cytoplasm and which in the lumen of the ER or Golgi will dictate hypotheses about the function of these domains.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Second, experimental attempts to identify cytoplasmic proteins that interact with the presenilins using screening procedures such as the yeast two-hybrid system or interaction cloning require a knowledge of which segments of the polypeptide chain lie in the cytoplasm.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Third, the membrane topology of the presenilins can be correlated with the positions of pathogenic mutations, providing clues to how these mutations alter the function of the proteins.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Finally, knowledge of the membrane topology of the presenilins will allow a more detailed comparison with possible homologues than is possible simply on the basis of hydrophobicity plots.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	29	We report here our analysis of the membrane topology of PS1 using both in vitro and in vivo expression systems.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Our results suggest that the protein spans the membrane six times, with both N and C termini located in the cytoplasm.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This model stands in marked contrast to ones originally proposed on the basis of hydrophobicity plots that hypothesized either seven or nine transmembrane domains for PS1 and PS2 (2, 4, 5, 20).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Our conclusions are consistent with and significantly extend those of a recent report, suggesting that PS1 possesses either six or eight transmembrane segments (21), but they differ from those of a second study proposing an eight-transmembrane topology for the presenilin homologue SEL-12 (22).

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	71	 A number of studies have utilized this portion of prolactin as a reporter, since it lacks any signals that might influence the membrane orientation of the adjacent polypeptide (24-26).

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	149	Our model for the topology of PS1 has important implications for the function of the protein and its role in AD.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	150	 We find that most of the polypeptide chain of PS1 is cytoplasmic, including the N-terminal region and a long C-terminal tail encompassing HR7-HR10.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	151	 These segments may therefore be important in interactions with cytoplasmic proteins.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Much of the cytoplasmic region from HR6 to the C terminus, exclusive of the segment between HR7 and HR8, is highly conserved in the presenilins and SEL-12, suggesting essential functions for this domain.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	153	 A number of pathogenic mutations are found between the end of HR6 and the end of HR7 (reviewed in Ref.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	154	 6), and one might speculate that these alter associations of PS1 with molecules in the cytoplasm.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Since little of the polypeptide chain protrudes into the ER lumen, a direct interaction between PS1 and lumenal proteins seems unlikely, although associations with other ER membrane proteins are possible.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	156	 If PS1 binds to APP, a possibility suggested by enhanced production of the A 42 fragment in cells expressing mutant PS1 (16-19), this interaction would most likely occur transiently during transit of APP through the ER and Golgi and would probably involve either the transmembrane region or short cytoplasmic tail of APP.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	157	The topology model proposed here makes it unlikely that PS1 functions as a conventional G-protein-coupled receptor, but is consistent with a role for PS1 in processes such as vesicle docking and budding, membrane-cytoskeletal interactions, or ion and solute transport.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The recently described endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 (13), which is predicted to occur following HR6, would be expected to generate a C-terminal fragment that lacks any transmembrane segments.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Whether this fragment is soluble would depend on how tightly HR7-HR10 are associated with the lipid bilayer, but if it were diffusible it could serve to transmit a signal to other regions of the cell.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Knowing the membrane topology of PS1 will now facilitate attempts to isolate interacting molecules and will provide a starting point for further investigations of the biological activity of normal and mutant forms of the protein.

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	8	Abbreviations: ACE, angiotensin I-converting enzyme (protein); ACE, angiotensin I-converting enzyme (gene); APOE*4, apolipoprotein E 4 (allele).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	9	Since then, this potential association has been examined in over 40 samples (4, 5) (table 1) from around the world.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Several studies replicated the report of increased risk for I positives, just a few contradicted it, and many found no association with Alzheimer's disease.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	11	 One study suggested an effect of age on the association (6), and another proposed an influence of gender (7).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	12	 An association with onset age of Alzheimer's disease has also been proposed (8).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Cohorts used in the meta-analysis of the ACE* insertion-deletion polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	14	  The association has recently been studied in the longitudinal, observational cohorts of the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) and the Rotterdam Study (9).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Both groups found a suggestion of a gender difference in their results, consistent with a previous report (7).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	16	 We therefore undertook a meta-analysis of studies of the association of the ACE indel with Alzheimer's disease, stratified by gender, by age, by ethnic group, and by apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4) carrier status, using mainly primary data, supplied by authors.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	17	Although three previous meta-analyses of ACE studies had been reported (10 to 12), subsequent studies have now made further data available.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Compared even with the latest meta-analysis (12), 10 more samples from eight studies were available to us (9, 13 to 18, and the above study of the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In addition, all previous meta-analyses were based on published data, that is, largely unstratified, and were thus limited in the interpretations they allowed.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Using primary data, we were able to explore more deeply, searching for sources of heterogeneity.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Two previous stratified meta-analyses of Alzheimer's disease genes (19, 20), based on primary data, have both deepened our understanding.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	22	 (21) have stressed the need to examine sources of heterogeneity in meta-analyses of case-control studies.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	23	 We therefore divided our analysis into two phases: first, a broad overall analysis and, second, the detailed examination of sources of heterogeneity.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	24	 We aimed to discover whether the ACE indel is associated with Alzheimer's disease and, if so, the nature of that association.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	25	Phase 2: examination of heterogeneity We examined six possible sources of heterogeneity.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We performed analyses stratified by age, gender, and APOE*4 status.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	27	 For the age stratifications ( < 65 years, 65 to 75 years, and  > 75 years), we divided the samples into two groups, according to how the ages of cases had been defined, for example, at onset (first group) or at examination or death (second group).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We also conducted analyses restricted to controls and to diagnoses of probable or definite Alzheimer's disease according to criteria of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) (25) or of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) (26) (26 full samples and two part samples).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In separate analyses, we excluded eight samples where Hardy-Weinberg analysis and genotyping methods were compatible with mistyping.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Underreporting of heterozygotes may occur unless either 5 percent dimethyl sulfoxide is included in the polymerase chain reaction (27) or the DD genotype is confirmed by an insertion-specific second amplification (28).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In further analyses, samples were placed where possible (34 of 39 samples) in one of three ethnic groups: North European (19 samples); South Caucasian (11 samples), defined here as from the Mediterranean or from the Middle East; and East Asian (four samples), from China or from Japan.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	32	Data analysis and statistical methods Three methods are commonly used to produce odds ratios in genetic association studies: method 1, allelic (i.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	33	 I in this case); method 2, comparing each genotype with one other in turn (e.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	34	 DI); method 3, comparing each genotype in turn with the other two combined.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	35	 All three methods are subject to bias, the degree of bias depending on how imperfectly the model fits reality.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	36	 For instance, method 1 is best suited to testing a codominant model, where there is an allelic dose effect (e.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Method 3, on the other hand, may be used to test either an I-dominant/D-recessive or a D-dominant/I-recessive model.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	38	 We chose to follow the hypothesis-generating study (1) in using method 3, partly because preliminary examination of subsequent studies had shown no evidence of codominance.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	39	 We also used both methods 2 and 3 to examine heterosis (heterozygotes at greater or lesser risk than either homozygote).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Our main approach, method 3, gives an estimate of the risk associated with each genotype when compared with the rest of the population.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	41	Pooled odds ratios were calculated three times, by the fixed-effects method of Mantel and Haenszel (29), by the random-effects method of DerSimonian and Laird (30), and by the Bayesian random-effects method of Warn et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	42	 However, as the results of all three methods were very similar, only those of the first two are shown (table 2).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The methods of meta-analysis permit the accumulation of results across independent studies, even where the number of subjects or the ratio of cases to controls varies considerably, as here in the cohort of Sleegers et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The heterogeneity test was by the method of Armitage (32).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Logistic regression analysis was used to compare odds ratios among ethnic groups.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Funnel plots (33) and cumulative meta-analysis (34) were used to investigate bias.

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Both stratified analyses and linear regression analysis were performed on these data and also on a subset of 10 North European samples, comprising 1,822 cases of Alzheimer's disease.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	92	 No effect of ACE*I carrier status on onset age of Alzheimer's disease and, surprisingly, only a modest effect of APOE*4 carrier status on onset age were seen (data not shown).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	93	Phase 2: examination of heterogeneity We examined six potential sources of heterogeneity: age, gender, race, APOE*4 status, misdiagnosis, and mistyping.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	94	Stratification by gender and by APOE*4 status.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	95	 No significant effects were seen of gender or of APOE*4 status on the associations with Alzheimer's disease, nor did stratification by either of these two factors remove the heterogeneity (data not shown).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	96	 We calculated the odds ratios of Alzheimer's disease for ACE*D homozygotes versus I positives when stratified by age ( < 65 years, 65 to 75 years, and  > 75 years).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Rather little effect of age was seen on the association of D homozygotes with Alzheimer's disease (data not shown), nor was there any reduction in heterogeneity on stratification by age.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	98	 We repeated the overall analyses of the three genotypes, restricting the data to the 28 samples that could be limited to the more rigorous diagnoses of probable or definite Alzheimer's disease according to criteria of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (25) or the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (26).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The odds ratios were similar to those shown in table 2, that is, significant odds ratios by the method of DerSimonian and Laird (30) of 0.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	100	15 for heterozygotes and a nonsignificant odds ratio of 1.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Heterogeneity remained for D homozygotes (p = 0.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	102	005) but was no longer significant (p = 0.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	103	 There were 12 instances of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium in individual studies and four in the six groups of pooled cases and controls analyzed by race (table 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	104	 We therefore excluded the eight samples where mistyping was considered possible, that is, underreporting of heterozygotes, taking into account both genotyping methods and Hardy-Weinberg analysis.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	105	 We then repeated the overall analyses with the remaining 31 samples.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	106	 The odds ratios were similar to those in table 2, that is, significant odds ratios of 0.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	107	12 for heterozygotes and a nonsignificant odds ratio of 1.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Heterogeneity remained for I homozygotes (p = 0.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	109	02) but was no longer significant for D homozygotes (p = 0.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Odds ratios of Alzheimer's disease for each ACE* genotype in the meta-analysis, by ethnic group.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	111	 The samples were divided into three ethnic groups, where possible: North European (19 samples), South Caucasian (Mediterranean and Middle Eastern, 11 samples), and East Asian (Chinese and Japanese, four samples).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	112	 This removed nearly all heterogeneity (table 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Table 3 shows clear differences among the three ethnic groups.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	114	 There was no overlap whatsoever in allelic frequencies among the three groups.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	115	 North Europeans and East Asians differed in the odds ratios for D homozygotes versus I positives (p = 0.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	116	0008) and for I homozygotes versus D positives (p = 0.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	117	 South Caucasians also differed from East Asians in the odds ratio for D homozygotes versus I positives (p = 0.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	118	 D homozygotes were at reduced risk in all groups, but particularly in East Asians.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Heterozygotes were at increased risk in North Europeans.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	120	 I homozygotes were at higher risk in East Asians, except by Bayesian analysis.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	121	 We further examined heterosis (heterozygotes at greater risk) in North Europeans, by comparing DI with DD and with II in turn.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	122	 We found that heterozygotes were at higher risk than D homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	123	25, 95 percent confidence interval: 1.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	124	45) but not significantly higher than I homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	125	08, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	126	ACE*D homozygotes were at reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (table 2) in each of the three main ethnic groups examined (table 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	127	 I homozygotes were neutral as regards Alzheimer's disease risk (table 2), except in East Asians, in whom I homozygotes may be at higher risk (table 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Heterozygotes were at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease overall (table 2) and mainly in North Europeans (table 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	129	 This example of heterosis will be discussed below.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Very similar results were achieved by three methods: fixed effects, random effects, and Bayesian random effects (refer to Materials and Methods and table 2).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Only genotypic comparisons were made (refer to Materials and Methods), which showed that there was no allelic dose effect, except in East Asians (table 3), and that thus allelic comparisons would have proved less informative.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	132	These findings of odds ratios close to 1, even though significantly different from 1 (tables 2 and 3), suggest either linkage disequilibrium with the true risk factor or confounding by a hidden interaction or both.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The second possibility is discussed below.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Regarding the former, Kehoe et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	135	 (1) in their study of ACE haplotypes gave evidence that the indel may not be the actual risk factor but rather in linkage disequilibrium with a nearby functional polymorphism that is the true risk factor.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	136	 ACE haplotype analysis has also proved of value with other phenotypes, such as enzyme levels (36), insulin levels, myocardial infarction, and obesity (37).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Future Alzheimer's disease studies may do better to examine polymorphisms in the regulatory regions, rather than the indel.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	138	The overall results were consistent with those of Kehoe et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	139	 (1) from 1999 and also with those of the recent meta-analyses of Kehoe et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	140	 (11) from 2003 and of Elkins et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The latter report (12) also suggested an age difference, however, although actual ages were not available to them, only mean cohort ages, and they did not take into account the different ways of defining case ages (refer to Materials and Methods), a strongly confounding factor.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Because of the latter problem, we cannot exclude the possibility that the association might be stronger in younger cases, for example, in those aged less than 65 years at onset or less than 75 years at death.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	143	Heterogeneity Our overall results showed heterogeneity (table 2).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Heterogeneity may be due to differences in sample selection (e.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	145	, in age, gender, or diagnosis) or in methods (e.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	146	, of genotyping), or it may be due to real differences in populations (e.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	147	, in race) or in interactions with other risk factors (e.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	148	 We examined all of these potential sources of heterogeneity.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	149	 We found little effect of age, gender, or APOE*4 status, thus confounding our initial hypothesis.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Both diagnostic and genotyping differences contributed some heterogeneity.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The former was mainly due to the diagnosis of "possible Alzheimer's disease," reported to have a poor record of confirmation at autopsy (38).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The latter was largely due to certain genotyping methods that may lead to underreporting of heterozygotes (27, 28), as shown by Hardy-Weinberg analysis.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	153	However, the greatest source of heterogeneity was ethnic differences.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Ethnic stratification removed nearly all heterogeneity (table 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	155	 There were clear contrasts among the three ethnic groups examined (North Europeans, South Caucasians, and East Asians) in allelic frequencies and in odds ratios (table 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The latter might be due to differences in linkage disequilibrium with the true risk polymorphism (see above).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Some of these ethnic differences had previously been pointed out by Panza et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	158	 These contrasts highlight the dangers of combining ethnic groups within a single cohort, even North and South Europeans, as indicated by Panza et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Unfortunately, there was only one cohort of African origin, from the United States (41).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Thus, no conclusions could be drawn about Africans.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	161	Heterosis Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are common in studies of the ACE indel, as previously pointed out by Buss et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	162	 This may be due to either mistyping or heterosis.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Several cases of such disequilibrium were indeed compatible with mistyping.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Most examples of disequilibrium in North Europeans, however, were of an excess of heterozygotes in Alzheimer's disease, which requires another explanation.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	165	 We believe that explanation is heterosis.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Heterosis occurs when heterozygotes show either a greater or lesser association with a given trait than does either group of homozygotes.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	167	 In this case, in North Europeans, both an excess of heterozygotes in Alzheimer's disease and an association of heterozygotes with Alzheimer's disease were found.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Comings and MacMurray (42) have suggested three explanations for heterosis, of which their second can be applied here.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	169	 This proposes that heterosis may follow from the inadvertent combination of two unlike subsets due to a hidden interaction with another, unknown risk factor.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	170	 To test this proposal, we constructed a mathematical model with two equal subsets based on a median split of an unknown factor X (table 4).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The model illustrates how, although heterozygotes may have intermediate odds ratios in each subset, they can emerge with the highest odds ratio when the subsets are combined (i.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The overall results of this illustrative model (table 4) were very close to those of the present meta-analysis (table 2).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	173	 We should stress, however, that heterosis was found only in North Europeans.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Moreover, although heterozygotes were at greater risk than D homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	175	25, 95 percent confidence interval: 1.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	176	45), they were not at significantly higher risk than I homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	177	08, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Thus, partial heterosis better describes this case.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Model to show how heterosis may follow from the combination of two unlike subsets.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	180	  A hidden interaction Partial heterosis in North Europeans suggests an interaction with another risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, another potential source of heterogeneity.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Candidates include cardiovascular risk factors, since many also contribute to Alzheimer's disease risk and since the ACE indel has been associated with cardiovascular risk (43 to 47).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	182	Biologic background Full discussion of the biologic basis of these associations is outside the scope of this mainly analytical study.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	183	 However, we note the associations of the ACE indel and of nearby polymorphisms with various phenotypes, including cardiovascular risk (37, 43 to 47).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	184	 In addition, ACE protein levels are raised in certain brain regions with Alzheimer's disease (48 to 50), the enzyme has been reported to modify ss-amyloid aggregation (51), ACE inhibitors have been reported to maintain memory in aged rats (52) and in human patients (53), and brain-penetrating ACE inhibitors have been associated with both reduced incidence of Alzheimer's disease in elderly hypertensive patients (54) and less cognitive decline in cases with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (55).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	185	 (9) have recently provided evidence from magnetic resonance imaging of increased atrophy in both the hippocampus and amygdala of nondemented women homozygous for the ACE*I allele, together with a modest but significant increase in risk of Alzheimer's disease, independent of vascular factors.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The D allele is associated with raised plasma levels of ACE (2), but that association is thought to be due to linkage disequilibrium with other nearby polymorphisms (3, 36).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	187	 There is an apparent conflict between the benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy and the associations of the indel with Alzheimer's disease risk and pathology and with plasma levels of ACE.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	188	 However, the influence of ACE polymorphisms on brain levels of the enzyme is not yet known and cannot be assumed to reflect the levels in plasma.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	189	 This subject warrants fuller discussion than is possible here.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	190	 A more detailed discussion is given by Kehoe (56), although it will need to be reconsidered and perhaps revised in the light of any interacting factor or factors that may emerge in future studies.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	191	Limitations of this meta-analysis The lack of information from some authors was a limitation, but we obtained full data on 84 percent of subjects.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The quality of diagnosis and of genotyping varied among studies, but our overall results were not changed when these questions were taken into account.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	193	 There was considerable heterogeneity in our initial results.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	194	 However, we found the main sources of that heterogeneity and were able to remove it.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Since cardiovascular factors are strong candidates for a potential interaction with ACE variants, the lack of data available to us on those factors was a limitation, which we hope will be overcome by future studies.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Cardiovascular factors might also have influenced our results through selective mortality.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	197	 However, D homozygotes have only a very slightly increased risk of cardiovascular complications (43 to 47, 57) and little evidence of any association with reduced life span (57 to 62).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Thus, the influence of selective mortality, if any, is likely to be very small and not enough to provide an alternative explanation for our findings.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	199	Conclusions We suggest that this large study has established the ACE indel as a marker of Alzheimer's disease risk, since we found no evidence of bias, we found and removed the main sources of heterogeneity, we excluded various potential interactions, and significant results remained in each of the three ethnic groups examined.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The indel, however, is probably in linkage disequilibrium with the true risk polymorphism (11).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	201	 There were marked contrasts among the three ethnic groups studied (table 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	202	 We also found evidence of an interaction with another risk factor in North Europeans.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Potential interactions with other factors than age, gender, and APOE*4 status should be examined, particularly interactions with cardiovascular risk factors.

0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In all patients mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) had previously been excluded.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Four different PS-1 missense mutations were identified in six familial cases, two of which where autosomal dominant cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Three mutations resulted in onset ages above 55 years, with one segregating in an autosomal dominant family with mean onset age 64 years (range 50-78 years).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	12	 One PS-2 mutation was identified in a sporadic case with onset age 62 years.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Our mutation data provided estimates for PS-1 and PS-2 mutation frequencies in presenile AD of 6 and 1% respectively.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	14	 When family history was accounted for mutation frequencies for PS-1 were 9% in familial cases and 18% in autosomal dominant cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Further, polymorphisms were detected in the promoter and the 5'-non-coding region of PS-1 and in intronic and exonic sequences of PS-2 that will be useful in genetic association studies.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	16	Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of senile dementia and the fourth leading cause of death in western societies.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	17	 AD is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system characterized by progressive loss of memory and intellectual functioning due to the appearance in the brain of two major lesions: senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The exact biochemical pathway leading to neurodegeneration is still unknown.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In most AD cases the first symptoms of memory dysfunction or behavior changes become apparent after age 65 years (late-onset or senile AD); however, in many cases the disease starts earlier in life (early-onset or presenile AD).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	20	 There are no indications that the disease in presenile AD cases is different from that observed in senile AD cases, apart from a more severe pathology and more rapid clinical progression.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Both senile and presenile AD have a genetic etiology; however, genetic cases are more frequent among presenile AD cases (for a review see 1 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Also, several AD families have been documented that segregate presenile AD in an autosomal dominant manner.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In these families a positional cloning approach has been employed to identify AD genes (for a review see 1 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	24	 To date, three AD genes are known that, when mutated, lead to presenile AD: the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) on chromosome 21 at 21q21.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	25	1 (2 ); the presenilin-1 gene (PS-1) on chromosome 14 at 14q24.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	26	3(3 ); the presenilin-2 gene (PS-2) on chromosome 1 at 1q42.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Although the normal function of the amyloid precursor protein (app) is unknown, mutations have been demonstrated to alter endoproteolysis of app such that more of a 42 amino acid long form of amyloid [beta] (A[beta]42) is produced (6 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Rapid deposition of A[beta]42 in AD brains is an early morphological event in AD pathology.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Also, the normal and pathological functions of the presenilin proteins (ps-1 and ps-2) are unknown (for a review see 7 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Since they both constitute integral membrane proteins with six to eight transmembrane domains (TM) and one large hydrophilic loop (HL) (8 ,9 ), similar functions of ps-1 and ps-2 were predicted.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Remarkably, mutations in PS-1 and PS-2 also produce more A[beta]42, suggesting that PS mutations and APP mutations lead to AD pathology through a common biochemical pathway.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	32	In APP seven different mutations have been identified in autosomal dominant families with presenile AD or AD-related phenotypes (6 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	33	 All mutations occur in exons 16 and 17, encoding the A[beta] proteolysis product of app.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	34	 However, extensive mutation analyses have shown that mutations in APP are rare, since they segregate in only 5% of the presenile AD families (1 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Since the PS genes were identified more recently (for a review see 7 ), extensive mutation analyses have not yet been performed.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	36	 However, initial estimates based on linkage analysis studies suggested that 70% of the presenile AD families were linked to chromosome 14 (10 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Later, a mutation in PS-1 was found in each chromosome 14-linked AD family (3 ,11 ,12 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	38	 To date 42 different missense mutations and one in-frame splice site mutation in PS-1 have been reported in 82 families world wide (13 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Mutation screenings of PS-1 in presenile AD families not selected on the basis of linkage to chromosome 14 indicated that PS-1 mutations contribute less (30-50%) than initially estimated (14 ,15 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	40	 A possible explanation for the lower mutation frequency of PS-1 may be that the initial mutation data were biased towards finding PS-1 mutations, since most families analyzed had been included in a genome-wide search for AD genes and were known to be linked to chromosome 14.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Only one mutation has been reported in a proven non-familial AD case (16 ); however, only few mutation studies of sporadic AD cases have been performed.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	42	Initial linkage studies indicated that PS-2 mutations are far less frequent than PS-1 mutations (5 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Apart from the one PS-2 mutation identified in the chromosome 1-linked group of Volga German AD families, only one other PS-2 mutation has been identified to date (5 ,17 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	44	 However, in contrast to PS-1 families onset ages in PS-2 families are highly variable and usually later in life (13 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Therefore, it cannot be excluded that PS-2 families may have been missed, since presenile AD families with earlier onset ages are more likely to be ascertained for linkage analysis studies since they have more clear inheritance patterns.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	46	 To date no mutation reports of PS-2 in non-familial presenile AD cases have been published; however, PS-2 has been less intensively investigated for mutations than PS-1.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	47	In this study we aimed at evaluating the genetic contributions of PS-1 and PS-2 mutations to presenile AD in autosomal dominant, familial and sporadic cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	48	 To overcome several of the biases mentioned above we used a unique sample of 101 unrelated familial and sporadic presenile AD cases ascertained in a population-based manner in The Netherlands (18 ,19 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The sample contained 11 autosomal dominant, 56 familial and 34 sporadic presenile AD cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	50	4 years (range 45-64 years), being lower than 60 years in 71 cases and lower than 50 years in 10 cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	51	 In the autosomal dominant AD families all probands had an onset age before 65 years; however, in four families the mean onset age was above 65 years.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	52	 In addition we analyzed the families of 10 autosomal dominant presenile AD cases included in this population-based study (20 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	53	 In all cases mutations in exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene were previously excluded (19 ,20 ) while one family was shown to be linked to chromosome 14 (20 ).

0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	69	 RESULTS Mutation analysis of PS-1 and PS-2.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	70	Previously, the complete genomic structure of PS-1 and PS-2 was determined identifying 10 coding exons in each gene (21 ,22 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	71	 In order to avoid confusion we used the exon numbering 3-12 for PS-1 in this study, as introduced by Clark et al.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Intronic primer pairs were designed allowing PCR amplification of the 10 coding exons of PS-1 and PS-2 (Table 1 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	73	 All 101 AD patients were examined for mutations in PS-1 and PS-2 by SSCP analysis and PCR cycle sequencing.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	74	In PS-1 we identified four missense mutations in exons 4, 5, 7 and 9 respectively and one intronic polymorphism in intron 8 (Tables 2 and 3 and Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The Ala79Val mutation was identified in three patients (1005, 1061 and 1087) (Table 2 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	76	 To test whether the mutation in the three patients has the same ancestral origin we genotyped three simple tandem repeat (STR) markers flanking PS-1 (23 ,24 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	77	 For D14S1028, D14S77 and D14S1004 all patients shared one common allele with allele frequencies calculated among the cases of respectively 0.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	78	 These data suggested that the three patients carrying the Ala79Val mutation might be related, although not closely, since genealogy studies had not indicated a familial relationship.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The other three mutations occurred only once and none of the mutations were present in the 118 control individuals.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The polymorphism observed in intron 8 is identical to that reported by Wragg et al.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	81	 (25 ) and allele frequencies were determined by the primer mismatch PCR assay described by those authors (Table 3 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Since the SSCP pattern of the intron 8 polymorphism could have masked the presence of mutations, we sequenced exon 8 in all cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Restriction enzyme analyses of mutations and polymorphisms in PS-1 and PS-2.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	84	 PCR amplified exons were digested with the restriction enzymes indicated.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	85	 (A) Missense mutations in PS-1 and PS-2.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	86	 (B) Polymorphisms in PS-1 and PS-2.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	87	In one patient a missense mutation in PS-2 was detected, resulting in an Arg - >  His substitution at codon 62 in exon 4 (Table 2 and Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Restriction digestion analysis showed that the mutation was absent in the other patients and controls.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In addition, SSCP and sequence analysis of exon 4 identified two different polymorphisms in intron 3 and at codon His87 respectively (Table 3 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Also, the SSCP patterns observed for exons 3, 5, 7 and 11 were due to polymorphisms, since the nucleotide changes involved intronic variations or exonic silent mutations (Table 3 and Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The polymorphism in exon 5 (Thr122) was seen in only one patient and represents a very rare polymorphism.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Also, the polymorphism in exon 7 (Ser236) is rare, since it was seen in only two patients.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The allele frequencies of the other more frequent polymorphisms were estimated in the 118 control individuals by restriction enzyme digestion (Table 3 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Comparison of the allele distribution in 15 control individuals showed that the two exon 3 polymorphisms are in linkage disequilibrium.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Also, the two exon 4 polymorphisms are in linkage disequilibrium.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Further, we demonstrated that the PS-2 polymorphisms in exons 3 (Ala23) and 4 (His87) and intron 11 show Mendelian inheritance.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	97	To complete the mutation analysis of PS-1 and PS-2 we developed flanking primers for the three exons located in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of PS-1 (numbered exons 1A, 1B and 2) and the two 5'-UTR of PS-2 (21 ,26 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	98	 SSCP analysis followed by PCR cycle sequencing revealed two polymorphisms in the 5'-UTR of PS-1, but no mutations (Table 3 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Allele frequencies of both polymorphisms were estimated by SSCP analysis of exon 1A and restriction digestion of exon 1B (Table 3 and Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Mendelian inheritance of both polymorphisms was demonstrated.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	101	 No mutations or polymorphisms were detected in the 5'-UTR of PS-2.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	102	Although SSCP analysis of PS-1 and PS-2 was negative in eight of the 10 autosomal dominant probands included in our sample, we could not rule out that mutations may have been missed, since the sensitivity of SSCP is not 100%.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Therefore, we performed a mutation analysis of PS-1 and PS-2 cDNA synthesized from RNA isolated from cultured lymphoblasts of a patient and an escapee.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	104	 No other than the Ala79Val and Tyr115Cys mutations in PS-1 were detected.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	105	All six PS-1 mutations occurred in patients with a positive family history of presenile AD, while the PS-2 mutation was observed in a sporadic case (Table 2 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Two PS-1 mutations were present in autosomal dominant cases (1005 and 1066), while four PS-1 mutations were detected in familial cases (1061, 1069, 1072 and 1087) (Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	107	 In the latter families the inheritance pattern was consistent with autosomal dominant transmission (Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	108	 2 ); however, these families had not been selected for linkage studies since they did not fulfil our rigid criteria for autosomal dominant AD (1061, 1069 and 1087) or showed bilineal transmission of AD (1072) (20 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Only in family 1072 were additional family members available and the PS-1 mutation Ala231Val was shown to be present in at-risk individuals.

0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	117	In autosomal dominant families 1005 and 1066 co-segregation of the mutation with presenile AD was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion (Table 2 and Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Previously we had used the informative families of the 10 autosomal dominant cases included among the 101 cases in genetic linkage studies (20 ).

0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Family 1005 was not informative for the chromosome 14 STR markers used.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	122	Mutation analysis of all 10 coding exons as well as the 5'-non-coding exons of PS-1 and PS-2 by SSCP analysis and PCR cycle sequencing identified four different missense mutations in PS-1 in six patients (Ala79Val, Tyr115Cys, Ala231Val and Glu318Gly) and one missense mutation in PS-2 in one other patient (Arg62His) among 101 unrelated presenile AD cases in our study.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	123	 All but one of the mutations (7 ,27 ) are novel mutations that were absent in 118 control individuals.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Based on our mutation data we calculated a mutation frequency of 6% for PS-1 and 1% for PS-2 in presenile AD.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Since all PS-1 mutations occurred in familial cases, i.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	126	 cases with at least one first degree relative with AD, the mutation frequency is estimated at 9% (six out of 67 cases) in familial presenile AD cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Among the familial cases in our study there were 11 cases belonging to families fulfilling our rigid criteria for autosomal dominant AD, i.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	128	 three patients in two generations with a clinical diagnosis of AD in at least two cases (20 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	129	 In two autosomal dominant families a PS-1 mutation was found resulting in a mutation frequency of 18% (two out of 11 cases) in autosomal dominant presenile AD.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	130	Since the mutation screening of PS-1 and PS-2 was performed by SSCP analysis, we cannot exclude that our estimates of mutation frequencies of PS-1 and PS-2 are underestimates, as the sensitivity of SSCP is not 100% (28 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	131	 However, we systematically analyzed each PCR-amplified exon of PS-1 and PS-2 together with positive controls of known mutations in the presence and absence of glycerol as denaturant.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Mutations in PS-1 and PS-2 may also have been masked by polymorphisms in exonic and flanking intronic sequences.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	133	 When polymorphic SSCP patterns were observed we sequenced the PCR products in five to 10 cases showing homozygous and heterozygous SSCP patterns.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	134	 In each case the underlying polymorphism was detected and confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion of the amplified product.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The efficiency of our mutation analysis strategy is demonstrated by detection of a mutation in exon 4 of PS-2 in one patient that had a unique SSCP pattern different from that of the polymorphic SSCP patterns observed for exon 4.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Also, sequence analysis of the polymorphic PCR products of exon 8 of PS-1 identified no mutations.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	137	The onset age in the PS-1 mutation cases varied from 45 to 58 years, with three mutations (Ala79Val, Ala231Val and Glu318Gly) having onset ages above 55 years (Table 2 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Most PS-1 mutations reported so far had onset ages between 35 and 55 years (29 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	139	 However, the majority of these mutations were located in exons 5 and 8, coding in part for TM II and the large HL after TM VI (13 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Here the mutations are predicted to interfere with the [alpha]-helical structure of TM II or the proteolytic processing of ps-1 occurring in HL VI (7 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The ps-1 mutations identified in this study are located in the N-terminal region (Ala79Val in exon 4), in TM V (Ala231Val in exon 7) and in the middle part of HL VI (Glu318Gly in exon 9).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Most likely these mutations have a milder effect on ps-1 functioning, possibly because the amino acid changes are semi-conserved (Ala79Val and Ala231Val) or they are located in a functionally less important region (Glu318Gly).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The Glu318 mutation is located in a region of ps-1 that is less conserved in ps-2 and ps of other species (13 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Also, co-segregation of the Glu318Gly mutation with AD could not be demonstrated, since no other relatives in family 1069 were available.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	145	 High variability in onset age was observed in PS-1 family 1005 segregating the Ala79Val mutation with a mean onset age in the family of 64 years, ranging from 55 to 78 years.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In one mutation carrier the disease was not yet fully penetrant at age 76 years.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Possibly, the onset age in this family is modulated by other genetic and/or environmental factors.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	148	 In this respect it is important to note that the non-penetrant case had an APOE [epsilon]3[epsilon]3 genotype, which may have delayed his onset age (30 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	149	 However, APOE studies in larger samples of PS-1 cases and families are needed to conclude that the APOE genotype modulates expression of PS-1 mutations.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Also, no effect of the APOE genotype on onset age was observed in chromosome 14-linked AD families with PS-1 mutations, leading to very early onset ages and severe phenotypes (31 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Another possibility is that the PS-1-linked phenotype is modulated by a polymorphism in ps-2 or that mutations in ps-1 and ps-2 act together to express the disease phenotype (digenic effect).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	152	 However, SSCP analysis as well as RT-PCR analysis of PS-2 cDNA did not detect sequence alterations in ps-2.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Family 1005 is also of particular interest since in this family several patients had been identified with cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) (Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	154	 However, none of them carried the PS-1 mutation, indicating that the CVAs in this family are not related to presenile AD.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In contrast to the previous three PS-1 mutations, the Tyr115Cys mutation in exon 5, corresponding to HL I, was detected in chromosome 14-linked family 1066, with mean onset age of 42 years (range 39-49 years) (20 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The latter provides evidence that some of the earlier mutation studies may indeed have been biased towards finding PS-1 mutations resulting in earlier onset ages and more severe phenotypes.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	157	Only one PS-2 mutation, Arg62His, was observed in a sporadic AD case with an onset age of 62 years.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The two published PS-2 mutations had been identified in autosomal dominant families with presenile AD in TM II and TM V of ps-2 (4 ,5 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The mutated Arg62 codon is not conserved in human ps-1 and ps of other mammalian species and is located in a region of the N-terminal domain that is generally not conserved between ps-1, ps-2 and the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog sel-12 (32 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Also, the mutation itself is a conserved amino acid substitution.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Therefore, it cannot be excluded that this ps-2 mutation is a rare polymorphism not related to AD pathogenesis, since the patient also had an APOE [epsilon]3[epsilon]4 genotype which may have increased her risk of developing AD (30 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	162	In conclusion, our mutation data showed that PS-1 and PS-2 mutations are rare genetic causes of presenile AD in general.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Also, the frequency of PS-1 mutations in autosomal dominant AD families (18%) is less frequent than initially estimated.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	164	 No mutations were identified in exons 16 and 17 of APP of any of the cases (33 ), suggesting that other AD genes must exist.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	165	 It is possible that a fraction of the cases may be attributed to the presence of an APOE [epsilon]4 allele.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	166	 In a previous study of this population-based sample we demonstrated that the risk for developing presenile AD is significantly increased in APOE [epsilon]4 homozygotes independent of family history and in APOE [epsilon]4 heterozygotes in which the family history is positive (33 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	167	 In the sample of 101 cases there were 19 APOE [epsilon]4 homozygotes and 31 familial APOE [epsilon]4 heterozygotes.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	168	In contrast to previous reports (29 ), we observed several PS-1 mutations leading to AD with onset ages above 55 years.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Also, one of these PS-1 mutations was identified in an autosomal dominant family with a mean onset age of 64 years (range 55-78 years).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The identification of these PS-1 mutations predicts that PS-1 mutations with even milder effects on ps-1 functioning may be present in senile AD.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	171	 This is of particular importance since a genetic association between an intronic PS-1 polymorphism and senile AD has been reported (25 ), although this association could not be replicated in all studies.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Possibly, the association is the result of a functionally more relevant sequence variation elsewhere in the PS-1 gene.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Preliminary data obtained by sequence analysis failed to demonstrate sequence variations in the coding region of PS-1 (25 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	174	 However, the promoter and 5'-non-coding region of PS-1 had not been examined, since these sequences became available only recently.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In this respect the identification by us of two polymorphisms in the 5'-non-coding region of PS-1 is of interest, since these polymorphisms may be used in genetic association studies to test whether PS-1 is also a susceptibility gene for senile and/or presenile AD.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Also, the intronic and exonic polymorphisms identified in PS-2 are useful to test the role of this gene in AD, an analysis that has not yet been performed.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	177	 MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	178	All patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD and onset at or before age 65 years, made in the period January 1980 and July 1987, living in metropolitan Rotterdam and the four northern provinces were ascertained (18 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The clinical diagnosis of AD was independently confirmed by two neurologists using a standardized protocol according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for AD (34 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	180	 A total of 198 patients participated in the study (18 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Onset age was defined as the age at which memory problems or behavior changes were first noted.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Cases were considered familial when at least one first degree relative suffered from dementia.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The percentage of familial cases in the total sample of presenile AD patients was 48% (18 ,33 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Of familial cases the pedigree was considered to segregate with autosomal dominant AD if at least three patients with dementia were reported in two generations and if there were at least two patients with detailed medical records on the clinical diagnosis of AD (18 ,33 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	185	Blood samples were drawn from 100 randomly selected AD patients (33 ) and detailed data on family history of disease were collected (18 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Affected and unaffected relatives of 17 families were visited at home, where blood was drawn.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	187	 All relatives were assessed for family history of disease, risk factors for AD and memory performance (20 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Blood samples were obtained from 118 control individuals matched for age within 5 years and place of residence.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The controls were drawn randomly from the population register of the municipality of the patient (33 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Cognitive status of the control individuals was tested and none of them showed symptoms of dementia at the time of the study.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Leukocytes were collected from total blood of the patients and relatives and permanent lymphoblast cell lines were obtained by transformation using Ebstein-Barr virus.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	192	 DNA was extracted from total blood or cultured lymphoblasts using a standard phenol/chloroform DNA extraction procedure.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	193	In our initial genetic analyses of the 100 cases we had included nine autosomal dominant cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	194	 However, recently an at-risk individual in 1066 (V-2, Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	195	 2 ) was diagnosed with probable AD and included in this study, bringing the total number of cases to 101.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Mutation analysis of exons 16 and 17 of APP excluded the presence of APP mutations in all cases (33 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The informative families of 10 autosomal dominant cases were used in linkage analysis studies with chromosome 14, 19 and 21 markers (20 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Family 1066 (mean onset age 42 years) was conclusively linked to chromosome 14, while two others were excluded.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	199	 The other results were not informative.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Since the linkage analysis studies were performed before the presenile AD locus on chromosome 1 was identified, the families had not been analyzed for linkage with chromosome 1 markers.

0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	215	 When aberrant SSCP patterns were observed the sequences of the fragments were determined using cycle sequencing.

0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received April 15, 1997; Revised and Accepted June 27, 1997.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	4	Missense mutations in the [beta]-amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) co-segregate with a small subset of autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) cases wherein deposition of the 39-43 amino acid [beta]-amyloid (A[beta]) peptide and neurodegeneration are principal neuropathological hallmarks.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To accurately examine the effect of missense mutations on APP metabolism and A[beta] production in vivo, we have introduced yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing the entire ~400 kbp human APP gene encoding APP harboring either the asparagine for lysine and leucine for methionine FAD substitution at codons 670 and 671 (APPK670N/M671L), the isoleucine for valine FAD substitution at codon 717 (APPV717I) or a combination of both substitutions into transgenic mice.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We demonstrate that, relative to YAC transgenic mice expressing wild-type APP, high levels of A[beta] peptides are detected in the brains of YAC transgenic mice expressing human APPK670N/M671L that is associated with a concomitant diminution in the levels of [alpha]-secretase-generated soluble APP derivatives.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Moreover, the levels of longer A[beta] peptides (species terminating at amino acids 42/43) are elevated in YAC transgenic mice expressing human APPV717I.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These mice should prove valuable for detailed analysis of the in vivo effects of the APP FAD mutations in a variety of tissues and throughout aging and for testing therapeutic agents that specifically alter APP metabolism and A[beta] production.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	9	Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is a major source of disability and death.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Genetic investigations have identified several etiologies for AD (reviewed in 1 ), including: a dosage imbalance for chromosome 21, as occurs in Down syndrome (DS); mutations in the [beta]-amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) on chromosome 21, the presenilin 1 gene on chromosome 14 and the presenilin 2 gene on chromosome 1 in autosomal dominant early onset familial AD (FAD); inheritance of the apolipoprotein E4 allele on chromosome 19 as a genetic risk factor for both late onset FAD and sporadic AD.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	11	 A principal cytological hallmark of all AD cases is parenchymal deposits of [beta]-amyloid (A[beta]), a 39-43 amino acid peptide derived from APP (2 ).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	12	The APP gene encompasses 18 exons and ~400 kbp of DNA that gives rise to at least four tissue-specific alternatively spliced transcripts that encode proteins of 695, 714, 751 and 770 amino acids (3 -7 ).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	13	 APP, a type I integral membrane glycoprotein of unknown function, matures through the constitutive secretory pathway and is processed by several pathways, including: cleavage by [alpha]-secretase at position 16 of A[beta], resulting in secretion of the APP ectodomain, thus precluding A[beta] formation; degradation through endosomal-lysosomal pathways; cleavage by [beta]- and [gamma]-secretases at the N- and C-termini of A[beta] respectively, resulting in production and secretion of A[beta] peptides (reviewed in 8 ).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Missense mutations in APP occur in a small subset ( < 5%) of individuals with early onset FAD.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In two large related FAD pedigrees in Sweden (9 ) a double mutation at codons 670 and 671 (of APP-770) results in substitution of lysine for asparagine and methionine for leucine (APPK670N/M671L).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In ~12 FAD pedigrees (10 -16 ) mutations within the transmembrane domain lead to substitutions of either isoleucine, phenylalanine or glycine for valine at residue 717 of APP-770 (APPV717I, APPV717F and APPV717G).

0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Cutting the plasmid DNA at a unique site (R) on one side of the mutation as well as introduction of the linear molecule into yeast containing the YAC and selection for Leu+ transformants result in targeted integration of the plasmid to the corresponding genomic sequence on the YAC.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	20	 (B) Subsequent selection for Cyhr transformants results in excision of the plasmid and generation of the wt or mutated sequence.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	21	 (C) High molecular weight DNA from a yeast strain containing the APP YAC and four representative ES transformants (see Table 1) were digested with HindIII, transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with a human Alu repetitive element (5).

0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	23	 (D) Cytoplasmic RNA from the ES transformants was subjected to RT-PCR analysis with appropriate mouse (mAPP) and human (hAPP) plasmid cDNA controls (5).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	24	 On the right are shown the sizes of the expected human (568 bp) and mouse (516 bp) products.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	25	Studies of transfected cells have provided enormous insights into the mechanism(s) whereby the FAD mutations affect APP processing and A[beta] production.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	26	 For example, cells expressing APPK670N/M671L secrete higher levels of all A[beta]-containing peptides as compared with cells expressing wild-type (wt) APP (17 -19 ); concomitantly, [alpha]-secretase-generated soluble APP derivatives are diminished (17 ).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In addition, cells expressing the APP717 substitutions specifically secrete elevated levels of longer A[beta] peptides (20 ), extending to residues 42 and/or 43 [A[beta]1-42(43)].
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Evidence that A[beta]1-42(43) is a highly pathogenic A[beta] species derives from biophysical studies showing the highly fibrillogenic nature of the peptide and immunocytochemical studies of brains of AD and DS individuals, demonstrating that A[beta]1-42(43) peptides are deposited relatively early in the disease (21 -24 ).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	29	Numerous standard transgenic mice have been generated that express various wt and mutant APP cDNAs or gene fragments from a variety of promoters (reviewed in 25 ; see also 26 -28 ).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Although these studies have revealed that APP transgenic mice can develop age-related A[beta] deposits, they have not specifically and accurately examined the effect of the regulated expression of APPK670N/M671L and APPV717I on the metabolism of APP and A[beta] in vivo.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In contrast, our efforts were designed to introduce the entire ~400 kbp human APP gene harboring the FAD mutations into the germline of transgenic mice, thus allowing for the proper spatial and temporal expression of mutant APP with appropriate splice donor and acceptor sites needed to generate the entire spectrum of alternatively spliced APP transcripts and encoded proteins.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	32	 A 650 kbp yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) containing the APP gene was mutagenized using a homologous recombination strategy in yeast, introduced into mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by lipid-mediated transfection and finally transferred into the mouse germline.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In brain and peripheral tissues of these mutant APP YAC transgenic mice high levels of human APP mRNA and protein are expressed in a manner that mirrors the spatial and temporal expression pattern of endogenous mouse APP gene products.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Furthermore, elevated levels of A[beta] peptides are detected in the brains of YAC transgenic mice expressing human APPK670N/M671L, with a concomitant decrease in levels of soluble [alpha]-secretase-generated APP derivatives as compared with mice expressing similar levels of wt APP.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Finally, we demonstrate that elevated levels of longer A[beta] peptides are detected in YAC transgenic mice expressing human APPV717I.

0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	37	The APPK670N/M671L and the APPV717I FAD mutations were introduced into a YAC containing the entire wt 400 kb human APP gene and ~250 kbp of flanking sequences with multiple neomycin resistance expression cassettes in the YAC vector arm by homologous recombination in yeast (29 ).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Briefly, genomic sequences containing the APP exons (16 and 17) to be mutagenized were subcloned by screening an APP YAC genomic sub-library with exon-specific PCR products.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The mutations in exons 16 (APPK670N/M671L) and 17 (APPV717I) were introduced into the respective genomic fragments using PCR-based mutagenesis strategies and then subcloned into the yeast vector p680.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	40	 p680 contains the yeast Leu2 gene, which permits growth in the absence of leucine, and the Cyh2 gene, which confers sensitivity to cycloheximide (30 ).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Finally, two-step gene replacement was performed in yeast to introduce the mutated APP genomic sequences into the 650 kbp APP YAC (Fig.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	42	 YACs containing the mutated APP genomic sequences were identified by restriction digestion and sequencing of exon-specific PCR products, while the integrity of the mutant YACs was confirmed by restriction digestion, Southern analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of yeast genomic DNA (data not shown).

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	3	The mechanisms by which mutations in presenilin-1 (PS1) and presenilin-2 (PS2) result in the Alzheimer's disease phenotype are unclear.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Full-length PS1 and PS2 are each processed into stable proteolytic fragments after their biosynthesis in transfected cells.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	5	 PS1 and PS2 have been localized by immunocytochemistry to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments, but previous studies could not differentiate between the full-length presenilin proteins and their fragments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We carried out subcellular fractionation of cells stably transfected with PS1 or PS2 to determine the localization of full-length presenilins and their fragments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Full-length PS1 and PS2 were principally distributed in ER fractions, whereas the N- and C-terminal fragments were localized predominantly to the Golgi fractions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In cells expressing the PS1 mutant lacking exon 9 (E9), we observed only full-length molecules that were present in the ER and Golgi fractions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The turnover rate was considerably slower for the E9 holoprotein, apparently due to decreased degradation within the ER.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Our results suggest that that full-length presenilin proteins are primarily ER resident molecules and undergo endoproteolysis within the ER.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The fragments are subsequently transported to the Golgi compartment, where their turnover rate is much slower than that of the full-length presenilin in the ER.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	12	Alzheimer's disease (AD),1 the major age-related dementing disorder, usually occurs sporadically in the elderly population.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In a subset of cases, familial AD (FAD) occurs as an inherited autosomal dominant disease.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Mutations in three different genes are associated with the familial form of AD (reviewed in Ref.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The first FAD gene is the -amyloid precursor protein (APP), the precursor to amyloid -protein, the major component of senile plaques seen in brains of AD individuals.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The other genes, presenilin 1 (PS1) on chromosome 14 (2) and presenilin 2 (PS2) on chromosome 1 (3, 4), account for the majority of the early onset cases of FAD.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	17	PS1 and PS2, which are functionally homologous to the C.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	18	 elegans Sel-12 molecule (5, 6), are hydrophobic proteins that cross the membrane 6-8 times (7, 8).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In transfected cells, both PS1 and PS2 holoprotein are rapidly turned over with a half-life of under 1 h (9, 10).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, in transfected cells and in brain tissue, stable N- (NTF) and C-terminal fragments (CTF) are apparently generated by endoproteolysis from full-length presenilin molecules (9, 11, 12).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Immunolocalization studies of presenilins in transfected cells have demonstrated a predominant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi distribution (13, 14).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The localization pattern is similar regardless of whether the antibodies are generated to either N- or C-terminal epitopes, raising the possibility that the NTFs and CTFs remain in proximity to each other.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	23	 However, these studies cannot distinguish the full-length presenilin molecules from the stable fragments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	24	 APP is also located in the ER and Golgi, where direct or indirect interaction with the presenilins may contribute to the production of longer forms of amyloid -peptide (A) (15-17).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Thus, knowledge of the processing and trafficking of presenilin molecules is important to our understanding of the pathways of A production.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	26	The role of endoproteolysis in presenilin maturation and function remains to be defined.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Interestingly, a PS1 FAD mutation lacking exon 9 (E9) that results in the absence of conventional endoproteolysis (12) can nevertheless functionally replace an egg-laying defect resulting from a C.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	28	 To date, neither the subcellular distribution of the holoprotein and its fragments nor the compartment where endoproteolytic cleavage occurs is known.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	29	 To define the distribution of full-length forms and stable fragments of PS1 and PS2, we carried out subcellular fractionation of stably transfected cells.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Our results indicate that full-length PS1 and PS2 are located mainly in the ER, while their N- and C-terminal fragments are located principally in the Golgi.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Turnover rate of the E9 mutant PS1 protein was slower than wild type (WT) PS1 holoprotein.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Concomitantly, the steady state subcellular distribution of E9 PS1 extends to both ER and Golgi fractions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Finally, pulse-chase experiments combined with subcellular fractionation suggested that the endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 takes place in the ER.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	34	PS1 and PS2 Stably Transfected Cells-- Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with WT or mutant (M146L or C410Y) PS1, or with WT or mutant (N141I) PS2 were described previously (10, 17).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	35	 cDNAs encoding WT and E9 PS1 were subcloned into an ecdysone-inducible mammalian expression vector (pIND, Invitrogen) and transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells previously transfected with the pVgRXR construct that encodes the regulatory ecdysone receptor (EcR293, Invitrogen).

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The PS1 monoclonal antibody, PSN2, was generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 31-56 of PS1 (18).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	40	 A PS2 polyclonal antibody, 1209, was raised against a glutathione S-transferase bacterial fusion protein encompassing residues 1-70 of PS2.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Polyclonal antibody CT15 was raised against the last 15 residues at the C terminus of the APP (19).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Additional polyclonal antibodies included calnexin (StressGen) and rat Na+/K+-ATPase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The cells were then either lysed immediately or chased in regular medium for 1-8 h.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The cells were then collected and fractionated as described below.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	47	Subcellular Fractionation-- Cultured CHO and 293 cells were detached from confluent cultures grown in 15-cm dishes with 20 mM EDTA in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The cells were disrupted using 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer followed by four passages through a 25-gauge needle.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000  x  g for 10 min.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The pellets were resuspended in 1.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	58	The viscosity of the gradient medium is a major determinant of the sedimentation rate.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	59	 In addition, because subcellular organelles are osmotically sensitive, the osmotic activity of the gradient medium is particularly important.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Thus, although sucrose, glycerol, and Ficoll are widely used for gradient fractionation of cellular membranes, they are not ideal in osmolality and viscosity.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The advantage of using Iodixanol gradient is that osmolality and viscosity remain relatively constant with changes in the density of the gradient.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Under this mild iso-osmotic condition, all organelles and endosomes can be isolated intact, without loss of water as the density of the gradient increases.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	65	 A gradient stock solution of 50% Iodixanol was prepared by diluting in 0.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Sequential 1-ml fractions were then collected from the bottom of the gradient.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The subcellular markers, calnexin, galactosyltransferase, and Na+/K+-ATPase, were analyzed in each gradient preparation.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	71	Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting-- Subcellular fractions collected from linear Iodixanol gradients were lysed by addition of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 1%.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Resultant immunoprecipitates were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, separated in 8-16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to either polyvinylidene difluoride or supported nitrocellulose membranes.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Samples from pulse-chase experiments were transferred to membranes following fractionation and quantitated directly by phosphor imaging.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Western blotting was carried out with antibodies as indicated for each experiment.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Primary antibodies were visualized with either 125I-conjugated secondary antibody or with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and detected with Super-Signal enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	78	Galactosyltransferase Assay-- -1,4-Galactosyltransferase assay was performed from the Iodixanol fractions according to the method of Bretz and Staubli (20), in which the addition of [3H]galactose onto the oligosaccharides of an acceptor protein, ovomucoid, was measured.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	79	Subcellular Fractionation by Iodixanol Gradient-- CHO cells, stably transfected with PS1 (WT, M146L, or C410Y) or PS2 (WT or N141I), and 293 cells, stably transfected with PS1 (WT or E9), under the ecdysone-inducible system were analyzed by subcellular fractionation.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Subcellular vesicles were separated on 1-20% continuous Iodixanol gradients as described under "Materials and Methods.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	81	" ER-rich fractions were found, as expected, at the bottom of the gradient, using an antibody against the well characterized ER marker protein, calnexin (21) (Fig.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Calnexin-reactive ER vesicles were most enriched in fractions 1-4.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Golgi-containing fractions were identified by assaying for -1,4-galactosyltransferase, a trans-Golgi enzyme (20), and this was principally found in fractions 4-7 (Fig.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The latter reactivity was derived from molecules transiting the Golgi.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	87	 As an additional marker, CHO cells stably expressing WT APP751 were fractionated and analyzed by blotting with antibody CT15 (to the C terminus of APP).

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	125	293 cells expressing WT PS1 showed a pattern of distribution of holoprotein and stable fragments very similar to that seen in the CHO-transfected cells, although there was a tendency for the Golgi fractions to be distributed over a larger number of lighter fractions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	126	 However, E9 mutant protein, which does not undergo the conventional endoproteolytic cleavage (12), was widely distributed throughout the gradient fractions (Fig.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	127	 The extension of E9 PS1 into the lighter Golgi fractions was not a result of overexpression, because the same result was seen when muristerone A was reduced in this cell line to match the level of expression seen in WT PS1-transfected 293 cells (Fig.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	128	 As expected, we observed no conventional proteolytic fragments from E9 PS1 protein.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Furthermore, as reported (22), the level of N-terminal fragment derived from endogenous PS1 decreased as the E9 PS1 expression increased with higher muristerone A induction (Fig.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	130	 The distribution of the NTF in the WT PS1 and E9-transfected cell lines, the latter with or without induction, was identical; in the case of the latter cells, the NTF was derived only from endogenous PS1.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Therefore, the subcellular distribution of transgene-derived PS1 fragments was not altered by the transfection or overexpression.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Note that the levels of NTF derived from endogenous PS1 decreased as E9 expression increased with higher muristerone A induction.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	140	E9 Mutant PS1 Has a Longer Half-life-- It has been reported that transfected full-length presenilin, mainly located in ER as shown above, has a short half-life, while N- and C-terminal fragments, mainly located in Golgi as shown above, have a substantially longer half-life (9, 22).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Futhermore, our results showed that E9 protein, extending from ER to Golgi-rich and lighter fractions, had a distinctly different subcellular distribution as compared with WT PS1 holoprotein.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	142	 To determine whether the E9 mutant has a different turnover rate, WT and E9 PS1 stably transfected 293 cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min and chased for 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 h.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The half-life of WT PS1 was under 1 h (average of approximately 50 min from multiple experiments) for the holoprotein and more than 8 h for the NTF (Fig.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	144	 On the other hand, the half-life of E9 was consistently twice as long as WT PS1 holoprotein (Fig.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	145	 At steady state conditions as documented in the experiments described above, E9 protein was also present in the Golgi fractions, where stable proteolytic fragments derived from endogenous PS1 were located.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Surprisingly, the distribution of the E9 mutant PS1 was not substantially altered during the chase period (Fig.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	147	 After 4 h, the profile of E9 protein was similar to that seen at earlier time points, i.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Therefore, diminished degradation within the ER appears to account in large part for the prolonged half-life of E9 rather than a shift of the proteins into the Golgi fractions, where the turnover rate may be slowed.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	156	 In this experiment, the half-life of WT PS1 and E9 was 40 and 80 min, respectively.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	157	 In C, immunoprecipitation with J27 antibody was performed from each fraction after Iodixanol separation at time 0 and after 1 and 4 h of chase.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Note that the distributions of both WT PS1 and E9 holoprotein were not substantially changed during 0-4 h of chase.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The gradient fractions showed that the longer half-life of E9 was due primarily to diminished turnover of protein in the ER fractions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The distribution of NTF (arrowhead) in PS1 WT cells was shifted from the dense to lighter fractions during the chase period (top).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	161	 NTF derived from endogenous PS1 in E9 cells did not appear until the 4 h time point (bottom).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	162	Closer inspection of the NTF generated during the pulse-chase period showed that at time 0, small amounts of labeled NTF can be detected in the PS1 WT cell line (Fig.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Surprisingly, at this time point, the distribution of NTF was virtually identical to the full-length protein, i.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	164	 with the peak signal in fractions 3 and 4.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	165	 After 1 h of chase, the levels of labeled NTF were increased and were distributed more widely, extending into the lighter fractions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Finally, after 4 h of chase, labeled NTF was predominantly within the Golgi-enriched fractions, similar to that seen at the steady state conditions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	167	 These findings indicated that the initial cleavage of PS1 occurred in the ER and the proteolytic fragments were subsequently transported to the Golgi.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Similar localization of labeled NTF to the Golgi fractions was seen in E9 cell line at the 4-h chase time, representing fragments derived from endogenous PS1 (Fig.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Interestingly, endogenous NTF in the E9 cell line was not visible until the 4-h time point, suggesting a delay in the formation of this proteolytic species.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	170	The mechanisms by which mutations in PS1 and PS2 result in the early onset of the AD phenotype are unclear.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	171	 It is hypothesized that the selective increase in the production and release of the amyloidogenic A42 as a result of the presenilin mutations is a key factor in the pathogenesis of FAD (10, 23-26).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	172	 At present, the intracellular compartment where presenilin interacts directly or indirectly with APP is unknown.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	173	 In this study, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of presenilins in transfected cells.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Our results showed that PS1 and PS2 are similarly distributed, with holoproteins being principally located in the ER, while the stable PS1 and PS2 fragments were principally located in the Golgi.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	175	 The E9 PS1 mutation results in a broader distribution of the protein in both ER and Golgi-rich fractions as well as a prolonged turnover rate due to diminished degradation within the ER.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Our results also indicate that endoproteolysis to generate stable N- and C-terminal fragments occurs in the ER.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	177	Previous immunolocalization studies of transfected cells demonstrated that both PS1 and PS2 are located in the ER and Golgi (13, 14).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	178	 These studies, however, could not distinguish the signals derived from full-length protein versus stable NTFs and CTFs.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	179	 We therefore carried out subcellular fractionations of CHO and 293 cells stably transfected with PS1 or PS2 to determine the localization of full-length presenilin and its fragments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Our results showed that full-length PS1 and PS2 were distributed in dense fractions that colocalized with the ER marker, calnexin.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Both stable NTF and CTF were distributed predominantly in the lighter fractions that colocalized with the Golgi marker, -galactosyltransferase activity.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In these gradient fractions, the ER and Golgi fractions overlapped with each other and did not represent distinct populations.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	183	 We also cannot exclude the possibility of other organelles containing presenilins that may co-purify into same gradient fractions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Therefore, our studies can only determine the predominant localization of these presenilin protein species to these compartments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Lesser amounts of protein in other locations cannot be excluded, nor did we examine the nuclear localization of the presenilins as was reported recently (27).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Nonetheless, the clear subcellular separation between the full-length presenilins and the stable fragments is noteworthy, because it is not known whether the normal physiological function of presenilin is provided by full-length molecules or proteolytic fragments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	187	In our study, the subcellular distributions for two PS1 mutations (M146L and C410Y) and the N141I PS2 mutation were similar to each other and to the respective WT presenilins.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Therefore, most mutations do not overtly alter presenilin trafficking.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	189	 In contrast, the noncleavable E9 PS1 mutant was localized to a larger number of gradient fractions, being distributed to both ER and Golgi fractions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	190	 In addition, as was shown recently (22), pulse-chase studies showed that the turnover rate of E9 mutant protein was considerably slower than WT PS1 holoprotein.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	191	 We initially speculated that the transport of E9 to the Golgi compartment where the stable presenilin fragments are located may underlie the decrease in turnover rate of this mutant protein species.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	192	 However, pulse-chase labeling combined with subcellular fractionation showed that a significant pool of pulse-labeled E9 protein remained intact within the ER at a time when WT PS1 holoprotein was completely degraded.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	193	 This result suggests that reduced proteolytic degradation of E9 within the ER is responsible for the increased half-life of this molecule.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	194	 In time, a small fraction of undegraded protein, together with the endogenous NTF and CTF, are found in the Golgi compartment.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	195	Previous studies have consistently shown an inverse relationship between E9 expression and endogenous NTF levels (22, 26), suggesting that mutant holoprotein competes with the normal cleavage of endogenous PS1.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In this study, increasing expression of E9 mutant protein by muristerone A induction similarly led to progressively lower levels of endogenous PS1 stable fragments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Interestingly, in the pulse-chase/fractionation studies, the appearance of labeled endogenous fragments was delayed.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Therefore, production of NTF from proteolysis of endogenous PS1 is affected both quantitatively and kinetically in the presence of E9 mutant protein.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	199	 This competition is likely to occur in the ER, because E9 appeared to be largely degraded in this compartment.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	200	Our study also provides evidence that constitutive endoproteolysis of PS1 to generate stable NTF and CTF occurs in the ER.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Pulse-chase experiments combined with subcellular fractionation showed that the initial pool of labeled NTF, albeit in very low levels, was located predominantly in the ER fractions, similar to labeled holoprotein.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	202	 During the chase period, however, the amount of labeled NTF increased, consistent with a precursor-product relationship between full-length protein species and their fragments within the ER.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Importantly, the NTF was seen to distribute to lighter fractions during the chase.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	204	 By 4 h of chase, labeled NTF was distributed predominantly to the Golgi-enriched fractions, similar to that seen at steady state.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Taken together, these observations provide compelling evidence that constitutive endoproteolysis of PS1 occurs initially in the ER compartment.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	206	With the notable exception of the E9 mutation, the subcellular distribution of all of the other PS1 (M146L, C410Y) and PS2 (N141I) mutations was indistinguishable from WT PS1 and PS2, respectively.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Since all of these presenilin mutations have been reported to show a selective increase in A42 production (10, 17), our results suggest that perturbations in the ER to Golgi processing at this level cannot explain how mutants alter A42 generation.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Like the presenilins, maturation of APP in the exocytic pathway occurs in the ER and Golgi compartments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Thus, colocalization of both APP and presenilins in the same subcellular compartments leads to the possibility of an interaction between these two molecules, as has been reported in transfected cells (15, 17).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Using subcellular fractionation, we have recently detected increased levels of A42 in ER and Golgi fractions of cells expressing mutant presenilins (16).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	211	 These observations suggest that understanding the molecular interactions between APP and presenilins as well as other proteins within these cellular compartments will be important in resolving the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	3	The pathogenic autosomal dominant mutations in APP and the presenilins lead to increased generation of the fibrillogenic peptide A42, which forms amyloid plaques, one of the hallmark pathogenic lesions of Alzheimer disease (reviewed in Refs.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Moreover, A is neurotoxic both in vitro and in vivo (10, 11).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	5	 These observations have led to the amyloid hypothesis, which proposes that the accumulation of A in the brain causes neurodegeneration and the dementia of Alzheimer disease.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, despite the significant effort spent investigating the properties of APP, its biological function and the reason for its cleavage remain enigmatic.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	7	 There is evidence that APP plays a role in cell adhesion, axonal transport, neurite outgrowth, and, recently, signal transduction (12-18).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	8	It has been suggested that APP may signal by a mechanism similar to that of the Notch receptor, in which the intracellular tail released by presenilin/-secretase translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	9	 This idea was supported by the observation that APP, together with the adaptor protein Fe65, could activate the transcriptional activity of the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 (18).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Thus, presenilins may mediate the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of a number of transmembrane proteins that release soluble intracellular domains that carry out signaling functions (reviewed in Refs.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	11	The adaptor protein Fe65 contains three protein interaction domains: the WW domain, which binds proline-rich sequences, and two C-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domains, which interact with Tip60 and APP, respectively (18, 21).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Fe65 and APP have been placed within a biological pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans, as the respective mutants have similar pharyngeal pumping phenotypes (22).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Expression of Fe65 can lead to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of AICD, where it may induce apoptosis through Tip60 (23-25, 48).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In addition, Tip60 and its histone acetyltransferase activity have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression and DNA repair (26-28).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	15	 However, the mechanism underlying the ability of APP to regulate Tip60-mediated transcription has not been determined.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In this study, we provide evidence that, in contrast to Notch, APP is able to activate transcription through Tip60 independently of -secretase cleavage by recruiting Tip60 to the membrane, leading to Tip60 activation through cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated phosphorylation.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This is followed by nuclear translocation of Tip60 and Fe65 and activation of transcription.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	130	 This shows that the lack of Notch signaling in presenilin-deficient cells is due solely to the lack of presenilin-dependent -secretase cleavage of mNotchE.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Further illustrating this point, a similar level of transactivation was obtained upon expression of soluble NICD in both wild-type and presenilin-deficient cells (Fig.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	157	It has been suggested that APP may be able to carry out signal transduction through cleavage by caspases at a cleavage site within its cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (31, 32).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	158	 To address this possibility, we used the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone in another series of luciferase assays in HEK-293 cells.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Inhibiting caspase activity with benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone failed to significantly affect the ability of APP to activate Tip60 (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Notably, there was still no effect on APP signaling when both -secretase and caspase inhibitors were added together.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Similar results were observed in the wild-type ES and PS-KO cells (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Thus, APP retains the ability to activate Tip60 signaling in the absence of cleavage by either -secretase or caspases.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	163	A recent study identified the A-degrading enzyme neprilysin as a potential transcriptional target of C50/AICD (33).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	164	 We attempted to confirm these results using our wild-type ES and PS-KO cell lines.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	165	 We observed significant cell line variability in the levels of endogenous neprilysin that did not correlate with presenilin genotype (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	166	 3C), indicating that the variation is not related to presenilin expression.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Furthermore, we attempted to elevate neprilysin levels in PS-KO cells by overexpression of PS1, C50, or C50-Myc.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	168	 We did not observe any reproducible changes in neprilysin levels upon expression of any of the plasmids 24 h after transfection (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	169	 We confirmed that both PS1 and C50-Myc were expressed by Western blotting (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Moreover, we confirmed that transfected PS1 was functional, as it rescued the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments that was observed in the absence of -secretase cleavage of APP (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Similar results were observed in HEK-293 cells transfected with C50 or C50-Myc (data not shown).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	172	 These results suggest that neprilysin may not be a transcriptional target of C50/AICD.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	173	Complex Formation of Tip60, Fe65, and APP Having shown that holo-APP or the membrane-spanning C-terminal fragments rather than C50/AICD may mediate signaling, we investigated whether Tip60 forms a complex with holo-APP.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Tip60 co-immunoprecipitated holo-APP (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	175	 The presence of holo-APP suggests that Tip60 may form a complex with APP in a membrane compartment rather than in the nucleus as suggested previously (18).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Even with longer exposures, we were unable to detect significant levels of APP C-terminal fragments or AICD in the Tip60 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that Tip60 forms a complex with holo-APP.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Coexpression of Fe65 along with Tip60 and APP increased complex formation between Tip60 and APP (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	178	 These results suggest that Tip60 forms a complex with holo-APP, presumably at the membrane, and support the hypothesis that APP may signal through a mechanism that involves membrane recruitment of Tip60 rather than nuclear translocation of AICD.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	184	  Role of Cyclin-dependent Kinase (CDK) Phosphorylation of Tip60 in Signaling Because APP can activate Tip60 through a pathway that does not require -secretase cleavage of APP, we considered whether APP signaling involves the activation of kinase cascades.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Two CDK sites were recently identified in Tip60 at serines 86 and 90 (34).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	186	 To examine the role of these phosphorylation sites in APP-Tip60 signaling, we fused the Gal4 DNA-binding domain to a Tip60 mutant in which serines 86 and 90 were converted to alanines.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	187	 We then assessed the activity of the Tip60 mutant in luciferase reporter assays of transfected HEK-293 cells.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The Tip60 mutant could not be activated by coexpression of Fe65 and APP, in contrast to the strong transactivation observed with wild-type Tip60 (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	189	 To further confirm the requirement of CDK phosphorylation of Tip60 in APP signal transduction, we tested the CDK inhibitor roscovitine.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	190	 CDK inhibition with roscovitine significantly decreased the ability of APP to activate Tip60 (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Similar results were observed in the ES cells (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Thus, phosphorylation of Tip60 at serines 86 and 90 by CDKs contributes to transcriptional signaling.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	193	 The Tip60 phosphorylation mutant was able to co-immunoprecipitate APP as efficiently as wild-type Tip60 when coexpressed with Fe65 (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Thus, the inability of APP to activate the Tip60 mutant is unlikely to be due to an effect on complex formation between APP and Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	195	Stabilization of Phosphorylated Forms of Tip60 by APP and Fe65 We then determined whether APP facilitates Tip60 phosphorylation.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	196	 The wild-type or phosphorylation mutant Tip60 construct was cotransfected with Fe65 and APP in HEK-293 cells (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Treatment of the cell lysates with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase led to a condensation of the multiple Tip60 bands into a single faster migrating form, suggesting that the slower migrating forms are phosphorylated forms of Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	198	 The Tip60 mutant migrated at a lower apparent molecular mass compared with wild-type Tip60, consistent with lack of phosphorylation of Tip60 at the CDK sites.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Alkaline phosphatase treatment also led to the condensation of the Tip60 mutant bands into a single faster migrating form that comigrated with dephosphorylated wild-type Tip60, indicating that there are additional phosphorylation sites yet to be identified.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Coexpression of Tip60 with Fe65 and APP led to markedly enhanced levels of the slowest migrating phosphorylated forms of wild-type Tip60 (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Densitometric analysis of the blot showed an 73% increase in the slowest migrating band relative to the fastest migrating form of Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Fe65 and APP did not affect the Tip60 CDK phosphorylation mutant, suggesting that they act to specifically increase phosphorylation at the CDK sites.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Coexpression of APP and Fe65 also led to significant phosphorylation of Tip60 at the CDK sites in ES cells (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	204	 To confirm that this phosphorylation event is mediated by CDKs, we tested the CDK inhibitor roscovitine.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	214	 A substantial portion of Tip60 was present in the nuclear fraction whether or not Fe65 and APP were coexpressed (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	215	 5A), as expected based on previous studies (18).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	216	 However, upon expression of Fe65 and APP, there was a marked redistribution of Tip60 to the membrane fraction (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	217	 The nuclear protein lamin B2 was present in the nuclear fraction, but was not detectable in the membrane fraction, suggesting that membrane-associated Tip60 is not due to nuclear contamination.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	218	 We then determined whether endogenous Tip60 can be recruited to the membrane by APP.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	219	 For this purpose, we utilized control HEK-293 cells and HEK-293 cells stably expressing APPwt.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	220	 As observed with overexpressed Tip60, most of the endogenous Tip60 immunoreactivity was in the nuclear fraction in both the control and APP-expressing cells (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	221	 However, in APP-expressing cells, there was substantial Tip60 immunoreactivity in the membrane fraction that was not observed in the control cells.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The APPwt-expressing cells showed an 10-fold increase in membrane-associated Tip60 compared with control cells that did not overexpress APP and an 2-fold increase in total cellular Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Thus, endogenous Tip60 can be recruited to the membrane by APP.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Once again, the lack of lamin B2 signal in the membrane fractions suggests that Tip60 immunoreactivity in the membrane fraction is not due to nuclear contamination.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	225	We then determined whether APP recruits Tip60 to the membrane in vivo by performing subcellular fractionation of wild-type and APP transgenic mouse brains.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Tip60 levels were compared in membrane fractions from the cortices and hippocampi of wild-type and Tg2576 APP transgenic mice that were either 3 months old (prior to plaque formation) or 2 years old (when the amyloid plaque load is high).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Significantly more Tip60 appeared in the membrane fractions of all APP transgenic samples compared with age-matched wild-type control samples (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	228	 However, Tip60 was also detected in the membrane fractions of wild-type mice, particularly in the hippocampus, suggesting that membrane sequestration occurs under physiological conditions.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	229	 The purity of these membrane fractions was once again confirmed by the absence of the nuclear protein lamin B2.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	230	 These results suggest that APP recruits Tip60 to membrane compartments, consistent with the formation of a Tip60 complex with the transmembrane form of APP.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	231	Colocalization of Tip60 and APP The effect of APP on Tip60 localization was also examined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with HA-Tip60 alone (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	233	 6, A-C) or with Fe65 and APP (D-F).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Tip60 was labeled with anti-HA antibody, and APP was labeled with antibody C8 (raised against the APP C-terminal domain).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The nucleus was visualized by staining with Hoechst dye.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	236	 When Tip60 was expressed alone, it localized to the nucleus, as shown by colocalization with the nuclear Hoechst dye (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Coexpression of Tip60 with Fe65 and APP led to a dramatic change in the localization of Tip60, with Tip60 now appearing outside of the nucleus (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Moreover, there was substantial colocalization of Tip60 and APP on the cell surface (Fig.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	240	 The presence of non-transfected cells that were not labeled indicated the specificity of Tip60 and APP labeling.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	241	 These results are consistent with the formation of a Tip60-Fe65-APP complex at the membrane and confirm the results of subcellular fractionation.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	242	Shuttling of Tip60 between the Nucleus and Cytoplasm Our results suggest that APP recruits Tip60 to the membrane, which activates it through phosphorylation and complex formation with Fe65.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	243	 We investigated whether Tip60 contains nuclear localization and export sequences that could mediate Tip60 shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The PSORTII program identified two potential nuclear localization sequences within Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	245	 These were the short basic nuclear localization sequence starting at amino acid 184 (PGRKRKS) and the type 1 bipartite nuclear localization sequence beginning at amino acid 295 (RKGTISFFEIDGRKNKS).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Both of these nuclear localization sequences are completely conserved in the mouse, rat, and human Tip60 proteins.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	247	 We also identified a potential nuclear export sequence (LTTLPVLYL) that conforms to the classic LX2-3(L/I/V/F/M)X2-3LX(L/I) motif, which is completely conserved in the mouse, rat, and human Tip60 proteins (35).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	248	 This raises the possibility that active transport of Tip60 out of the nucleus may be required for the interaction of Tip60 with APP, which may then be followed by nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	249	 To determine whether nuclear export is required for Tip60 activation, we used the CRM1 nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B in the Gal4-Tip60 luciferase assay.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Treatment with leptomycin B greatly suppressed the ability of APP to activate Tip60 (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Thus, nuclear export of Tip60 or some other factor is required for APP to be able to activate transcription through Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	252	 These results support a model in which Tip60 actively shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, enabling its activation by APP and Fe65 at the membrane.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	259	The model of APP signaling that we propose differs from that of the canonical Notch signaling pathway in that APP signals via activation of cytoplasmic proteins through post-translational modifications rather than by providing an intracellular domain to activate transcription.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	260	 This difference is critical, as both we and another group (36) found that the C50/AICD fragment is unable to activate transcription, in contrast to the transcriptional activity of NICD.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Moreover, our results indicate that overexpressed C50/AICD acts as a dominant-negative protein to inhibit APP-Tip60 signaling.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	262	 However, -secretase cleavage appears to facilitate signaling in ES cells, presumably through the release of the Fe65-Tip60 complex from the membrane.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	263	 One potential -secretase-independent mechanism for the dissociation of Fe65 and Tip60 from APP and the membrane could be phosphorylation of APP at threonine 668, which has been shown to decrease the interaction between Fe65 and APP (37).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Interestingly, CDK5 has been shown to phosphorylate APP at this site (38), raising the possibility that CDK5 could play the dual role of activating Tip60 and releasing the complex from the membrane.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	265	One difference between Notch and APP processing is that APP undergoes constitutive ectodomain shedding and -secretase cleavage, whereas Notch undergoes ectodomain shedding only following ligand binding.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Thus, it is difficult to understand how APP signaling could be regulated if it occurs constitutively.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Our findings indicate that one mechanism of regulation of this pathway is through the activity of CDKs.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	268	 This is particularly intriguing, as altered activity of CDK5 has already been implicated in Alzheimer disease (39, 40).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Furthermore, the CDK5 activator p35 is membrane-associated, suggesting that CDK5 could specifically phosphorylate Tip60 when it is recruited to the membrane by APP.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	270	A number of potential target genes of C50/AICD have been reported recently.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	271	 One intriguing potential target is the A-degrading enzyme neprilysin, which was reported to be responsive to C50/AICD in presenilin-deficient cells (33).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	272	 We did not observe reproducible regulation of neprilysin expression by PS1 or C50.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Moreover, we observed considerable variation in neprilysin levels between ES cell lines that did not strictly correlate with presenilin genotype.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	274	 We also attempted to verify two other proposed target genes of Tip60, KAI1 and manganese-super-oxide dismutase (27, 41).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	275	 In our hands, reporter constructs containing the promoters of these two genes were not responsive to Tip60, Fe65, APP, or various combinations of these constructs.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Another recent study suggested that a fusion of the protein citrine to C50/AICD increases the expression of a number of genes, including APP, BACE, Tip60, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and KAI1 (42).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	277	 We have been unable to confirm these results by transfection of HEK-293 cells with C50 or C50-Myc, which could reflect a different activity of the reported citrine fusion protein.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Overall, we have not been able to confirm any of the proposed C50/AICD target genes that we are aware of at this time.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Further work needs to be done to delineate the APP signaling pathway with primary importance being the identification of endogenous target genes that are affected by APP.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Progress in this area may have been hindered thus far by the focus on AICD as the transcriptionally active form.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	281	The relevance of APP signaling to Alzheimer disease is unclear.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	282	 However, it has been shown that many pathogenic mutations in presenilins actually decrease Notch signaling (4, 43-45).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Moreover, presenilin-deficient mice exhibit a neurodegenerative phenotype (46).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Additionally, a recent study showed that familial Alzheimer disease mutations in APP can inhibit signaling through the APP-Gal4-VP16 fusion (47).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Thus, alterations in APP signaling could potentially play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	286	Overall, our data provide evidence for APP signaling by a novel mechanism that does not require -secretase cleavage by the presenilins and that involves recruitment of signaling factors to the membrane to facilitate phosphorylation and complex formation.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	287	 This mechanism would allow signaling to be regulated in multiple ways through the activity of CDKs, shuttling of Tip60 between the nucleus and cytoplasm, or possibly through -secretase activity, which may modulate activation even though it is not required.

0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	3	Studies of PSs and their role in the development of AD have led to an appreciation that they regulate a number of diverse functions in the cell.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	4	 PSs have been shown to play a role in proteolytic processing of amyloid ss protein precursor (APP) and APP family members (2,3), Notch and Notch family members (4,5), and ErbB4 (6).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In all cases, PSs appear to be required to permit the release of the cytoplasmic tail of these proteins from a membrane-bound stub that is generated after ectodomain cleavage of the holoprotein.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Significantly, inhibition of the release of the membrane-bound stub of these proteins alters signaling cascades that appear to be mediated by translocation of the cytoplasmic tail to the nucleus (6 to 8).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	7	 PSs have also been shown to interact with a wide array of different proteins, and have been implicated in IP3-mediated release of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium (9), capacitative calcium entry (10,11), ss-catenin signaling (12 to 14) and protein trafficking (15).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	8	Much work on PSs has focused on their role in processing APP (1).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	9	 PSs have been shown to influence the final cleavage step in the release of the approximately 4 kDa amyloid ss protein (Ass) from APP, a proteolysis that is referred to as -secretase cleavage.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This event generates Ass from a membrane stub of the APP, which in turn is produced by a previous hydrolysis of the APP holoprotein by a membrane-bound aspartyl protease referred to as ss-secretase.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Significantly, -secretase generates Ass peptides of varying lengths, with the two species of most interest being peptides of 40 amino acids (Ass40) and 42 amino acids (Ass42).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In all cases studied to date, mutant PSs increase the relative level of Ass42 production.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	13	 As the longer Ass42 aggregates more rapidly than other forms of Ass and had previously been shown to be increased by AD-linked mutations in the APP, these studies not only implicated PSs as modulators of -secretase cleavage, but also convinced many in the AD field that this longer form of Ass was critical to AD pathogenesis (16).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	14	Subsequent to these initial studies on AD-linked PS mutations, three lines of evidence have emerged to support a direct role of PS in -secretase cleavage of APP, as well as the -secretase cleavage that regulates the release of the cytoplasmic tails of Notch and ErbB4.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	15	 First, at the genetic level, PSs appear to be essential for -cleavage.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	16	 PS1 knockout markedly inhibits -secretase cleavage (3,4), whereas PS2 knockout has no apparent effect on -secretase activity (17), probably owing to compensation by the more widely expressed PS1.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	17	 However, a combined PS1/PS2 knockout completely abolishes -secretase activity (18,19).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Second, biochemical evidence also supports the identification of PSs as -secretases.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	19	 PSs co-fractionate with -secretase activity in a high-molecular-weight complex, and this in vitro activity can be recovered in the pellet after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PS1 (20).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In addition, mutation of two absolutely conserved aspartate residues (D257 and D385 in PS1, and D263 and D366 in PS2) results in PSs that act in a dominant-negative fashion  to  at least with respect to -secretase activity (21,22).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This leads to the hypothesis that PSs represent a novel class of intramembranous cleaving diaspartyl proteases, a hypothesis supported by inhibitor studies (23,24).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Third, four groups have been able to show that inhibitors of -secretase activity bind with varying degrees of specificity to both PS1 and PS2 (25 to 28).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Collectively, these experiments indicate that compounds, including some with properties of protease inhibitors, can bind to PSs.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Moreover, given that two groups had specifically designed their inhibitors to be transition state analogues of aspartyl proteases, it certainly appears that, despite the lack of demonstrable homology to known aspartyl proteases, PSs may be just that.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	25	More recently, the primary sequence encompassing one of the aspartate residues (D385 in PS1 and D366 in PS2) in PSs has been proposed to be similar to a region of type IV prepilin peptidases that contain a catalytic aspartate residue (29,30).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	26	 This sequence motif similarity, and their common feature of spanning the membrane several times, suggests that PSs and the bacterial signal peptidases may be distinct members of a novel class of intramembranous proteases.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Despite their local sequence similarities, PSs and type IV prepilin peptidases are not demonstrably homologous.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In order to investigate whether PSs possess hitherto unappreciated divergent homologues, we undertook searches of protein and nucleotide sequence databases using PSI-BLAST (31) and a hidden Markov model package (32).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	29	 These searches revealed a family of sequences with significant similarities to presenilins.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	30	 This observation may assist in elucidating the molecular and cellular functions of PSs.

0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	49	  In order to investigate whether the newly identified protein family is homologous to PSs, we constructed its multiple sequence alignment and compared a global hidden Markov model (32), derived from the alignment, with a second non-redundant database, nrdb90.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Results showed that presenilins represented all of the highest-scoring sequences, including a plant presenilin (Arabidopsis thaliana gene product At2g29900) whose sequence similarity to the family was significant (E=5.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	51	 These significant sequence similarities demonstrate that the eukaryotic and archaeal proteins represent a novel family of presenilin homologues (PSHs).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	52	Five distinct PSH genes were evident from the human genome sequence.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	53	 PSH genes were found in fungi, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and in archaea such as Archaeoglobus fulgidus.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	54	 This is the first time that PS homologues have been detected in eukaryotes other than plants and animals, and in prokaryotes.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	55	As predicted from their presence in the expressed sequence tag (EST) database, the human PSH RT to PCR experiments confirm that each of the PSHs is expressed in humans (Fig.

0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Authenticity of the products was verified by sequencing.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	66	  The proximity of PSH2 to the MAPT gene, which codes for the microtubule-associated protein tau, on chromosome 17 suggested that it might be a candidate gene for the variant of FTDP-17 that occurs in families that lack tau pathology and obvious mutations in tau (33 to 35).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Sequence analysis was therefore performed in the probands from four families with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with similar clinical and pathological phenotypes to these tau-negative families.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	68	 However, in each case, the FTD family was not large enough to confirm linkage to chromosome 17.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In addition, PSH2 was sequenced in control samples with H1/H1 and H2/H2 MAPT genotypes to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in linkage disequilibrium with these haplotypes in the adjacent MAPT gene.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	70	 This analysis demonstrated that PSH2 is highly polymorphic, with 12 SNPs being detected, of which nine alter the encoded amino acid sequence (Table 1).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Nine of the PSH2 SNPs were apparently in complete linkage disequilibrium with the H1/H2 haplotypes in the adjacent MAPT gene.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	72	 However, none of the SNPs were obviously pathogenic in the four FTD families, since all were present in control individuals or did not segregate with disease (R123Q and E209K).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	73	Of the five human PSH genes, the PSH1 gene neighbors a locus on chromosome 12q24 with linkage to bipolar risk (38).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	74	 PSH2 is the most proximal gene to the MAPT gene, encoding the tau protein, on chromosome 17q21.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Hyperphosphorylated forms of tau are often found in the brains of patients with AD, and MAPT mutations are associated with frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) (39,40).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	76	 On one hand, the close proximity of a PS homologue to a gene whose dysfunction is intimately associated with neurodegenerative conditions might be coincidental.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	77	 On the other hand, the close proximity (50 kb) of these genes might be significant, since sequence analysis has revealed multiple (nine) SNPs in PSH2 that are in complete linkage disequilibrium with the extended H1/H2 haplotypes in the MAPT gene (41).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The H1 haplotype is a genetic risk factor for the development of the sporadic tauopathies progressive supranuclear palsy (41) and cortical basal degeneration (42).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	79	 In addition, the location of PSH2 might be relevant to families that have been described with FTDP-17 lacking tau pathology and without obvious mutations in the MAPT gene (33 to 35).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Sequencing of PSH2 in multiple MAPT mutation-negative FTD families that have similar clinical and pathological phenotypes to these FTDP-17 families has thus far failed to reveal any evidence of pathogenic mutations.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	81	 However, none of the sequenced tau-negative FTD families is large enough to demonstrate linkage to chromosome 17q, and thus we cannot exclude PSH2 as a candidate gene for  tau-negative  FTDP-17.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The remaining three PSH genes are on chromosomes 20q11.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	83	All of the PSHs appear to be widely expressed, since each is represented by numerous ESTs from diverse tissues and cell lines.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Significantly, even though the intronless PSH2 might be predicted to be a non-translated pseudogene resulting from retrotransposition of an ancestral PSH mRNA, it does in fact appear to be expressed, at least at the mRNA level.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	85	 In these initial non-quantitative RT to PCR experiments, expression of PSH2 appeared to be lower than that of other PSHs.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	86	 More rigorous analysis of relative expression levels will be needed to determine the relative abundance of each of the PSH transcripts.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	87	The identification of a novel family of PS homologues is likely to lead to insights into PS function and evolution.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	88	 By inference from PSs, a diaspartyl peptidase function for PSHs is plausible.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	89	 However it is perhaps unlikely that PSHs cleave known PS substrates, since the PSH family, represented among the archaea and eukaryotes, appear to have arisen considerably before the appearance of PSs, Ass, Notch and ErbB4.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Moreover, double knockout of PS1 and PS2 appears sufficient to abolish -secretase cleavage of APP and Notch (18,19).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	91	 In any case, additional experiments will need to be conducted to determine whether or not any of the PSHs can cleave known -secretase substrates.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Based on their apparent expression in the brain, it is unlikely that known -secretase substrates are major substrates for the PSHs.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	93	 However, as has been shown for other enzyme families, the identification of a wider repertoire of PS/PSH family members may now facilitate a greater understanding of the molecular and cellular functions of this biomedically important family.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	94	 In particular, given the interest in developing -secretase inhibitors that target PSs as potential therapeutic agents in AD (1), information gathered by studying this protein family may offer important insights into the potential catalytic mechanisms and substrate-specificities of PS and PSH that will aid the development of such inhibitors.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	95	Further members of the PSH sequence family were detected by searching a non-redundant nucleotide sequence (NT; ftp://ftp.

0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	2	Background Patients with Alzheimer's disease show a wide variation in clinical phenotype.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Genetic research has been largely concerned with the role of mutations or common variants as risk factors for the disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Do genetic factors also influence clinical phenotype?.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	5	Aims To examine the evidence that genetic factors influence the clinical expression of the disease in addition to influencing risk.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	6	Method A selective review was made of the key literature.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	7	Results Mutations in three genes, coding for amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, and a common variation (4) in another gene, APOE, have been shown to lead to an earlier development of the disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	8	 More recently, genetic association and twin studies have suggested a role for genetic factors in the development of other aspects of clinical phenotype, notably the appearance of non-cognitive symptoms.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	9	Conclusions In Alzheimer's disease genetic variation influences a number of aspects of clinical phenotype.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	10	Early family and twin studies have indicated that a number of genes have an important part to play in the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Variation in these genes, including both rare mutations and common polymorphisms, appears to confer increased risk for the development of the disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, apparent increased risk may be largely explained by the effects that genetic variation has on the clinical phenotype of Alzheimer's disease, particularly the age at which the disease presents.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	13	 More recently, it has been proposed that genetic variation may also explain some of the other features of clinical phenotype, including the development of non-cognitive symptoms.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	14	The clearest evidence for a genetic contribution to the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease is the existence of families in whom the disease is transmitted in a clear autosomal dominant pattern.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Study of one of these large pedigrees revealed the transmission, from generation to generation, of a single point mutation in the gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP), found on chromosome 21 in family members developing early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Further studies of these families led to the discovery of other point mutations in the same gene and later the presence of mutations in two other genes, encoding presenilin-1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2 (PS-2), found on chromosomes 14 and 1, respectively.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	17	 To date, 12 Alzheimer's disease-related mutations have been discovered in the APP gene, 69 mutations in the PS-1 gene and 5 mutations in the PS-2 gene.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Significantly, research suggests that the different mutations in these three genes lead to a common result, an increase in ss-A4 peptide fragment of APP which forms the core of the neuritic plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	19	While these findings are of immense importance in terms of elucidating the biological pathogenesis of Alzheimer's diease, it is important to recognise that these three causal genes may only account for 30-50% of all autosomal dominant early-onset cases, or around 10% of familial early-onset cases (Cruts et al, 1998).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Thus, given that in the majority of cases ( >  95%) Alzheimer's disease occurs after the age of 60 years, it is clear that these genetic mutations make only a small contribution to the risk of developing the disease in general.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	21	The inheritance of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is more complex than that of the early-onset form.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In cross-sectional studies the presence of a positive family history of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is a consistent risk factor for subjects with the late-onset form, but a clear autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance is rare.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Both twin and family studies suggest a polygenic multifactorial mode of inheritance and as a consequence the elucidation of genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease requires different methods from those used in the early-onset disease, with its simple Mendelian patterns of inheritance.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Association studies have so far dominated the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Such studies look for variation in the frequency of an allele in samples of unrelated patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease compared with unrelated control subjects.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These studies have resulted in a number of candidate genes being proposed as having importance as risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and include associations with variation in genes encoding the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, PS-1 (an intronic mutation not associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease), butyrylcholinesterase, angiotensin-1 converting enzyme, 1-antichymotrypsin, the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex, 2-macroglobulin, the low-density lipoprotein-like receptor, the serotonin transporter and interleukin-1.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Typically, interest in these candidates has diminished as independent replication has not been forthcoming, and little evidence now remains for an important role for genetic variation in the VLDL receptor, PS-1 or 1-antichymotrypsin genes in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The other candidate genes still have their advocates and remain hotly disputed.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	29	More recently, the results of a number of linkage studies have become available.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The methods used for linkage studies in complex non-Mendelian diseases such as late-onset Alzheimer's disease are less powerful than those used for the early-onset form.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	31	 However, such studies can reveal areas of interest in the genome that might later be explored by association studies.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	32	 A complete genomic screen in a series of multiplex families affected with late-onset Alzheimer's disease has revealed five regions of interest on chromosomes 4, 6, 12, 19 and 20.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Excluding the effects of the APOE4 locus, the maximum log likelihood ratio (lod) score in this study occurred in a region located on the short arm of chromosome 12 (Pericak-Vance et al, 1997).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	34	 However, two subsequent studies following similar methods (Blacker et al, 1998; Wu et al, 1998) were unable to confirm linkage to this area.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A large sibpair study (Kehoe et al, 1999) has revealed many possible loci showing linkage to late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These include loci on chromosomes 1, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 19 (close to APOE) and 21 (close to the APP gene).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Currently, the main focus of attention is chromosome 10, with two independent studies showing evidence of a susceptibility locus in the same region (Ertekin-Taner et al, 2000; Myers et al, 2000).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, it is clear that a large number of loci are implicated and that there is some disagreement between studies in the predicted areas of interest.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	39	 These findings demonstrate some of the limitations of this approach, but also serve to emphasise the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Further exploration of these areas by association studies   the positional candidate approach   is likely to dominate the genetics of Alzheimer's disease in the future.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	41	Of the genetic risk factors that have been advocated as having a role in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, the least controversial remains the increased risk associated with possession of one or more copies of the APOE4 allele, coding for the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) variant 4.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Significantly, the importance of APOE4 was determined using a positional candidate gene approach.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Since this finding, other studies (Artiga et al, 1998; Bullido et al, 1998; Lambert et al, 1998) have also suggested an association between a number of polymorphisms within the transcriptional regulatory region of the APOE gene and late-onset Alzheimer's disease that is independent of ApoE 4 status.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Based on these data, it was suggested that there are two independent mechanisms by which risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease can be modified by the APOE gene: first, by variations in the coding regions, which alter the functional properties of APOE; and second, by the presence of promoter variants which result in quantitative differences in APOE expression (Artiga et al, 1998).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	45	 However, this hypothesis is controversial, and more recent studies (Helisalmi et al, 1999; Zurutuza et al, 2000) have failed to support the independence of APOE promoter variants in the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	46	GENETIC INFLUENCES ON CLINICAL PHENOTYPE.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	47	Age of onset Families carrying mutations in the APP gene have ages of onset largely within the range 40-65 years.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	48	 To date, no APP mutation carrier has been reported to be unaffected beyond the age of 67 years.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Families carrying mutations in the PS-1 gene have the earliest ages of onset, which fall largely within the range 35-55 years, although one such family member has recently been recorded with onset at 24 years (Wisniewski et al, 1998).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	50	 These mutations are largely associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, but at least two of these mutations (Ala79Val and His163Tyr) have been observed with late-onset Alzheimer's disease and may be non-penetrant (Cruts et al, 1998).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Families carrying mutations in the PS-2 gene have ages of onset largely within the range 40-70 years and thus show some overlap with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Penetrance is high but may not be 100%, with at least two reported cases of non-penetrance over the age of 80 years (Bird et al, 1996).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	53	The familial influence on age of onset in late-onset Alzheimer's disease may be substantial.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Thus, one study of affected sib pairs suggests that shared familial effects may account for 40% of the variance (Tunstall et al, 2000).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Indeed, studies have shown that in the late-onset disease the age of onset is approximately 6 years earlier in individuals who carry two copies of the APOE4 allele compared with non-carriers.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	56	 This has led to the suggestion that the APOE4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease mainly because in old age Alzheimer's disease and death are competing risks.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Any factor leading to an earlier age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in the elderly (and hence the development of the disease prior to death) will be associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Evidence confirming this hypothesis has come from a large study of approximately 5000 individuals (Meyer et al, 1998).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	59	 This study showed a clear decline in relative risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease in all subjects with increasing age but with a clear plateau beyond which no further new cases of the disease were reported.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The age at which this plateau was reached was earlier in carriers of the APOE4 allele.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Thus, it appears clear that the APOE4 allele has its predominant effect by determining when, but not if, an individual develops late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Meyer et al, 1998).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	62	Non-cognitive features If genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease are associated with non-cognitive symptoms, then one might anticipate that subjects with a family history of the disease have an increased frequency of these symptoms.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Likewise, one would expect an association between known genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, including the genes for APP, PS-1, PS-2 and the ApoE 4 allele, and these symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	64	In fact, there appears to be little consistent evidence of an association between either a positive family history of Alzheimer's disease or variation in known candidate genes and an increase in the frequency of non-cognitive symptoms occurring for the first time within the disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	65	 It thus seems unlikely that major genetic risk factors for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease have a substantial role to play in the development of non-cognitive symptoms within the late-onset disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	66	 However, this does not mean that these symptoms have no genetic basis, since genes may influence the phenotypic expression of the disease without being involved directly in its aetiology.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Indeed, early studies have shown evidence of an association between a positive family history of depressive illness and an increase in the frequency of depressive symptoms occurring for the first time within Alzheimer's disease (Pearlson et al, 1990).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	68	 These early findings are supported by a sib-pair study (Tunstall et al, 2000) showing that familial factors have a role in the development of depressive illness in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In addition, this small study also suggests a role for familial factors in a wide variety of non-cognitive symptoms, including agitation, aggression and psychosis.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	70	A more direct approach has also been adopted whereby common genetic polymorphisms previously showing associations with other neuropsychiatric conditions have been found to be associated with non-cognitive symptoms in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	71	 For example, one study (Holmes et al, 1998) of people with late-onset Alzheimer's disease found an association between common polymorphic variations in the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C serotonin receptor genes (102-T/C and Cys23Ser polymorphisms, respectively), previously implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder, with psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Associations were found between the presence of the C102 allele and the presence of visual and auditory hallucinations and between the presence of the Ser23 allele and visual hallucinations.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Another study (Sweet et al, 1998) has found evidence to suggest an association of psychosis and aggression in patients with Alzheimer's disease who carry common polymorphisms in the dopamine receptor genes DRD1 and DRD3.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	74	 These studies need to be replicated but they suggest that common receptor polymorphisms may have a role in the genesis of psychotic or other non-cognitive symptoms that are not implicated as genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	75	Cognitive decline No study to date has looked at rates of decline in carriers of APP, PS-1 and PS-2 mutations, but patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease who have a positive family history of Alzheimer's disease show no evidence of increased rates of decline.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The majority of studies have also failed to show any relationships between possession of the APOE4 allele and increased rates of decline.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This lack of association is interesting since it implies that genetic factors may determine only when the disease starts, not the rate of degeneration.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Clearly, caution is required when interpreting a negative finding and it may be that associations will always be difficult to establish because of the large number of confounding factors which may influence cognitive deterioration as well as difficulties with the use of psychometric scales over short periods.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Indeed, a study by Craft et al (1998) has suggested that there is an increased rate of cognitive decline in APOE4 carriers, which may be detectable by using a long follow-up period.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	80	Duration The mean duration of illness in families with PS-1 mutations is significantly shorter (range 5.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	81	8 years) than in families with both PS-2 (range 4.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	82	8 years) and APP mutations (range 9.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	83	0-16 years), reflecting the severity of PS-1-associated Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Studies of late-onset Alzheimer's disease suggest that the duration of illness tends to be longer in people who have a positive family history or in carriers of the APOE4 allele.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	85	 However, it has since been shown that this relationship no longer holds true once the confounding effects of age of onset have been taken into account.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Thus, in late-onset Alzheimer's disease, increased survival is more directly related to an earlier age of onset, which is influenced by a number of factors that are not exclusively genetic.

0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	88	CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS A number of genes have been implicated as risk factors for the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Variation in some of these genes appears to have a major effect in determining when   not if   the disease will develop.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Other aspects of clinical phenotype, notably non-cognitive symptoms, are also influenced by genetic variation.

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, September 9, 2004 , and in revised form, December 1, 2004.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	4	The PS-dependent proteolytic process is involved in the release of the cytoplasmic domains of an increasing range of type I integral membrane receptors such as Notch (4 to 6), ErbB-4 (7), E-cadherin (8), and others.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	5	 PSs, in addition to their role as -secretase catalytic subunits, have an important function in subcellular trafficking of a selected group of proteins such as APP, Trk receptor (9), Nicastrin (10), and Pen-2 (11).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	6	PSs mediate additional physiological functions, including roles in calcium homeostasis, neurite outgrowth, apoptosis, and synaptic plasticity (12).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Because deleting ps1 and ps2 genes in mice leads to an early embryonic lethality (13), the role of presenilins cannot be fully examined in double knock-out mice.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	8	Therefore, we used cells derived from PS1 and PS2 double null (termed PS1/2 null) blastocysts and their WT controls (14) to perform a differential proteomic approach.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We identified a presenilin-dependent defect in albumin binding reflecting an abnormal caveolae-dependent pathway.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We showed that caveolin 1 was mislocalized in PS1/2 null cells leading to abnormal caveolae formation and an absence of caveolin1 in lipid rafts.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Overexpression of PSs in PS1/2 null cells was sufficient to restore normal caveolin localization and function.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We could not detect any physical interaction between presenilins and caveolin 1.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These results imply that presenilins are responsible, in an indirect manner, for caveolin 1 transport to the cell surface to form caveolae.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	14	Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis Total protein extracts from WT, PS1/2 null, and PS1/2 null cells transiently transfected with the presenilin 1 cDNA (blastocyst-derived and SV40-transformed blastocyst-derived cells) were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis by the method of O'Farrell.

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells and WT controls were grown in 100-mm diameter dishes, and 2 x 107 cells were used to prepare the CEMs.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Cells were washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 2 ml of MBST buffer (25 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and homogenized with a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The extract was adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose in MBS lacking Triton X-100 and placed in the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube.

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	79	  Caveolae-deficient endothelial cells show defects in the uptake and transport of albumin in vivo (15).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Caveolin 1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts show defects in the endocytosis of albumin but not transferrin (16).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Caveolae-mediated endocytosis in endothelial cells is stimulated by the binding of albumin to a specific albumin-binding protein localized in caveolae (17).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Therefore, the defect of endocytosis and/or binding of albumin observed in PS1/2 null cells (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	83	 1) could be linked to the abnormal caveolae-dependent pathway.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	84	We next examined the ability of WT and PS1/2 null cells to bind/endocytose the fluorescent tracer FITC-albumin.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	85	 2 shows that PS1/2 null cells (left panel) failed to accumulate FITC-albumin even after 30 min of continuous incubation in contrast to WT cells showing cell surface labeling with FITC-albumin within 5 min of incubation.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	86	 To ensure that the lack of expression from the presenilins did not globally affect ligand binding/endocytosis, we also examined the intracellular uptake of a second fluorescent tracer, FITC-transferrin, known to be endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	87	 2 (right panel), FITC-transferrin was rapidly endocytosed in both WT and PS1/2 null cells.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Thus, PS1/2 null cells show a selective defect in caveolae-mediated ligand binding reminiscent of that observed in caveolin 1-deficient cells (16).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	89	To ensure that the defect in caveolae-dependent endocytosis observed in PS1/2 null cells was specifically because of a lack of PS proteins, we examined whether the transient expression of the presenilin cDNA was sufficient to restore albumin binding in PS1/2 null cells.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	90	 3A, the two-dimensional gel profile of proteins in PS1/2 null cells re-expressing PS1 was comparable with that of the corresponding WT cells (see Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The presence of BSA was detected on Coomassie-stained two-dimensional gels of either SV40-transformed blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells (top) or blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells (bottom) overexpressing PS1.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	92	 We confirmed this result by restoring efficient FITC-albumin uptake in blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells expressing either PS1 (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	93	 These results show that caveolae functionality is dependent upon either PS1 or PS2 expression.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	94	Because the phenotype observed in PS1/2 null cells (Figs.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	95	 1, 2, 3) is reminiscent to the one observed in caveolin1-deficient cells (16), we wondered if caveolin 1 was expressed in PS1/2 null cells.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	96	 By Western blotting, we were able to detect caveolin 1 expression in PS1/2 null cells.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	97	2 We decided to further investigate how caveolin1 was regulated in PS1/2 null cells in comparison to WT cells.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	98	 We employed the following three distinct methods to address this issue.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	99	 We first explored caveolin1 localization by immunofluorescence.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	100	 We then observed caveolae formation by EM.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Finally, we looked at the association of caveolin 1 with lipid rafts by sucrose density centrifugation.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	102	In order to evaluate caveolin 1 (Cav1) distribution between WT and PS1/2 null cells, we performed indirect immunofluorescence experiments (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	103	 In most of WT cells, endogenous caveolin 1 was predominantly localized at the plasma membrane with typical caveolae-associated punctated staining (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	104	 4A, I), whereas in PS1/2 null cells, endogenous caveolin 1 showed pronounced punctated perinuclear localization (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Altered localization of caveolin 1 in PS1/2 null cells was also observed after forced expression of GFP-Cav1 (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	106	 4A, IV) and with endogenous caveolin 2.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	107	2 This result shows that there is an intracellular retention of caveolin 1 in PS1/2 null cells.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	108	 To evaluate if caveolin 1 membrane localization was PS-dependent, we examined if transient expression of presenilin 2 cDNA was sufficient to induce a change in caveolin 1 localization.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	109	 4B, transient expression of FLAG-presenilin 2 (V) in PS1/2 null cells induced redistribution of endogenous caveolin 1 from its perinuclear localization (VI).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Micro-injection of PS1 cDNA in GFP-Cav1 positive PS1/2 null cells (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	111	 4B, VII) allowed GFP-Cav1 to be relocalized as in WT cells (VIII).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	112	 In contrast, no noticeable changes in GFP-Cav1 localization was observed after the microinjection of the Notch NICD (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	113	 4B, IX) construct in GFP-Cav1-positive PS1/2 null cells (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	114	 These results show that caveolin 1 is mislocalized in PS1/2 null cells and that even though most of the PS1/2 null mice phenotypes are attributable to a loss of Notch 1 function (13), presenilins are involved in the subcellular localization of caveolin 1 independently from Notch activity.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	115	Expression of caveolin 1 in cells lacking caveolae causes de novo formation of caveolae, whereas ablation or mislocalization of caveolin 1 expression causes a loss of caveolae (18 to 20).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	116	 We wondered if PS1/2 null cells showing mislocalized caveolin 1 were still able to form caveolae.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Caveolae are well defined organelles, forming flask-shaped necks at the plasma membrane easily distinguishable by electron microscopy.

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	122	2 These data show that presenilins are involved in caveolae formation.

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	129	 We performed isolation of CEM of WT and PS1/2 null cell proteins (see "Experimental Procedures").
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	130	 It has been shown previously that caveolae-enriched fractions isolated in this manner exclude markers for caveolae membranes such as the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum (22, 23).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Distribution of BIP and -adaptin, non-raft proteins localized in the ER and the trans-Golgi, respectively, was also examined to monitor the contamination of CEM with ER and trans-Golgi membranes (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Flotillins have been described as a new family of proteins associated with caveolae (24).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	133	 6A), flotillin 1 expression was restricted to fractions 4 and 5 (CEM), implying that extraction with Triton X-100 yielded good separation of lipid rafts from BIP and -adaptin not detected in CEM fractions.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Caveolin 1 expression was not restricted to CEM and was also found in other fractions in WT cells.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	135	 As shown previously (25 to 27), PS1 was also concentrated in raft fractions.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Caveolin 1 expression was detected in fraction 5 in WT cells (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	137	 6A) but not in PS1/2 null cells (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	138	 In PS1/2 null cells, caveolin 1 was only present in fraction 7 and in high density fractions (fractions 9 to 12) with Triton X-100-soluble proteins.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	139	 This result shows that in the absence of presenilins, caveolin 1 was not detected in the low density fractions normally enriched in caveolae (fractions 4 and 5), further supporting the fact that caveolae do not form.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Most surprisingly, flotillin 1 expression was no longer associated with lipid rafts in PS1/2 null cells, implying that not only caveolae but also other lipid rafts may be affected by a deficiency in presenilins expression.

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Non-raft proteins resident in the ER (BIP) and the trans-Golgi (ada, -adaptin) are recovered in heavier fractions.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	147	  In order to determine the molecular mechanism responsible for caveolin 1 mislocalization in PS1/2 null cells, we tested if presenilin 1 and caveolin 1 were able to interact with one another.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Despite a co-expression of caveolin 1 and PS1 in lipid rafts (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	149	 6A), we were not able to detect any interaction between endogenous presenilin 1 and caveolin 1 by immunoprecipitation in WT cells2 either from total extract or from CEM fractions.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	150	Altogether these results show that PS1 or PS2 expression is required for a correct localization of caveolin 1 in caveolae at the plasma membrane but that the absence of presenilins may affect other protein(s) directly implicated in caveolin 1 sorting.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	151	We observed an intracellular retention of caveolin 1 in PS1/2 null cells (Fig.

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	153	2 In these experiments, caveolin 1 was more broadly distributed than -adaptin.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	154	 The precise localization of caveolin 1 in the absence of presenilins needs further investigation.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	155	The mechanism by which presenilins, such as chaperone proteins, will allow the correct caveolin 1 localization and caveolae formation does not involve a complex between caveolin 1 and presenilin and is independent from Notch 1 signaling (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Flotillin 1 always targets to the lipid raft/caveolae fractions independent of the presence of caveolin (28).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Thus, the absence of flotillin 1 from lipid raft fractions in PS1/2 null cells is not because of caveolin 1 mislocalization, implying that the mechanism by which presenilins transport raft proteins to lipid rafts is more global and may directly affect a common protein involved in the targeting of raft-associated proteins to lipid rafts.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Lipid rafts are multifunctional organelles playing important roles in a variety of cellular processes, and in this work, we pointed to an important new role for presenilins.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	159	Neurons do not form caveolae but form lipid rafts with caveolae-type structures.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	160	 APP was found in membrane fractions with caveolae-like properties (29), suggesting that caveolae-type structures might be important in the manifestation of AD.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Moreover, targeting -secretase to lipid rafts was shown to up-regulate -site processing of APP (30), and presenilins were found highly enriched in caveolin-3-positive caveolae in astrocytes surrounding senile plaques (31).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Recently, -secretase complex was shown to be localized in lipid raft microdomains of post-Golgi and endosomes (32).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	163	 We can thus postulate that in neurons, presenilins may be implicated in the trafficking of proteins such as flotillin 1, which is responsible for lipid raft formation.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	164	 These lipid rafts would form the best environment for -secretase activity.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	165	 A better understanding of how -secretase complex is formed and transported to the cell membrane may lead to the development of new pharmacological strategies to specifically target the cleavage of APP and delay the progress of AD.

0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	3	These findings are well established and have driven therapeutics research, especially because they have allowed the development of animal models of these diseases as well as defined therapeutic targets (7).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In each of these examples, the precise  pathologic species  of protein is obscure, if there is one, and it is debated whether the deposits themselves, or some intermediate species such as an oligomer, are responsible.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	5	 This has been extensively investigated, with the balance of recent data favoring smaller intermediate species as the toxic entities (8); however, the generality of the fact that the mutated protein in each example can be deposited suggests that the process of pathogenicity is related to, although perhaps separable from, the process of deposition.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	6	By studying the autosomal dominant forms of these and other diseases, researchers hope to gain insight into the more common, sporadic forms, and from a mechanistic perspective, this has certainly been the case.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, perhaps more surprisingly, over this last 4 years, it has become clear that, in the case of many of these diseases at least, the haplotype of the Mendelian pathogenic locus influences the disease risk for sporadic disease.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	8	In this review, we briefly summarise these data, and then make predictions concerning the etiology and pathogenesis of these and other neurodegenerative diseases.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	9	 First, though, it is worth noting what a  haplotypic association  means from a mechanistic perspective: in the absence of coding changes, a haplotypic association implies there is genetic variability either in the amount of expression of the protein, or in the alternate splicing of the protein, and that this contributes to disease risk.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	10	Alzheimer's disease Extensive sequencing of the APP gene in late-onset Alzheimer's disease has failed to identify mutations (13).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	11	 However, analysis of data from sibpairs affected with late-onset Alzheimer's disease has consistently suggested that APP is a locus for this form of disease (14,15).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This suggests that genetic variability at the APP locus contributes to disease risk, although the precise variability has not been identified.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Such a finding is consistent with the longstanding observation that individuals with trisomy 21 inevitably develop Alzheimer pathology by their fifth decade (16); however, those few cases of Down syndrome caused by triplication of chromosome 21 distal to the APP gene do not develop Alzheimer's disease (17).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Thus, having three copies of the APP gene leads to Alzheimer pathology in the fifth decade and as yet unidentified genetic variability at the APP locus appears to contribute to disease risk.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	15	Frontal temporal dementia: tangle diseases Mutations in the tau gene cause many cases of autosomal dominant frontal temporal dementia in which there is tau pathology.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	16	 There are many sporadic diseases in which tau pathology occurs, usually as tangles, but also as Pick bodies or Argyrophilic grains (18).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	17	 There are two genetic haplotype clades in Caucasian populations, designated H1 and H2, which differ in intron sizes, promoter sequence and wobble bases (19).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The H1 haplotype has a frequency of 75% in Caucasians, and thus the H1 homozygotes constitute 60% of such populations.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, individuals with one of the three sporadic tau diseases, progressive supranuclear palsy (19), corticobasal degeneration (20) and argyrophilic grain disease (21), although not Pick's disease (22) or Guam disease (23), show a robust association with H1 homozygosity, with a frequency of H1 homozygotes being 95%.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	20	 These data show clearly that variability in either tau expression or tau splicing variability (or both) contribute to disease risk.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In this case, it is difficult to determine whether it is control of splicing or control of expression which is the key variable because it is indeed clear that many mutations which lead to Mendelian disease do so through altering alternate splicing (2,24).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	22	Parkinson's disease/Lewy body dementia Mutations in the -synuclein gene cause autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease, and -synuclein is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the pathognomic feature of Parkinson's disease (25).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Genetic variability in the -synuclein promoter contributes to the risk of sporadic Parkinson's disease (26,27) with the  associated  promoter allele being a stronger promoter (28).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Perhaps most convincingly, triplication of the whole -synuclein locus causes autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease/Lewy body dementia with an onset age in the fourth decade (29) and duplication of the locus leads to disease in the fifth decade (30).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Thus, with Parkinson's disease, there is a clear dose relationship between synuclein expression and disease occurrence, with normal genetic variability in the promoter contributing to the risk of typical idiopathic disease and with multiplications of the locus causing Mendelian disease with an onset age determined by the precise  dose .
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Protein studies in cell lines from affected individuals in these kindreds reveal that the amount of -synuclein produced correlates with disease (A.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	27	While these findings were unexpected, perhaps they should not have been.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	28	 All chemists know the power of the law of mass action, and perhaps it should not have surprised us that it may have profound implications in determining our risks of neurodegenerative disease (36).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Of course, one therapeutic approach in all cases, therefore, would be to aim to reduce the concentrations of the toxic proteins in the relevant tissue compartment either through decreased production, increased breakdown, or both.

0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received April 5, 2001; Revised and Accepted June 5, 2001.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	3	Presenilin (PS) proteins are required in -secretase-mediated cleavage of APP, since deletion of the PS1 gene inhibits Ass generation (23).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Moreover, the finding that mutagenesis of critical aspartate residues (D257 and D385) in PS1 causes reduced Ass secretion and accumulation of APPCTFs led to the hypothesis that PS1 may exert an aspartyl protease activity and that it might be identical to -secretase (24).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In addition to most APP mutations, PS interferes with -secretase activity in such a way that production of the highly amyloidogenic Ass42 is increased (25).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Consequently, a leading hypothesis for AD etiology is  the amyloid cascade hypothesis  (26) stating that increased Ass42 secretion represents a gain of misfunction.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	7	However, it was reported recently that the APP V715M mutation affects Ass40 rather than Ass42 secretion (7).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Moreover, the artifical putative active site D257A PS1 mutant causes accumulation of APPCTFs without a concomitant reduction in Ass secretion, indicating that accumulation of APPCTFs is not necessarily a direct consequence of decreased Ass production (27).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	9	Recently, several novel mutations, clustered at the -secretase processing site of APP, have been identified (6 to 10).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	10	 To compare their relative effects on -secretase cleavage, we expressed human APP695 with or without the clinical mutants T714I, V715M, V715A, I716V, V717I and V717L in primary cultures of cortical neurones and analysed the full scope of APP metabolites.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We demonstrate that these mutations lead to significantly increased relative Ass42/Ass40 concentrations and that the level of increase is inversely correlated with the age at onset of AD.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Furthermore, some but not all C-terminal APP mutations also influenced the turnover of APPCTFs, resulting in the accumulation of APPCTFs.

0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	43	  We further investigated whether the accumulation of APPCTFs observed with the T714I mutation was the consequence of reduced degradation or increased production.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Therefore pulse-chase experiments were performed and the turnover rate of wild-type and mutant CTFs was assessed.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	45	 As can be appreciated from Figure 4A and B, the turnover rate of the APP holoprotein is more or less identical for wild-type and mutant APP.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	46	 In contrast, the turnover rates of wild-type APPCTFS or APPI716VCTFs is faster than the turnover rates of the APPCTFs containing the T714I or V717I mutation (Fig.

0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Quantification of the radioactive bands is shown in (A) for the APP holoprotein and in (B) for APPCTFs.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The radioactive signals are normalized to the signal obtained for APP holoprotein at time zero.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Data are representative for two independent experiments.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	58	At the level of -secretase processing, the different mutations apparently have slightly different effects.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Mutations at codons 714 (T714I) and 715 (V715A and V715M) appear to primarily affect the 40-cleavage and cause a decreased secretion of Ass40.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Mutations at codons 716 (I716V) and 717 (V717I and V717L) predominantly affect the 42-cleavage and increase Ass42 secretion.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Hence, pathogenic APP mutations exert their largest effect on the cleavage site which is located two or three residues more N-terminal to the substitution (Fig.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	62	 This suggests that the residues in the P3' and P4' positions are of particular importance for the exposure of the scissile bounds to the catalytic sites of the -secretase protease(s).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Remarkably, the drastic decreases in Ass40 secretion observed with the mutations at codons 714 and 715 are not clearly accompanied by a large increase in Ass42 secretion.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	64	 However, as we demonstrated previously for the APP T714I mutation (8), Ass isoforms ending at residues 39, 38 and to a lesser extent 37 may counterbalance the decrease in Ass40.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Overall, it follows that the ratio of Ass42 to Ass40 is the best indicator of the severity of the disease in patients with APP mutations.

0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Residues that when mutated affect predominantly 42 cleavage (dashed line) are encircled with dashes.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Note that both types of residues are located at opposite sides of the helix (separated by the bold dashed line).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	75	  Unexpectedly, APP C-terminal mutations also influence the levels of APPCTFs.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The T714I, V717I and V717L mutations cause the accumulation of APPCTFs in neurons, whereas the V715A, V715M or I716V mutations have no significant effect on APPCTF levels.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Both - and ss-secretase-generated APPCTFs increase approximately to the same extent.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	78	 This elevation is not clearly accompanied by increased secretion of the sAPP, indicating that the accumulation of APPCTFs is not the direct result of increased - or ss-secretase processing of APP.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Increased levels of APPCTFs could also result from reduced -secretase activity (23).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	80	 It could be envisaged that the presence of the C-terminal APP mutation reduces -secretase activity.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Since Ass40 is the major Ass isoform produced, a specific reduction of the 40 cleavage could theoretically explain the accumulation of APPCTFs while maintaining Ass42 levels at a pathogenic level.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	82	 However, the APP mutations that drastically decreased Ass40 secretion (V715A and V715M) did not display APPCTF accumulation, whereas the others (V717I and V717L) did not significantly affect Ass40 secretion but accumulated APPCTFs.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Therefore, the effect of the latter mutations on APPCTF metabolism must occur independently from the -secretase cleavage step.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Our pulse to chase data indicated a reduced turnover rate of these mutant CTFs, suggesting that these APP mutations not only affect -secretase processing, but also the catabolic pathways that degrade these fragments.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Accumulation of APPCTFs was shown before with the Swedish and London APP mutants K670N/M671L, V717I, V717F and V717G (37), in agreement with our findings.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	86	 (37) proposed that APPCTFss is linked to a signalling transduction pathway.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Accumulation of APPCTFss was speculated to disrupt this pathway, leading to cytoskeletal abnormalities and neurodegeneration.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	88	 However, our data show that accumulation of APPCTFs is not a consistent feature of all APP mutants causing AD.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In fact, mutations V717I and I716V result in a very similar mean age of onset, whereas APPCTFs accumulate with the former but not with the latter.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Therefore, accumulation of APPCTFs is likely a less important factor in the overall pathogenesis of the disease.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	91	 It would be of interest to investigate these different mutations at the pathological level in the brain of patients.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Unfortunately, no material is yet available from patients with mutations that do not cause APPCTF accumulation, i.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	93	 mutations at positions 715 or 716 of the APP sequence.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	94	Finally, we propose a molecular model that integrates our observations.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	95	 If one presumes an -helical conformation for the transmembraneous part of APP (38) (Fig.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	96	 5B), then the mutations at residues 714 and 715, which primarily affect 40-secretase cleavage, are located at one side of the helix, whereas mutations at residues 716 and 717, which predominantly affect 42-secretase cleavage, are located at the opposite side.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	97	 It should be noted that the mutations at residues 714 and 717, leading to accumulation of APPCTFs, are located at one side of the helix, whereas mutations at residues 715 and 716, which do not lead to accumulation of APPCTFs are at the other side (Fig.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Our recent unpublished data (W.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	99	De Strooper) demonstrated that the region in APP spanning the currently investigated clinical mutations is involved in the direct binding of APP to PS1.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	100	 We speculate, therefore, that the investigated clinical mutations cause subtle changes in the binding interaction between PS1 and APP, and therefore mainly affect exposure of the scissile bonds to the catalytic site of -secretase The abnormal accumulation of APPCTFs observed with some of the APP mutants could also fit this hypothesis, since the PS1 D257A catalytic site mutant leads to accumulation of APPCTFs without the concomitant reduction in Ass production (27).

0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The filters were hybridized with the 32P-labeled KIAA0471 cDNA fragment identified by differential display.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The blot was also rehybridized to ss-actin probe as control.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	41	It is important to consider that besides the working problems of human samples and the fact that the human brain is thought to have the greatest complexity of gene expression of any region of the body (17), we obtained clear and sharp DDRT gels, improving the image of the bands compared with previously reported studies (18,19).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	42	We have identified one cDNA that is not expressed in septum or hippocampus of several Alzheimer's patients (including the one with the PS1 mutation).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	43	 As it was necessary to screen  > 35% of total mRNA to observe a difference in AD gene expression, this transcript could be important among the total genes potentially associated with AD.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The differential mRNA was identified as KIAA0471.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	45	 At this stage, this KIAA0471 mRNA cannot be directly associated with any known protein, but based on its predicted coding region it would be translated into a soluble large protein with a length of 370 amino acids (20) and a molecular weight of 43 kDa.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	46	 This predicted protein presents at least 95% homology with H.

0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Studies of predicted KIAA proteins indicate that having multiple domains they may participate in an intricate framework of assembly protein complexes.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Their predicted functions are mainly implied in cell communication/signaling, cell structure/motility or nucleic acid management (22).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	51	 This would be in agreement with an increased KIAA0471 expression in proliferative cells and its reduction in the neuronal loss associated with neurodegeneration.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	52	 If true, the absence of KIAA0471 expression evidenced by our results may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of septohippocampal lesion presented in AD.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	53	 At present, studies are being directly conducted to determine entire sequences of human KIAA proteins together with their biological functions and will help to better understand its involvement in a variety of diseases (23).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	54	Lack of expression of KIAA0471 gene in the PS1 mutation patient could be an additional factor that contributes to explain its very early onset dementia and/or early death.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	55	 A possible genetic association of presenilin 2 and KIAA0471 with AD cannot be discarded as both genes map in the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q24 to q25 KIAA0471 and 1q31 to q42 PS2).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	56	 AD mutations in this chromosome result in individuals with a wide range in age of onset (24) and the same is also shown by our results.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	57	 A special instability of the 1q chromosome is also suggested by the presentation of genetic abnormalities leading to gliomas (oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas) (25) and ependymomas (26).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	58	 On the other hand, well-characterized diseases sometimes appear linked to genetic mutations in the same loci where KIAA0471 maps (1q24 to q25).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	59	 This is the case of type 2 diabetes (27), immunoglobulin A nephropathy (28) and hereditary prostate cancer 1 (29).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	60	 At present, no direct relationship with AD has been established for most of these diseases, except the recently recognized association among hyperinsulinemia, diabetes and AD (30) and the insulin-degrading enzyme activity on ss-amyloid peptides (31 to 33).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Therefore, knowledge of the function of KIAA0471 protein in the future could elucidate their possible relationship.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	62	 This deficiency in KIAA0471 only showed up in male individuals and, though only one AD woman was included in this study, further study will be necessary to disentangle whether there is a link to gender.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	63	Further work is needed to determine what causes this lack of expression.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Among these, it could be due to a mutation in the KIAA0471 gene that results in an altered or missing mRNA (upstream effect) or simply to an ulterior suppresion of mRNA production by another factor (downstream effect).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	65	 At this moment, we are beginning new assays using microchips with DNA probes and specific antibodies against the predicted KIAA047 protein; these new attempts are aimed to understand the difference of gene expression found in this study using DDRT to PCR technique.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	66	 The study of the incidence of KIAA0471 mRNA deficit in Alzheimer's patients in a wide population sample, both in brain tissue and in blood, will give a key information for a better diagnosis of the disease in future.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	67	In conclusion, we found for the first time a strong reduction of the KIAA0471 gene expression in several AD patients, including one with the PS1 mutation.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The predicted defective protein presents 95% homology with IDN4-GGTR sequences.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	69	 This identification of a new genetic defect may give new clues to explain the pathogenesis of the AD process and be a new starting point for the design of rational diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These proteins are all characterized by repeats of the armadillo motif, a 42 amino acid sequence involved in protein to protein interactions, however, only the function of ss-catenin has been fairly well established.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	12	 One pool of ss-catenin is bound at the cell membrane to the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin and provides a link to the actin cytoskeleton.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	13	 A second pool is located in the cytoplasm in complex with axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and glycogen-synthase-kinase-3ss (GSK-3ss).
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Phosphorylation of ss-catenin by GSK-3ss promotes its binding to the ss-transducing repeat-containing protein (ss-TrCP), an F-box protein, and part of the E2/E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Maniatis 1999 ).
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Upon ubiquitination, ss-catenin becomes rapidly degraded by the proteasome (Fig 1).
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Binding of the soluble ligand Wnt to the membrane receptor frizzled inhibits GSK-3ss via a pathway involving casein kinases and the protein disheveled.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This results in the accumulation of unphosphorylated ss-catenin in the cytoplasm and its subsequent translocation to the cell nucleus.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Here, ss-catenin binds to members of the LEF/TCF (T cell-specific transcription factor 1) family of transcriptional regulators and activates Wnt target genes like cyclin D1, c-myc, and metalloproteases.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Thus, a finely tuned balance between the three ss-catenin pools at the cell membrane, in the cytoplasm, and in the nucleus, determines the final outcome of the Wnt signaling pathway (Fig 1, for a detailed overview see www.

0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	25	However, when the functional relevance of the PS-ss-catenin interaction was investigated, contradictory results were obtained.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	26	 PS1 appeared to either stabilize (Zhang et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	27	 1998 ) or destabilize ss-catenin (Kang et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Remarkably, clinical PS mutations that cause Alzheimer's disease also affected ss-catenin stability positively or negatively.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Given these contradictory results it remains unclear to what extent these observations contribute to our understanding of the disease (see www.

0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In an attempt to avoid methodological confusion, Soriano et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	32	 2001 have been careful not to overexpress proteins, to use primary cultures (and not large T-transformed cultures) of PS1 knockout fibroblasts, to apply rigorous controls, and to use several functional assays to make their point.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	33	 They convincingly demonstrate that ss-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasmic pool and LEF/TCF gene transcription becomes activated in the absence of PS1.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Their conclusion that presenilin is a negative regulator of the Wnt/ss-catenin pathway gains considerable support from recent in vivo studies in Drosophila melanogaster, showing that an accumulation of armadillo (the Drosophila homologue of ss-catenin) was observed in PS-deficient blastoderm embryos (Noll et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A genetic screen for suppressors of the armadillo phenotype yielded the Drosophila PS (Cox et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	36	An important question is how PS1 affects ss-catenin stability.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Since PS1 can bind GSK-3ss, it is tempting to speculate that it provides a scaffold for the phosphorylation of ss-catenin (Kang et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Interestingly, the ss-catenin interaction site on PS1 contains a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by GSK-3ss (Kirchenbaum et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	39	 2000 ), suggesting that this interaction is regulated as is the interaction of ss-catenin with the axin/APC/GSK-3ss complex.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	40	 However, from the data of Soriano et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	41	 2001 , it appears that PS1 is not needed for the phosphorylation of ss-catenin since phosphorylated ss-catenin species accumulate in PS1 deficient cells.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Furthermore, in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, fewer ubiquitinated ss-catenin species are observed in PS1 deficient cells than in wild-type cells (Soriano et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Instead, these results suggest that PS1 is needed for the ubiquitination of ss-catenin (but see Noll et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	44	 2000 ) and raise intriguing questions concerning the relationship of PS1 with the ubiquitin ligase machinery and the proteasome (Fig 1).
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	45	PS1 is also involved in the Notch 1 signaling pathway.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Notch 1 belongs to a family of large type I integral membrane receptors involved in cell fate decisions.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Upon ligand binding, Notch becomes proteolytically processed.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Its intracellular domain translocates to the nucleus where it binds to transcription regulators of the CSL family and induces the expression of Notch target genes (Fig 1).
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	49	 PS1 functions in the proteolytic complex needed to generate the intramembranous cleavage of Notch, not unlike the cleavage of APP (Kopan and Goate 2000 ).
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The embryonic lethal phenotype of the mice in which the PS1 genes have been inactivated can largely be explained by deficiencies in the Notch signaling system and therefore the physiological relevance of the ss-catenin/PS1 connection in mammals remained somewhat speculative.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	51	 However, as discussed in Soriano et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	52	 2001 , mice that specifically lack expression of PS1 in the skin have been generated (Zheng, H.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	53	 These mice develop a spectrum of skin tumors, suggestive of increased ss-catenin activity and the concept that PS1 may act as a repressor of this pathway in adulthood.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	54	Inhibitory cross-talk between the Notch and the Wnt signaling pathways previously was thought to occur at the level of the Notch extracellular domain binding to Wnt (Wesley 1999 ), and at the level of the Notch intracellular domain binding to disheveled (Axelrod et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	55	 PS1 seems now to provide a third level where such interaction could theoretically occur.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Deleting the cytoplasmic loop domain of PS1 annihilates its binding with ss-catenin, whereas the proteolytic cleavage of Notch and APP is maintained (Saura et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The function of PS1 in ss-catenin turnover can thus be separated from its function in -secretase processing.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	58	 As in many biological questions, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans could shed some light on this matter.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	59	 1998 provided evidence that a protein encoded by sel-10, a suppressor of the Notch signaling pathway, associates functionally and physically with SEL-12, the worm's homologue of human PS.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	60	 SEL10 is related to the CDC4 family of F box/WD40 repeat containing proteins.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	61	 These proteins are part of the E3-enzymes of the ubiquitin-ligation pathway and appear to function as adapters that recruit target proteins to a complex containing the E2 to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Maniatis 1999 ).
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	62	 More than 30 mammalian homologues including ss-TrCP have been identified (Winston et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The challenge now is to find out whether PS1 provides a scaffold for ss-TrCP or other members of the F-box protein family and ubiquitin-ligase substrates like ss-catenin.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	64	 It also will be important to establish whether the current findings can be extended to other proteins that bind to PS, e.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	65	 In conclusion, PS1 is involved in at least two proteolytic machines regulating signal transduction cascades: regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Notch and APP on one hand (Brown et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	66	 2000 ), and regulated protein degradation of ss-catenin in the Wnt signaling pathway on the other (Noll et al.

0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	5	Despite being associated with the presenilin complex, Notch cannot be cleaved since its extracellular domain somehow blocks presenilin activity.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	6	 After ligand binding, neuralized adds a ubiquitin to the intracellular domain of delta and triggers its endocytosis (2) (Kramer, 2001).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Ligand endocytosis triggers a conformational change in Notch that permits metalloproteases to cleave near the membrane at a second site (S2), then the extracellular domain is trans-endocytosed to the ligand-expressing cell (3) (Parks et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This event permits presenilin to cleave Notch at a third site (S3) located within its transmembrane domain (4) (Mumm and Kopan, 2000).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	9	 NICD is now free to translocate to the nucleus.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In cells expressing both Notch and ligand, ligand interferes with this process by an unknown mechanism; this interference may be relieved by the neuralized protein, which targets Delta for degradation (Kramer, 2001).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	11	Once in the nucleus, NICD converts CSL from a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator (5-8).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Our current understanding proposes that this conversion occurs by direct protein-protein interactions between the Notch intracellular domain, SKIP and CSL, which leads to SMRT/HDAC dissociation (reviewed by Mumm and Kopan, 2000).

0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	17	 NICD degradation resets the cell and prepares it for the next round of Notch signaling.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	18	Two specific regions of Notch are required for this activity: the `Abruptex' region of Notch (EGF repeats 17-29, dark blue) (Brennan et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	19	, 2001) and the region C-terminal to the ANK repeats that contains the PEST domain (Brennan et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This region was previously shown to bind Dishevelled (Dsh).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Dsh is a mediator of Wnt signals downstream of the Frizzled (Frz) receptors (Huelsken and Birchmeier, 2001).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	22	 During Drosophila neurogenesis, CSL-dependent Notch signals restrict neural competence to a small number of cells within an equivalence group (Kopan and Turner, 1996).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In this newly recognized role, Notch acts to prevent cells from acquiring neural or myogenic competence earlier in development.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Although it is unclear how Notch mediates this effect, or how many additional proteins are involved, this activity requires Deltex, a cytoplasmic ring finger protein (Ramain et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	25	, 2001) and the kinase GSK3ss (Sgg) (Brennan et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Deltex and CSL appear to be antagonistic, possibly because both compete for the ANK domain of Notch.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	27	 This cytoplasmic Notch activity may not require proteolysis (1,1'), however, it has not been determined yet whether presenilin or other proteases are required for the Deltex-dependent Notch activity.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Wnt acts to block Notch either directly, via the Abruptex domain (Wesley and Saez, 2000) (1-2) or, more likely, indirectly by stimulating Dsh to block GSK3 or to circumvent Deltex/Notch interaction (or both; 1',2').
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Interference with Notch/Deltex activity by Dsh requires the Dsh-binding region of Notch; deletions of this region and some Abruptex mutations render Notch a constitutive repressor of neural competence (2') (Ramain et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Removal of both Notch and wingless restores competence, suggesting that the only role of Wnt in acquisition of neural or myogenic competence is to antagonize Notch.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received July 29, 2003; Revised September 23, 2003; Accepted October 7, 2003.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	3	Several groups (7 to 9) have suggested that quantitative, intermediate phenotypes may be useful in unraveling the complex genetics of disorders such as LOAD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Clinical disease states such as LOAD are likely to result from an uncertain, complex sequence of pathophysiologic events whereas intermediate phenotypes may be more directly related to the action of a set of genes that are more easily identified.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Thus the identification of genes with variants that contribute to specific intermediate phenotypes may be a tractable way to identify at least some of the genes that contribute to diseases governed by complex genetics.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	6	 To optimize the utility of this approach, it is important to select intermediate phenotypes that are highly heritable and have a close biological link to the disease in question.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	7	In our studies, we have focused on levels of the amyloid ss protein (Ass), specifically Ass42, as a quantitative intermediate phenotype for LOAD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Ass is a secreted protein (10 to 12) derived from a set of large precursor proteins collectively referred to as the amyloid ss protein precursor.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Secreted Ass, which is produced by virtually all cells, is readily detected in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Most secreted Ass has forty amino acids (Ass40) but a small fraction (5 to 10%) has two additional amino acids at the carboxyl terminus (Ass42) (13 to 15).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In the brains of all patients with AD, a large amount of Ass aggregates and is deposited in senile plaques, much of it in the form of highly insoluble amyloid fibrils.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	12	 To make a definite diagnosis of AD, large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles must be demonstrated in the brain at autopsy (16).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In all LOAD patients, a large amount of the Ass deposited in senile plaques ends at Ass42.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In one-third of cases, Ass ending at Ass42 is essentially the only form of Ass deposited, in one-third it is the predominant form and in one-third a large amount of Ass40 is also deposited (17).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	15	 It is worth noting that synthetic Ass40 and Ass42 both spontaneously assemble into amyloid fibrils in vitro, but Ass42 forms amyloid fibrils far more rapidly than Ass40 (18,19).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The brain has very high levels of APP mRNA; the concentration of Ass in cerebrospinal fluid is 50 times higher than in plasma; and mixed fetal brain cultures produce far more Ass than other types of cultured cells (12,20,21).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Thus it is likely that senile plaques form specifically in the brain because Ass levels are higher in the brain than in other organs.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	18	The APP, presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 genes have many, fully penetrant mutations that cause early onset familial AD (EOFAD) (22 to 25).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Apart from its early onset and causation by specific mutations, EOFAD is clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from LOAD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	20	 We and others have shown that the EOFAD mutations all increase Ass42 and sometimes increase Ass40 as well (15,26 to 30).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Importantly, we observed plasma Ass42 elevations both in EOFAD patients and in young, cognitively normal carriers of EOFAD mutations (31).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	22	 We also observed Ass42 elevations in plasma from non-demented relatives of LOAD patients between the ages of 20 and 65 (32).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Importantly, these elevations were not associated with the ApoE4 allele or with variants in any of the EOFAD genes (32).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	24	 (33) found in a longitudinal study of unrelated elderly individuals, that those who subsequently developed AD had higher plasma levels of Ass42 than did those who remained free of dementia.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Collectively these findings show that Ass42 is closely linked to AD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	26	 To investigate the heritability of plasma Ass, we analyzed extended LOAD families and found that plasma Ass40 and Ass42 levels both have substantial heritability (34).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	27	Given these findings that the level of plasma Ass42 was likely to be useful as an intermediate, quantitative phenotype for LOAD, we performed variance components linkage analysis on this trait in a group of extended LOAD pedigrees.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This analysis showed significant linkage to a locus at 80 cM on chromosome 10 (35).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Linkage to the same region was obtained independently in a study of affected LOAD sib-pairs (36).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Together, these two studies provide strong evidence for a novel LOAD locus on chromosome 10 that acts to increase Ass42.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The sib-pair group estimated the effect of this locus to be equivalent to that of ApoE, suggesting that it was likely to be a major risk factor for LOAD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	32	 A third group found linkage in a more downstream region of chromosome 10 and focused on the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) as a possible candidate gene in this region (37).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	33	 More recently, a fourth group using age of onset as a quantitative phenotype in AD and Parkinson's disease (PD) families found suggestive linkage to chromosome 10 at 133 to 135 cM (38).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	34	An important advantage of the variance components approach employed here is that candidate genes, identified through their likely effect on Ass42, can be evaluated systematically to determine how much various within-gene variants contribute to linkage.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In this study, we analyzed VR22 for variants that contribute to the linkage signal on chromosome 10.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Both its location and function make VR22 a strong candidate gene.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Located at 80 cM at the peak of the previously reported linkage signal, VR22 encodes a novel catenin, -T catenin, which was recently cloned by Jannsens et al.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The catenins interact closely with ss catenin and play an important role in intercellular adhesion as strong intercellular adhesion depends on linkage of the cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton via the /ss catenin complex.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	39	 -T catenin is closely homologous to -N catenin, which is neuron specific, and to -E catenin, which is expressed in all tissues.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	40	 -T catenin is expressed at high levels in testis and heart, but it is also expressed in human and mouse brain (39).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	41	 -T catenin has overall sequence identity of 56 and 58% with -E and -N catenin respectively.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	42	 (39) have shown that that -T catenin interacts with ss catenin in a functionally effective fashion.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	43	 This makes VR22 a strong functional candidate because ss catenin interacts with presenilin 1 (40), which has many mutations that increase Ass42 (26,29,31) and cause early onset familial AD (24).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	44	 (40) has shown that loss of signalling through the ss catenin pathway leads to enhanced neuronal vulnerability to Ass.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	45	 In addition, ss catenin and presenilin forms a complex that leads to stabilization of the former, such that destabilization of this complex leads to ss catenin degradation and enhanced neuronal apoptosis.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Presenilin mutations were shown to lead to destabilization of the ss catenin to presenilin complex, degradation of the ss catenin and enhanced Ass production.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Given that catenins provide the link between ss catenin and its binding counterparts (such as presenilins) to the actin cytoskeleton, it is possible to postulate that mutations in catenins could lead to disruption of the stability of the ss catenin to presenilin complex resulting in enhanced neuronal vulnerability of cells to Ass and increased Ass production.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	51	  To determine if other SNPs in this region of the VR22 gene show stronger association, we analyzed 10 additional SNPs for a total of 13 SNPs analyzed in a region spanning 8.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Many SNPs in this region showed nominally significant association, but none showed association stronger than that observed with 4360 and 4783 (Table 1).

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	56	 These SNPs were selected to be in several groups, which were designed to span the entire VR22 gene at 250 kb intervals as well as the region 3' of VR22.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The known exons in VR22 were 43.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Given that the extent of LD in the human genome was estimated in different studies to be anywhere between 10 and  > 100  kb (41 to 45); and that this extent in any one genomic region is not predictable a priori, it is possible to miss association signals due to variants in-between our SNP groups.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	60	 However, given the size of VR22, and our extent of coverage throughout and outside this gene, association signals we did identify with the 4360 to 4783 VR22 SNPs will be well-bounded within VR22 with this SNP genotyping design.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Three to six SNPs were analyzed in each group, and linkage disequilibrium between the most significantly associating 4360 SNP and the other SNPs was analyzed in the 22 combined families (Fig.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Using a covariate style regression approach, each SNP was analyzed for association with plasma Ass42 in the 10, 12 and 22 combined LOAD families (Table 2 and Fig.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	69	  On both the 3 and the 5 sides of the strongly associating 4360 SNP, LD with flanking SNPs fell to essentially baseline levels within the large VR22 gene.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	70	 On the 5 side, SNP association with Ass42 also decreased to baseline levels within the VR22 gene (Fig.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	71	 On the 3 side, the significance of SNP association decreased by more than 2 orders of magnitude (from 0.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Association was at baseline levels on the 3 side 1 000 kb from the 3 margin of VR22.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	74	This bounding approach effectively limits the region of potential association on both the 3 and 5 sides of 4360 to within VR22.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Thus, our data provide strong evidence that the association of the 4360 and 4783 SNPs with plasma Ass42 is due to variant(s) in the VR22 gene.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	76	Given that a total of 51 SNPs were genotyped, the issue of multiple testing can be raised.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Many of the SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium and therefore are not independent from one another (Fig.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Therefore, a simple Bonferroni correction under the assumption of 51 independent tests is overly conservative for this study.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Nonetheless, even when Bonferroni correction is applied, the 4783 and 4360 SNPs are still significant in the 10 families (P=0.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	80	005) and the 22 combined families (P=0.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The association in the smaller set of 12 families are no longer significant after this overly conservative correction (P=2 and 4 for 4783 and 4360, respectively), nonetheless their inclusion in the analysis leads to improved evidence for association.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	82	Contribution of VR22 association to linkage at 80 cM We next investigated the contribution of the VR22 4360/4783 association to the linkage that we previously reported.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Our initial linkage findings were obtained using seven markers covering 14 cM on chromosome 10.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	84	 To analyze the entirety of chromosome 10, we genotyped 26 additional markers spanning 165 cM in the 10 LOAD families.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	85	 When all 10 families were combined, the best two point lod scores were obtained with 4783 (2.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The peak described by the multipoint lod scores broadened and flattened considerably with the incorporation of the additional markers, but the maximum multipoint lod score continued to be at 80 cM (Fig.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The multipoint IBDs used in these analyses are generated using the 31 markers as described in the text.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	92	  The reason for the broader and flatter peak in this fine-mapping analysis may be several-fold.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	93	 First, we utilized the MCMC MIBD estimation implemented in the Simwalk2 package (46,47) for the multipoint linkage results presented in this paper as opposed to the regression-based MIBD estimation algorithm implemented in SOLAR, which was used in our original paper (34, see also Subjects and Methods).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Second, genotyping of additional markers leads to more information regarding recombination that could potentially lead to a decrease in the original linkage signal obtained by fewer markers.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Third, utilizing a larger number of markers increases the likelihood of map or genotyping errors, despite the implementation of strict genotype-quality control measures.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Indeed, others have also found that fine-mapping with more markers can lead to a lowering in their original lod scores obtained with a lesser number of markers (48,49).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	97	To evaluate the extent to which the 4360 and 4783 SNPs [or functional SNP(s) associated with this tightly linked pair] account for the linkage observed, we repeated linkage analysis after regressing out the effect of the VR22 4360 association by including it as a covariate in the linkage model.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	98	 After regressing out the effect of this SNP, the multipoint linkage signal diminished substantially in the 10 combined families (Fig.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	99	 This marked diminution in lod scores indicates that a substantial proportion of the linkage signal for plasma Ass42 is accounted for by the VR22 4360 association.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The residual linkage signal that persisted after regressing out the VR22 4360 association indicates that there are likely to be additional variants that contribute to linkage, though this residual signal may also be due to random variation.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The diminution in the maximum multipoint lod scores, upon inclusion of the 4360 SNP as a covariate, is also evident from the comparison of the variance component model that excludes this covariate (Table 3B) to the one that includes it (Table 3C).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The P-value for the major gene effect at the maximum multipoint locus goes from 0.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The same trend is observed when the twopoint linkage for the 4360 SNP is assessed with and without including 4360 as a covariate (Table 3D and E).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The P-value for the major gene at the 4360 locus loses significance from P=0.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	105	Since they are intronic SNPs located 1.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	106	4 kb from the nearest exon, 4360 and 4783 are unlikely to have a functional effect, and their association with Ass42 presumably occurs because they are in LD with one or several functional VR22 SNPs.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Our sequencing of all VR22 exons in the only reported VR22 transcript (39) failed to identify any potentially functional SNP(s) that could account for the 4360/4783 association.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	108	 It is possible that there are functional SNPs that affect the splicing of known or alternatively spliced exons, in strong LD with 4360/4783.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	109	The basic premise in studying plasma Ass42 as an intermediate phenotype is that genes with variants that influence plasma Ass42 will be genes with variants that influence risk for LOAD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The results reported here are useful because they identify VR22 as a gene with variants that influence plasma Ass42, thereby increasing the likelihood that VR22 is the gene (or one of the genes) in the 80 cM region of chromosome 10 with variants that influence risk for LOAD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	111	 An important, unanswered question is how well the effect of a SNP on plasma Ass42 will correlate with its effect on the AD phenotype.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	112	 It is unlikely that the change in plasma Ass42 caused by a specific genetic variant directly increases risk for AD; increased risk for AD is probably produced by a related effect that the variant has within the brain.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Thus it is conceivable, perhaps even likely, that a specific variant with a strong influence on plasma Ass42 may sometimes have little or no influence on the AD phenotype and vice versa.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	114	 It is only by thoroughly studying several genes and elucidating the effects of the entire set of functional variants on the plasma Ass42 and AD phenotypes that this question can be answered.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	115	 It may be that effects on the two phenotypes correlate well for the variants in some genes and poorly in others.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	116	The results reported here indicate that VR22 variants significantly associate with plasma Ass42 and account for a substantial portion of our linkage signal on chromosome 10.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Additional analysis is needed to identify the entire set of functional variants that account for the Ass42 linkage at 80 cM.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Once they are identified it will be important to test their effects on Ass production and VR22 gene function by biological experiments; as well as to determine whether these functional variants modify the risk for AD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	119	Microsatellite genotyping DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using routine methods.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Genotypes for the microsatellites were obtained using ABI 377 and 3100 sequencers and associated Genescan/Genotyper software packages.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	125	 The order and location of 27 chromosome 10 microsatellite markers were determined from the Marshfield linkage map.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Two markers, D10S1435 and D10S1211, which did not have locations on the Marshfield linkage map (51), were placed on the linkage map according to the location estimates obtained from the MAP-O-MAT program (http://compgen.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Two SNPs found in the VR22 gene were also used as markers in linkage analysis.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	128	 These SNPs, 4360TC and 4783AG, are located at 61137462 and 61137039 bp, respectively, on the chromosome 10 genomic map in the Celera database (http://www.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The two SNPs were placed on the linkage map based on their approximate centimorgan locations estimated from the physical maps.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	130	Identification and genotyping of SNPs The VR22 genomic and mRNA sequences were initially obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) web site using the genomic contig NT_008663 and AF091606.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	131	 In order to identify SNPs, primers were designed to cover all known exons and a 7 kb intronic region between exons 10 and 11.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	132	 LOAD cases, elderly control subjects and family members from the extended LOAD pedigrees were then sequenced to identify polymorphisms.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The initial sequencing of the VR22 exons and the 7 kb intronic region identified three SNPs in the intronic 7 kb region (4825, 4783 and 4360).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Subsequently, many additional SNPS in VR22 and flanking genes were identified using the Celera database.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Our aim was to cover this region using SNP groups that are located at every 250 kb, with each group composed of 3 to 5 SNPs separated by 1 to 5 kb.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	136	 A total of 51 SNPs, including VR22 4360 and 4783 were genotyped throughout VR22 and the 3 (ANXA2P3) and 5 (SIRT1) flanking genes.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	137	 The SNPs within each group were found to be in strong LD with each other.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The SNP locations were obtained from the Celera sequence map.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	139	Variance components analysis We employed the variance components methodology, implemented in the software package SOLAR (53,54) to estimate the heritability of plasma Ass42 levels and to perform linkage and association analyses to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that affect the variance of Ass42 in our extended LOAD families.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	140	 This method, described in detail elsewhere (53,54), estimates the amount of variance in a quantitative trait due to a particular genetic locus (q2), residual genetic factors (g2) and individual-specific, random environmental factors (e2), based on the phenotype covariance between arbitrary relative pairs.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The covariance matrix takes the form.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	142	where is the matrix of the probabilities that each pair of individuals share genetic material identical by descent for a given chromosomal location (estimated from the genetic marker data), 2 is the matrix of kinship coefficients describing polygenic factors and I is the identity matrix describing sporadic environmental factors.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	143	In addition, the effect of shared-environment (h2) on the variance of the trait can also be estimated by including a household matrix in the model.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	144	 This is a matrix whose ijth element is equal to 1 if individuals i and j share a specified environment, and 0, otherwise.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Our family collection is largely composed of extended pedigrees, where we have measured the plasma Ass of most members from each family in a single batch of ELISAs.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	146	 To rigorously account for any possible assay batch to batch variations that may affect the variance in plasma Ass42, we included a household matrix in the models.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Since almost all individuals from each family were measured in one batch, the household matrix included an element=1 for those individuals from the same extended family and 0, otherwise.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	148	 We realize that by doing so, we are probably being overly conservative.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Since the shared-family (household) effect employed to account for potential batch to batch variance in the assay overlaps with the kinship effect (55), inclusion of the household matrix almost certainly overcorrects for batch to batch variance and underestimates the shared-genetic effect.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	150	 For this reason, we performed the heritability and linkage analyses, both with and without the household matrix in the model.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The multipoint results shown in Figures 2 and 3 include the household matrix.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The analyses without the household matrix yielded slightly better lod scores and higher heritabilities in general.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	153	The scalars q2, g2, h2 and e2 are estimated using maximum likelihood.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	154	 For heritability estimations, we compared an environmental model where q2 and g2 were fixed at zero and h2 and e2 were estimated, to the polygenic model where g2, h2 and e2 were estimated.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The linkage analyses were performed by comparing the polygenic model to the linkage model where q2 was also estimated.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The difference between the two log10 likelihoods for the models produces a lod score that is equivalent to the classical lod score of linkage analysis.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	157	 We incorporated sex, age, age2, sex*age, and sex*age2 as covariates in the heritability estimations.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	158	 None of these covariates were significant at P < 0.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	159	05 therefore, they were excluded from the multipoint linkage analysis.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	160	In order to minimize age and dementia-related environmental effects on plasma Ass42 levels, we performed all of our analyses on the 20 to 65 year age group, as in our previous studies (34,35).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Since variance components methods are based on the underlying assumption that the quantitative trait being analyzed has a normal distribution, 10log(Ass42) levels were used as the phenotypes.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Extreme outliers with plasma Ass levels  plus or minus 4 standard deviations beyond the mean were excluded from the analyses.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Thus the 10log(Ass42) phenotype analyzed had a normal distribution.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Plasma Ass measurements were done using a well established sandwich ELISA system as described previously (15).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	165	 All samples were measured in duplicate.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Each ELISA plate included samples from five volunteers.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The results from these five standard samples were used to normalize the values obtained so as to reduce plate-to-plate and day-to-day variance.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	168	Identity-by-descent probability estimations The identity-by-descent (IBD) probabilities at each genotyped marker were estimated using the pairwise likelihood-based estimation method implemented in SOLAR (53).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	169	 These IBD estimates were used to obtain the twopoint lod scores.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Multipoint IBD probabilities were also estimated at each centimorgan between each pair of adjacent markers using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multipoint IBD estimation approach implemented in the Simwalk2 package (46,47).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The MCMC process was run twice, once with the default length of 1000 replicates and a second time by doubling this process length.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Multipoint linkage analyses using these MIBD matrices were done using the variance components methodology implemented in SOLAR.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	173	 The results using the shorter and longer runs were similar.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	174	 The results of the latter are presented here.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Given that the computation time increases with the marker number and that our two most upstream markers yielded no evidence for linkage in any of the datasets, these two markers (D10S1435 and D10S189) were omitted from the MIBD estimations.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	176	 There are two major differences between the MIBD estimations utilized in our previous report of linkage on chromosome 10 and the current study (35).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The results of the previous linkage were obtained as result of genotyping seven markers in a 13 cM region, and the current study utilizes 31 markers spread from 28.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Second, the MIBD estimation approaches that we used in the previous and current studies are different.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The MCMC approach implemented in Simwalk2 (46,47) that we utilized in this study is different from the MIBD probability estimation algorithm implemented in SOLAR, which was the approach we utilized in our initial analysis of seven chromosome 10 markers.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	180	 (47), demonstrated significant differences between the results obtained by these two methods using the same dataset and concluded that the multipoint MCMC approach yielded more accurate MIBD probability estimates for inter-marker loci.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	181	 For this reason, we utilized the MCMC approach in this study.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	182	Tests of association We initially tested for association between the SNPs and plasma Ass42 in the 10 extended LOAD families using a regression based covariate approach in the variance components paradigm implemented in the computer program SOLAR (53).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	183	 In order to control for the effect of linkage, we included the linkage component (q2) in both the null and alternative models tested.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	184	 We used the multipoint IBD matrix () that yielded the maximum multipoint lod score at 80 cM in the 10 extended LOAD families.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The multipoint IBD probabilities in the matrix , were estimated in Simwalk, using the genetic marker information as described above.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	186	To test the effect of specific SNP genotypes, we used the measured genotype approach where we included the copy number of the SNP allele as a covariate in the analysis and regressed the plasma Ass42 phenotype on this covariate for each individual.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The measured genotype approach is a classical test for differences in trait mean by genotype described theoretically previously (56,57).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	188	 This approach was also utilized in previous association studies of SNPs and various quantitative traits in extended families (58,59).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	189	 For individuals with an XX, XY or YY SNP genotype, we used a covariate that takes the value of 0, 1 or 2, respectively.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	190	 This formulation assumes that the SNP is an additive QTL.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The model that includes the covariate is tested against the model that does not include it to determine its effect on the quantitative trait of interest.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Twice the difference in natural log likelihoods of these two models is distributed as a 2 distribution with 1 degree of freedom.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In order to test for association above and beyond linkage, residual genetic and same-household effects, these three components were included in both the null and alternative models.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	194	 We first tested for association between the SNPs and Ass42 in the 10 LOAD families that we previously used to describe linkage to chromosome 10 (35).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In order to control for the effect of linkage, residual genetic effects and same-household effects in this group, we estimated the effect of each SNP on the background of a model that included our 80 cM multipoint identity-by-descent matrix, as well as kinship and household matrices.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	196	 We then tested each SNP for association with Ass42 in a second, independent set of 12 LOAD families, and also analyzed the combined group of 22 families.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	197	Linkage analysis conditional upon association A conditional linkage analysis that accounts for association with a functional polymorphism (or one in strong LD with it) at the linkage locus will decrease or eliminate the linkage signal (58,59).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	198	 For this reason, we performed linkage analysis conditional on the association with our most strongly associating SNP (4360TC).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	199	 We performed this test by estimating the proportion of variance due to linkage on the background of a model that included this SNP as a covariate and comparing it to a linkage only model that excluded this covariate.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	200	Analysis of linkage disequilibrium We measured linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the SNPs and the haplotype groups within the 22 extended LOAD families by using the GOLD program (60).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	201	 We used the expectation-maximization algorithm of Slatkin and Excoffier (61) to determine various pairwise statistical parameters for LD, such as Lewontin's standardized disequilibrium coefficient D (62).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	202	 This algorithm determines LD from the founders and married-ins.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	203	 LD was estimated between the VR22 4360 SNP and all other SNPs.

0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	2	It is an aphorism that basic biological research lays the groundwork for solving important biomedical problems.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	3	 However, the reverse is true as well: focusing on problems of human disease can lead to important new insights into the intricacies of nature.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Research on Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 provides a case study for the latter, where the race to identify molecular players involved in pathogenesis has unveiled some unexpected and fascinating aspects of protease biochemistry and proteolysis-dependent signal transduction.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The 40-42-residue amyloid- peptide (A) is implicated in the early pathogenic events that lead to AD, and this peptide is carved out of the amyloid- precursor protein (APP) by - and -secretases (Fig.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	6	 These two proteases are considered such important drug targets that the search for inhibitors of A production within pharmaceutical companies has gone on for years even though both - and -secretases remained unknown until very recently.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Last year, -secretase was identified as a new membrane-tethered member of the aspartyl protease family (2-6), a finding that should greatly facilitate drug discovery.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	8	 -Secretases, which prevent A formation by cleaving in the middle of the amyloid domain (7), have now been shown to be members of the ADAM family (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) (8, 9).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	9	 At the same time, the mysterious -secretase is giving up its secrets as well.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	10	Genetic studies of families susceptible to autosomal dominant, early onset ( < 60 years) AD underscore the importance of A formation to the disease process (10, 11).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Several different missense mutations in the APP gene on chromosome 21 cause familial AD (FAD), and these mutations are found immediately near the -, -, or -secretase processing sites.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	12	 A Lys  Asn/Met  Leu double mutation near the -secretase cleavage site found in a Swedish pedigree leads to increased A production (both A40 and A42) (12), and indeed purified -secretase cuts peptide substrates with the "Swedish mutation" better than peptides based on the wild-type sequence (2, 4, 6).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The several FAD-causing mutations in APP near the -secretase processing site also affect A production, but in these cases the mutations alter the specificity of the protease, leading to increases in the 42-residue A variant (13, 14).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These findings bolstered the "amyloid hypothesis" of AD pathogenesis, because A42 is particularly prone to fibril formation (15) and is the protein initially deposited in the neuritic plaques that characterize the disease (16).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Genes encoding the polytopic presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 (PS1 and PS2), found on chromosomes 14 and 1, respectively, were later identified as major loci for FAD (17, 18), and mutations in the presenilins were likewise found to increase A42 production in transfected cell lines (19-21), transgenic animals (19, 20, 22), and human plasma (23).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Thus, presenilins somehow modulate -secretase activity.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In fact, deletion of PS1 in mice dramatically reduced -secretase activity (24), and knockout of both PS1 and PS2 resulted in complete abolition of this APP processing event (25, 26), demonstrating that presenilins are absolutely required for proteolysis by -secretase.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	18	-Secretase carries out an unusual proteolysis within the middle of the predicted transmembrane domain of its substrates, C99, generated by -secretase, and C83, generated through alternative processing by -secretase (Fig.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Indeed, a helical conformation of the -secretase cleavage site in APP can explain why nearby FAD-causing mutations specifically increase A42 production; these mutations are immediately adjacent to the amide bond processed to give A42 (27).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	20	 A phenylalanine-scanning study near the -secretase cleavage site and the resulting effects on A40 and A42 production provided important experimental support for the idea that the substrate is in a helical conformation upon initial interaction with the protease (28).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Other mutagenesis studies likewise indicated that -secretase has loose sequence specificity (29-31).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	22	The findings that PS mutations affect A42 generation and that PS knockouts prevent A production raised the question if presenilins are identical with the -secretases.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Presenilins appear to bear no obvious sequence homology with known proteases, and their homology to Spe-4, a Caenorhabditis elegans protein apparently involved in vesicle transport in spermatozoa, initially suggested a less direct role in -secretase processing of APP (17).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Furthermore, overexpression of presenilins does not lead to increased -secretase activity (20).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, presenilins themselves undergo proteolytic processing within the hydrophobic region of the large cytosolic loop between transmembrane domain (TM) 6 and TM 7 (Fig.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	26	 1B) to form stable heterodimeric complexes (39, 40).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	27	 (Most studies support an eight-TM topology for the presenilins (34-36), although six- and seven-TM topologies have also been suggested (37, 38)).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	28	 These heterodimers are only produced to limited levels even upon overexpression of the holoprotein (39, 41-43) and may be found at the cell surface (44).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Expression of exogenous presenilins leads to replacement of endogenous presenilin heterodimers with the corresponding exogenous heterodimers, indicating competition for limiting cellular factors needed for stabilization and endoproteolysis (45).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	30	FAD-causing presenilin mutants are likewise processed to stable heterodimers with one exception, a missense mutation in PS1 that leads to the aberrant splicing out of exon 9, a region that encodes the endoproteolytic cleavage site (39, 41).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This PS1 E9 variant is an active presenilin, like other FAD-causing presenilin mutants, causes increased A42 production (19, 46).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Upon overexpression, most PS1 E9 is rapidly degraded similar to unprocessed wild-type presenilins; however, a small portion of this PS1 variant is stabilized in cells (41, 47) and forms a high molecular weight complex like the N- and C-terminal fragments (40, 48), suggesting that it can interact with the same limiting cellular factors as wild-type presenilins.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	33	 These observations are consistent with the idea that the bioactive form of presenilin is the heterodimer and that the hydrophobic region is an inhibitory domain.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	34	 However, several artificial PS variants have been generated which are biologically active/inactive independent of their ability to undergo endoproteolysis (49, 50).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Therefore, further evidence is required to finally demonstrate the role of PS endoproteolysis for their biological and pathological function.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	36	Given the characterization of -secretase as an aspartyl protease that might catalyze an unusual intramembranous proteolysis, the sequences of presenilins were inspected and found to contain two conserved aspartates predicted to lie within TM 6 and TM 7, flanking the large cytosolic loop (51).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	37	 These aspartates appear to align with each other within the membrane and with the -secretase cleavage sites in APP (Fig.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Mutation of either aspartate to alanine completely prevented PS1 endoproteolysis, and these Asp  Ala PS1 mutants acted in a dominant-negative manner with respect to -secretase processing of APP.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Similar effects on APP processing were observed even when conservative mutations to glutamate (51) or asparagine (49, 52) were made, indicating the crucial identity of these two residues as aspartates and suggesting that the effects are not likely because of misfolding.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	40	 These effects have been corroborated by several laboratories and have been seen for both PS1 and PS2 (48, 49, 51-54), although a recent study demonstrated that the TM 7 aspartate may be less tolerant of mutagenesis compared with the TM 6 aspartate (55).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	41	The presenilins are also critical for processing of the Notch receptor, a signaling molecule crucial for cell-fate determination during embryogenesis (57).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	42	 After translation in the ER, Notch is processed by a Furin-like protease, resulting in a heterodimeric receptor that is shuttled to the cell surface (Fig.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Upon interaction with a cognate ligand, the ectodomain of Notch is shed by a metalloprotease apparently identical to tumor necrosis factor- converting enzyme (TACE) (58, 59).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Interestingly, metalloproteases such as TACE and ADAM-10 are among the identified -secretases that shed the APP ectodomain (8, 9).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The membrane-associated C terminus is then cut within the postulated transmembrane domain to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which then translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with and activates the CSL (CBF1, SU(H), Lag-1) family of transcription factors (60).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	46	 NICD formation is absolutely required for signaling from the Notch receptor; knock-in of a single point mutation near the transmembrane cleavage site in Notch1 results in an embryonic lethal phenotype in mice virtually identical to that observed upon knockout of the entire Notch1 protein (61).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	47	The parallels between APP and Notch processing are striking.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Not only are both cleaved by TACE, but also the transmembrane regions of both proteins are processed by a -secretase-like protease that requires presenilins.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Deletion of PS1 in mice is embryonic lethal, with a phenotype similar to that observed upon knockout of Notch1 (62, 63), and the PS1/PS2 double knockout phenotype is even more similar (64, 65).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Deficiency in PS1 dramatically reduces NICD formation (66), and the complete absence of presenilins results in total abolition of NICD production (25, 26).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Treatment of cells with -secretase inhibitors designed from the transmembrane cleavage site within APP likewise blocks NICD production (66) and nuclear translocation (67) and reduces Notch signaling from a reporter gene (67).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Moreover, the two conserved TM aspartates in presenilins are required for cleavage of the Notch TM domain; as seen with -secretase inhibitors, expression of Asp mutant PS1 or PS2 results in reduction of NICD formation, translocation, and signaling (44, 54, 55, 67).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Thus, if presenilins are the catalytic components of the -secretases that process APP, they are also likely the catalytic components of the related proteases that clip the transmembrane region of Notch.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	54	Advancing the understanding of -secretase and the role of presenilins in this activity had been hampered by the lack of an isolated enzyme assay.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	55	 (80) reported a solubilized -secretase assay that faithfully reproduces the properties of the protease activity observed in whole cells.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Isolated microsomes were solubilized with detergent, and -secretase activity was determined by measuring A production from a Flag-tagged version of C99.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	57	 A40 and A42 were produced in the same ratio as seen in living cells (~9:1), and peptidomimetics that blocked A40 and A42 formation in cells likewise inhibited production of these A species in the solubilized protease assay.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	58	 After separation of the detergent-solubilized material by size-exclusion chromatography, -secretase activity coeluted with the two subunits of PS1.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Remarkably, immunoprecipitated PS1 heterodimers also produced A from the Flag-tagged substrate, strongly suggesting that presenilins are part of a large -secretase complex.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	60	More direct evidence that presenilins are the catalytic components of -secretases has recently come from affinity labeling studies using transition-state analogue inhibitors targeted to the active site of the protease.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	61	 (80, 81) identified a peptidomimetic that blocks -secretase activity with an IC50 of 0.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	62	3 nM in the solubilized protease assay and contains a hydroxyethyl isostere, a transition-state mimicking moiety found in many aspartyl protease inhibitors.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	63	 While the transition-state mimicking alcohol directs the compound to aspartyl proteases, flanking substructures determine specificity.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Photoactivatable versions of this compound bound covalently to presenilin subunits exclusively (82).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Interestingly, installation of the photoreactive group on one end of the inhibitor led to labeling of the N-terminal presenilin subunit, whereas installation on the other end resulted in the tagging of the C-terminal subunit.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Moreover, whereas these agents did not label wild-type PS1 holoprotein, they did tag PS1 E9, which (as described above) is not processed to heterodimers but nevertheless is active.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	67	 (83) identified peptidomimetic inhibitors containing a difluoro alcohol group, another type of transition-state mimicking moiety, and these compounds were developed starting from a substrate-based inhibitor designed from the -secretase cleavage site in APP.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Conversion of one such analogue to a reactive bromoacetamide provided an affinity reagent that likewise bound covalently and specifically to PS1 subunits in cell lysates, isolated microsomes, and whole cells.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Either PS1 subunit so labeled could be brought down with antibodies to the other subunit under coimmunoprecipitation conditions, demonstrating that the inhibitor bound to heterodimeric PS1.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Seiffert and colleagues (84) likewise identified presenilin subunits as the molecular target of novel peptidomimetic -secretase inhibitors.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	71	 These inhibitors, however, do not resemble known transition-state mimics, so it is not clear whether they would be expected to bind to the active site of the protease.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	72	The discovery that presenilins are likely -secretases raises a number of fascinating questions with respect to protease biochemistry as well as protease evolution.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	73	 To carry out hydrolysis in a lipid environment, the transmembrane regions likely form a pore- or channel-like topography, with polar residues facing inward to allow entry of and interaction with the catalytic water.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	74	 With such a sequestered active site and the two-dimensional fluidity of the lipid bilayer, the substrate probably first interacts with a binding site on the outer surface of the protease, with subsequent conformational changes allowing entry of the substrate to the active site within the protease interior.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Further, given that the conformation of the substrate upon initial interaction with the protease is apparently an -helix, the enzyme must have some mechanism for unwinding or bending the substrate near the site of cleavage so that the catalytic water and protease residues can access the scissile amide bond.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	76	As for the origin of presenilins and other intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs) (85), it seems likely that certain polytopic integral membrane proteins acquired a few catalytic residues essential for catalysis rather than that soluble proteases somehow acquired multiple transmembrane domains.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This would explain why polytopic membrane proteases bear little or no sequence homology with soluble proteases.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	78	 For instance, in the S2P family of proteases that process membrane-bound transcription factors in mammals and bacteria, each contains an essential HEXXH motif that is a consensus sequence for a number of metalloproteases (86).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Otherwise, they bear little resemblance to other metalloproteases.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Similarly, presenilins require two conserved aspartates for proteolytic function but otherwise do not look like typical aspartyl proteases.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Apparently there are only a very limited number of efficient biochemical solutions to the problem of proteolysis, as mechanisms conferred to polytopic proteases are strikingly similar to those of soluble and membrane-tethered proteases.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Interestingly, the presenilins contain a motif near one of the critical aspartates that is also found in the bacterial type 4 prepilin protease family (50, 87), polytopic aspartyl proteases that also have eight transmembrane domains and require two completely conserved aspartates (88).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	83	 This finding further supports the idea that presenilins may indeed be polytopic aspartyl proteases.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	84	Considerable work lies ahead to understand presenilins/-secretases.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Clearly, the top priority is to identify the other critical components of the -secretase complex, allowing reconstitution of activity and development of a purified enzyme assay.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Assembly of the complex into active -secretase should allow more focused structural-functional studies than the current approach of expressing mutant proteins in whole cells or organisms.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Also, understanding how the more than 70 different FAD mutations in presenilins cause specific increases in A42 production might shed some light on how this deleterious function can be skewed in favor of other less noxious A isoforms.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Such understanding should not only suggest novel therapeutic approaches to AD but should also undergird our appreciation of the workings of an emerging class of polytopic membrane proteases.

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	4	Received for publication, June 7, 2004 , and in revised form, August 10, 2004.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	5	PEN-2 (presenilin enhancer 2) was initially identified during a genetic screen for modifiers of the presenilin homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans (SEL-12 and HOP-1) (8).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Subsequent studies confirmed that it is a component of the high molecular weight presenilin complexes and that its presence within these complexes is necessary for their maturation and activity (8, 13, 14).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Thus, loss of PEN-2 activity is associated with reduced presenilin levels (8, 15, 16), reduced presenilin endoproteolysis (13, 17, 18), and loss of regulated intramembranous proteolytic (-/S3 cleavage) activity (8).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of PEN-2 provides no clue as to its function.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, the protein is predicted to have two hydrophobic transmembrane domains (19, 20).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	10	 There are also a series of residues at the hydrophilic C terminus (residues 90 to 101) that are conserved during evolution and that we hypothesize are functionally important (see Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In support of this, one of the three naturally occurring loss-of-function mutants in C.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	12	 elegans is a stop codon mutation at residue Trp74, which truncates the protein near the beginning of this C-terminal hydrophilic loop (8) (see Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	13	 To explore this hypothesis, we have investigated the functional effects of mutations in this C-terminal domain.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Our data indicate that both the overall length of the exposed C terminus of PEN-2 and the sequence of a highly conserved DYLSF motif within this domain are important for binding of PEN-2 to other components of the presenilin complex and for proper function of the complexes during NCT maturation, presenilin endoproteolysis, and A secretion.

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The beads were washed three times with 1% CHAPSO in the same buffer.

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	32	Gradient Centrifugation For subcellular fractionation, the membrane fractions were isolated from HEK293 cells as described previously (22) and were applied on a step gradient consisting of 1 ml each of 30, 25, 20, 15, 12.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	33	8-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting.

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	35	A Assays A40 and A42 were measured as described by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (23, 24), using conditioned medium collected from PEN-2 knock-down HEK293 cells transiently transfected with either wild-type PEN-2, mutant PEN-2, or an empty vector as a control.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The values of both A40 and A42 were compared by Student's t test.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Because the DYLSF mutants represent a population of related mutants that are not fully independent of each other, we analyzed the mutations involving the DYLSF domain including the deletion mutants as a single population to avoid the risk of false positive results arising from multiple comparisons.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The AAA (IPG), del96 to 101, KDAS, and del100 to 101 mutants were individually compared with wild-type PEN-2 because they represent a small number of tests of a different hypothesis (that the length of the C terminus is critical).

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Endogenous PEN-2 in wild-type and del96 to 101 PEN-2 transfected cells were significantly reduced in the cell lysates (panel 2), whereas presenilin (panels 3 and 4), APH-1 (panel 5), and APP (panels 6 and 7) are unchanged.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	43	 B, the binding to presenilin (panels 1 and 3), APH-1 (panel 4), or nicastrin (panel 5) in del84 to 101 and del90 to 101 significantly reduced, whereas the binding in del96 to 101 is not affected much.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The binding between PS1 and endogenous PEN-2 (panel 2) compensates the failure in the binding to mutant PEN-2 (panel 1) in del84 to 101 and del90 to 101.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	45	  To explore whether these mutants caused destabilization of PEN-2, we assessed cellular PEN-2 levels following cycloheximide blockade of protein synthesis in HEK293 cells.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Endogenous PEN-2, wild-type PEN-2 tagged at the N terminus, and del96 to 101 mutant constructs had equivalent stability with a half-life of 9 to 10 h (Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	47	 In contrast, both the del84 to 101 and del90 to 101 deletion mutants were highly unstable, with a half-life of approximately 4 h.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	48	 This result is not surprising because the del84 to 101 and del90 to 101 molecules are not incorporated into presenilin complexes and are therefore not stabilized.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	49	 However, it is also possible that these proteins might be intrinsically unstable and that they are simply degraded before they can interact with the other components of the presenilin complexes.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	50	 To exclude this possibility, we transiently expressed V5-tagged wild-type and mutant PEN-2 peptides in PS1 and PS2 double knock-out ES cells, where the stabilizing influence of presenilin complexes are not present, thereby allowing a direct comparison of the intrinsic stability of the wild-type and deletion mutant peptides.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	51	 In PS1::PS2 double knock-out ES cells, the stability of transiently expressed wild-type and mutant PEN-2 proteins were equivalently reduced to less than 4 h, confirming that the mutant PEN-2 proteins were not intrinsically unstable (data not shown).

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The deletion and the tagging at C terminus accelerate the degradation of the PEN-2 proteins.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	54	 The stable transfectants expressing mock (panel 1), wild-type PEN-2 tagged at N terminus (panel 2), wild-type PEN-2 tagged at the C terminus (panel 3), del84 to 101 (panel 4), del90 to 101 (panel 5), and del96 to 101 (panel 6) were treated with cycloheximide for indicated time (0, 6, 12, and 24 h), and endogenous or exogenous PEN-2 in total cell lysates were analyzed.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	55	  To explore whether these mutants caused mistrafficking of PEN-2, we investigated the subcellular distribution of endogenous and exogenous PEN-2, using biochemical fractionation on iodixanol gradients.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	56	 This study revealed that endogenous PEN-2 is predominantly located in intracellular membrane structures, especially those of the endoplasmic reticulum (colocalizing with calnexin) and the Golgi network (co-localizing with GM130) (Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The distributions of exogenous V5-tagged wild-type PEN-2 as well as the del84 to 101, del90 to 101, and del96 to 101 mutants were essentially identical and just slightly shifted with regard to the distribution of endogenous wild-type PEN-2 because of the presence of the additional V5 tag and/or because of modest overexpression (Fig.

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	61	 GM130 (panel 1) and calnexin (panel 2) were used as a marker protein of Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	62	  Previous studies have suggested that PEN-2 plays a role in presenilin endoproteolysis, nicastrin maturation, and A generation (8, 13, 15 to 18).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Several of the mutants described above, even when stably overexpressed, are unable to displace endogenous PEN-2 from functional complexes.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	64	 As a result, it is impossible to measure the functional properties of these PEN-2 mutants in cells expressing endogenous PEN-2.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	65	 To circumvent this problem, we created PEN-2 knock-down cells by stable expression of PEN-2 siRNA.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	66	 In these PEN-2 knock-down cells, endogenous PEN-2 protein is moderately (clone 10) or severely depleted (clones 13, 17, and 19) (Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	67	 In agreement with previously reported studies using transient siRNA expression of PEN-2 (16, 18), our PEN-2 stable knock-down cells showed significant accumulations of immature glycosylated nicastrin (Fig.

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	69	 These PEN-2 knock-down cells also showed significant reductions in the amount of mature PS1-NTF, and these reductions in PS1-NTF levels were in proportion to the degree of depletion of PEN-2.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	70	 As expected from previous work showing that APH-1 is a stable initial scaffolding molecule (21), APH-1 (Fig.

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	75	 PEN-2 knock-down cells fail in NCT maturation, PS endoproteolysis, and A secretion, resulting in the accumulation of APP-CTF.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	76	 In mock (clones 3 and 5) and PEN-2 knock-down cells (clones 10, 13, 17, and 19), PEN-2, NCT, PS1, APH-1, APP, and A secretion were analyzed (panels 1 to 7, respectively).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	77	  To assess the interaction of these PEN-2 deletion mutants (del84 to 101, del90 to 101, and del96 to 101) with nicastrin, presenilins, and APH-1 in the absence of interference from endogenous PEN-2, we transiently expressed each of these deletion mutants in the PEN-2 knock-down cells.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	78	 As expected from the initial immunoprecipitation experiments reported above, both the del84 to 101 and the del90 to 101 mutants bound poorly to the other presenilin components even in the absence of endogenous PEN-2 (Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Again in agreement with the results reported above, the binding of the del96 to 101 mutant to nicastrin, PS1, and APH-1 was reduced, but less severely than binding of del84 to 101 and del90 to 101 mutants.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	80	 To further explore the sequence specificity of the apparently important conserved DYLSF domain at residues 90 to 94, we created a deletion mutant (del90 to 94), and a series of missense mutations in which either single residues, two residues, or five residues within the 90 to 94 domain were mutated to alanine (Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	81	 We then repeated the co-immunoprecipitation studies.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Deletion of residues 90 to 94 or missense mutation of all five residues to alanine caused a dramatic reduction in the interaction between presenilin 1, nicastrin, and APH-1 (Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	83	 In contrast, mutation of a single residue or two residues had variable but generally less severe effects on the interaction of PEN-2 with the other components as measured by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	85	 The binding of PEN-2 to other components is severely disturbed in del84 to 101, del90 to 101, AAAAA, and del90 to 94 mutants and moderately in del96 to 101 and del100 to 101 mutants.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Using PEN-2 knock-down cells transiently transfected with mock, wild-type, del84 to 101, del90 to 101, del96 to 101, AYLSF, DALSA, EYLSF, DYAAF, AAAAA, del90 to 94, AAA (IPG), or del100 to 101(lanes 1 to 11, 14, and 15), pulled-down PEN-2 with anti-PS, anti-NCT, or anti-APH-1 antibody was analyzed.

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Transient transfection of wild-type PEN-2 in PEN-2 knock-down cells significantly rescued nicastrin maturation, PS endoproteolysis, and A secretion (Fig.

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	97	 These effects were robust, being replicated in all three independent PEN-2 knockdown cells.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In contrast to the profound loss-of-function effects of the AAAAA and del90 to 94 mutants, mutation of only one or two residues of the DYLSF domain caused variable but milder reductions in nicastrin maturation and PS endoproteolysis and A secretion (Figs.

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	109	 PEN-2 knock-down cells transiently transfected with mock, wild-type, del84 to 101, del90 to 101, del96 to 101, AYLSF, DALSA, EYLSF, DYAAF, AAAAA, del90 to 94, AAA (IPG), del100 to 101, or KDAS (lanes 1 to 11, 14, 15, and 18).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	110	 B, secreted A in the condition medium was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (n 3 independent replications).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	111	  Despite the fact that the del96 to 101 mutant binds more efficiently to other presenilin complex components than do the remaining PEN-2 deletion mutations, the del96 to 101 mutant only partially rescued presenilin complex maturation and function (with activity being equivalent to that of the other deletion mutations).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	112	 We reasoned that this reduced rescue activity of the del96 to 101 mutant despite its only mild reduction in binding could occur if there are specific residues in the 96 to 101 domain that are critical for PEN-2 activity.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	113	 There are three highly conserved residues in this domain: Ile at codon 96, Pro at codon 97, and Gly at codon 99.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	114	 An alternate possibility is that the absolute length of the C terminus is critical to the function of PEN-2, and this deletion (and all of the other deletions) has altered this property.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	115	 This latter possibility is supported by the prior report that exogenous wild-type C-terminally tagged PEN-2 failed to complement loss-of-function alleles in the C.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	116	 elegans PEN-2 gene (8) and by our earlier observation that PEN-2 constructs tagged with C-terminal Myc epitopes were unstable (Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	117	 To resolve this dichotomy, we made three constructs: one with alanine missense mutations at all three conserved residues, one with a four-residue (KDAS) C-terminal addition, and one with a deletion of the two non-conserved C-terminal residues, AAA (IPG), KDAS, and del100 to 101, respectively (Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Immunoprecipitation experiments following transient expression of these constructs in PEN-2 knock-down HEK293 cells revealed that the AAA (IPG) mutant bound to the other presenilins complex components comparably with that of wild-type PEN-2.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	119	 However, the KDAS and the del100 to 101 mutant had a moderate reduction in binding that was similar in magnitude to the reduction in binding of the del96 to 101 mutant (Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	120	 6, lane 15 for del100 to 101; not shown for KDAS).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	121	 As would be expected from these binding assays, transient expression of the AAA (IPG) mutant nearly completely rescued both nicastrin maturation, PS endoproteolysis, and A secretion, whereas the KDAS and the del100 to  101 mutant had minimal effect (Figs.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	122	 8, lanes 14, 15, and 18, and 9A, lanes 14, 15, and 18).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	123	 These data indicate that, in addition to the sequence and size of the conserved DYLSF motif at residues 90 to 94, another critical factor for nicastrin maturation and PS endoproteolysis is the length of the C terminus (Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	124	The deletion mutants, and to a lesser degree the individual missense mutations of the DYLSF domain, affect the binding of PEN-2 to the presenilin complex (and as a result they also affect presenilin complex assembly, maturation, and -secretase activity to an equivalent degree).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	125	 On the other hand, modulation of the length (but not the sequence) of the exposed extreme C terminus of PEN-2 has less impact on PEN-2 binding to the complex but does have a significant affect on presenilin complex maturation and -secretase activity.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	126	 We interpret these findings to mean that: 1) the amino acid sequence of the DYLSF domain is important for the physical binding of PEN-2 to the other presenilin complex components and 2) the absolute length of the C terminus is important for PEN-2 activity within functional presenilin complexes.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	127	The DYLSF domain has no conserved homology by BLAST database search.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	128	 However, the YLSF sequence matches the tyrosine-based sorting signal (YXX[LMVIF]) in the cytoplasmic tail of several proteins including the mu subunit of the AP (adaptor protein) complex, TGN38, epidermal growth factor receptor, mannose 6-phosphate receptor, and furin (25 to 28).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The tyrosine-based sorting motifs in these proteins are responsible for targeting these proteins to various organelles (25 to 28).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Although the YLSF motifs in these examples work in the cytoplasm, it is conceivable that the DYLSF domain of PEN-2 could also be involved in targeting PEN-2 to nascent presenilin complexes or may simply be a binding motif required for the interaction of PEN-2 with other proteins in the PS1 complex.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	131	The fact that the absolute length (but not the sequence) of the C terminus of PEN-2 is critical for presenilin complex function but does not affect binding of PEN-2 to the complex suggests that the C terminus may be involved in maintaining non-sequence-based spatial interactions (e.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	132	 spatial packing) with other components of the presenilin complex.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	133	 A similar critical sensitivity to the length of the C terminus has been reported for both PS1 and PS2 (29).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Because the C termini of both PS1/PS2 and PEN-2 are oriented in the cytoplasm, additional experiments will be needed to discern whether the C termini of these two proteins in fact interact, whether directly with each other or with a third protein.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	135	 However, taken together these data raise the possibility that PEN-2 might function as an important linker/spacer molecule that maintains spatial interactions between various presenilin complex components.

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	5	 They colocalize with proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus in transfected and untransfected cells.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In COS-1 cells low amounts of intact endogeneous presenilin 1 migrating at 45 kDa are detected together with relative larger amounts of presenilin 1 fragments migrating between 18 and 30 kDa.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The presenilins have a strong tendency to form aggregates (mass of 100-250 kDa) in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which can be partially resolved when denatured by SDS at 37  degrees C instead of 95  degrees C.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Sulfation, glycosaminoglycan modification, or acylation of the presenilins was not observed, but both proteins are posttranslationally phosphorylated on serine residues.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The mutations Ala-246  Glu or Cys-410  Tyr that cause Alzheimer's disease do not interfere with the biosynthesis or phosphorylation of presenilin 1.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Finally, using low concentrations of digitonin to selectively permeabilize the cell membrane but not the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, it is demonstrated that the two major hydrophilic domains of presenilin 1 are oriented to the cytoplasm.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The current investigation documents the posttranslational modifications and subcellular localization of the presenilins and indicates that postulated interactions with amyloid precursor protein metabolism should occur in the early compartments of the biosynthetic pathway.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	12	Alzheimer's disease is a major health problem.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Patients suffer from a progressive dementia caused by massive neuronal loss in cortical and hippocampal areas of the brain (1-6).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Neuropathological signs of the disease are tangles and amyloid deposits in the brain parenchyma, and amyloid deposits in the brain vasculature.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The cause of the sporadic form of the disease is still unknown, although an increased risk is associated with the presence of apolipoprotein allele E4 (6, 7).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	16	 On the other hand, familial early onset Alzheimer's disease is caused by point mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 (8), in the presenilin 2 (PS2)1 gene on chromosome 1 (9-11), or, most frequently, in the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene on chromosome 14 (12-15).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I integral membrane protein and is the precursor of the amyloid peptide, the main component of the senile plaques (1-3).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Point mutations in exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene cause alterations in the metabolism of APP.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	19	 This results in an increased production of intracellular A4 amyloid peptide containing carboxyl-terminal APP fragments and in an increased secretion of the potentially neurotoxic A4 peptide (1-3, 16).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	20	 63% of the amino acid residues in the sequences of the two presenilins are conserved, which strongly suggests that both proteins are involved in similar functions and have a similar pathogenic role in Alzheimer's disease.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Based on computer algorithms, seven membrane spanning domains have been defined (9-15), although the possibility of nine transmembrane domains cannot be ruled out at this moment (17).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The amino-terminal domain and the acidic loop domain, located between transmembrane domains six and seven, are hydrophilic and can be alternatively spliced (9, 13).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The mutations that cause familial Alzheimer's disease are found all over the protein, but the hydrophilic loop constitutes a "hot spot" with nine different mutations described to date (5, 15).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The biological function of the presenilins remains essentially unknown, but, interestingly, the 103 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of PS2 can inhibit apoptosis in a "deathtrap" assay (18).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Based on the homology with Caenorhabditis elegans proteins, roles in intracellular protein sorting and/or intercellular signal transmission have been proposed as well (19, 20).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	26	A hypothetical final common pathway in the pathogenesis of the genetic and sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease has been postulated, based on the invariable occurrence of the amyloid deposits, the neurofibrillar tangles and the neurodegeneration in all affected brains.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The central question is thus how mutations in the presenilin genes can cause this typical neuropathology.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Studies indicating an increased production of more amyloidogenic A4-(1-42) peptide in fibroblasts obtained from patients with presenilin mutations would support the amyloid hypothesis that postulates abnormal A4 amyloid peptide production and plaque formation as the pivotal event in the pathogenesis of the disease (2, 21).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	29	 However, the observed increases in A4-(1-42) peptide production were relatively small, and the suggested relationship between presenilin mutations and APP metabolism should be further corroborated by experiments showing directly the effect of presenilin mutations on APP processing in transfected cells or in brains of transgenic animals.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Moreover, other aspects of APP metabolism such as the production of carboxyl-terminal APP fragments (16) should be investigated in greater detail.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The possibility that presenilins interact with the cytoskeleton or exert their effect via apoptotic pathways should not be disregarded at this time (18).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In addition to addressing these questions, basic information is needed on the subcellular localization, the posttranslational modifications, and the membrane orientation of the presenilins.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	33	We used COS-1 cells and CHO cells to express PS1 and PS2, as well as Myc-tagged PS1 and PS1-containing mutations that cause familial Alzheimer's disease.

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Both domains are candidate regions for interactions with other proteins, and their orientation determines whether this interaction occurs with cytoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum proteins.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	234	 To analyze this question, we used low concentrations of digitonin to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane (see "Materials and Methods") and antibodies against the amino-terminal domain (antiserum B14), against the Myc tag introduced at the amino terminus (mAb 9E10), against the second loop domain (antibody 519), and, finally, against the hydrophilic loop domain (antiserum B16) of PS1.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	235	 To monitor the permeabilization procedure, rat monoclonal antibody against the luminal endoplasmic reticulum retention signal KDEL was used (30, 31).

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	239	 On the other hand, antibodies against the second hydrophilic loop domain (519) reacted with PS1 when saponin (Fig.

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	253	The current investigation provides a detailed characterization of the biosynthesis of presenilins overexpressed in COS-1 cells and CHO cells.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	254	 The results show that the PS proteins are unglycosylated phosphoproteins with apparent molecular masses of about 45 and 50 kDa in SDS-PAGE.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	255	 They have a strong tendency to form SDS-resistant complexes with apparent molecular masses between 100 and 250 kDa.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Double immunofluorescence studies showed that PS1 is mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus and that its amino-terminal domain and the hydrophilic loop domain are oriented to the cytoplasmic side.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	257	The localization of transfected PS1 in the endoplasmic reticulum of COS-1 cells or CHO cells is not a simple consequence of overexpression of the protein or nonspecific general effects on the biosynthetic pathway in these cells.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	258	 First, endogeneous presenilins are located in the endoplasmic reticulum of untransfected cells as demonstrated in Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	259	 1A using confocal laser microscopy.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Second, using identical transfection conditions, APP and furin were found to accumulate in the Golgi apparatus, as demonstrated before (33, 34).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	261	 4) and the secretory processing of APP3 in CHO cells stably expressing human APP770 was not affected by transfection of PS1, ruling out general inhibitory effects on protein transport and processing.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	262	 On the other hand, the levels of endogeneous presenilin in COS-1 cells are apparently very low.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Only the combination of immunoprecipitation to concentrate PS1 from detergent extracts of 10  x  106 cells, followed by immunoblotting using mAb PS1-3, allowed us to detect endogeneous PS1 migrating at the same molecular weight as transfected PS1.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	264	 The disadvantage of this approach is that the antibodies from the immunoprecipitation step interfere with the consecutive detection of possible PS-aggregates in the immunoblotting step (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	265	 This assay also precludes a dynamic analysis of the metabolism of the presenilins using metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	266	 On the other hand, it allowed us to demonstrate the presence or absence of particular antibody epitopes on PS1 fragments.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Importantly, the use of hydrophilic loop-specific antibodies in the immunoprecipitation step resulted in the detection of relative large amounts of, presumably proteolytic, fragments of PS1 in the 18-30-kDa range (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	268	 The level of these fragments was not, or only slightly, increased in COS-1 cells that overexpressed PS1, which explains why they were not readily detected in the transfection experiments.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	269	 The proteolytic process involved is probably easily saturated or even inhibited by PS overexpression (35, 36).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Our data therefore do not allow us to speculate any further on the exact nature or the biological significance of this process.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	271	 We can only conclude that overexpression studies of the type used here are not suitable to study this particular aspect of presenilin metabolism.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	272	 On the other hand, it is clear that untransfected cells (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	273	 3) and brain tissue in vivo (36, 37) contain detectable amounts of intact presenilin.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Since this endogeneously expressed PS1 has the same mobility as transfected PS1, the conclusion that transfected PS1 (and PS2) are not subject to glycosylation, sulfation, glycosaminoglycan modification, palmitoylation, or myristoylation also holds apparently true for the endogeneous protein.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	275	 These posttranslational modifications are thereby also excluded as contributing to the formation of the high molecular mass, SDS-resistant aggregates (100-250 kDa) in SDS-PAGE electrophoresis.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	276	 These aggregates were observed to a variable extent in all our experiments, and were noticed by others using other cell types or brain tissue (36, 38, 39).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Since the smears were detected with three different antibodies recognizing three different epitopes, and by a Myc-directed mAb using a Myc-tagged PS1 construct, the aggregates must contain presenilin core proteins, alone or associated with unidentified components.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Denaturation of immunoprecipitates at 37  degrees C instead of 95  degrees C, resulted in less aggregates and increased amounts of the 45-kDa PS1 band (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	279	 The aggregates therefore probably consist mainly of oligomers of presenilins.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	280	 It is unclear whether this property to form SDS-resistant aggregates in vitro has any physiological significance in vivo, but immuno-electron microscope observations suggest that clustering of presenilins also occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum of untransfected cells.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	281	2 It should be envisaged that in pathological conditions exacerbated aggregation of presenilins could become a problem.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	282	 In this context, it should be mentioned that antibodies against PS1 stain amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (40).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	283	Importantly, the two point mutations causing Alzheimer's disease that were studied here, i.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	284	 PS1 Ala-246  Glu (FAD1 kindred) and PS1 Cys-410  Tyr (NIH2 kindred), did not alter the biosynthesis or level of expression of the PS1 protein in COS-1 cells and CHO cells.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	285	 These mutations must cause therefore more subtle effects.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	286	 The possibility that they interfere with the fragmentation of PS1, as was shown recently for two other mutations (35, 36), cannot be excluded from the current data.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Analysis of brains of transgenic mice expressing the PS1 Ala-246  Glu mutant indicate, however, that at least this mutation does not interfere with the proteolytic processing of PS1.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	288	4 Since all PS mutations known to date act in a dominant way in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, a gain of function is most likely.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Evidence that fibroblasts derived from patients with presenilin mutations produce more and longer forms of the A4 amyloid peptide suggests that the mutations exert their effect on cellular metabolism or trafficking of amyloid precursor protein (21).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	290	 The localization of PS1 in the early compartments of the biosynthetic pathway makes it unlikely that the presenilin mutations directly influence - and/or -secretase activity, since these operate in the late-Golgi and transport vesicles, at the cell surface and in endosomes (27, 41-43).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	291	 The possibility that PS mutants influence the balance between amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic processing of APP in an indirect way by changing its intracellular trafficking should now be further explored in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and neurons (16, 44, 45).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	292	Our study demonstrates furthermore that the presenilins are phosphorylated on serine residues.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Phosphorylation of PS1 and PS2 was evident both in COS-1 cells and CHO cells, but the phosphorylation of PS1 was less intense and more variable than of PS2.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	294	 The observation that okadaic acid enhanced the PS1 phosphorylation suggests that PS1 is more prone to phosphatase activity than PS2 (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Protein kinase C is not responsible for PS phosphorylation, since neither stimulation of cells by phorbol esters nor purified kinase added to immunoprecipitated PS1 or PS2 resulted in increased labeling.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	296	 It is therefore unlikely that the presenilins are directly involved in the regulation of APP secretion by protein kinase C (46, 47).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	297	Finally, we showed that the hydrophilic NH2-terminal and the major loop domain of PS1 are exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Digitonin at low concentrations selectively permeabilizes the cell membrane, but not the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (29).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Antibodies directed toward the amino-terminal domain of PS1 (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	300	 9) displayed similar immunofluorescent staining patterns in digitonin and saponin permeabilized cells.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Control experiments with antibodies against a luminal epitope, i.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	302	 the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (30, 31), showed that digitonin did not permeabilize the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	303	 For the major hydrophilic loop domain, essentially identical results were obtained.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	304	 The conclusion therefore is that the two major hydrophilic domains in PS1 are oriented to the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum, which directs the search for candidate proteins interacting with these domains toward the cytoplasm.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Consistent with this conclusion, antibodies against the second loop domain reacted with PS1 after saponin, but not after digitonin permeabilization.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	306	 This not only confirms the luminal localization of the recognized epitope, but also validates the approach as it was used.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	307	While more detailed studies, including electron microscopy and enzymatic digestion protection assays, are required to settle definitively the orientation of the presenilins in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, our results clarify already two important issues.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	308	 The first problem is the orientation of the first transmembrane domain in PS1, which determines in fact the topology of all the following transmembrane domains (46).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	309	 The positive charge difference between the 15 carboxyl-terminal and the 15 amino-terminal residues flanking the first membrane spanning domain suggests a luminal orientation of its amino terminus (48).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	310	 However, several exceptions to this rule are known, mainly of proteins of which the amino-terminal domain contains more then 17 charged amino acid residues (48).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	311	 In PS1, this domain contains 29 charged residues, which would explain its cytoplasmic orientation.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	312	 The second issue, which has been pointed out by others before (9, 13, 17), is whether two putative hydrophobic stretches in the PS amino acid sequence flanking the hydrophilic loop, can additionally span the membrane, which would make the presenilins nine transmembrane domain proteins.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Our data are compatible with a seven-transmembrane domain model with the amino-terminal domain and the hydrophilic loop located in the cytoplasm (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	314	 10; see also Note Added in Proof).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	315	 In conclusion, the current study has analyzed the biosynthesis and the subcellular localization of the presenilins and provides a basis for the further study of their cell biology and their possible interactions with integral membrane and cytoplasmic proteins such as APP or Tau, both implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (4).

0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	7	Aims To identify factors which influence age at onset of dementia in Down's syndrome.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	8	Method Studies of factors which influence formation of beta-amyloid (Ass) were reviewed, including atypical karyotypes, susceptibility genotypes, gender and oestrogen deficiency, and individual differences in Ass peptide levels.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	9	Results The apolipoprotein E 4 allele, oestrogen deficiency and high levels of Ass1-42 peptide are associated with earlier onset of dementia, while atypical karyotypes and the apolipoprotein E 2 allele are associated with reduced mortality and reduced risk of dementia.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	10	Conclusions Factors which influence Ass levels, rather than overexpression of APP, may account for the differences in age at onset of dementia in Down's syndrome.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	11	Several lines of evidence suggest that deposition of Ass-42 is an important initial step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Ass1-42 aggregates more rapidly and is deposited earlier in Alzheimer's disease plaques than Ass1-40 (Iwatsubo et al, 1994).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Mutations in the gene for APP and in presenilin (PS1/2) genes are associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease and with a selective increase in Ass1-42 (Borchelt et al, 1996; Mann et al, 1996; Scheuner et al, 1996; Kosaka et al, 1997; Younkin, 1998).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Brain levels of Ass1-42 increase early in the development of Alzheimer's disease and are strongly correlated with cognitive decline (Cummings  and  Cotman, 1995; Naslund et al, 2000), and plasma levels of Ass1-42 are higher in elderly people who subsequently develop Alzheimer's disease than in those who remain free of dementia (Mayeux et al, 1999).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	15	Virtually all individuals with Down's syndrome have neuropathological changes consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by the time they reach 40 years of age, including deposition of Ass in diffuse and neuritic plaques (Wisniewski, H.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	16	 et al, 1995; Mann, 1988), and most will develop dementia by the end of their seventh decade of life (Lai  and  Williams, 1989).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Despite the nearly universal occurrence of Alzheimer's disease pathology by middle age, there is wide variation in age at onset of dementia.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease at age 65 has ranged between 30% and 75% (Zigman et al, 1997).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Most studies have shown that the average age at onset of dementia is between 50 and 55 years, with a range from 38 to 70 years (Lai  and  Williams, 1989; Prasher  and  Krishnan, 1993).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Methodological problems may account for some of the variation in estimated prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in this population requires both documentation of clinically significant decline in cognitive and adaptive competence from previously attained levels of performance and documentation of the absence of any other condition that might cause declines in performance (Aylward et al, 1997).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Both these requirements are particularly difficult to address for adults with Down's syndrome, given their lifelong intellectual disability.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The wide range of premorbid levels of performance associated with differences in level of intellectual disability requires specific criteria for clinically significant decline indicative of dementia for each level of function, and these are just beginning to be developed.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	24	 There is, as yet, no consensus on a set of cognitive assessment tasks or on diagnostic criteria for existing cognitive assessment batteries that can differentiate adults with Down's syndrome who do and do not have dementia in its early stages.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Presently, most diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome are made clinically, at relatively late stages of the disease, without systematic cognitive or functional testing over time.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	26	The neuropathological manifestations of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome have been attributed to triplication and overexpression of the gene for APP located on chromosome 21 (Rumble et al, 1989) and the increased risk of dementia in Down's syndrome may be mediated by an increased substrate for cellular production of Ass peptides.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Recent neuropathological studies have shown that diffuse plaques, the most prevalent Alzheimer-type lesion seen in individuals with Down's syndrome before age 50, are not associated with dementia.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Diffuse plaques contain non-fibrillar amyloid, appear at younger ages than do neuritic plaques, are not associated with neuronal degeneration, and do not appear to affect the structure and function of neurons.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In contrast, increases in the numbers of neuritic plaques, containing substantial amounts of fibrillised Ass peptides, are observed in adults with Down's syndrome predominantly after 50 years of age and are associated with neuronal degeneration and loss of function (Wisniewski, T.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Examination of the age-specific prevalence of dementia in Down's syndrome supports the hypothesis that the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome are closely associated with the development of these fibrillised plaques (Lai  and  Williams, 1989; Visser et al, 1997; Holland et al, 1998; Lai et al, 1999) (see Fig.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Although prevalence studies have employed varying sampling and diagnostic methods, there is remarkable agreement across studies that risk of Alzheimer's disease increases primarily after 50 years of age.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In addition, not all adults with Down's syndrome will develop dementia even if they reach ages when the presence of high densities of neuritic plaques can be presumed.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Thus, while triplication of the gene for APP may serve to increase diffuse plaques in adults with Down's syndrome, factors distinct from APP triplication must account for individual differences in susceptibility to the formation of fibrillised plaques and for the wide range in age at onset of dementia.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	34	 A central task of the epidemiology of dementia in Down's syndrome is to identify factors that may influence risk of Alzheimer's disease by accelerating formation of Ass.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Several avenues of investigation are suggested by existing findings and I will review the role of (a) atypical karyotypes; (b) genetic susceptibility factors; (c) gender and oestrogen deficiency; and (d) individual differences in Ass peptide levels.

0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	40	Polymorphisms in the gene for apolipoprotein E (APOE) have been associated with risk for the more common late-onset Alzheimer's disease, that is, with onset after 65 years of age.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	41	 There are three common variants of the gene for APOE, encoded for by three alleles, 2, 3 and 4.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	42	 In numerous cross-sectional and case control studies, patients with Alzheimer's disease have been found to be significantly more likely than their peers to have one or more copies of the APOE 4 allele (Corder et al, 1993; Mayeux et al, 1993; Saunders et al, 1993).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The APOE 4 protein may act by increasing the rate of the process which leads to Alzheimer's disease, predisposing to greater accumulation of Ass in those with and without Alzheimer's disease (Roses et al, 1994; Hyman et al, 1995; Polvikoski et al, 1995).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The presence of the least common allele, APOE 2, has been associated with a delay in disease onset or even protection by most investigators (Corder et al, 1994; Roses et al, 1994).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	45	Apolipoprotein E in Down's syndrome The relation of APOE genotype to risk of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome has been difficult to establish.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	46	 All studies have consistently found that the presence of the APOE 2 allele increases longevity and reduces the risk of dementia but the role of the 4 allele has been controversial (Hardy et al, 1994; Royston et al, 1994; Martins et al, 1995; van Gool et al, 1995; Cosgrave et al, 1996; Lambert et al, 1996; Schupf et al, 1996; Prasher et al, 1997; Schupf et al, 1998; Sekijima et al, 1998; Tyrrell et al, 1998; Lai et al, 1999; Rubinszstein et al, 1999; Deb et al, 2000).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Small sample sizes and, importantly, failure to consider differences in the age at onset of dementia among those with and without an 4 allele may account for some of the negative findings.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Since the effect of the 4 allele is not expressed until midlife, inclusion of sufficient numbers of adults over 50 years of age and analysis using survival methods that can adjust for age and years of follow-up are important methodological considerations.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Our group used survival methods for analysis and found that the presence of the 4 allele was associated with earlier onset of dementia and greater decline in adaptive behaviour (Schupf et al, 1996).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Compared with those with the APOE 3/3 genotype, adults with Down's syndrome with an 4 allele were five times as likely to develop dementia by age 65, while no one with an 2 allele developed dementia (see Fig.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Among affected individuals, mean age at onset of dementia was 53.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	52	3 years for those with the 4 allele and 58.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	53	0 years for those with the 3/3 genotype.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Four other studies found an increased frequency of the 4 allele in adults with Down's syndrome and dementia compared with those with Down's syndrome without dementia (Martins et al, 1995; Sekijima et al, 1998; Rubinsztein et al, 1999; Deb et al, 2000).

0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	58	The results of other studies of APOE genotype in adults with Down's syndrome have been mixed.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Several studies that found that the APOE 2 allele decreased risk of dementia had sample sizes that were too small to demonstrate a significant effect of the 4 allele (Hardy et al, 1994; Royston et al, 1994; Wisniewski, T.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Two case control studies of adults with Down's syndrome compared allele frequencies in individuals with and without dementia and found no significant association between APOE genotype and Alzheimer's disease but did not adjust for age (van Gool et al, 1995; Prasher et al, 1997).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	61	 One large study examined 100 adults with Down's syndrome (40-70 years of age) and used survival analyses to examine age at onset of dementia by APOE genotype (Lai et al, 1999).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The cumulative incidence of dementia by age 65 was 55% for those with the APOE 2/3 genotype, 88% for those with the APOE 3/3 genotype and 100% for those with any 4 allele.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The effect of the 4 allele was stronger at younger ages, consistent with findings from studies in the general population that the effect of the 4 allele is to accelerate onset of Alzheimer's disease (Corder et al, 1993; Saunders et al, 1993; Meyer et al, 1998).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Cumulative incidence to age 55 was 0.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	65	71 among those with an 4 allele and 0.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	66	40 among those with the APOE 3/3 genotype.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The authors suggested that the 4 effect in their study may have been attenuated by the high rates of dementia at more advanced ages.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	68	 They concluded that the effect of the 4 allele may be dependent on the age of the study sample.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	69	These findings are consistent with reduced Ass deposition (Polvikoski et al, 1995) and less plaque formation (Benjamin et al, 1994; Lippa et al, 1994) in those with an 2 allele, and with acceleration of Ass pathology in those with an 4 allele (Hymen et al, 1995; Polvikoski et al, 1995).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The size of the 4 effect, the relation of the presence of an 4 allele to early mortality and the interaction of APOE genotype with other risk factors for dementia in Down's syndrome such as gender and level of learning disability remain to be resolved.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	71	 This will require larger and older samples and analytic procedures which can provide better adjustment for age and other potential confounders.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	72	In human studies, some, but not all, data show higher age-specific rates of Alzheimer's disease in women compared with men (Bachman et al, 1993) and approximately half the risk of Alzheimer's disease in women who have received oestrogen replacement therapy (Barrett-Conner  and  Kritz-Silverstein, 1993; Brenner et al, 1994; Henderson et al, 1994; Paganini-Hill  and  Henderson, 1994; Mortel  and  Meyer, 1995; Tang et al, 1996).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Such findings support the hypothesis that oestrogen deficiency contributes to the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	74	 In contrast, randomised controlled clinical trials of oestrogen replacement therapy in women with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease have failed to show cognitive improvement, suggesting that the major effect of oestrogen is to delay onset rather than reverse cognitive and functional decline (Henderson et al, 2000; Mulnard et al, 2000).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	75	Gender differences and the effects of oestrogen in Down's syndrome have not been systematically investigated and more work is needed to clarify how hormonal risk factors may influence onset of dementia.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Few studies have presented results separately for men and women.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Studies that have compared women with men have found conflicting results, with different studies showing earlier onset (Raghaven et al, 1994; Lai et al, 1999), later onset (Farrer et al, 1997; Schupf et al, 1998) or no difference in age at onset (Visser et al, 1997; Lai  and  Williams, 1989) by gender.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Two studies employed survival methods to examine age at onset distributions by gender, adjusting for both age and level of learning disability, and found conflicting results.

0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	80	 3a); the effect of gender was observed in all age groups over 50 years (Schupf et al, 1998).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Both men and women with Down's syndrome show elevations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone at puberty indicative of primary gonadal dysfunction, which appear to progress with age and be more frequent in men than in women (Hasen et al, 1980; Campbell et al, 1982; Hsiang et al, 1987; Hestnes et al, 1991).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Thus, older men may not benefit from the relative preservation of oestrogen proposed to account for lower risk of Alzheimer's disease in men in the general population.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	83	 In contrast, another study found that women with Down's syndrome were approximately twice as likely to develop dementia as men (Lai et al, 1999) (see Fig.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	84	 In that study, the effect of gender was seen primarily at younger ages.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	85	 In both studies, gender differences were largest in those with the APOE 3/3 genotype, suggesting that the high risk associated with the presence of the APOE 4 allele can mask gender effects.

0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	89	Only one published study has examined the influence of oestrogen deficiency on age at onset of dementia in women with Down's syndrome (Cosgrave et al, 1999).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Menstrual profiles and risk of dementia in 143 women with Down's syndrome were studied.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Twelve women were postmenopausal and diagnosed with dementia.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	92	 There was a significant relationship between age at menopause and age at onset of dementia in this subsample (r=0.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Although the sample size is small, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that higher endogenous oestrogen levels can lower risk of dementia by decreasing Ass peptide levels and maintaining cholinergic function in critical neuronal populations.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	94	 If the association between age at menopause and onset of dementia can be confirmed and supporting hormonal data provided, oestrogen replacement therapy might prove to be an important intervention to delay onset of dementia.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	5	Received August 15, 2003; Accepted November 11, 2003.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	6	Mutations in two additional genes, presenilin 1 (PS1) and its homolog PS2, also cause early-onset FAD (15 to 17).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Studies in both vertebrates and invertebrates suggest that PS1 and PS2 are components of a larger protein complex that contains nicastrin, Aph-1, and PEN-2 (18 to 27).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This complex is either a required cofactor for, or is itself, the -secretase activity that generates the C-termini of Ass40 and 42 (19,22 to 24,28 to 35).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Deletion of both PS1 and PS2 leads to a complete loss of -secretase activity (33).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Cells deficient in PS1 also show abnormalities in the subcellular trafficking of integral membrane proteins, including APP (36,37).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	11	An interaction between the presenilins and APP was first suggested by the observation that the plasma of patients with mutations in PS1 had higher ratios of Ass42 relative to Ass40 than patients with sporadic AD (38).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Subsequent work in cell models demonstrated that co-expression of FAD-mutant PS1 with APP reproduced the rise in Ass42 relative to Ass40 that had been seen in patients with PS1-associated AD (39 to 41).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This shift in Ass40 : Ass42 ratio was also found in the brains of transgenic mice co-expressing one of several FAD PS1 mutations (M146V, M146L, A246E or M286L) with the Swedish mutation of APP (39,42 to 44).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Similar shifts in the steady-state ratios of mouse Ass40 : Ass42 were also noted in mice expressing only FAD-variant PS1 (45) or PS2 (46).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Transgenic mice co-expressing mutated PS1 and APP developed amyloid pathology much earlier than mice expressing only APP; the acceleration in amyloid formation directly correlated with the change in the Ass40 : Ass42 ratios (42,47,48).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In contrast, co-expression of wild-type human PS1 with mutant human APP had no impact on the rate of amyloid formation (44).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	17	Studies of dominant negative versions of PS1 and chemical inhibitors of -secretase have been interpreted as evidence that PS1 may comprise the active site of the -secretase complex (28,31,49 to 52).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Moreover, because some of these inhibitors coordinately depress both Ass40 and Ass42 production, it has been assumed that one enzyme complex is responsible for the production of both peptides (50,51).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In such a setting, FAD mutations in PS1 might alter the ratio of Ass peptides produced from APP simply by shifting the specificity of -secretase to favor cleavage at residue 42 over that at 40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In this scenario, mutations that increase the output of Ass42 should be accompanied by a decrease in the generation of Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	21	In the current work, we took advantage of recent advances in ELISA methodology to examine Ass40 and Ass42 levels in several lines of APPswe mice co-expressing either of two FAD PS1 variants (A246E and dE9).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Each PS1 variant accelerated the rate of amyloid deposition to differing extents.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	23	 After quantifying the levels of Ass40 and Ass42 in the brains of young, pre-symptomatic animals, we found that co-expression of either PS1A246E or PS1-dE9 in APPswe transgenic mice specifically increased Ass42 levels without altering Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	24	 From these data, we defined a direct correlation between the age of amyloid onset and Ass42 levels.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Based on work from cultured cell models suggesting that mutant PS1 alters the production of Ass42 (39 to 41), we conclude that changes in the steady-state level of this peptide in our transgenic mice were most likely due to alterations in the processing of APP.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We suggest that FAD-PS1 variants may increase the accessibility of BACE1-cleaved C-terminal fragments of APP (ss-CTFs) to a -secretase that preferentially cleaves at residue 42.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	27	Immunoblot analysis of brain protein separated by SDS to PAGE demonstrated relatively high levels of APPswe expression in each of these lines (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Blots probed with monoclonal antibody 22C11, which detects a shared epitope in the N-terminal region of mouse and human APP, showed that each of the transgenic lines expresses 2- to 4-fold more total APP than non-transgenic animals (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Immunoblots probed with monoclonal antibody 6E10, which detects the humanized Ass domain of our transgene product, demonstrated that APPswe protein levels were highest in the brains of mice from line C3-3; overall expression in the three lines ranked Q2-2 < 85 < C3-3 (Fig.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	33	 (B) Antibody 22C11 was used to detect endogenous mouse APP and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP-2) (80) in non-transgenic controls and both endogenous APP/APLP-2 and transgene-derived human APPswe in lines Q2-2, 85 and C3-3.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Immunoblot analysis consistently revealed the highest APPswe expression in line C3-3, the lowest in line Q2-2, with Line 85 falling between the two lines.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	35	  PS1-A246E and PS1-dE9 possess different amyloidogenic potentials In previous studies we (44,47) and others (42,43,48) have shown that the co-expression mutant PS1 with APPswe can accelerate the rate of amyloid deposition.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	36	 By contrast, co-expression of wild-type human PS1, even at very high levels, has no effect on the rate of amyloid deposition (44).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Here we extend this work to compare the effects of two FAD PS1 variants which hasten amyloid onset to differing degrees.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	38	 As shown previously (47), transgenic mice from line C3-3 do not develop amyloid deposits until well beyond 18 months of age (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Co-expression of PS1-A246E (line N-5) halves this time, with C3-3/N-5 mice developing amyloid deposits by 9 to 12 months (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Plaque burden in the C3-3/N-5 mice worsens with age, and by 20 to 24 months the hippocampus and cortex show high amyloid burdens.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	41	 A similar acceleration in amyloid deposition has been noted when mice from a different line of PS1-A246E (line I2-4) are crossed to C3-3 mice (44).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	42	 When mice from line C3-3 are crossed with mice expressing the exon-9-deleted variant of PS1 (line S-9) (56), substantial amyloid deposition is visible by 6 months of age (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	43	 As with PS1-A246E, amyloid burdens in the C3-3/PS1-dE9 mice increase throughout life (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The early appearance of amyloid deposits was observed in offspring of C3-3 mice mated with two different lines of PS1-dE9 mice (line S-9 shown here and line O-7, data not shown), confirming that the effect was due to the PS1-dE9 transgene and not to an artifact of integration site.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Amyloid plaques are absent from young (A) and middle-aged (B) animals, appearing only in mice over 20 months of age (C).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	49	 (D to F) Co-expression of PS1-A246E accelerates the appearance of amyloid plaques.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Deposits are first observed in line C3-3 APPswe/PS1-A246E double transgenic mice at 10 to 13 months of age (E) before plaque load worsens with age (F).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	51	 (G to I) Co-expression of PS1-dE9 in line C3-3 APPswe mice further hastens the appearance of pathology.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Double transgenic APPswe/PS1-dE9 mice have a substantial number of deposits by 6 months of age (G), and plaque burden increases progressively with time (H and I).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The hippocampus is shown in all panels for ease of comparison; plaques are also observed in superficial layers of the anterior cortex concurrent with hippocampal onset.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	54	  Measurements of Ass levels by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to the N-terminus of Ass followed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for the 40 or 42 termini demonstrated that the ratio of Ass40 : Ass42 varied by genotype (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	55	 In mice expressing only APPswe the ratio was 3 : 1; co-expressing PS1A246E decreased the ratio to 1.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Co-expressing mutant PS1 shifts the ratio of Ass40 : 42.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	60	 (A) Quantitative immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (see Methods) were used to measure Ass40 : 42 ratios in the brains of mice co-expressing APPswe with PS1A246E or PS1dE9.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	61	 In mice from line C3-3, the brains contains 2- to 3-fold more Ass40 than Ass42.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	62	 As reported in a previous work (39), co-expression of PS1A246E halves the Ass40 : Ass42 ratio to 1.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Here we show that expressing PS1dE9 in the C3-3 APPswe mice alters Ass levels so dramatically that Ass42 becomes the dominant species.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed Student's t-test.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	66	  Further evidence of the highly pathogenic activity of PS1-dE9 was seen when we extended our study to mice that express lower levels of APPswe.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Mice from line Q2-2 do not develop amyloid pathology until after 20 months of age (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	68	 To test whether co-expression of mutant PS1 could induce plaques in this non-depositing line, we crossed Q2-2 APPswe mice with animals expressing either PS1-A246E (line I2-4) (44,56) or PS1-dE9 (line S-9) (56,57).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Despite its ability to accelerate amyloid deposition in line C3-3 mice (44), co-expression of PS1-A246E in line Q2-2 produced no amyloid pathology in any brain region through 20 months of age (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	70	 In contrast, double transgenic offspring from Q2-2xPS1-dE9 developed substantial amyloid pathology by mid-life (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Deposits probably began at 15 to 18 months; by the time they were sacrificed at 20 months, animals had a considerable burden of both diffuse and compact plaques throughout the hippocampus and cortex.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Thus, PS1-dE9 consistently induces earlier pathology in APPswe transgenic mice than PS1-A246E, and is pathogenic enough to cause amyloid formation even in a line of APPswe animals that would otherwise have remained free of deposits.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	78	 (C and G) Co-expression of the more pathogenic PS1-dE9 leads to the formation of amyloid plaques in Q2-2 mice by 20 months of age.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Diffuse and dense core deposits are found in both the hippocampus (C) and cortex (G) at this age.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	81	 These animals express slightly higher levels of APPswe than line Q2-2 mice, leading to an earlier onset of pathology than Q2-2xPS1dE9.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Plaques are abundant in the hippocampus (D) and cortex (H) of line 85 mice by 9 months of age.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	83	  Analysis of the double-transgenic mice, created by co-injecting Mo/Hu APPswe and PS1-dE9 constructs, again confirmed the amyloidogenic potential of the PS1-dE9 variant.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Animals from line 85 express levels of APPswe intermediate to lines C3-3 and Q2-2 (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	85	 1); however, because they invariably co-express PS1dE9, line 85 mice develop amyloid deposits far earlier than either single transgenic APPswe line (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Occasional deposits can be found in line 85 mice as young as 6 months of age, and by 9 months most animals have a significant plaque burden in the cortex and hippocampus (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Thus the dE9 variant appears to be a highly pathogenic mutation, with profound effects on the deposition of amyloid peptides.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Despite its highly pathogenic activity, expression of PS1-dE9 alone in mice is not sufficient to induce amyloid deposits from endogenous mouse APP (not shown), consistent with previous reports of other FAD variant PS1 transgenic mice (48).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	89	Mutant PS1 specifically increases the steady-state levels of Ass42 By two independent approaches, we have demonstrated that the earlier appearance of amyloid in mice co-expressing APPswe (line C3-3) with PS1-A246E (line N-5) or PS1-dE9 (line S-9) is associated with a change in the ratio of Ass40 : Ass42 to favor Ass42 (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In both of these studies, however, variance in the efficiency of Ass peptide captured by either immunoprecipitation or ELISA made it difficult to distinguish whether Ass42 levels were increased at the expense of Ass40, or whether the level of Ass42 increased independently while Ass40 remained unchanged.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	91	 In the course of our study, a refined ELISA approach (58) was developed that allowed us to address this issue.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	92	Using the refined ELISA assay, we studied the levels of Ass peptides in the brains of young, pre-deposit animals from each of the double transgenic lines described above (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Tissue was processed using a two-step extraction method: following sonication in 0.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	94	2% diethylamine (DEA) and high-speed centrifugation, soluble Ass was recovered in the supernatant, and the pellet was then re-extracted with 70% formic acid (FA) to recover all remaining insoluble species.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The two fractions were assayed separately; data for total Ass were calculated by addition of the DEA and FA fraction values obtained for each animal.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	96	 We noted that approximately 50% of Ass40 was extracted by DEA, while a lower, and more variable, percentage of Ass42 was extracted by this solvent (Table 1).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Because all of the samples were prepared from young, pre-deposit animals, especially in the case of the mice transgenic for only APPswe, we do not believe that the relative insolubility of Ass42 was due to oligomerization of this peptide, but rather to an inherent difference in the solubility of the two peptides in DEA.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Our comparisons across genotypes in each transgenic series therefore focus on total Ass values rather than DEA- or FA-soluble fractions to accommodate the differential solubility of the two peptides.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	101	 (A) The levels of Ass40 and 42 were measured in the brains of mice from five distinct genotypes (noted below graph) by ELISA as described in Materials and Methods.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Values for Ass40 and 42 in each genotype were normalized to the levels in C3-3 single transgenic mice, so that the value of each peptide in the C3-3 mice is set to 1, and the values for Ass40 and 42 in other genotypes are related to C3-3 mice (see Table 1).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Statistical significance among genotypes was calculated pair-wise using a two-tailed Student's t-test (pairs noted by brackets on figure).

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	105	 There were no statistical differences in Ass40 levels within the remaining C3-3 pairs.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	106	 By contrast, levels of Ass42 were significantly increased in mice co-expressing mutant PS1.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	108	 As in (A), all Ass42 values are normalized to the levels measured in C3-3 single transgenic animals.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Co-expression of Hu PS1dE9 induces the greatest relative increase in Ass42 and the largest decrease in age of amyloid onset.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Note that the onset of amyloid lesions for line Q2-2 is estimated from the age at which plaques appear in Q2-2xPS1dE9 animals, and would be difficult to observe in the normal mouse lifespan.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	111	 (C) The levels of Ass40 and 42 in the brains of Q2-2 APPswe mice crossed to PS1 mice were measured in a separate ELISA assay.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	112	 The concentration of each peptide was normalized to the value measured in Q2-2 single transgenic mice (set to 1).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	113	 As in the C3-3 series, the co-expression of PS1A246E and PS1dE9 in the Q2-2 mice significantly elevated the level of Ass42 without decreasing that of Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	114	 The asterisk denotes a small but significant difference in Ass40 found between Q2-2xPS1-A246E and Q2-2.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	115	 None of the remaining pairs showed significant differences in Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Normalized fractions of brain Ass extracted into DEA and formic acid   Two separate series of experiments were performed.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	117	 In one series we compared Ass40 and Ass42 levels in the brains of C3-3 APPswe mice with the levels in C3-3xPS1-A246E, C3-3xPS1-dE9, APPswe/PS1dE9 line 85 and Q2-2 mice (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	118	 In the first series, all values were normalized to Ass levels in the C3-3 mice.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Graphing the relative levels of each peptide in these animals revealed that the addition of mutant PS1 increases the concentration of Ass42 without causing a proportionate decrease in Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	120	 The case for this conclusion is stronger in the second series of mice described below, but even in the C3-3 series our measurements show that, compared with APPswe single transgenic mice, co-expression of PS1A246E caused a 50% increase, and PS1-dE9 a 150% increase, in the concentration of Ass42 without consistently lowering the level of Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	121	 In mice co-expressing the PS1dE9 variant with APPswe, the levels of Ass42 exceeded that of Ass40 (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	122	 3), hence it is difficult to argue that the lack of change in Ass40 levels might be due to a far greater abundance of Ass40 relative to Ass42.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	123	Comparison of these values with the ages at which amyloid deposits first appear in each genotype suggests an immediate relationship (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	124	 The age of onset in each cross directly correlates with the concentration of Ass42 in the brain.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	125	 This correlation extends beyond the C3-3 series.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Line 85 mice, made by co-injecting APPswe and PS1dE9 vectors, were very similar to C3-3xPS1-dE9 mice in both their peptide levels and in their age of amyloid onset (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	127	 At the other end of this spectrum, Q2-2 single transgenic mice accumulate even less Ass42 than C3-3 single transgenic mice, and show no sign of amyloid pathology at ages when deposits have already begun in C3-3 animals (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	128	In the second ELISA experiment, we measured Ass levels across the Q2-2 APPswe series (Q2-2; Q2-2xPS1-A246E; and Q2-2xPS1-dE9).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The concentrations of Ass values for each genotype were normalized to levels in the Q2-2 single transgenic animals.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Again, we found that the addition of mutant PS1 specifically elevates Ass42 levels without lowering Ass40 levels (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Collectively these data demonstrate that when mutant PS1 is present, then there is a specific increase in Ass42 without a proportionate decrease in Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	132	 These data also demonstrate that the concentration of Ass42 is the driving force behind changes in the rate of amyloid deposition that occur in the double transgenic mice.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	133	Transgenic mice expressing PS1-dE9 do not develop  cotton wool  plaques In FAD patients, the dE9 mutation is associated with pathology and motor symptoms atypical for AD.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Neuropathological examination of several patients carrying this mutation have revealed large, loose,  cotton wool  amyloid aggregates in the cortex, and a relative absence of compact dense core deposits (59 to 63).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Such atypical pathology has not been found in all PS1-dE9 kindreds (62,64), and indeed, was not observed in mice expressing the dE9 transgene.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Instead, APPswe/PS1-dE9 double transgenic animals displayed characteristic compact, dense-cored, deposits throughout the cortex and hippocampus which could be stained with Congo Red and were birefringent under polarized light (Fig.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	140	 This panel shows Congo Red-stained plaques under bright-field (A, C, E and G) and under polarized light (B, D, F and H).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The plaques appear qualitatively identical in mice from both high-expressing, early onset C3-3 and low-expressing, late-onset Q2-2 lines.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Shown are sections from 6-month old C3-3xPS1-dE9 mice (A, B, E and F) and 20-month-old Q2-2xPS1-dE9 mice (C, D, G and H).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Congophilic deposits are found both in the cortex (A to D) and in the hippocampus (E to H).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	144	Amyloid onset is determined by the level of Ass42 In previous studies, we (44,47) and others (42,43,48) have demonstrated that the co-expression of FAD-associated PS1 variants in APP transgenic mice shifts the ratio of Ass40 : Ass42, and that this shift correlates with a more rapid appearance of amyloid deposits.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	145	 In contrast, the co-expression of wild-type human PS1 has no impact on the rate of amyloid formation (44).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	146	 All previous studies have been two-point comparisons between one line of mice expressing mutant APP mice and mice expressing one FAD-PS1 variant.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The present study is the first to analyze different combinations of APP and PS1 variants that show distinct courses of amyloid pathology.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Our data demonstrate that the age at which amyloid deposits first appear correlates directly with the concentration of Ass42 in the brain.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	149	 As demonstrated in mice from line Q2-2, not all animals over-expressing APP, nor even those co-expressing PS1, will form amyloid deposits in their 2-year lifetime.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	150	 While co-expression of PS1-A246E was able to dramatically accelerate the appearance of plaques in C3-3 APPswe transgenic mice, its effect was not strong enough to induce plaques by 20 months of age in the lower-expressing Q2-2 APPswe mice.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Instead, plaques were only observed in mice from line Q2-2 when the highly pathogenic PS1-dE9 variant was introduced.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Quantitative ELISA analysis in mice from each genotype revealed that both PS1 variants altered the concentration of Ass42 in the brain: animals expressing either PS1 variant contained more Ass42 than Q2-2 single transgenic mice.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	153	 However, co-expression of PS1-dE9 led to substantially higher Ass42 levels than did PS1-A246E, consistent with its ability to induce amyloid formation earlier than PS1-A246E.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	154	Studies of Ass40 and Ass42 fibrilization in vitro have demonstrated that the formation of congophilic fibrils follows second-order kinetics, where there is a long lag phase (the nucleation and seeding phase) followed by an exponential phase of fibril formation until extinction of the substrate (12,13,65,66).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Since the length of the lag phase is proportional to the concentration of Ass peptides (12,13,65,66), we believe that the different rates of Ass deposition observed in each genotype represent changes in the rate of nucleation and seeding of Ass42 fibrils in vivo.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	156	Congophilic neuritic amyloid pathology in Mo/Hu APPswexPS1dE9 mice Neuropathological studies of brains from FAD patients with the PS1-dE9 mutation have reported a number of cases that contain senile plaques atypical for AD.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	157	 In these unusual cases, Ass aggregates have been described as  cotton wool  deposits because they lack compact dense cores and do not show birefringence when stained with Congo Red (59 to 63).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	158	 However such atypical pathology has not been found in all PS1-dE9 kindreds (62,64).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Indeed, mice carrying the PS1dE9 mutation do not recapitulate the cotton wool plaques of the dE9 FAD patients.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Instead, all lines of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice examined in this study develop congophilic, neuritic, senile plaques (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Perhaps the extreme concentrations of Ass needed to observe amyloid formation within the mouse lifespan artificially drive plaques into the compact form.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	162	The second atypical feature of FAD caused by the PS1-dE9 mutation is the frequent appearance of spastic paraparesis (59,61,67).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Affected patients exhibit abnormal gait with hyper-reflexive lower extremities.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	164	 However, not all kindreds carrying PS1-dE9 show motor involvement (62).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	165	 We have yet to observe any evidence of diminished motor function in any line mice expressing PS1-dE9, either alone or in conjunction with APPswe (A.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The incomplete penetrance of atypical pathology and motor dysfunction in the PS1-dE9 kindreds, and the lack of such features in the transgenic models, suggests that a modifier locus may influence the expression of these phenotypes in humans.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	167	Mutant presenilins may recruit new pools of substrate to the -secretase pathway to elevate production of Ass42 Studies of presenilin biology suggest that PS1 and PS2 compete for inclusion into a larger protein complex that contains nicastrin, Aph-1 and PEN-2 (18 to 27).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	168	 This complex is required for active -secretase, which is responsible for proteolytic processing of APP to generate the C-termini of Ass peptides (28,33).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Studies with chemical inhibitors of -secretase have shown that the cleavage of APP at the 40 site and 42 sites are coordinately suppressed, suggesting a single activity is responsible for both cleavages (50,51,68 to 70).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	170	 In this setting, the simplest explanation for the elevation of Ass42 relative to Ass40 in the presence of mutant PS1 was a simple shift in the enzyme specificity to favor cleavage at residue 42 with no net change in the amount of total Ass.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	171	 However, our results indicate that the expression of FAD PS1 variants specified increases in the steady-state levels of Ass42 without altering Ass 40 levels.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Expression of mutant PS1 thus leads to a net increase in total Ass.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	173	 A similar finding was reported by Oyama and colleagues in their study of mice transgenic for PS2-N141I, which also show a specific increase in Ass42 levels (46).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	174	Experiments in cell cultures have shown that co-expression of FAD PS1 variants with APP alters the ratio of Ass40 : 42 in the medium in favor of Ass42 (39 to 41).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In these cell culture experiments, it is assumed that the PS1 variants alter the production and secretion of Ass42 rather than altering its clearance or catabolism.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	176	 However, the cell culture paradigms cannot replicate the complex architecture and signaling patterns of neurons the brain.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	177	 In hippocampal slice cultures, Kamenetz et al.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	178	 (71) recently demonstrated that neuronal activity can influence the secretion of Ass into the extracellular space.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	179	 In vivo, such as with the animal models used for our studies, it is difficult to separate changes in the production of Ass from changes in its catabolism.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	180	 However, based on the cell culture studies of APP processing, we believe it likely that the increase in steady-state levels of Ass42 measured in brain tissue from our mice reflects enhanced production of Ass42, rather than changes in its stability or clearance.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Studies demonstrating the absolute requirement of PS1 or PS2 function for an active -secretase (28,33) are consistent with this interpretation.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	182	Recent reports indicate that PS1 is required for the translocation of APP from the plasma membrane into endosomes where the -secretase cleavage that produces extracellular Ass is thought to occur (72), and that specific mutations in PS1 alter this movement (73 to 75).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Moreover, others have demonstrated that cells deficient in PS1 show alterations in the subcellular trafficking of specific membrane proteins (36,37).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	184	 However, studies in cultured cells have suggested that full-length APP is not the preferred substrate for -secretase.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Instead, it appears that the direct substrates of -secretase are C-terminal fragments of APP generated by - or ss-secretase.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	186	 These fragments, not the full-length protein, accumulate to high levels when -secretase is inhibited (28,30,31,33,49 to 52).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Whether the effects we have detected are due to changes in APP trafficking is unclear.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	188	 We note that an analysis of the levels of sAPP-ss, the soluble ectodomain of APP generated by BACE1, failed to detect obvious alterations due to co-expression of mutant PS1 (Supplementaly Material, Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	189	In light of foregoing data, we favor the notion that PS1-A246E and PS1-dE9, with differing efficiencies, place a greater amount of APP-CTF substrate in contact with a -secretase that preferentially cleaves at residue 42.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	190	 This mechanism would explain the specific elevation in Ass42 levels and the absence of change in Ass40 levels.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Moreover, this scenario could also explain how certain natural and experimental variants of PS1 differentially affect the cleavage of APP-CTFs and Notch, another important substrate of -secretase (32).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	192	 We note that if the PS1/Nicastrin/PEN-2/Aph-1 protein complex were responsible for the delivery of substrates to -secretase but not their proteolysis, inhibition of the PS1 complex, either genetically or pharmacologically, would diminish -secretase activity in a manner indistinguishable from inhibiting -secretase itself.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Thus, we think it possible that one of the effects of mutant PS1 is to augment the amount of substrate presented to a 42-specific -secretase.

0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The second family, the rhomboids, whose prototypic member Drosophila Rhomboid-1 cleaves and liberates several EGF ligands, appears to be a group of serine proteases (4).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	7	 A third family, whose prototypic members are the presenilins (PSs) involved in cleavage of the amyloid ss protein precursor (APP) and Notch, appears to be a group of aspartic proteases (5,6).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Collectively these proteases have been referred to as intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	9	 For several reasons a great deal of attention has focused on the aspartic I-CLiP family.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	10	 First, the prototypic members of this family, the human PSs, are therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Second, a new member of this family, signal peptide peptidase (SPP), was recently identified and shown unequivocally to possess proteolytic activity and have biological functions that may also make it a therapeutic target.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Herein, we will discuss these recent advances with respect to the presenilin/signal peptide peptidase family of I-CLiPs.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	13	Despite the evidence that mutations in PSs altered the -secretase activity that generated Ass, no one readily endorsed the idea that PSs were -secretases.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	14	 PSs did not bear homology to classic proteases; thus, it was proposed that PSs influenced -secretase activity indirectly.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Over the past few years, genetic and biochemical evidence has emerged demonstrating that PSs are in fact -secretases.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Knockout studies of PS1 and PS2 demonstrated an essential role of these proteins in -secretase cleavage.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	17	 PS1 knockout decreased -secretase activity by 80%, a PS2 knockout had little or no effect, and a combined PS1 and PS2 knockout abolished -secretase activity (15 to 18).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Biochemical studies showed that PS1 co-fractionates with -secretase activity in a high molecular weight complex and this in vitro activity could be recovered in the pellet after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PS1 (19).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Significantly, mutation of conserved aspartate residues (D257 and D385 in PS1, and D263 and D366 in PS2) present in two adjacent transmembrane regions produced dominant negative forms of PS that inhibited -secretase activity in cells (5).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	20	 These studies together with inhibitor studies suggested that PSs might be aspartic type proteases (20).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Finally, inhibitors of -secretase activity have been shown to directly target both PS1 and PS2 (21 to 24).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Moreover, given that two groups had specifically designed their inhibitors to be transition state analogs of aspartic proteases (21,22), it certainly appears that despite the lack of demonstrable homology to known aspartic proteases, PS may be just that.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	23	Recent insight into the other components of the high molecular weight complex that contains -secretase activity and PSs, now offers a more complete picture of -secretase.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Three additional proteins are required for -secretase activity in cells.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Nicastrin (Nct, APH-2) is a 130 kDa type I membrane protein that was originally purified from the complex (25).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Two additional proteins, APH-1, another integral membrane protein of 30 kDa with multiple transmembrane regions, and PEN-2, a small hairpin like protein of 12 kDa, were initially isolated from genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans (26).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Together with a PS, the three components appear to comprise a minimal functional -secretase complex (27 to 29).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Although the precise function of each subunit is not yet definitively established, it appears that PSs are the catalytic component, and that Nct, APH-1 and PEN-2 play various roles in the stabilization and maturation of the complex.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	29	 It is also possible that these  accessory  proteins are involved in substrate presentation.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	30	The biological activities of -secretase and PSs have been extensively reviewed (2,30).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Although some activities of PSs are distinct from their protease activity (e.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	32	 stabilization of ss-catenin), many are not.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	33	 -Secretase activity regulates Notch and APP signaling by promoting the release of the cytoplasmic tail from a membrane bound fragment of each precursor.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	34	 It is not clear whether the release of small peptides, such as Ass, into the exoplasmic space has any demonstrable physiologic function.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	35	 It is also not clear whether -secretase cleavage of substrates other then Notch and APP has some physiologic functions.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	36	 It is possible that -secretase cleavage of certain substrates may simply be a mechanism to breakdown these proteins.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	37	 A current list of -secretase substrates, cleavage products and putative functions are listed in Table 1.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	38	The role of SPP in cell function is poorly understood.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The SPP substrates identified to date, represent a variety of signal peptides and a viral protein (Table 2) (31 to 34).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	40	 They do not unequivocally demonstrate to a role of SPP either in the degradation of signal peptides that may otherwise accumulate in the ER membrane, or in the activation of signaling or regulatory molecules, or both.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Potential orthologs of SPP are found in the genomes of animals and plants but not fungi and bacteria (31,35).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Therefore, the prime role of SPP may not necessarily be the clearance of membranes from signal peptides, which are produced in all organisms, and a more basic mechanism may exist to fulfil that function.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	43	 We may thus speculate that SPP, in analogy to other I-CLiPs, may promote the liberation of bioactive peptides or proteins from the ER membrane.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The generation of HLA-E epitopes in humans represents the first example of such an SPP-dependent production of a bioactive peptide, which in this case functions as a reporter.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	45	 HLA-E epitopes that play a key role in immune surveillance, are produced from the signal sequences of the antigen presenting MHC class I molecules in a process that depends on SPP (36).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The epitopes are eventually presented at the cell surface of most of our cells, where they are recognized by the natural killer (NK) cells of the immune system.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Presentation of these signal peptide-derived epitopes is an indirect indication that the probed cell is healthy and had properly synthesized MHC class I molecules.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	48	 If such epitope presentation is defective or otherwise disturbed, e.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	49	 due to a virus infection or transformation to a tumor cell, these impaired cells are thought to be recognized and eliminated by the NK cells (37).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	50	 SPP substrates   The substrate spectrum of SPP may not be restricted to classic signal peptides, which typically are short, NH2-terminal extensions of a precursor protein.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The finding that SPP is exploited by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) for the processing of the viral core protein, implies that the protease may also catalyse intramembrane cleavage of membrane anchored proteins, similar to other I-CLiPs (34).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	52	 During biosynthesis of viral proteins in HCV infected cells, the immature HCV core protein is transiently anchored in the ER membrane via a COOH-terminal, signal peptide-like sequence.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Intramembrane proteolysis by SPP promotes the final processing of core protein and its release from the ER membrane into the cytosol.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Likewise, we may speculate that proteins anchored in the ER membrane by a signal peptide-like sequence, may be liberated from the ER membrane and activated upon cleavage by SPP.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	55	 PS and PSH family members   Another common feature, and one that is typical of many I-CLiPs, is that both PS and SPP activity appear to require prior cleavage of the substrate to remove its ectodomain.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	56	 SPP substrates are first cleaved by signal peptidase (33), whereas PS/-secretase substrates are first cleaved by shedding proteases (e.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	57	 ADAM family members and ss-secretase) (39 to 41).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	58	 In most cases studied to date, this initial cleavage is essential for the intramembrane cut to occur.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Thus, substrate specificity of PS/-secretase and SPP may be determined as much by this priming cleavage as the respective substrate sequence itself.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	60	One of the most striking differences between PSs and SPP is the apparent opposite positioning of the active site motif-containing transmembrane regions within the plane of the membrane (31,42).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	61	 This positioning correlates with the opposite orientation of the respective substrates.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	62	 PS substrates have a type I membrane topology with their COOH-termini facing the cytosol, whereas SPP substrates have a type II topology with their NH2-termini facing the cytosol.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Thus, it appears that related proteases with inversed proteolytic domains evolved for the cleavage of membrane spanning peptides of different topologies.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	64	Despite the common features, there are major differences between PSs and SPP.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The reconstitution of human SPP in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which does not express an orthologous  signal peptide peptidase , suggested that human SPP does not require additional proteins for activity (31).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	66	 In contrast, PSs appear to require at least three additional protein partners for activity.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	67	 PSs undergo endoproteolytic activation, which may depend on these components and, together with these additional proteins, forms an active -secretase complex.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Such activation and complex formation may provide means of control of the protease's intramembrane-cleaving activity, and regulate substrate delivery and/or trafficking to the intracellular site of action.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In the case of SPP, there is no indication for endoproteolysis or any another activation step.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Nevertheless, its activity is almost certainly regulated in some fashion; SPP does not appear to randomly attack membrane proteins in the ER.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Rather than the protease activity, properties of the substrates may account for controlled proteolysis by SPP (33).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	72	View larger version (67K):    Figure 1.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Possible models of cleavage by an I-CLiP.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Several models are presented that could permit water access to the active site.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	75	 (A) An I-CLiP may form a shallow or deep hydrophilic pocket in the membrane.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	76	 This would allow access of water to the catalytic residues (indicated by the two stars).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The pocket may form upon a conformational change induced by binding of the substrate.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	78	 (B) Two units of an I-CLiP may act as a dimer to carry out the cleavage.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	79	 In this case, substrate binding to one I-CLiP unit may induce a conformational change and the formation of a pore containing a merged active site.

0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	237	 This negative staining could be attributed by the lack of Dll induction caused by defective Notch signaling or by the absence of comma- and S-shaped bodies in PSEN-null mutant kidney.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	238	 It is interesting to note that Dll1 expression seems to be restricted to a specific region of comma- and S-shaped bodies (Fig.

0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Similar to NICD and Hesr1, both Notch ligands were not expressed in the ureteric bud, again supporting a cell autonomous mechanism of presenilin-dependent Notch signaling within the mesenchyme.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	241	Progression from pretubular aggregates to comma- and S-shaped bodies requires the conversion and patterning of mesenchymal cells into highly organized and polarized epithelia.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Analysis of cell adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix proteins, NCAM and E-cadherin, revealed that renal vesicles and tubular derivatives were partially formed in the PSEN-null kidney.

0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Thus, presenilins are not essential in the mesenchyme to epithelium transition.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	245	 However, despite the formation and apparent fusion of some E-cadherin positive distal renal tubule structures to the bud epithelium, mature proximal tubules and glomeruli were completely absent in PSEN-null kidney.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	246	 This conclusion was supported by the negative binding to LTL and lack of expression of WT1, respectively.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	247	 From these data, we conclude that presenilins play an indispensable role in the patterning and differentiation of renal vesicles leading to proximal tubules and glomeruli.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	248	In contrast to inductive interactions and MET, our current understanding about nephron patterning is limited.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	249	 There are candidate regulatory mechanisms in tubule patterning by molecules such as the cadherins, which are differentially regulated in the various renal epithelial compartments (Cho et al.

0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	254	 This activity is highly conserved and likely accounts for the role of presenilins during somite patterning (Donoviel et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Our analysis showed that the presenilin -secretase activated form of Notch1 (NICD), Notch downstream target Hesr1 and ligands Dll1 and Jag1 were expressed in mesenchymal derivatives and that their expressions were critically impaired in PSEN-null kidneys.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Thus, the Notch pathway, particularly signaling through Notch1, may be the underlying mediator for presenilin activity in kidney development.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	257	 It is noteworthy that mice expressing a hypomorphic allele of Notch2 exhibit kidney glomerulogenesis defects (McCright et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	258	 As all four mammalian Notch proteins are presenilin substrates in vitro (Saxena et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	259	, 2001), a defective Notch2-mediated pathway may also account for the PSEN-null kidney phenotype.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	260	 However, the presence of glomeruli in Notch2 mutant kidneys, albeit structurally abnormal, indicates that Notch2 functions downstream of tubule patterning (McCright et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	261	Although an essential role for the presenilins in Notch signaling has been well established, how this regulation affects Notch ligand expression has been the subject of controversy.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Some support a lateral inhibition model in which loss of Notch signaling resulting from presenilin deficiency leads to ectopic overexpression of the ligand (Donoviel et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	263	, 2000); Others suggest that presenilin-mediated Notch signaling is necessary for proper induction of its ligand (Takahashi et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	264	 The differences may be caused in part by variations of the systems of study; as ligand expression seems to be subjected to strict temporal-, spatial- and cell type-specific regulation.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	265	In kidney development, detailed examination of expression patterns of Jag1 and Dll1 yielded some interesting findings.

0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Interestingly, although pretubular aggregates and renal vesicles still exist in PSEN-null mutant at E16.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	270	 These data suggest that sustained Notch activation is necessary for the maintenance of Jag1 expression during nephrogenesis.

0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Although the origin of these cells is not known, this spatiotemporally restricted expression pattern may imply functional significance.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Indeed, during somite patterning, caudally restricted expression of Dll1 has been shown to be important for prefiguring somite identity, and proper Dll1 induction requires presenilin-dependent Notch signaling (Takahashi et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Equally possible, however, the absence of Dll1 expression could also be due to the physical lack of comma- and S-shaped bodies in the PSEN-null kidney.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	276	Besides Notch and APP, numerous other proteins have been reported as substrates of presenilin-dependent proteolysis (Lammich et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Although the physiological significance is not clear, impaired processing of these molecules cannot be excluded as a potential mechanism for the kidney defects.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Through processing-independent mechanisms, PSEN1 has been shown to interact with ss-catenin and to facilitate its turnover (Kang et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Therefore, it is possible that deregulation of the ss-catenin pathway in the PSEN-null may contribute to the kidney phenotype.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	280	 The Wnt pathway has been implicated in the inductive phase of kidney development (Dressler, 2002), but is essentially unaffected in the PSEN-null.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	281	 In addition, we have created mice with a deletion of exon 10 of the endogenous Psen1 essential for ss-catenin interaction.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Homozygous exon 10-deleted mice, when crossed onto the Psen2-null background, are viable and do not exhibit kidney defects (H.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	283	 These observations thus argue against a potential ss-catenin involvement in the PSEN-null kidney.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	284	In addition to the kidney patterning defect, Psen1- and Psen2-double null embryos display other abnormalities, most noticeably defects in heart looping and vascular remodeling (Donoviel et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	285	 These defects were apparently corrected by the human PSEN1 transgene presumably because of its early expression in mesoderm and in relevant cell derivatives.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Indeed, the human Thy-1 promoter has been shown to be active in endothelial cells (Gordon et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	287	, 1987), and expression of Hesr1, although absent in developing nephrons of the PSEN-null kidney, can be detected in blood vessels.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The analysis of mechanisms leading to these phenotypes is currently ongoing.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	289	In summary, using our novel presenilin `rescue' system, we have identified a novel function of the presenilins in nephrogenesis.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Specifically, presenilins are indispensable for the patterning of renal epithelial structures to form mature proximal tubules and glomeruli.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Loss of presenilins is associated with failed progression from renal vesicles to comma- and S-shaped bodies.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	292	 On the molecular level, we reveal an obligatory role of presenilins in the activation of Notch signaling and maintenance of the Notch ligand Jag1 expression in the mesenchymal derivatives during kidney development.

0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This clearly demonstrates that PS is required for -secretase activity and Ass generation.

0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Nicastrin and PS1 NTF-CTF are capable of binding to this immobilized -secretase inhibitor under conditions that also maintain the -secretase activity; conditions disrupting the association of these proteins with the inhibitor also render the complex inactive.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In common with anti-PS1 antibodies, anti-nicastrin antibodies can precipitate the functional -secretase complex (Esler et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Although glycosylation of nicastrin is not absolutely required for -secretase activity (Herreman et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	28	, 2003), mainly the mature form of nicastrin was identified in the HMW -secretase complex, and levels of nicastrin in cells closely correlate with PS levels (Arawaka et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Reduction of PS levels leads to a concomitant reduction in nicastrin levels, and downregulation of nicastrin expression decreases the levels of stabilized PS molecules.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Thus, reduction in the amount of either protein decreases Ass generation (Edbauer et al.

0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Notch is a type I integral membrane protein that has a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	34	 After translation, the receptor is proteolyzed in the trans-Golgi as part of its maturation into a heterodimeric cell surface receptor.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Notch then suffers a second proteolysis as a result of ligand activation, leading to shedding of the extracellular domain of the receptor.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The remaining membrane-bound C-terminal stub is subsequently cleaved within its transmembrane domain to release the Notch intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression.

0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Inactivation of APH-1 or PEN-2 in cultured Drosophila cells significantly reduces the -secretase cleavage of APP and Notch, and PS NTF-CTF levels are also reduced (Francis et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	51	 In mammalian cells, PEN-2 protein levels are significantly reduced in the absence of PS; downregulation of nicastrin synthesis similarly causes a reduction in PEN-2 levels.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Downregulation of PEN-2 synthesis likewise decreases the levels of stabilized PS molecules and mature nicastrin, with a concomitant reduction in -secretase activity (Steiner et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Reduction of APH-1 levels in mammalian cells also reduces -secretase activity (Lee et al.

0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	349	 This indicates that spr-3 and spr-4 mutations do not bypass the need for presenilins per se, but only for sel-12 and that this effect is dependent on the activity of hop-1.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	350	 We confirmed this result by constructing hop-1; sel-12 spr-3 triple mutant strains (Table 3).
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	351	 Similar experiments with spr-4 have not been performed because of the genetic proximity of spr-4 and hop-1.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	352	 We find that spr-3 does not affect the phenotype of hop-1; sel-12 double mutants as has also been shown for spr-1, spr-2 and spr-5 (Eimer et al.

0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	357	 In sel-12 spr-3 mutants, presenilin activity is very near the threshold necessary for correct egg laying and reducing hop-1 activity by half brings the worms below this threshold.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	358	 Taken together, all of these results are consistent with spr-3 and spr-4 suppressing sel-12 by upregulating hop-1.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	359	 hop-1 activity is required for spr-3- and spr-4-mediated suppression of the sel-12 egg-laying defect.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	360	 hop-1 is haploinsufficient in a sel-12 spr-3 background.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	361	All Spr genes may function through the same mechanism We provide evidence that the mechanism by which mutants of spr-3 and spr-4 suppress sel-12 loss-of-function alleles involves de-repression of hop-1 transcription in those stages in which hop-1 expression alone does not suffice.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	362	 Similarly, we have shown recently that SPR-1 and SPR-5 proteins interact, and that spr-5 upregulates hop-1 expression at the same developmental stages as mutations in spr-3 and spr-4 (Eimer et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	363	 This suggests that spr-1, spr-3, spr-4 and spr-5 all suppress sel-12 by upregulating hop-1, replacing one presenilin with another.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	364	 Similarly, mutations in spr-2 genetically bypass the need for sel-12, but do not bypass the need for both sel-12 and hop-1 (Wen et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	365	 Although hop-1 activity is required for the suppression mechanism, Wen et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	366	 did not find evidence for hop-1 transcriptional de-repression (Wen et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	367	 However, the stage specific de-repression of hop-1 transcription we have seen would not be detectable on a mixed-stage northern blot.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	368	 Thus, we propose that spr-2 may also bypass the need for sel-12 by the same mechanism as spr-3, spr-4 and spr-5.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	369	Upregulation of hop-1 transcription in the early larval stages can explain the suppression of sel-12 by spr-3 and spr-4 Mutations in spr-3 and spr-4 clearly de-repress the transcription of hop-1 in the early larval stages.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	370	 However, even in the suppressor strains, the absolute hop-1 transcript levels in the early larval stages are still much lower than in the adult stage.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	371	 We believe that the stage-specific increase in hop-1 expression is sufficient to explain why spr-3 and spr-4 suppress sel-12.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Even in a strong, putative null sel-12 mutant, there is sufficient HOP-1 protein in the larval stages to enable most lin-12-dependent developmental decisions to occur correctly.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	373	 In sel-12 mutants, the ventral uterine/anchor cell decision, lateral inhibition in the vulval precursors and the sex myoblast/coelomocyte decision are not affected (Levitan and Greenwald, 1995), indicating that there is sufficient presenilin activity, provided by HOP-1, present in many cell types.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	374	 In sel-12(ar131) even the cell fate is executed correctly in the vast majority of animals and in sel-12(ar171) it is executed correctly in some animals, while in a sel-12 hop-1 double mutants, 100% of animals have a defective vulval uterine connection (Cinar et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	375	 This indicates that in sel-12 mutants the expression of hop-1 is almost sufficient for wild-type cell induction.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	376	 Therefore, it is likely that small increases in hop-1 expression could be sufficient to compensate completely for the loss of sel-12 in all developmental decisions.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	377	There are also reasons to believe that small amounts of presenilin message may be sufficient to provide adequate levels of presenilin activity.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	378	 Presenilins are normally found as part of a high molecular weight complex (Capell et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	379	 This complex is assembled in the ER and Golgi, and proteins that are not incorporated into this complex are not targeted to the cell membrane and are rapidly degraded (Ratovitski et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	380	 Presenilins may be required in small amounts because the amount of other components of the complex are limiting for assembly (Edbauer et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	381	 Consequently, it has been found that, in cell culture, presenilins cannot be overproduced (Thinakaran et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	382	 Furthermore, as the presenilin complex is thought to have enzymatic activity, the levels of the complex necessary for its biochemical function may normally be in vast excess of what is required.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	383	 Thus, even if the amount of the complex present at the cell membrane in spr; sel-12 double mutants should be slightly lower than the wild-type levels, the wild-type phenotype of the double mutants indicates that it suffices to ensure sufficient levels of lin-12 signaling.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	384	Is the increased expression of hop-1 in the early larval stages seen in spr-3 and spr-4 mutants sufficient to rescue the later larval defects seen in sel-12 mutants? We have several reasons to believe this is the case.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	385	 First, the cell signaling events that lead to the cell induction and the correct alignment of the sex muscles, occur prior to the developmental changes (Cinar et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	386	, 2002a) and presenilin activity is presumably required at the time of signaling.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	387	 Second, our initial experiments suggested that the relative expression of hop-1 is increased in the L1, L2 and L3 stages in both spr-3 and spr-4 mutants.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	388	 We chose to pursue this further at the L1 stage because we thought the upregulation of hop-1 expression might be most obvious at this stage.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	389	 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in cell culture that, once assembled, the high molecular weight presenilin complex is very stable over a long time period (Edbauer et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	390	 Finally, we have indications that the presenilin complex is necessary in small amounts and can persist for up to 24 hours in C.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	391	 elegans because we see rescue of sex myoblast/coelomocyte cell-fate decision in hop-1;sel-12 double mutants with maternally provided hop-1 (Eimer et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	392	 Thus, presenilin protein produced in the embryo is sufficiently stable and produced in sufficient amounts for a cell fate decision occurring in the L2 stage.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	393	Do spr-3 and spr-4 perform a conserved function? Although SPR-3 and SPR-4 do not have clear mammalian homologs, they may be performing a similar function to known transcriptional repressors.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	394	 Both SPR-3 and SPR-4 resemble known transcriptional repressors, especially REST/NRSF (Re1 silencing transcription factor/neural-restrictive silencing factor) in different vertebrates.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	395	 The C2H2 zinc-finger factor REST mediates repression of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells, by recruiting the co-repressor complexes Sin3 and CoREST (Humphrey et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	396	 Both of these co-repressor complexes contain multiple proteins, including histone deacetylases, and presumably repress transcription in part by removing activating acetyl groups from histones H3 and H4 at the target locus.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	397	 It is possible that SPR-3 and SPR-4 may also function by recruiting conserved co-repressor complexes to the hop-1 locus.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	398	 Three other Spr genes, spr-1, spr-2 and spr-5, encode proteins similar to components of known co-repressors (Eimer et al.

0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	402	 Recently, it has been shown that upregulation of SET also inhibits demethylation of methylated DNA and may integrate the epigenetic states of DNA and associated histones (Cervoni et al.

0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	407	 We have shown that SPR-1 and SPR-5 interact biochemically in vitro and in vivo (Eimer et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	408	 This suggests that a similar complex is present in C.

0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	410	 Interestingly, CoREST has been found to associate with at least two large, basic C2H2 zinc-finger proteins, ZNF217 and REST (You et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	411	, 2001), and may be a general co-repressor complex that is recruited to different loci in different cell types by binding to a different C2H2 zinc-finger proteins.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	412	 Recent work also suggests that CoREST may interact with components of the SWI-SNF complex (Battaglioli et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	413	, 2002) and may be involved in silencing of chromosomal regions (Lunyak et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	414	The proteins encoded by the Spr genes may form one or more transcriptional repressor complexes Thus, SPR-3 and SPR-4 may recruit one or more conserved co-repressor complexes, including one similar to the CoREST co-repressor complex, to target loci.

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	5	 However, apart from a role in early development, neither the normal function of the presenilins nor the mechanisms by which mutant proteins cause AD are well understood.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We describe here the properties of a novel human interactor of the presenilins named ubiquilin.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) interaction, glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments, and colocalization of the proteins expressed in vivo, together with coimmunoprecipitation and cell fractionation studies, provide compelling evidence that ubiquilin interacts with both PS1 and PS2.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Ubiquilin is noteworthy since it contains multiple ubiquitin-related domains typically thought to be involved in targeting proteins for degradation.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, we show that ubiquilin promotes presenilin protein accumulation.

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The topology of presenilins is debatable, though the most widely drawn models show proteins that weave through the membrane eight times, with the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains and a large "loop" between transmembrane domains six and seven all oriented towards the cytoplasm (see Fig 1 A) (Haass and De Strooper 1999 ).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Although both proteins share extensive sequence identity along their entire lengths, their NH2-terminal domains and the second half of their loops are highly divergent, suggesting that these unique regions could modulate different functions of the two presenilins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	23	 An examination of presenilin-linked FAD mutations mapped so far reveals that most are missense mutations in identical residues spread throughout the polypeptide in both presenilins, suggesting that the conserved residues are important for the function of the proteins.

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Indirect immunofluorescence, as well as laser confocal microscopy, revealed endogenous intracellular localization of ubiquilin in HeLa cells to both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig 6B, Fig E, and Fig G).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	301	 In some cells, endogenous ubiquilin staining was stronger in the nucleus (Fig 6 E, arrowheads).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Furthermore, in a small subset of cells, ubiquilin within the cytoplasm was localized to punctate structures (Fig 6B and Fig E, arrows).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	303	 The frequency of these structures dramatically increased upon overexpression of full-length untagged ubiquilin (Fig 6C and Fig F).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	304	 To corroborate the anti-ubiquilin staining pattern, we performed additional localization studies on myc- and GFP-tagged ubiquilin proteins in HeLa cells (Fig 2 IV, O and N, respectively).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Overexpressed myc-tagged ubiquilin stained with anti-myc mAb exhibited the same intracellular structures (Fig 6 I) as overexpressed wild-type ubiquilin (Fig 6C and Fig F).

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Indeed, there was a dramatic change in ubiquilin staining in HeLa cells coexpressing either PS1 or PS2 and ubiquilin, resulting in almost complete colocalization of the presenilin and ubiquilin intracellular staining patterns, as seen by laser confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig 7A and Fig B).

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	330	Since Y2H data suggested that ubiquilin interacts with both the loop and COOH-terminal domains of the presenilins, we examined whether removal of these regions from PS2 would abolish colocalization of the proteins in vivo.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	331	 To assess this possibility, two PS2 constructs containing progressively longer COOH-terminal deletions were made.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	332	 In the first, PS2(C), the 39-amino acid COOH-terminal domain was deleted (Fig 1 A, arrowhead), whereas in the second, PS2(LC), the large hydrophilic loop and all sequences downstream were deleted (Fig 1 A, arrow).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	333	 When expressed in HeLa cells, PS2(C) still colocalized with ubiquilin (Fig 7 C), presumably since the PS2 loop region that remained could bind ubiquilin, as suggested by the strong interaction between the two in Y2H assays (Fig 1 D).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	334	 However, once the hydrophilic loop region and COOH terminus were both removed, PS2(LC) no longer colocalized with ubiquilin (Fig 7 D), suggesting that the NH2 terminus and the first six transmembrane domains of PS2 do not contain additional ubiquilin binding sites.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	335	 A notable feature of the overexpression of PS2(LC) was its accumulation into large spherical aggregates that failed to stain positively for ubiquilin.

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	338	 However, these conditions did not markedly increase PS2 protein levels (Fig 8 B, lanes 4 to 6).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	339	 Remarkably, coexpression of ubiquilin with PS2 caused a substantial (>10-fold) increase in PS2 protein accumulation (Fig 8 B, lanes 7 to 9) compared with overexpression of PS2 alone (Fig 8 B, lanes 4 to 6).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	340	 This effect was independent of treatment with lactacystin or MG-132, as it also occurred just as robustly in cells not treated with the proteasome inhibitors.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Particularly striking was the increased accumulation in SDS-PAGE gels of full-length uncleaved PS2 protein (Fig 8 B, arrowhead) and higher molecular weight complexes that PS2 forms.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	342	 Increasing the amount of transfected ubiquilin plasmid DNA, whereas maintaining constant levels of transfected PS2 plasmid DNA, revealed a dose-dependent effect by ubiquilin on PS2 accumulation within the cells (Fig 8 E, lanes 1 to 5).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	343	 This effect was specific for ubiquilin expression, since cotransfection of increasing amounts of GFP plasmid DNA with PS2 did not increase PS2 protein accumulation (Fig 8 F, lanes 1 to 5).

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	346	 In fact, recent reports have indicated that cleavage of presenilins is not essential for biological function of the presenilins, namely by its ability to rescue PS activity in C.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	347	 The absence of detectable endoproteolytic cleaved forms of PS2 is more clearly illustrated in Fig 8 G, which shows that an antibody specific for PS2-loop sequences downstream of the proposed endoproteolytic cleavage site recognized the same 54 kD and higher PS2 species (as the PS2 NH2-terminal specific antibody).

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	413	Here, we describe a novel human presenilin-interacting protein named ubiquilin.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	414	 Y2H interaction, GST pull-down experiments, coimmunoprecipitation studies, changes in the cellular fractionation of proteins, and colocalization of the proteins expressed in vivo provide compelling evidence that ubiquilin and the presenilins interact with one another.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	415	 Ubiquilin is an important protein because it contains multiple ubiquitin-related domains typically thought to be involved in targeting proteins for degradation, yet ubiquilin promotes increased presenilin protein accumulation.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	416	 Moreover, ubiquilin is highly expressed in neurons of human brain and is associated with NFTs and Lewy bodies of AD and PD brains, respectively.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	417	The promotion of presenilin protein accumulation by ubiquilin overexpression is noteworthy as a new means by which presenilin levels may be modulated.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	418	 By conducting pulse-chase experiments, we found that ubiquilin induced an increase in presenilin protein maturation, but did not dramatically affect presenilin protein turnover.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	419	 The net effect over time from increased presenilin protein synthesis and undisturbed turnover rate would eventually lead to an elevation of the intracellular pool of presenilin proteins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	420	 This modulation of presenilin levels by ubiquilin may have important consequences to cellular functions, as presenilins have been linked to various biological processes, including Notch signaling, calcium regulation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, unfolded-protein response, as well as APP-associated gamma secretase activity (see Introduction).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	421	It will be interesting to determine the precise mechanism by which ubiquilin induces increased presenilin protein synthesis.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	422	 Ubiquilin could increase presenilin synthesis by simply increasing presenilin transcription, increasing presenilin translation, or facilitating correct polypeptide folding, maturation, and intracellular targeting of the polytopic transmembrane presenilin protein.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	423	 Based on its various properties, we are especially intrigued by the possibility that ubiquilin may act as a molecular chaperone.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	424	 (a) Studies of the Xenopus ubiquilin homologue, XDRP1, have suggested that ubiquilin can act posttranscriptionally like a molecular chaperone and prevent degradation of in vitro translated cyclin A protein (Funakoshi et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	425	 (b) Chap1 (ubiquilin 2) has been shown to bind Stch, an Hsp70-like protein (Kaye et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	426	 In turn, many heat-shock proteins have been shown to function as molecular chaperones, preventing protein aggregation and protein degradation (Warrick et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	427	 1999 ; Krobitsch and Lindquist 2000 ).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	428	 (c) Recent evidence has linked ubiquilin proteins to the proteasome (Kleijnen et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	429	 Meanwhile, the 19S regulatory subunit of the 26S proteasome (the degradation complex for ubiquitin-tagged proteins) has been shown to possess protein-unfolding activity (Braun et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	430	 (d) Indirect evidence that ubiquilin may aid in presenilin protein folding or targeting comes from our observation that the presenilin construct PS2(LC), with deletions of both the loop and COOH-terminal ubiquilin-interaction sites (as demonstrated by Y2H assays and lack of colocalization with ubiquilin within cells), frequently accumulated into large cytoplasmic aggregates.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	431	 In contrast, presenilin molecules, which contained ubiquilin interaction sites, rarely formed large protein aggregates.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	432	 The connection between aggregate accumulation and loss of ubiquilin interaction may be entirely coincidental.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	433	 However, the possibility that the two are interconnected cannot be discounted.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	434	 Finally, presenilins proteins have themselves been linked to molecular chaperones of the ER, which are involved in the unfolded-protein response (Katayama et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	435	Another mechanism by which ubiquilin might increase presenilin accumulation is to alter presenilin degradation rates, especially that of the ubiquitinated forms of presenilins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	436	 In fact, a recent report by Kleijnen et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	437	 2000 found evidence that overexpression of human ubiquilin proteins, hPLIC-1 (ubiquilin 1) and hPLIC-2 (ubiquilin 2), interfered with ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 and IkB.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	438	 Although we did not find any significant change in the turnover rate of the major 54-kD PS2 polypeptide species (corresponding to full-length PS2), we cannot exclude the possibility that certain ubiquitinated forms of presenilins may have altered turnover rates.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	439	 The ubiquitinated forms of presenilins migrated as a smear on the SDS-PAGE gels, which made quantification of the turnover rates of these species difficult.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	440	 It will be important in future studies to determine if ubiquilin is involved in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of presenilins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	441	The region in ubiquilin that binds presenilins was mapped to the COOH-terminal region containing the UBA domain, which is highly conserved in ubiquilin family members from human to yeast (Fig 4).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	442	 This sequence was both necessary and sufficient to bind PS1 and PS2 in vitro.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	443	 The UBA domain is a recently recognized motif present in one or two copies in a variety of proteins involved in the ubiquitin/proteasome folding/degradation pathway, UV excision repair, and phosphorylation (Hofmann and Bucher 1996 ).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	444	 The UBA domain consists of 55 total residues of which 45 appear to be core residues.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	445	 15 of the core residues are extremely well conserved, suggesting they may be important for determining the overall structure of the domain.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	446	 Through nuclear magnetic resonance, the structure of the COOH-terminal UBA domain of the human DNA repair protein HHR23A (RAD23 homologue) has been determined.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	447	 It is a compact three-helix bundle with an exposed hydrophobic surface predicted to be involved in protein to protein interactions (Dieckmann et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	448	 The strong binding of the ubiquilin UBA domain to presenilins may be facilitated by similar protein to protein interactions.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	449	 It will be important to determine if sequence variation of the UBA domain in different proteins influences binding specificity to different target proteins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	450	In vitro binding assays indicated that the UB domain in the NH2-terminal portion of ubiquilin was not required for binding presenilins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	451	 Although this domain shares high homology to the conserved 76-amino acid ubiquitin polypeptide, it is unlikely to be involved in covalent linkage to lysine residues of target proteins, since it lacks the obligate COOH-terminal glycine residue required for cleavage and conjugation.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	452	 Another possibility could be that the UB domain is modified by conjugation by either ubiquitin or other small ubiquitin-like proteins (e.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	453	) to its lysine group (or groups) forming ubiquitin-conjugates (Pickart 1998 ).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	454	 This is also unlikely to occur, as ubiquilin immunoblots did not show the expected ladder of ubiquitin-conjugated bands.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	455	 Therefore, the UB domain may play a role in some other function.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	456	 For example, in yeast RAD23 and its human homologues (HHR23A and HHR23B), the UB domains are involved in binding subunits of the proteasome, whereas in XDRP1, the UB domain is necessary for binding cyclin A.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	457	 Clearly, insight into ubiquilin's function will emerge from an understanding of protein to protein interactions and the roles of its different domains.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	458	Using a combination of immunological and GFP-tagging approaches, we have demonstrated that ubiquilin is localized to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in HeLa cells.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	459	 The intensity of nuclear staining was variable, with some nuclei staining very brightly.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	460	 The variability may be related to cell cycle changes of cyclin A (a protein to which ubiquilin's homologue XDRP1 has been shown to interact) levels within the nucleus.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	461	 The cytoplasmic distribution of ubiquilin was also variable.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	462	 In untransfected cells, endogenous ubiquilin had a fine punctate appearance, with hints of association to a network-like pattern, possibly the ER.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	463	 In some of these cells, ubiquilin accumulated in larger spherical structures throughout the cytoplasm, whose number and size were variable.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	464	 Upon ubiquilin overexpression, the cells formed even larger and more numerous ubiquilin-containing structures.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	465	 Under confocal microscopy, the ubiquilin staining pattern colocalized almost perfectly with the presenilin staining pattern.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	466	 Considering that the two presenilin interaction sites (COOH terminus and loop domains) both face the cytoplasm according to the predicted topology of presenilins in membranes, it is not surprising that ubiquilin colocalized with ER membrane-bound presenilin.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	467	 Still, many other proteins have also been shown to interact with these two domains of presenilins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	468	 Clearly, understanding the dynamics of the different protein to protein interactions should provide clues regarding presenilin functions.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	469	 A study of mouse PLIC-1 and PLIC-2 suggested an involvement in linking integrins via integrin-associated proteins to the vimentin cytoskeleton (Wu et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	470	 We have not observed any significant staining of ubiquilin to the cell periphery and do not know if this is in any way related to the lack of expression of particular integrin-associated proteins or integrins in HeLa cells.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	471	 Nevertheless, it is interesting that vimentin and presenilins have been linked to one another in aggresomes, structures involved in the cellular response to misfolded proteins (Johnston et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	472	 Moreover, recent evidence indicates that aggresomes are involved in the recruitment of the proteasome Hsp70 and chaperones (Garcia-Mata et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	473	 1999 ), which circumstantially suggests a mechanism by which ubiquilin could be associated with proteins of the misfolded protein response.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	474	There are the several lines of evidence that link ubiquitin to genes and tissues involved in AD.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	475	 First, presenilin proteins are thought to be ubiquitinated, since treatment with proteasome inhibitors cause the accumulation of large complexes, which migrate in SDS gels in a manner consistent with modification by ubiquitin (Kim et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	476	 Second, it is well known that ubiquitin immunoreactivity is strongly associated with the NFTs and senile plaques of AD, hallmark lesions of AD pathology (Mori et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	477	 The strong ubiquilin immunoreactivity associated with NFTs and Lewy bodies is intriguing, considering that these lesions are known to contain misfolded proteins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	478	 At present, our results do not provide clues as to whether ubiquilin is acting in a causative role or as an end result of association with misfolded and accumulated proteins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	479	 We plan to pursue this in the future.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	480	In summary, ubiquilin is the first presenilin-interacting protein, to our knowledge, that has been found to regulate presenilin levels in cells.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	481	 The presence of multiple ubiquitin-related domains suggests ubiquilin may be involved in the regulation of presenilin protein levels by the proteasome-folding and/or degradation pathway.

0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	12	Predictive or prenatal testing is potentially feasible in families with FAD but will depend upon the availability of DNA from at least one affected individual in order to establish which mutation is causing disease in that family.

0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Thus, individuals from FAD pedigrees need to be informed that there is a 30% chance that, with the current state of our knowledge, no causative mutation will be found.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	17	 If no mutation is found then, if the pedigree is strongly suggestive of an autosomal dominant disorder, the geneticist may choose to go on to search for mutations in genes associated with similar conditions   prion protein (PrP) in CJD and tau in frontal temporal dementias, for example.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Yet another factor to consider is that there has been one report of apparent non-penetrance of a PSEN1 mutation in a healthy 68-year-old member of a FAD pedigree (Rossor et al, 1996).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Notwithstanding these caveats, in the absence of any preventive treatment, the take-up for predictive testing is likely to be low, as has been the case in Huntington's disease (Binedell et al, 1998).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	20	When faced with someone who is worried about their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease it is often worth pointing out that we are all at some risk of developing Alzheimer's disease provided that we live long enough.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The large Rotterdam study suggests that the risk at age 55 years of developing dementia in the following 35 years is 0.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In this study 73% of dementia was wholly or partially attributable to Alzheimer's disease.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The large continuing Framingham study yields somewhat lower lifetime risks of Alzheimer's disease after the age of 65 years: 6.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	24	3% for men and 12% for women, with a corresponding risk for all dementia of 10.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	25	9% and 19%, respectively (Seshadri et al, 1997).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Many epidemiological studies suggest that women are at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The reasons for this are not clear, but increased longevity compared to men, increased survival with the disease and some increase in intrinsic vulnerability probably all play a part.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	28	Prevalence studies tell us that dementia doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 years up to the age of around 85 years, after which time the rate of increase appears to slow (Heeren et al, 1991; Skoog et al, 1993; Ritchie  and  Kildea, 1995; Breitner et al, 1999; von Strauss et al, 1999).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	29	 It is likely that some of this slowing is due to very old people not living as long with their dementia as younger sufferers do, although it is also possible that survivors into late old age are relatively resistant to developing dementia (Drachman, 1994).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Prevalence data are summarised in Table 1.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	31	View this table:    Table 1 Prevalence of dementia by age (from Ritchie  and  Kildea, 1995, with permission)  .
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	32	In fact, two nearly completely ascertained community-based studies, one from Japan and one from The Netherlands, found that the prevalence of dementia in centenarians was very high: 70% in the Japanese and 88% in the Dutch sample (Asada et al, 1996; Blansjaar et al, 2000).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Asada et al (1996) attributed some 76% of the dementia to Alzheimer's disease and demonstrated that the 6-month mortality rate was 27% for the centenarians with dementia, whereas none of the non-demented centenarians died.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	34	Thus, prevalence figures for dementia tell us that many of us are at some risk of developing dementia, provided that we live long enough.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This is obviously too simplistic: most people do not expect to live into their mid-90s; a much more reasonable question is, "What is my chance of developing Alzheimer's disease by the age of 85 years?".
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Family studies in Alzheimer's disease can go some way towards allowing us to answer this question for the relatives of affected individuals.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	37	Overall, the findings from studies based in memory clinics (that are likely to be centres of secondary referral) suggest that 30-48% of probands with Alzheimer's disease have a history of affected first-degree relatives compared with 13-19% of controls.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	38	 This translates to 6-14% of the relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease having a history of Alzheimer's disease compared with 3.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	39	5-7% of the first-degree relatives of healthy controls.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Kaplan Meier life table analysis has been used in these studies to infer that the cumulative risk of dementia by age 90 varies between 30 and 50% compared with between 10 and 23% in control relatives.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	41	 However, as has been pointed out by Breitner, owing to competing causes of death, only about one-third of this theoretical familial predisposition to Alzheimer's disease is realised in the usual life span.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	42	 This translates to an actual predicted risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in the first-degree relatives of probands with Alzheimer's disease of 15-19%, compared with 5% in controls (Breitner et al, 1988; Breitner, 1991).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	43	The latest systematically ascertained twin studies on the heritability of Alzheimer's disease also tend to support the estimates of familial risk derived from family studies.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Probandwise, concordance rates of about 40% and 84%, respectively, are seen in fraternal and identical twins (Bergem et al, 1997).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Because fraternal twins are genetically equivalent to ordinary first-degree relatives, the observed morbid risk of developing Alzheimer's disease is similar to that estimated for first-degree relatives in family studies.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	46	A study by Silverman et al (1994) suggested that, in large measure, the familial component of risk to the relatives of probands with Alzheimer's disease was expended by the end of the ninth decade, after which time the risk was very similar to that in controls.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	47	 A number of other family history studies have suggested that familial factors are more prominent when onset is earlier (McGuffin et al, 1994).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Thus, much of Alzheimer's disease in late old age may be considered as not very familial and merely an expression of one of the ways in which the ageing process is manifested in those few survivors into late old age.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	49	The findings from these family studies can be used to advise relatives in only the broadest terms.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	50	 One can do little more than to say that, on balance, the risk to the first-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease who developed the disorder at any time up to the age of 85 years is increased some threefold to fourfold relative to the risk in controls.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	51	 This would seem to translate to a risk of developing Alzheimer's disease of between one in five and one in six, which, although an improvement on a risk of one in two, can still be rather frightening.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	52	 In order to put this risk into better perspective, and to help allay the client's anxiety, it may be preferable to present the risk estimates in a graphical form, as is done in Fig.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	53	 If this is done, clients can see that even at 78 years, the age of greatest risk, the actual predicted risk is only some 3% and that the cumulative risk (half the area under the curve f(x) S(x)) from age 65 to 78 is probably less than 10%.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	54	 In our experience many tell us that this is reassuring   partly because their worries were about getting Alzheimer's disease in their fifties "because this is when familial Alzheimer's disease happens" or in their sixties/seventies, thus preventing them from enjoying retirement.

0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	60	In the case of patients with Alzheimer's disease who became demented late in old age, say by their 80s, relatives probably run the same 30-50% risk of developing dementia as anyone else who lives to the age of 90 years and beyond.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Of course, it is possible that some of the same genes that confer longevity may also increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Like other disorders that reflect the combined action of several genes, the risk to relatives drops rapidly as the degree of genetic relatedness falls.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Data are limited but the risk to second-degree relatives, such as grand-children, is probably less than twice the population levels (Heston et al, 1981).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	64	The APOE 4 association with Alzheimer's disease has been replicated in many laboratories around the world.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	65	 A meta-analysis summarised the data and demonstrated that the association was found in people of European, African American, American Hispanic and Japanese origin (Farrer et al, 1997).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Exactly how APOE 4 and the apoE4 protein influence the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease is still unknown, but bearers of this risk allele appear to get Alzheimer's disease earlier and develop a heavier amyloid burden.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	67	The consensus of opinion appears to be that APOE genotype determines  when  rather than  whether  one succumbs to Alzheimer's disease.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	68	 For example, the Cache County study (Meyer et al, 1998, Breitner et al, 1999) on an elderly population of almost 5000 found 22 cases of Alzheimer's disease among 141 APOE 4 homozygotes, 118 among 1452 APOE 4 heterozygotes and 80 among 3339 not bearing the APOE 4 allele.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	69	 There appeared to be a plateau in each group's survival curve beyond which no new cases of Alzheimer's disease were seen.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	70	 For APOE 4 homozygotes no new cases were seen after the age of 84 years, with nine individuals surviving without Alzheimer's disease for a combined total of a further 37 years.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	71	 For APOE 4 heterozygotes the last onset of Alzheimer's disease was at 99 years, with four long-term survivors.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The last onset of dementia in individuals without the APOE 4 allele was at age 95 years, with 31 surviving free of dementia for a combined total of 100 years thereafter.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	73	 This differential effect of APOE genotype on the age of maximum risk of Alzheimer's disease is also suggested in the APOE meta-analysis of Farrer et al (1997) and also in the study by Asada et al (1996).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	74	A Bayesian analysis has been used by Seshadri et al (1995) to relate the APOE genotype to the lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	75	 When the estimates of dementia risk derived from the Framingham study (Seshadri et al, 1997) are substituted in the analysis, somewhat lower risk estimates, which are stratified according to gender, are obtained (Table 2).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	76	View this table:    Table 2 Remaining lifetime risk at age 65 years of developing Alzheimer's disease according to gender and apolipoprotein E (APOE) status  .
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	77	These estimates suggest that, at most, some 50% of APOE 4 homozygotes will develop Alzheimer's disease within their lifetime.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	78	 These predictions agree well with the general population-based study of Henderson et al (1995), which suggested that the risk of developing dementia by age 90 years in APOE 4 homozygotes was about 50%.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	79	Some claims have been made that APOE genotyping may be an aid to diagnosing Alzheimer's disease.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The study by Mayeux et al (1998) suggested that for patients referred to specialised assessment centres for Alzheimer's disease, APOE genotyping used in combination with clinical criteria might improve the specificity of the diagnosis.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The data show that whereas the demonstration of one or more APOE 4 allele in a person suspected of suffering with dementia slightly increases the accuracy of a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, the absence of an APOE 4 allele has little value in either endorsing or refuting a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Thus, even in a selected group of patients, presumably all with a high a priori chance of Alzheimer's disease, APOE genotyping seems to confer negligible diagnostic benefit.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	83	Families where there is evidence of FAD (or indeed any familial early-onset dementia) should be referred to a specialist centre   in the UK this will be a regional genetics department.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Counselling for such families should follow the process established for Huntington's disease.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	85	 For late-onset Alzheimer's disease all the groups are agreed that there is no role for APOE genotyping in prediction or risk assessment.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	86	Late-onset Alzheimer's disease For late-onset Alzheimer's disease there is wide agreement that there is no genetic test available, but genetic testing is not the same as genetic counselling.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The absence of a test should not mean that relatives are denied information and the opportunity to discuss their concerns.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	88	 So, when asked "am I likely to get Alzheimer's disease?" by the relative of a patient with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, how should one answer? In most cases of Alzheimer's disease it is only possible to advise relatives of their risk in the broadest terms.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Extrapolating from family history studies, it is possible to say that the risk to the children is in the region of one in five to one in six and one should be prepared to illustrate what this means in an easy to understand graphical form.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	90	 We believe that it is permissible for such a broad estimate of risk to be imparted by a consultant or doctor not specifically trained in genetic counselling.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	91	Occasionally, psychiatrists encounter families with several siblings affected by late-onset Alzheimer's disease and a history of dementia in previous generations.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Such families almost certainly exhibit high genetic loading, but there are few reliable data on whether and to what extent risk increases with the number of affected relatives, although studies of other common disorders suggest that this is likely to be the case.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	93	 However, it should be borne in mind that the number of affected relatives may well depend on factors affecting longevity as well as on the degree of genetic loading for Alzheimer's disease, and it may not be advisable or possible to base discussion on risk estimates that are increased when several relatives have been affected in late old age.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	94	 There is also preliminary evidence for substantially increased risk in the offspring of parents who both have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (Bird et al, 1993).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	95	 In such pedigrees, if relatives request further information, it may be worth taking a detailed family history and consulting with a clinical geneticist.

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	7	 (B) Schematic illustrating a -secretase reporter.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The reporter contains two components: a chimeric protein, APP-GAL4, as a substrate and the UAS-GRIM construct as an output.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	9	 APP-GAL4 is specifically expressed in the eye.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In the absence of -secretase mediated APP cleavage (left panel), no cell death will be observed in vivo.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In the presence of -secretase (right panel), the unleashed APP fragment and GAL4 are translocated to the nucleus and activate GRIM-dependent cell death.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	12	 (C to F) Scanning electron micrographs of adult fly eyes of various genotypes.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The genotypes are as follows: (C) GMR to APP to GAL4/+; (D) UAS to GRIM/+; (E) GMR to APP to GAL4, UAS to GRIM/+; (F) GMR to p35/+; GMR to APP to GAL4, UAS to GRIM/+.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Expression of GMR to APP to GAL4/+ (C) or UAS to GRIM/+ (D), in isolation resulted in flies with wildtype-appearing eyes.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In contrast, Expression of both GMR to APP to GAL4 and UAS to GRIM (reporter) results in adult flies with small eyes (E), indicative of retinal cell death.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Retinal cell death present in the reporter flies is eliminated and eye size restored to normal by coexpression of the caspase inhibitor baculovirus p35 (F).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	17	  -Secretase activity resides in a large multi-protein complex (8), the exact molecular weight and composition of which is still being elucidated (reviewed in 9,10).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Recent observations indicate that the activity of four proteins, Presenilin, Nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2, are necessary for -secretase activity (reviewed in 10).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The human genome encodes two Presenilins, Presenilin 1 (PS1) and Presenilin 2 (PS2).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Presenilins bind APP and probably provide the active catalytic core of -secretase or act as intimate cofactors (reviewed in 2,6,11 to 14).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Mutations in PS1 and PS2 are associated with the majority of familial AD cases (4).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Nicastrin is a transmembrane glycoprotein isolated via its ability to bind PS1 (15) and to promote Notch signaling in C.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	23	 APH-1, a polytopic membrane protein originally identified as a regulator of Notch signaling in C.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	24	 elegans (17,18), binds to Presenilins and Nicastrin (19 to 21).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	25	 PEN-2, a small protein that spans the membrane twice, was also first identified as a regulator of Notch signaling in C.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These four proteins, when coexpressed in S.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	27	 cerevisiae, which lacks endogenous -secretase activity, are sufficient to create an active -secretase complex (22; reviewed in 10).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This finding suggests that these four proteins are the minimal core components of the -secretase, although it does not exclude the possibility that factors in yeast may also contribute to formation of the active -secretase complex.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	29	 These four proteins regulate the stability and maturation of each other in tissue culture (19 to 26).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	30	 How this regulation occurs is unknown.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	31	 It is also unknown if other signaling pathways regulate -secretase activity by modifying the assembly or activity of these proteins.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	32	Drosophila -secretase and its four known components are functionally conserved.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Drosophila has an endogenous -secretase activity for APP and Notch (27), and its mechanism of action through formation of a high molecular weight complex with Presenilin is also conserved (28).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Drosophila has a single homolog each of presenilin (psn) (29 to 31), nicastrin (nct) (32 to 34), aph-1 and pen-2 (18).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Loss of psn or nct function in Drosophila results in Notch-like phenotypes (32 to 37).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Removing aph-1 or pen-2 in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) culture cells via RNA interference (RNAi) suppresses -cleavage of both APP and Notch (18).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Together, these observations indicate that the mechanisms by which APP cleavage occurs in flies, as well as the pathways by which this activity is regulated, are conserved with those of mammals.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	38	Genes that regulate -cleavage of APP have been isolated successfully through several approaches.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Positional cloning of familial AD genes resulted in identification of PS1 and PS2.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Biochemical purification of PS1-associated proteins led to the identification of Nicastrin (reviewed in 3 to 5).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Function-based in vivo genetic screens conducted in model systems such as C.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	42	 elegans and Drosophila for phenotypes that are suggestive of an alteration in -secretase activity provide an important complementary strategy for identifying new genes regulating -secretase.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	43	 elegans mutants with Notch-like or presenilin-like developmental defects identified the -secretase regulators aph-2 (nicastrin) (16), aph-1 and pen-2 (17,18).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The advantage of the in vivo genetic approach is that it does not rely on direct physical binding to existing proteins such as Presenilins, and thus will not be limited by the low affinity or abundance of important interacting components.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	45	 In addition, it has the potential to identify components of the regulatory pathways of -secretase activity that may not bind to Presenilin.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Below, we describe a reporter that allows determination of the endogenous levels of -secretase activity in an easy to visualize, nonessential neuronal tissue, the adult fly eye.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	47	 This reporter is designed to identify changes in -cleavage of APP.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	48	 This is in contrast to previous C.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	49	 elegans and Drosophila-based screens which used presenilin and Notch mutant phenotypes during development as surrogate markers (16 to 18).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In addition, we describe results from a screen utilizing these flies that identified a small region on the second chromosome containing one or more genes whose products may promote APP -secretase activity.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	51	Flies expressing GMR to APP to GAL4 alone have wildtype-appearing eyes (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	52	 1C), as do flies carrying only UAS to GRIM (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	53	 In contrast, flies expressing both GMR to APP to GAL4 and UAS to GRIM (referred to hereafter as the reporter flies) have small eyes (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Importantly, the reporter small eye phenotype was completely suppressed when reporter flies also expressed under GMR control the potent cell death and caspase inhibitor baculovirus p35 (38) (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	55	 1F), or the Drosophila cell death and caspase inhibitor DIAP1 (44) (data not shown).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	56	 These observations indicate that the reporter small eye phenotype is strictly due to GRIM-induced caspase-dependent cell death, and not the result of developmental defects or the activation of other signal transduction pathways by the cleaved APP to GAL4 reporter protein.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	57	The -secretase reporter flies act as a useful genetic background in which to carry out screens for -secretase regulators (see below).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Any screen, genetic or chemical, generates false positives, i.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	59	 mutations that act as modifiers but that are not interesting for the project at hand.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	60	 In our case sources of such modifiers include mutations that affect the efficiency of GMR- or GAL4-dependent transcriptional activation, or the efficacy of GRIM-dependent cell death signaling.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	61	 We intended to use GMR to GAL4, UAS to GRIM to eliminate these false positives.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	62	 However, since GMR to GAL4, UAS to GRIM flies are lethal, we chose to utilize two strains of flies that act as reporters for false positives.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The first strain is GMR to GRIM which expresses GRIM directly under GMR control and has small eyes (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The second strain is GMR-GAL4, UAS-GRIM G/REAPER (45).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	65	 This chimeric protein, G/REAPER, has the N-terminus of Grim, and the C-terminus of a second cell death activator, Reaper (Rpr) (46).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	66	 GMR to GAL4, UAS to G/RPR flies also have a small eye phenotype, due to induction of caspase-dependent cell death (45) (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	67	 True modifiers of -secretase activity should alter the eye size of reporter flies, but not those of the false positive reporter flies.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	68	 False positives, on the other hand, should modify eye size similarly in the presence of both the reporter and false positive reporters.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	69	 As an example of the latter, reduction in the levels of glass, which encodes a transcription factor that drives GMR-dependent expression (47), results in suppression of the small eye phenotype of reporter flies, as well as those of the false positive reporters (data not shown).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	70	View larger version (176K):    Figure 2.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	71	 -Secretase reporter flies are sensitive to the levels of Psn.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Scanning electron micrographs of various genotypes are shown.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The genotypes are as follows: (A) GMR to APP to GAL4, UAS to GRIM/+; (B) GMR to APP to GAL4, UAS to GRIM/+; psnC1/+; (C) GMR to APP to GAL4, UAS to GRIM/+; GMR to PSNDN/+; (D) GMR to GRIM/+; (E) GMR to GRIM/+; psnC1/+; (F) GMR to GRIM/+; GMR to PSNDN/+; (G) GMR to GAL4, UAS to G/RPR/+; (H) GMR to GAL4, UAS to G/RPR/+; psnC1/+; (I) GMR to GAL4, UAS to G/RPR/+; GMR to PSNDN/+.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	74	 (A) is identical to Figure 1E, as the crosses for Figures 1 to 3 were set up in parallel.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Decreasing Psn levels suppress the GMR to APP to GAL4, UAS to GRIM-dependent small eye phenotype (B, C; cf.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	76	 A), but not the small eye phenotypes associated with GMR-GRIM (E, F; cf.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	77	 D) or GMR to GAL4, UAS to G/RPR (H, I; cf.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	78	  Activity of the reporter depends on Presenilin, Nicastrin and Aph-1 Presenilin, Nicastrin and Aph-1 are required for -secretase-dependent cleavage of APP in mammals and Drosophila (reviewed in 10,14).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Thus an important prediction is that the eye phenotype of reporter flies, but not those of the false positive reporter flies (GMR to GRIM or GMR to GAL4, UAS to G/RPR), should be sensitive to the levels of Psn, Nct and Aph-1.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	80	 We used two approaches to decrease Psn levels: in the first we made reporter flies heterozygous for a psn null mutation, psnC1 (35), thereby decreasing the psn genetic dose by 50%; in the second we generated and expressed a dominant negative version of Drosophila Psn under GMR control (GMR to PSNDN flies; see Materials and Methods for details).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Heterozygous flies for psnC1 or GMR to PSNDN alone had wild-type-appearing eyes (data not shown).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	82	 In contrast, decreasing Psn levels suppressed the small eye phenotype of the reporter (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	83	 A), but not the small eye phenotypes associated with GMR-GRIM (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	84	 D) or GMR to GAL4, UAS to G/RPR (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	85	Results of a similar series of experiments showed that the reporter eye phenotype was also sensitive to levels of a second component of the -secretase complex, Nct (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Again, we used two approaches to reduce the levels of Nct.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	87	 In the first we made reporter flies heterozygous for a nct null allele, nct J2 (33), thereby decreasing the nct genetic dose by 50%.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	88	 In the second we generated flies that expressed an nct RNA interference construct under GMR control (GMR to RNAi to nct flies, see Materials and Methods for details), and introduced these into the reporter background.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Heterozygous flies for nctJ2 or GMR to RNAi to nct, in isolation, had wild-type-appearing eyes (data not shown).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	90	 However, they both led to a strong suppression of the reporter-dependent small eye phenotype (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	91	 As with psn above, reduction of nct dose had no effect on the eye size of the false positive reporter flies, GMR to GRIM (Fig.

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Therefore, to determine if loss of aph-1 function suppressed the reporter small eye phenotype we generated flies that expressed an aph-1 RNAi construct under GMR control (GMR-RNAi-aph-1 flies).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	104	 These flies were wild-type in appearance (data not shown).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	105	 They acted as strong suppressors of the small eye phenotype of the reporter (Fig.

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Thus, the -secretase reporter fly eye phenotype is sensitive to small changes (roughly 2-fold) in the levels of three known components or regulators of the -secretase complex, Psn, Nct and Aph-1.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	109	 These observations argue that GMR to APP to GAL4/UAS to GRIM flies function as reporters of endogenous -secretase activity and that they constitute a sensitized background in which to screen for -secretase regulators and components.

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	118	 We screened the second chromosome using a publicly available  deficiency kit  that contains 85 stocks that in total delete about 80% of this chromosome, which makes up about two-fifths of the Drosophila genome.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Heterozygous deletion-bearing flies were crossed to the reporter flies and progeny bearing the deletion and reporter identified.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	120	 These were then scored for suppression as compared to flies carrying the reporter alone.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Several regions that contained strong suppressor activity were identified (Table 1).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	122	 One of these, at 55A-55F, defined by Df(2R)1547, contains the pen-2 gene (55C1-5) which encodes the fourth component of mammalian and Drosophila -secretase complex.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	123	 A second strong suppressor region was identified at 23A1-C5, as defined by the deficiency Df(2L)90 (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	124	 This region contains aph-1 (23A6).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Df(2L)3910 (23A6-B1) also removes aph-1.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	126	 This deficiency acted as a reporter suppressor, but a much weaker one than Df(2L)90 (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	127	 This suggested that the region deleted by Df(2L)90 contains additional -secretase suppressor loci.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	128	 We used smaller deficiencies in the region to further map the suppressor activity.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Df(2L)97 (23C3 to D2), Df(2L)4954 (23D2 to 23E3) and Df(2L)6875 (23C5 to 23E2) did not suppress the reporter phenotype.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	130	 However, Df(2L)1567, which deletes from 23C1 to E2 and does not overlap with Df(2L)3910, acted as a very strong reporter suppressor (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Df(2L)1567 did not suppress the small eye phenotypes of the two false positive reporter lines, GMR to GRIM and GMR to GAL4, UAS to G/RPR (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Together, these observations place the suppressor in the 23C1 to 3 region.

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Df(2L)3910, a much smaller deficiency that deletes Aph-1, results in weaker suppression (D).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Df(2L)1567, which does not include Aph-1, also results in suppression of the GMR to APP to GAL4, UAS to GRIM small eye phenotype (E).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Df(2L)1567 does not suppress GMR to GRIM (G, cf.

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Together these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the 23C1 to 3 region contains a gene(s) that promotes -secretase activity.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	148	  The above observations are consistent with the hypothesis that this region contains a gene(s) that promote -secretase activity.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	149	 However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the modifier functions instead to regulate the fate of the AICD, to which GAL4 is appended (see also the Discussion below).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	150	 This possibility is not uninteresting.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	151	 AICD has been shown to interact with a number of proteins, and evidence suggests that it can participate in multiple cell-biological processes (reviewed in 9,48).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Once the responsible modifier gene is identified, cell culture-based assays using RNAi interference to follow AICD processing and fate in the absence of this gene (18) will distinguish these possibilities.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	153	Here we described the generation of flies that function as living reporters for APP -secretase activity.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	154	 In these flies, -secretase-dependent cleavage of an APP-tethered transcription factor (a protease substrate), expressed specifically in the developing eye, leads to transcriptional activation of a cell death activator, Grim.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Thus, the levels of endogenous -secretase activity are read out as a function of Grim-dependent cell death, which manifests itself as flies that have decreased eye size.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The Drosophila eye is particularly useful as a screening system for regulators of -secretase activity since its cell population is dominated by neurons, and the eye is dispensable for viability and fertility.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Importantly, the reporter small eye phenotype is easily quantifiable, and is regulated in a dose-dependent manner by modest changes (roughly 2-fold) in the levels of psn, nct and aph-1, which encode known components of the -secretase-containing complex.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Thus, these flies constitute a very sensitized background in which to carry out genetic screens for other regulators of -secretase activity.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	159	It is important to point out that it is not surprising that modest changes in the levels of -secretase components (2-fold reductions associated with heterozygosity) alter the reporter eye phenotype, but have no effect on -secretase-dependent developmental processes in the eye, such as Notch signaling.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Our reporter is specifically designed to be sensitive to, and to be able to report on, levels of -secretase activity within the normal physiologic range.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Thus, the reporter flies have been engineered to display a dominant eye phenotype in response to wild-type levels of -secretase activity.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	162	 This is brought about in several different ways.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	163	 The reporter protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence that is removed cotranslationally, generating a protein that has the N-terminus of ss-secretase-cleaved APP.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Therefore, in contrast to endogenous substrates, the reporter protein does not require -or ss-secretase cleavage in order to become a suitable substrate for -secretase.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	165	 To the extent that these prior cleavage events are rate-limiting, the reporter will become the preferred substrate.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	166	 In addition, in the reporter flies APP to GAL4 is expressed at high levels, probably much higher than those of endogenous -secretase substrates such as Notch.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Therefore, it is likely that the reporter protein becomes, on a molar basis, the dominant substrate.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Finally, the output of our reporter, cell death in the eye, requires GAL4-dependent transcriptional activation from the UAS to GRIM element.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Five optimized GAL4 binding sites are present in this construct (49), thereby conferring a significant level of transcription-dependent amplification.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	170	 In this sensitized background modest changes in the level of -secretase activity brought about by changes in the levels of its components would be expected to result in modification of the eye phenotype.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	171	 In contrast to this engineered situation, heterozygosity for almost all genes in the fly genome (including psn, nct, and aph-1) does not result in observable phenotypes during normal development because the residual 50% gene activity is sufficient to mediate normal signaling within and between cells.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	172	 In other words, endogenous cellular signaling pathways such as Notch are normally buffered against phenotypic variability in response to modest changes in the activity of genes required for Notch processing (reviewed in 50).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	173	The -secretase reporter flies were designed to identify factors that regulate -secretase cleavage.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	174	 However, it is important to note that several other sorts of interesting modifiers may be identified.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	175	 These include factors that influence the stability and subcellular localization of APP to GAL4, AICD and -secretase components.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	176	 They could also include factors that regulate proteolysis of the reporter outside the -secretase target site.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	177	 In particular, regulators of a recently identified -cleavage which is C-terminal to the -cleavage site and is also regulated by Psn (51 to 54) may also be detected.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Many of these factors would be of potential relevance to the understanding of Alzheimer's disease mechanisms.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	179	This reporter has several advantages for conducting genome-wide genetic screens.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	180	 First, the small eye phenotype of the reporter flies acts as a readout of the endogenous, physiological levels of -secretase.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	181	 This stands in contrast to the situation with many eye-based dominant modifier screens, in which the sensitized background results from hyperactivation of a signaling pathway (55).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Thus modification of the reporter small eye phenotype by genetic manipulations or chemical compounds directly reflects modifications of the endogenous, physiologically relevant level of -secretase activity.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Second, this reporter allows us to conduct screens that are focused specifically on identifying genes that regulate cleavage of APP.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	184	 It makes no assumption about the role of psn in -secretase function, and thus constitutes an unbiased approach to identifying factors regulating APP processing.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Again, this stands in contrast to screens focused on identifying genes that use Notch or psn loss-of-function phenotypes during development as a surrogate marker.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Third, the sensitivity of the reporter allows us to conduct F1-dominant modifier screens.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Since a large number of flies can be screened in a short period of time (F1, first generation), this sets the stage for a genome-wide search for mutations affecting -secretase.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Moreover, disruption of one copy of almost all genes in the fly genome leads to flies that are viable and fertile.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Thus, a function of these genes can be tested for even though homozygous deletion of the gene might be lethal earlier in development.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Finally, the reporter flies are also useful for exploring the roles of candidate genes in -secretase regulation.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	191	 In particular, the fact that levels of specific genes in the eyes of reporter flies can be selectively decreased using GMR-RNAi constructs, as illustrated here for nct and aph-1, provides a rapid method to test candidate -secretase regulators in a neural tissue in vivo.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	192	Residue D278 in Drosophila Psn corresponds to one of two evolutionarily conserved aspartate residues located in putative transmembrane domains 6 and 7 (29).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Mutation of either of these conserved residues to alanine in mammalian PS1 creates a protein with dominant negative activity (58).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	194	 We generated a dominant negative version of Drosophila Psn (Psn-D278A) from a psn cDNA, LD25307, obtained from Research Genetics, using the Stratagene QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Psn-D278A was introduced into the GMR vector, generating GMR to Psn to D278A.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	196	GMR-driven nct and aph-1 RNAi constructs were generated following a strategy that results in transcription of sense and antisense strands of a transgene expressed under GMR control (59).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	197	 A similar strategy has been developed to drive double-stranded RNA production under UAS control (60).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	198	 A fragment of Drosophila nct (coding region residues 291 to 696) or aph-1 (coding region amino acid residues 29 to 174) was introduced between two GMR promoter sequences oriented in opposite directions in the vector PCasper, generating GMR-RNAi-nct and GMR-RNAi-aph-1, respectively.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	199	 To ensure that the RNAi effect was specific to the transgene in question, transgenic flies containing GMR to RNAi to nct, which suppresses the small eye phenotype of the GMR to APP to GAL4, UAS to GRIM reporter, were crossed to flies with small eyes due to expression of GMR to GRIM, GMR to REAPER (RPR) or GMR to HID (44,61).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The small eye phenotypes of these flies was not suppressed (data not shown).

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The resulting GMR to APP to GAL4, UAS to GRIM chromosome was balanced over CyO.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	208	 GMR to APP to GAL4, UAS to GRIM flies were crossed into different genetic backgrounds and the appropriate progeny compared with the progeny of GMR to APP to GAL4, UAS to GRIM outcrossed to w1118, the background stock into which the GMR-driven transgenes were introduced.

0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	0	Notch Oncoproteins Depend on -Secretase/Presenilin Activity for Processing and Function* Indranil Das, Colleen Craig, Yasuhiro Funahashi, Kwang-Mook Jung, Tae-Wan Kim, Richard Byers, Andrew P.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Department of Pathology and Obstetrics/Gynecology, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, and the  Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, August 20, 2003 , and in revised form, May 3, 2004.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	3	In vertebrates, full-length Notch proteins are part of a family of four receptors (Notch1 to 4) and five ligands that include members of the Jagged and Delta families.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Notch receptors have an extracellular (EC) domain consisting largely of multiple epidermal growth factor-like repeats within which are binding sites for ligands.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The Notch receptors also have a cytoplasmic region containing the RAM domain, seven ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal PEST domain.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Newly synthesized Notch receptors are processed initially in the trans-Golgi by a furin-like convertase, generating a ligand binding ectodomain and a transmembrane signaling domain that remain associated during transport to the plasma membrane (6 to 8).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Ligand binding to the ectodomain induces several successive proteolytic cleavage events in the transmembrane subunit that result in release of its intracellular domain from the cell membrane.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	8	 An initial cleavage by ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease)-type metalloproteases occurs just external to the transmembrane (TM) domain (9, 10) and serves to facilitate additional cleavages by -secretases/presenilins within the TM domain (11).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Mammalian presenilins (PS-1 and PS-2), are polytopic membrane proteins that appear to function as aspartyl proteases within a high molecular mass multiprotein complex that also includes the proteins nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 (12 to 15).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Presenilins provide the active site of the -secretase proteolytic activity (16).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	11	Presenilin-mediated cleavage is involved in activation of all four mammalian Notch receptors (17, 18), and in the case of Notch1, it occurs at several sites within the TM domain (19).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Notch1 cleavage is prevented by the addition of -secretase inhibitors or mutations within critical aspartate residues of presenilin (20, 21).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Delta-1-induced signaling through Notch1 is also reduced in cells deficient in presenilins or in cells treated with -secretase inhibitors (21 to 23).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Presenilins have recently been recognized as having multiple substrates in addition to Notch, including -amyloid precursor protein, ErbB4, N- and E-cadherins, and CD44 (24 to 28).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Presenilins are necessary, after ectodomain shedding, for the cleavage and subsequent nuclear translocation of the intracellular domains of each of these polypeptides (11, 25, 27 to 29).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In the case of Notch, presenilin-mediated cleavage allows the Notch intracellular domain (IC) to gain access to the nucleus, where it binds the transcription factor CBF1/CSL.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This binding event converts CSL from a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator, leading to expression of target genes (30).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	18	Notch signaling is normally activated by the interaction of a Notch receptor with ligand expressed on an adjacent cell.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Truncated forms of Notch containing deletions spanning most, or all, of the EC domain bypass the need for ligand binding and signal constitutively.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Two such Notch deletions, involving mouse Notch4 and human Notch1 (initially named TAN-1 for translocation-associated Notch homolog-1), were originally identified as oncogenes.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The int-3 oncogene, which we refer to as Notch4/int-3, arises from retroviral integration of the mouse mammary tumor virus into the Notch4 locus and causes murine mammary tumors (31 to 33).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In all cases, viral integration results in the production of a truncated transcript that encodes both the TM and the IC domain of Notch4 (see Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In a similar fashion, the TAN-1 oncogene associated with T-ALL is generated from a truncation in human Notch1 caused by a recurrent (7, 9) chromosomal translocation involving the Notch1 gene and the T cell receptor gene (34).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	24	 All breakpoints identified to date occur within the intron just prior to the exon encoding the 34th epidermal growth factor repeat and result in fusion of the 3'-end of Notch1 to T cell receptor promoter/enhancer elements.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The fusion gene drives expression of multiple truncated mRNAs that encode a series of N-terminally truncated TAN-1 polypeptides ranging in size from slightly larger to slightly smaller than the normal Notch1 transmembrane subunit (35).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The precise structure and origin of these polypeptides have not been defined.

0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Model for Notch processing and signaling.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Ligand binding of full-length Notch may induce structural changes that allow tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE) and presenilin cleavage and the release of NotchIC from the membrane.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Notch4/int-3 lacks most of the ectodomain but is inserted into membranes and traffics to the cell surface where it is cleaved readily by presenilins.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Blockade of presenilin-mediated activity can inhibit signal induction through both Notch4/int-3 and FL-Notch.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	32	 TAN-1 polypeptides demonstrate partial dependence on presenilins.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Like Notch4/int-3, some TAN-1 polypeptides are inserted into membranes and depend on proteolytic cleavage by presenilins (mTAN-1); some TAN-1 polypeptides, however, may not be localized to the cell surface and are targeted to the nucleus in a presenilin-independent manner (cTAN-1).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	34	  To understand the mechanism of action and activities of Notch, engineered Notch proteins that are constitutively active have been studied.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	35	 These engineered Notch proteins include forms either consisting of only the IC, or the IC linked to the TM domain, a small portion of the EC domain, and the leader peptide (NotchE).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Both of these forms are active in a variety of assays and are oncogenic (36 to 38), but only NotchE depends on presenilin for activity (18, 39).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	37	 For instance, pharmacologic inhibition of presenilin suppresses the growth of Notch1E-induced T-ALLs, but not T-ALLs induced by the Notch1 IC domain (N1IC) (40).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	38	In this study, we asked whether Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1, oncogenic forms of Notch proteins, require presenilins for proper processing, signaling function, and activity.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Based on the known sites of truncation within the Notch1 and Notch4 genes during their oncogenic conversion, both TAN-1 and Notch4/int-3 are predicted to encode proteins including TM domains, but lacking signal peptides.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	40	 It was thus unclear whether these oncoproteins would insert into membranes and require presenilin activity for activation.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	41	Our results show that both Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 are targeted to the membrane and are subject to presenilin-mediated proteolytic processing.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Notch4/int-3 requires presenilin activity for CSL-mediated signaling and biological activity in endothelial cells.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	43	 TAN-1, however, demonstrates only partial dependence on presenilin activity.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Although blockade of presenilin function alters TAN-1 processing, it does not affect the growth of T-ALL cells, apparently because some TAN-1 polypeptides bypass the requirement for presenilin processing for nuclear access.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The finding that some oncogenic forms of Notch depend on presenilin activity for function suggests potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.

0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	64	 SUPT1 cells (expressing TAN-1) and transfected HeLa cells were treated  plus or minus  CpdE 16 h prior to harvest.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	65	 SUPT1 cells and transfected HeLa cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then labeled with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4  degrees C.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Biotin was quenched with phosphate-buffered saline and glycine, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline.

0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Transfected HeLa cells (A) or SUPT1 cells (B) incubated with or without CpdE for 16 h were treated with membrane-impermeable biotin to label cell surface proteins.

0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Proteins bound to beads (Mem) and whole cell lysates (CL) were analyzed by Western blot for the indicated proteins.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	194	 An antibody to 1-integrin was used as a control, demonstrating that CpdE did not nonspecifically affect membrane protein levels.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	195	 An antibody to glycogen synthetase kinase-3 (GSK-3) was used as a cytosolic protein control.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	196	  Normal Notch polypeptides associate with presenilin early in the secretory pathway within the Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum and then move to the cell surface (51).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	197	 We found that HeLa cells express both PS-1 and PS-2, whereas SUPT1 cells express only PS-1 (Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	198	 4, A and B, and data not shown).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	199	 In both cell lines, presenilins were present at the cell surface, based on their susceptibility to biotinylation (Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	200	If cleavage of Notch oncoproteins by presenilins occurs at the cell surface, then one may expect that inhibition of -secretase/presenilin activity would alter the membrane-bound forms of these proteins by preventing their cleavage.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Analysis was performed by treating cells with CpdE to examine the effects on membrane expression of the truncated Notch proteins.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The cell surface expression level of Notch4/int-3 proteins in transfected HeLa cells was increased noticeably after CpdE treatment (Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Similarly, CpdE treatment of SUPT1 cells led to a dramatic increase in the levels of a specific TAN-1 polypeptide at the cell surface (Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	204	 CpdE did not nonspecifically alter the expression of cell surface proteins because 1-integrin levels at the membrane were similar before and after CpdE treatment.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Thus, presenilin inhibition causes the cell surface accumulation of Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 polypeptides that presumably represent presenilin substrates.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	206	Differential Biological Effects of Notch Oncoproteins Are Observed after -Secretase Inhibition We next asked whether inhibition of -secretase/presenilin activity would abrogate the biological activity of Notch4/int-3 proteins in an in vitro angiogenesis assay and through TAN-1 proteins in a growth inhibition assay of SUPT1 cells.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Recent studies indicate that Notch signaling is involved in endothelial cell development and angiogenesis (42, 52 to 54).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Several in vitro assays have been developed that demonstrate a role for Notch signaling during angiogenesis.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	209	2 In a three-dimensional collagen gel bioassay, expression of Notch4/int-3 in HUVEC induces endothelial cell sprouts (Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	210	 These results help define the potential roles for Notch4 signaling in angiogenesis.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Treatment with the presenilin inhibitor, CpdE, caused a dramatic decrease in HUVEC sprouting (Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	212	 5B), indicating that this Notch4/int-3 activity is dependent on presenilin-mediated cleavage.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	213	 The specificity of CpdE activity on membrane-bound Notch is apparent because we have also used an endothelial tube formation culture assay in which Notch4/int-3 and N1IC both inhibited endothelial tube formation, but in which CpdE relieved the block in tube formation caused by Notch4/int-3 but not by N1IC (data not shown).

0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	224	  Constitutive Notch1 signaling induces the appearance of T cell lymphoblastic neoplasms (T-ALL) (37, 55) that require sustained Notch1 signaling for growth and survival (40).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	225	 In murine T-ALL cell lines transformed by Notch1E, which require presenilin cleavage for nuclear access, treatment with CpdE led to growth arrest and apoptosis of these cells (40).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Similarly, dominant-negative inhibitors of the CSL/N1IC nuclear complex cause G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of SUPT1 cells (40), indicating that nuclear Notch1 is also needed for growth and survival of human T-ALL cells.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Despite this requirement, treatment of SUPT1 cells for up to 7 days with 5  microM CpdE had no effect on growth, as assessed by cell number (not shown) or cell cycle analysis (Fig.

0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	230	 SUPT1 cells cultured for 4 days with the indicated doses of CpdE or drug carrier (Me2SO) were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed for cell cycle fractions as described under "Experimental Procedures.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	231	  These observations, together with the Western blot data shown in Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	232	 3C, suggest only a partial requirement for -secretase/presenilin activity for TAN-1 polypeptides to enter the nucleus.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	233	 To study the extent to which nuclear access of TAN-1 polypeptides is -secretase/presenilin-dependent, SUPT1 cells treated with CpdE or carrier were immunostained with an antibody specific for a C-terminal portion of the intracellular domain of Notch1 (anti-TC) (Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was observed in the absence of drug (Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	235	 7A), but nuclear staining was decreased preferentially by treatment with CpdE (Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	236	 This was documented further by analysis of anti-Notch1IC (TC) staining in control and treated SUPT1 cells with a spectral imager, which confirmed a substantial redistribution of TAN-1 polypeptides from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of cells treated with CpdE (Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	237	 In contrast, the distribution and intensity of anti-Notch1IC (TC) staining was unchanged in CpdE-treated Jurkat cells, a control T cell leukemia cell line that expresses normal Notch1 polypeptides at modest levels (Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	238	 These data are consistent with the existence of two pools of TAN-1 polypeptides, a major pool dependent on -secretase/presenilin for nuclear access, and a minor pool that can access the nucleus in a -secretase/presenilin-independent fashion (see Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Support for the existence of the latter type of TAN-1 polypeptide is seen in Western blots (Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	240	 3C), in which one TAN-1 polypeptide of slightly smaller size than the membrane-associated presenilin-sensitive polypeptides is unaffected by drug treatment.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	241	 This polypeptide also fails to appear at the cell surface (Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	242	 4B), presumably because it lacks a TM domain, and thus would not be expected to require -secretase/presenilin activity for processing and nuclear access.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	243	 This same TAN-1 polypeptide may generate sufficient constitutive Notch activity to maintain the growth of SUPT1 cells in the presence of -secretase/presenilin blockade.

0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	250	Membrane Targeting of Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 Presenilins and Notch interact early in the secretory pathway within the Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum (51), even with Notch constructs devoid of most of the EC domain (50, 51).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Perhaps this association promotes membrane insertion of truncated Notch polypeptides lacking signal peptides but retaining TM domains.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	252	 After insertion, truncated Notch would be competent for transport to the cell surface as part of a complex containing presenilin.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	253	 This is consistent with coimmunoprecipitation experiments showing that most Notch proteins targeted to the membrane are associated with presenilin (50).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Presenilins are expressed at the membrane in a biologically active complex with nicastrin (15, 56), and membrane-tethered Notch has also been observed in a complex with nicastrin (14).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Thus, it is possible that the affinity between Notch and presenilin and/or nicastrin mediates the localization of Notch oncoproteins to the cell surface.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	256	The idea that presenilins assist in the cell surface targeting of Notch is supported by studies on the role of presenilins in the trafficking of -amyloid precursor protein (APP) (56, 57).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Aberrant processing of -amyloid precursor protein by presenilin is associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	258	 In addition to this role, presenilins are also necessary in the trafficking of -amyloid precursor protein from the trans-Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (57) and from the cell surface to endosomes (56).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Additionally, presenilins are required for the proper maturation and trafficking of nicastrin to the cell membrane (58 to 60).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Presenilins may serve a similar function in the trafficking of Notch.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Such a function would be independent of proteolytic activity because mutations of critical aspartate residues abrogate the proteolytic activity of presenilin without affecting trafficking of Notch to the cell surface (21).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	262	Differential Effects of Presenilin Inhibitor on Biological Activity Mediated through TAN-1 and Notch4/int-3 Although Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 polypeptides both exhibit altered proteolytic processing and accumulate at the cell surface when presenilin activity is blocked, -secretase/presenilin inhibition yields different effects on the biological activity of these oncoproteins.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	263	 The biological activity of Notch4/int-3 was examined in a bioassay established to detect endothelial sprouting from HUVEC.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Notch4/int-3 induced a strong sprouting response in this assay, demonstrating a role for Notch4 signaling in the initial processes of angiogenesis, an effect that was almost completely inhibited by a -secretase/presenilin inhibitor.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	265	 These studies suggest that blockade of presenilin activity may be a means of inhibiting Notch-mediated angiogenesis, which could be a useful tool in regulating tumor-associated angiogenesis.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	266	The biological activity of TAN-1 was studied in a growth assay of SUPT1 cells, which have two truncated and no normal Notch1 genes.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	267	 SUPT1 cells contain increased levels of nuclear Notch1 and required persistent Notch1 signaling for growth, based on the effect of dominant-negative inhibitors of N1IC/CSL function (40).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	268	 However, SUPT1 cell growth is unaffected by CpdE, despite evidence of altered TAN-1 processing and accumulation of TAN-1 polypeptides at the cell surface.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	269	 The unresponsiveness of SUPT1 cells may be the result of the expression of TAN-1 polypeptides that are not dependent on presenilin-mediated proteolysis for nuclear access.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Specifically, the smallest TAN-1 polypeptide detected in SUPT1 whole cell lysates was unaltered by CpdE (Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	271	 This polypeptide may arise from a cryptic translational start site downstream of the region encoding the extracellular domain.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Such aberrant initiation codons have been demonstrated within the TM domains of murine Notch1 (61) and feline Notch2 (62).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Whether such sites are purely pathophysiologic or utilized under some normal circumstances is unknown.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	274	 We hypothesize that this TAN-1 polypeptide accesses the nucleus in a presenilin-independent fashion, accounting for the refractoriness of SUPT1 cells to presenilin blockade.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	275	Model for Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 Cleavage by Presenilins  Our studies are consistent with current models for Notch processing and activation (9, 63) illustrated in Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	276	 These models propose that the Notch receptor is normally inhibited from proteolytic processing because of conformational constraints imposed by the EC domain.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Ligand binding may induce structural changes that allow for proteolytic cleavage by TACE (tumor necrosis-alpha-converting enzyme) and other metalloproteases and the consequent shedding of most of the EC domain.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	278	 This then enables the subsequent proteolysis mediated by presenilins.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Gain of function mutations of Notch could either act independently of presenilin or function only after presenilin-mediated cleavage.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Our studies indicate that there are both presenilin-dependent and -independent forms of the TAN-1 oncoproteins.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	281	It is still controversial whether presenilins recognize a specific consensus sequence within Notch that is required for its cleavage.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	282	 All four Notch receptors are cleaved by presenilin at a conserved valine within the TM domain, and mutation of this valine residue within Notch1 and Notch4 greatly reduces the efficiency of cleavage (18).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	283	 However, Notch cleavage is also observed at another site within the TM domain N-terminal to the conserved valine (19).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Additionally, studies in Drosophila show that it is the size of the Notch EC domain that is critical to whether presenilin can cleave, such that the shorter the EC domain the more efficient the cleavage (63).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	285	 This lack of cleavage site specificity was also observed for other substrates and suggests that presenilins may serve a general role in facilitating the cleavage of particular single-pass TM proteins with short EC domains.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	286	Notch Oncoproteins and Cancer N-terminal truncations within the Notch proteins can lead to oncogenic gain of function phenotypes.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Such truncations are observed in human T-ALLs with chromosomal translocations of Notch1, or in T-ALLs in mice and cats with proviral insertions into Notch1 (64), or Notch2 (65), respectively, and in murine mammary tumors with proviral insertions into Notch4 (33, 66).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Interestingly, various human tumor cell lines exhibit up-regulation of a RNA species encoding for a truncated form of Notch4 that also has transforming potential (67).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	289	 From our studies, one might predict that regulation of presenilin-mediated proteolysis and subsequent activation of these Notch oncoproteins is dependent upon whether the protein encodes for the TM domain.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	290	In tumors driven by Notch oncoproteins containing the TM domain, -secretase/presenilin inhibitors may be an effective therapy.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	291	 The Notch4/int-3 oncoprotein is a potent mammary oncogene that is dependent on presenilin for signal activation and function.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	292	 In addition, ligand-dependent signaling through full-length Notch receptors may also be important in some neoplasms.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	293	 For example, ligand-dependent activation of full-length Notch receptors contributes to the growth of Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma cell lines (68).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Many neoplasms express one or more Notch receptors, but reliable means of measuring Notch activation, which can be mediated by very low levels of nuclear Notch, are not readily available.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Presenilin inhibitors may be generally useful tools in evaluating the role of Notch signaling in various neoplasms.

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	7	Molecular epidemiologic studies have presented seemingly contradictory results concerning a potential role of CTSD polymorphism in Alzheimer s disease (6 to 19).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	8	 There is also controversy on whether this polymorphism may interact with the apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4), which is the best known genetic determinant for sporadic Alzhei-mer s disease (20).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Single studies may have been underpowered to detect interactions or even overall effects.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Given the amount of accumulated data, we deemed it important to perform a quantitative synthesis of the evidence using rigorous methods.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Thus, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of all available studies relating the CTSD polymorphism to the risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	12	Case-control studies were eligible if they had determined the distribution of CTSD genotypes in Alzheimer s disease cases (regardless of age of onset) and in a concurrent control group of dementia-free subjects using a molecular method for genotyping.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Cases with Alzheimer s disease were eligible regardless of whether they had a family history of Alzhei-mer s disease or not.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	14	 However, we excluded family-based studies of pedigrees with several affected cases per family, because their analysis is based on linkage considerations.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	15	Data extraction Two investigators independently extracted data and reached consensus on all items.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The following information was sought from each report: authors, journal and year of publication, country of origin, selection and characteristics of Alzheimer s disease cases and controls, demographics, ethnic group of the study population, eligible and genotyped cases and controls, and number of cases and controls for each CTSD genotype.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	17	 For studies including subjects of different ethnic groups, data were extracted separately for each ethnicity, whenever possible.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Furthermore, we examined whether matching had been used, whether there was specific mention of blinding of the personnel who performed the genotyping to the clinical status of the subjects, and whether the genotyping method had been validated.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	19	Meta-analysis The primary analysis compared Alzheimer s disease cases with controls for the contrast of T versus C alleles.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This analysis aims to detect overall differences.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	21	 We also examined the contrast of extremes (homozygotes), T/T versus C/C.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Finally, we examined the contrast of T/T versus (C/T + C/C) and the contrast of (C/T + T/T) versus C/C.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These contrasts correspond to the recessive and dominant effects, respectively, of the T allele.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	24	The odds ratio was used as the metric of choice.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	25	 For each genetic contrast, we estimated the between-study heterogeneity across all eligible comparisons using the chi-square-based Q statistic (36).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Heterogeneity was considered significant for p  <  0.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Data were combined using both fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) and random-effects (DerSimonian and Laird) models (37).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Random effects incorporate an estimate of the between-study variance and tend to provide wider confidence intervals, when the results of the constituent studies differ among themselves.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In the absence of between-study heterogeneity, the two methods provide identical results.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Random effects are more appropriate when heterogeneity is present (37).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	31	We also performed cumulative meta-analysis (38) and recursive cumulative meta-analysis (39, 40) to evaluate whether the summary odds ratio for the T versus C contrast changed over time as more data accumulated and whether the strength of the association changed when the first hypothesis-generating study was excluded from the calculations (41).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Inverted funnel plots and the Begg-Mazumdar publication bias diagnostic (nonparametric correlation coefficient) (42) evaluated whether the magnitude of the observed association was related to the variance of each study, that is, whether large studies gave different results compared with smaller ones (43).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Finally, we evaluated whether the summary results were different when the analysis was limited to studies with more intensive efforts to exclude Alzheimer s disease from controls (those that clearly performed neuropsychological testing for all controls).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	34	Previous investigations have alluded to the possibility that the T allele may interact with the APOE*4 allele in conferring susceptibility to Alzheimer s disease (7, 9).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Thus, we also evaluated the effect of T allele carriage on the risk of Alzheimer s disease separately for APOE*4-positive and APOE*4-negative subjects.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Moreover, we evaluated the genetic effect conferred by the presence of APOE*4 separately in subjects carrying the T allele and those not carrying the T allele.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Odds ratios were combined with fixed and random effects models, as described above.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	38	 When these data were not reported, we communicated with the primary investigators to obtain this information, whenever possible.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	39	Analyses were performed with SPSS 11.

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Only one study (7) specifically mentioned blinding of the personnel who performed the genotyping.

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	47	 All studies used polymerase chain reaction, and two studies (14, 18) also used dynamic allele-specific hybridization.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	48	Meta-analysis database The eligible studies summarized in table 2 included a total of 3,175 cases with Alzheimer s disease and 3,334 controls, of whom 3,174 and 3,298, respectively, had genotype data.

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Overall, the prevalence of T/T homozygosity was 0.

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The respective prevalence rates of C/T heterozygosity were 16.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	61	5 percent, and the respective rates for C/C homozygosity were 83.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The distribution of genotypes in control groups was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all studies.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Distribution of CTSD alleles among Alzheimer s disease cases and controls in the included studies   Overall effects There was a trend suggesting that the T allele may confer increased susceptibility to Alzheimer s disease (figure 1).

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	65	14), and there was significant heterogeneity among the 16 study comparisons (p  <  0.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	66	 We found no evidence of an association of the T/T genotype with the risk of Alzheimer s disease relative to the C/C genotype.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	67	 There was no significant between-study heterogeneity.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	68	 No evidence of an association with Alzhei-mer s disease was discerned also when the recessive model was examined for the effect of T, while a trend for an association was seen in the dominant model (by random effects, OR = 1.

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	103	 It should be noted that it is not clear whether the CTSD polymorphism has functional consequences for the mature form of the enzyme.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Although we cannot exclude a biologic effect for the CTSD polymorphism, our findings are in accordance with the results of a recent full genome scan showing no significant linkage of Alzheimer s disease to the short arm of chromosome 11, the region where the CTSD gene is located (45 to 47).

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	4	Received for publication, April 30, 2004 , and in revised form, June 22, 2004.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	5	It is now widely accepted that PS1 and PS2 are the catalytic components of the -secretase complex, which appears to be an aspartyl protease whose activity resides at the interface between two presenilin fragments, the N-terminal (NTF) and the C-terminal (CTF) fragments (13, 14).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The NTF and CTF presenilin moieties are most probably produced by autocatalytic presenilinase activity and are more stable than the PS holoprotein (15, 16).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	7	 NTF and CTF heterodimerize with a 1:1 stoichiometry within the -secretase complex (17, 18), a complex that also contains nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 at an as yet undetermined stoichiometry (2, 19, 20).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	8	A new view of the -secretase complex was put forward by our group and others, providing evidence that the functional -secretase core contains two presenilin molecules (26, 41 to 43) and that presenilin FAD mutants may produce subtle alterations in presenilin dimerization and hence alter -secretase tertiary and quaternary structure (41).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In this report, we demonstrate that the hydrophobic transmembrane regions of presenilin contribute to the interactions within the dimer and that alterations of the dimer not related to the catalytic site, such as that affecting the HL1 domain, impair -secretase function.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In addition, by reconstituting -secretase activity from two catalytically inactive presenilin aspartic mutants, we demonstrate that a functional diaspartyl catalytic group is formed at the interface of the NTF and CTF moieties from two different presenilin molecules.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	11	To generate the constructs to be expressed in SL2 cells, an in-frame fusion containing an HA N-terminal tagged Drosophila presenilin (H-A-Psn) in pACT-2 (pACT-Psn) was subcloned into the expression vector pActPPA (kindly provided by Dr.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Vaquero) to drive the expression of HA-PSN from a Drosophila actin 5C expression cassette.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	13	 For the expression constructs bearing the N-terminal c-Myc-tagged Psn, a forward strand oligonucleotide (5'-CATGGAGGAACAAAAGCTGATTTCTGAAGAAGACTTGG-3') and its complementary reverse strand oligonucleotide (5'-AATTCCAAGTCTTCTTCAGAAATCAGCTTTTGTTCCTC-3'), coding for the c-Myc epitope, were annealed and cloned into the NcoI and EcoRI sites of pAS2 to 1-Psn.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The entire c-Myc-Psn fusion was subcloned into pActPPA expression vector.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The aspartic mutant PSNs were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the Psn template as described elsewhere (45).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	16	 For the in-frame substitution of HL1 (amino acids 123 to 154) by HL5 (amino acids 261 to 267), a two-step cloning strategy was used.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	101	  In our previous work, we proposed that HL1 played an important role in dimer formation and, probably, in the conformation of the presenilin -secretase complex due to homomeric protein/protein interactions mediated by this domain.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In support of this, 14 of the 145 mutations in PS1 and PS2 cluster in this 32-amino acid loop, and all of the FAD mutations that we analyzed altered HL1/HL1 dimerization (41).

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	104	 1, A and B, suggested that the region comprising the N terminus-TMI-HL1-TMII domains was not required for NTF/NTF or NTF/CTF interactions, given that its deletion did not affect the strength of the NTF/NTF or NTF/CTF interactions compared with that of wild-type fragments (as assessed semiquantitatively by growth on selective medium).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	105	 To further address the role of HL1 in NTF/NTF homodimerization, we undertook a new series of experiments to analyze whether the NTF/NTF interaction and dimerization would be altered when the HL1 loop sequence was substituted by another connecting loop so that the topology and relative position of all transmembrane domains were still maintained.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	106	 To this end, we generated an NTF variant, named NTF1 to 5, in which HL1 (amino acids 123 to 154 of PSN) was replaced by HL5, a shorter ER-facing connecting loop peptide of PSN (amino acids 261 to 267 of PSN).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	107	 This in-frame substitution did not alter the number of transmembranes or the connecting loops, and the general NTF topology should be preserved.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	108	 To directly test NTF/NTF interaction in the membrane, we again resorted to the split ubiquitin system, which we had previously shown allowed presenilin to be properly anchored in the membrane.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	110	 According to these results, replacement of HL1 increases the strength of the NTF/NTF interaction, thus confirming the contribution of other domains to the formation and stability of the dimer and indicating that the HL1 may have a modulatory role on NTF/NTF interaction and thus in presenilin dimerization.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	111	 In contrast, none of the hydrophilic domains of the CTF domain seemed to be a determinant for any structural interactions, since they could be deleted without affecting CTF/CTF or NTF/CTF interactions (Fig.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Immunodetection of lysates from stably transfected cells using an anti-HA antibody showed that the PSNHL1 to 5 holoprotein was more stable over time than the wtPSN holoprotein (Fig.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	133	 We then analyzed the production of AICD by performing a quantitative assay based on a -galactosidase reporter system activated by substrate cleavage (47).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	134	 We chose to assay -secretase activity by using reporter-based assays, since they are widely used to monitor signaling pathways mediated by cleavage in Drosophila, are highly sensitive, and can be easily quantified.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	138	 This dsRNA was co-transfected along with the assay constructs in order to specifically knock-down endogenous PSN without altering the levels of the tagged exogenous PSN expression (as confirmed by Western blot analysis; data not shown).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Treatment with dsRNA targeting the endogenous presenilin produced a significant decrease in -galactosidase activity in stably vector-transfected cells, whereas the -galactosidase activity of the stably wtPSN-transfected cells remained unaltered (data not shown).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	140	 To assess whether the 5'-UTR-3'-UTR dsRNA reduced cleavage at the -site of the C99 substrate by the endogenous presenilin and therefore decreased A production, SL2 cells were transiently transfected with an SC100 construct encoding the C99 substrate (48) along with dsRNA.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Forty-eight hours post-transfection, medium was replaced to quantify de novo produced A peptides after RNAi treatment.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	142	 The production of A40 and A42 peptides was clearly reduced after dsRNA treatment (Fig.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Interestingly, the dsRNA treatment did not alter the production of the A42 peptide relative to total A, and thus, the A40/42 ratio remained unaffected in dsRNA-treated cells (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	145	 This decrease in the endogenous presenilin activity (as measured by A production) correlated with the accumulation of -CTF stubs generated by -secretase cleavage (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	146	 These results further confirmed the efficiency of the dsRNA interference, and thus, from here on, all experiments were performed in dsRNA-treated cells.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The -galactosidase activity, which measured AICD production (-cleavage), was obtained in mutant stably transfected cells and compared with that of wtPSN (which was considered 100%).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Remarkably, the -secretase activity in PSNHL1 to 5 stable cell lines, assessed on the C99-GVP substrate, was completely abolished, yielding values similar to those of the TMVII aspartic mutant presenilin, PSND461A (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	160	 This result showed that HL1 appears to be essential for the -cleavage of APP and, consequently, for AICD production.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	161	 We next tested whether the PSNHL1 to 5 mutant cleaved the APP-derived substrate to produce the A40 and A42 peptides (-cleavage).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Stable cell lines expressing different presenilin variants were transiently transfected with the SC100 construct, and A production in the cell medium was subsequently analyzed.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	165	 These results demonstrate that the HL1 of PSN is required for both - and -cleavages of APP.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	166	We then examined the ability of PSNHL1 to 5 to cleave a Notch substrate at the S3 site by using the same reporter-based strategy.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	167	 A Drosophila Notch-derived substrate lacking the extracellular domain (NECN) and fused to the transcription factor Gal4Vp16, NECN-GVP, was co-transfected with the aforementioned reporter constructs in SL2 cells.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Altogether, these results confirmed that indeed the HL1 domain plays a modulating role in the presenilin dimerization and showed that substitution of HL1 by another connecting domain resulted in a complete loss of -secretase function concerning presenilinase activity, the - and -cleavages of APP, as well as the S3 cleavage of Notch, without affecting PSN stability.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Statistical significance according to the U-Mann Whitney Test was as follows: *, p  <  0.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	183	  We designed an experimental approach based on genetic complementation between two different aspartic mutants to assess whether the TMVI aspartic residue (Asp279 in Drosophila PSN/Asp257 in human PS1) from one monomer formed a functional diaspartyl group with the TMVII aspartic residue (Asp461 in Drosophila PSN/Asp385 in human PS1) from the other.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	184	 If this were the case, we should be able to reconstitute -secretase activity from the two catalytically inactive aspartic mutants, thus providing further evidence that presenilins functions as a dimer in vivo and that at least two aspartic residues are required.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	185	 To our knowledge, this possibility has not been formally tested before.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	186	 We constructed a double cassette expression plasmid to stably co-express two presenilin mutants, HA-PSND279A and c-Myc-PSND461A, in SL2 cells.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	187	 To assess -secretase activity, we analyzed the production of AICD, A, and NICD using the corresponding substrates.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	188	 In cells stably expressing both PSN mutants, we predicted the formation of three different complexes: the inactive homodimers containing the same mutation and thus containing either two 461 or two 279 aspartic residues (HA-PSND279A/HA-PSND279A and Myc-PSND461A/Myc-PSND461A, respectively) and the heterodimeric complex with one aspartic 461 and one aspartic 279 (HA-PSND279A/Myc-PSND461A), at a 1:1:2 ratio.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	189	 If a functional catalytic site were formed between the two mutant monomers, we would expect that the presenilin heterodimer PSND279A/PSND461A would produce one or more of the presenilin-dependent cleavage products (AICD, NICD, and A40/42).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	190	We first analyzed the expression levels of different presenilin mutants in stably transfected SL2 cells.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Western blot analyses of cell lysates showed high levels of expression of the HA-tagged (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	192	 4B, left) and the Myc-tagged presenilins (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	193	 4B, right), even when co-expressed.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	194	 In contrast to cells co-expressing HA-wtPSN and c-Myc-wtPSN, no presenilinase activity was detected when the HA-PSND279A and c-Myc-PSND461A mutants were co-expressed (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Thus, no presenilinase activity was reconstituted, and only mutant presenilin holoproteins could assemble at the dimer core of the -secretase complex in these cells.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	196	To evaluate the production of AICD generated by the -cleavage activity, stable cell lines were co-transfected with the C99-GVP substrate and the corresponding reporter constructs.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Interestingly, we observed that, in contrast to the -galactosidase activities of the single and double aspartic D279A and D461A mutants, co-expression of both single mutant presenilins resulted in a significantly higher -secretase activity (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	198	 4C), amounting to 50% of the wild-type presenilin value.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	199	 This result shows that co-expression of the two mutants, PSND279A and PSND461A, restores AICD production, providing strong evidence that an active catalytic site is formed between the NTF and the CTF aspartics from different presenilins within the same complex.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Similarly, the production of A40/42 from the C99 substrate was determined.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Again, and in contrast to the abolition of A40 and A42 production in cells expressing only one single (either PSND279A or PSND461A) or double (PSND279A+D461A) aspartic mutants, coexpression of the two PSN mutants restored the production of the A40 and A42 to the same level as endogenous PSN in cells untreated with dsRNA (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	202	 4D), around 25 to 30% of that achieved by overexpression of wtPSN.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Furthermore, the A40/42 ratio in cells expressing the combination of both aspartic mutants was similar to that of wtPSN (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The rescue of -secretase activity due to the co-expression of the two aspartic mutants was further confirmed by a significant reduction of -CTFs levels in these cells compared with cells expressing each mutant, PSND279A and PSND461A, alone (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Note the statistical significance of the decrease in the -CTF levels when co-expressing the two mutants (lane 5), compared with those of the single or double mutants expressed on their own (lanes 2 to 4, which were not statistically different among them).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	206	To assess S3 cleavage, we performed a similar series of experiments with the NECN-GVP substrate.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Remarkably, and in contrast to the APP-derived C99 substrate, the co-expression of the PSND279A and PSND461A mutants did not restore NICD production (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	208	 In fact, the null values obtained were comparable with those for the single PSND461A mutant.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Taken together, these results indicate that the functional diaspartyl group formed between the NTF and CTF from two different presenilins restore -secretase activity, at least to mediate and cleavages of C99, but also that this diaspartyl group may display substrate specificity, since it is able to discriminate between the two substrates, C99 and NECN.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	210	Evidence for presenilin dimerization was first gathered from yeast two-hybrid assays, which mostly assessed the ability of hydrophilic domains and large presenilin fragments to selfassociate (41, 42).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Nonetheless, exhaustive analysis of in situ interactions performed in membrane-anchored presenilin domains to study the contribution of the hydrophobic transmembranes to dimerization was missing.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The split ubiquitin system (44) allowed us to design a test for assaying different combinations of TM regions, grouped by even numbers in order to preserve the general presenilin topology and the cytosolic/lumen direction of the domains.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Our results show that presenilin transmembrane domains are relevant for interactions within the NTF/NTF, CTF/CTF, and NTF/CTF dimers, either for assembly or stabilization, and therefore for the maintenance of the tertiary and quaternary presenilin structure.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	214	 In this context, the fact that the hydrophobic domains are the most evolutionarily conserved presenilin regions and that FAD mutations are mainly concentrated on these transmembrane domains indicate that even conservative changes may cause subtle disturbances in dimerization and final quaternary structure, which are then reflected in shifts of the substrate cleavage sites.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	215	Previous results from our group showed that the HL1 domain (the hydrophilic loop connecting TMI and TMII) from two NTFs interacted and were involved in NTF/NTF homodimerization (41).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	216	 In addition to being the largest ER-facing loop, the highly evolutionarily conserved HL1 domain is the presenilin hydrophilic region that clusters the highest number of FAD mutations.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Remarkably, the FAD mutations analyzed altered the formation of the HL1 HL1 complex (41).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	218	 The substitution of this domain increased NTF/NTF interaction, thus indicating that, more than being a requirement for interaction, it may rather play a modulatory role in dimerization as a means to achieve a correct presenilin tertiary or quaternary structure.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	219	 We therefore focused on this domain to assess its contribution to presenilin structure and function.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Interestingly, substitution of HL1 for another ER-hydrophilic connecting loop, HL5, which presumably generates a topologically equivalent presenilin protein, totally inhibited presenilinase activity.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	221	 In addition, production of AICD, A, and NICD was completely absent in cells expressing this PSN variant.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	222	 This abrogation of presenilinase and -secretase activities was not due to increased presenilin instability, since the PSNHL1 to 5 mutant holoprotein was still detected after 10 h of cycloheximide treatment, thus proving to be much more stable than the wtPSN holoprotein.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the inhibition of the -secretase activity in this PSN mutant is a secondary effect of the lack of presenilin endoproteolysis, we do not favor this explanation, since presenilinase and -secretase activities do not necessarily correlate (30, 57).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Another presenilin variant lacking HL1 has been analyzed.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The TM1 to 2 PS1 mutant (with a deletion comprising the TMI-HL1-TMII regions) was able to generate the A peptides (30), although the maturation and trafficking of the -secretase complex components were highly altered.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	226	 A similar effect of our PSNHL1 to 5 mutant could be assumed.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	227	 However, we deem it unlikely, since the presenilin transmembrane regions, integrally maintained in the PSNHL1 to 5 but not in the TM1 to 2 mutant, mediate the interactions within the -secretase complex (58 to 60).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Recently, it has been suggested that presenilin endoproteolysis is a regulatory event that causes a cleavage-induced conformational change by which presenilin becomes an activated enzyme (61).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	229	 According to this report, the presenilinase cleavage would retrieve the loop encoded by exon 9, which would otherwise occupy the presenilin substrate-binding site.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	230	 If this was the case, we should then surmise that the TM1 to 2 mutant adopted a conformation that relieved the exon 9 peptide from the binding pocket, whereas the conformation of the PSNHL1 to 5 variant allowed neither endoproteolysis processing nor the retrieval of exon 9 peptide; hence, -secretase activity might be severely compromised.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	231	One prediction of the presenilin dimer in the -secretase core is the formation of more than one catalytic diaspartyl group.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	232	 We addressed whether all the diaspartyl combinations were functional.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Our results showed reconstitution of active -secretase when two different presenilin aspartic mutants were co-expressed, as a functional diaspartyl group was formed with the TMVI Asp279 aspartic residue (Asp257 in human PS1) from one PSN monomer and the TMVII D461 aspartic residue (Asp385 in human PS1) from the other (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Not only did this diaspartyl group cleave the C99-APP-derived substrate at both - and -sites, but it also produced A40 and A42 peptides in the same ratio as the wtPSN, thus suggesting that a similar diaspartyl combination is responsible for APP - and -cleavages in vivo.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Remarkably, the fact that in the same experimental conditions this catalytic group does not generate NICD by S3 cleavage supports the idea that different requirements have to be met for APP and Notch cleavages, in agreement with previous reports (25, 27 to 29, 63).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	236	 In addition, our results suggest that presenilinase activity requires the formation of a diaspartyl group between the NTF and CTF from the same monomer.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	237	 According to our results, endoproteolytic processing is no longer a requirement for presenilin activation when co-expressing the two presenilin aspartic mutants.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	238	 These presenilin aspartic mutants might adopt a slightly different conformation that would not need to retrieve exon 9 from the binding substrate site (61).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	239	We have ruled out some possible concerns about the reconstitution of -secretase activity in our experimental conditions on the following grounds: (i) we discarded any domain swapping between the two mutant presenilin molecules, first because this event has already been ruled out in presenilins by several authors in previous reports (26, 64, 65), and, moreover, in our case presenilin domain swapping was completely prevented, since the expressed mutants were not endoproteolytically cleaved into the NTF and CTF fragments; (ii) even if considering some residual endogenous presenilin-dependent or -independent -secretase activity after RNAi treatment and the fact that not all presenilin mutants might be equally effective in replacing this residual activity, the fact that each individual mutant abrogated -secretase activity, as measured by loss of A, AICD, and NICD production (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	240	 4, C, D, and G), whereas in the same experimental conditions co-expression of the two mutants restored between 30 and 50% of the wild-type activity (in accordance with the heterodimer PSND279A/PSND461A representing only one-half of the dimer population), indicated that genetic complementation between the two mutants occurred, and a functional diaspartyl group was assembled in trans; and finally, (iii) this reconstituted -secretase activity only cleaved the APP-derived substrates, whereas the activity on Notch-derived ones was completely impaired.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Were other presenilin-independent activities to account for the APP processing but not for Notch cleavage, these activities should be detected in all of the mutant controls, which obviously was not the case.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	242	Hence, the fact that -secretase activity is restored only after co-expression of the two aspartic mutant presenilins within the same cell and that this activity discriminates between the two substrates, in contrast to the wild-type or endogenous presenilin, makes complementation of the two presenilin mutants the highest likely explanation for the restoration of -secretase activity.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	243	 We concluded that the reconstituted presenilin catalytic function was due to the bona fide formation of a diaspartyl group in trans at the interface of the two mutant presenilins, each providing one different aspartic residue.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Our results are also completely consistent and provide a feasible explanation for the recent report on the rescue of presenilinase and -secretase activity on a C99 substrate by co-expression of an inactive C-terminally truncated presenilin mutant with wild-type CTF, but not by a mutant aspartic CTF, in PS-deficient cells (54).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	245	Based on our results, we propose a model in which the catalytic diaspartyl groups responsible for cleaving these substrates partially overlap within the same presenilin -secretase complex.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Thus, the Asp257/Asp385 group formed in trans at the interface of the two presenilin monomers would cleave a C99 substrate, whereas the Asp257/Asp385 group in cis between the NTF and CTF moieties of the same molecule would process an NECN substrate (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The experimental approach with the two aspartic mutants did not allow to test the second possibility.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	248	 This hypothesis is consistent with the divergent transmembrane sequences of both substrates, which, according to our model, would be cleaved by different diaspartyl combinations.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	249	 It should be noted that the observations presented here are fully compatible with the recently proposed models in which -secretase may contain separated docking and catalytic sites (26, 35, 66 to 68).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Other scenarios are also compatible with our observations.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	251	 One is that the conformation of the HA-PSND279A/Myc-PSND461A heterodimer hinders the access to the catalytic site of the NECN substrate, but not that of the C99.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	252	 In this context, if the conformations of the mutants were slightly different from the wild-type protein, mutations on the catalytic site could alter in turn the accessibility to the binding site, allowing the access of C99 but still hampering that of the NECN substrate.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	253	 A second alternative might be that the mutant presenilins are addressed to a cellular compartment different from the wild type, allowing access to the APP-derived substrate while precluding that of the Notch substrate.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Another alternative is that recognition and/or cleavage of the NECN substrate requires at least three aspartic residues of the presenilin dimer, similar to what has been suggested (26).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Finally, other authors have proposed that different isoforms (PS-1, PS-2, aph-1aL, aph-1aS, and aph-1b) assemble in different -secretase complexes to provide substrate specificity (40).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	256	 This does not apply to our model because the components of the -secretase complex are encoded by single copy genes in Drosophila (2).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Notwithstanding, and irrespective of the number and composition of the -secretase complexes, once the substrate has reached the catalytic center, it may be cleaved by a specific diaspartyl group, which could differ between different substrates.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	260	 The diaspartyl group formed by one aspartic acid 257 and one aspartic acid 385 (in black) from two presenilin molecules cleaves a C99 substrate (A) both at the - and -sites, whereas an NECN substrate (B) is cleaved by the diaspartyl group (in black) formed with the NTF and CTF from the same monomer.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	262	Presenilins belong to an emerging family of unusual diaspartyl proteases, the I-CLiPs (56, 69), whose characteristics include complex structural topology and the ability to carry out regulated intramembraneous proteolysis of substrates (70).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Remarkably, another of its members, the signal peptide peptidase, has been recently reported to form a homodimer that is labeled by inhibitors directed against the active site of -secretase (71).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	264	 The finding that two aspartyl I-CLiPs, signal peptide peptidase and presenilins, function as dimers that are recognized by the same active site inhibitor suggests that dimerization may be a general requirement for function or regulation of this family of proteases and provides new insights on how regulated intramembraneous proteolysis may take place.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	265	To sum up and as a main conclusion, we reconstituted -secretase activity through co-expression of two distinct, catalytically inactive, aspartic presenilin mutants and provided evidence that presenilin functions as a dimer within the -secretase complex and that a functional diaspartyl group is formed at the interface of this dimer.

0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	4	Missense mutations in the presenilin 2 (PS-2) gene on chromosome 1 were sought by direct nucleotide sequence analysis of the open reading frame of 60 pedigrees with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In the majority of these pedigrees, PS-1 and [beta]-amyloid precursor protein ([beta]APP) gene mutations had been excluded.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	6	 While no additional PS-2 pathogenic mutations were detected, four silent nucleotide substitutions and alternative splicing of nucleotides 1338-1340 (Glu325) were observed.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Analysis of additional members of a pedigree known to segregate a Met239Val mutation in PS-2 revealed that the age of onset of symptoms is highly variable (range 45-88 years).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This variability is not attributable to differences in ApoE genotypes.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These results suggest (i) that, in contrast to mutations in PS-1, mutations in PS-2 are a relatively rare cause of FAD; (ii) that other genetic or environmental factors modify the AD phenotype associated with PS-2 mutations; and (iii) that still other FAD susceptibility genes remain to be identified.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	10	Missense mutations associated with early onsetAlzheimer's disease (AD) have been discovered in two related genes termed presenilin I on chromosome 14 (1 ) and presenilin II on chromosome 1 (2 ,3 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Analysis of a number of large data sets have revealed that missense mutations in the presenilin I (PS-1) gene are a frequent cause of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), accounting for perhaps as much as 50% of all cases of early onset FAD (1 ,2 ,4 -6 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In order to determine the frequency of mutations in the presenilin II (PS-2) gene, we undertook a survey for mutations in the open reading frame (ORF) of the PS-2 gene in 60 pedigrees with FAD.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The disease in these families was characterized by the occurrence of AD consistent with the NINDS-ADRDA criteria in at least three closely related subjects, often in more than one generation.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In these pedigrees, the age at onset (range: 35-82 years; 36 with mean age at onset  < = 64 years; 14 with mean age at onset  > = 65 years; 10 with insufficient reliable data on age at onset) overlapped that observed in the pedigrees with known PS-2 mutations (onset between 45 and 72 years).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	15	 To determine the penetrance of PS-2 mutations, we also examined several additional members of the FLO10 pedigree previously described with the Met239Val missense mutation in the PS-2 gene (2 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Our data suggest that missense mutations in the PS-2 gene are a rare cause of AD and that these missense mutations may be subject to the modifying action of other genes or environmental influences.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	17	Fibroblasts, transformed lymphoblasts or peripheral blood samples were obtained from at least one affected member of 60 kindreds with multiple (>3) family members affected by FAD that were ascertained through the familial Alzheimer's disease registry at the University of Toronto, through clinics at the University of Florence and the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Centre, from the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, from French University Hospitals through the National INSERM network of France, and from the Indiana University Alzheimer's Disease DNA Bank and the NIA sponsored repository at the Coriell Institute.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Diagnosis of AD in affected members used the NINDS-ADRDA criteria or the similar CERAD criteria.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Mutations in the PS-1 and [beta]-amyloid precursor protein ([beta]APP) genes had previously been excluded in the majority of these pedigrees by sequencing of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products corresponding to the PS-1 gene and genomic PCR products corresponding to exons 16 and 17 of [beta]APP.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	20	Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of RT-PCR products corresponding to the ORF of PS-2 in these 60 FAD pedigrees failed to uncover any additional mutations beyond the two initial mutations (Asn141Ile mutation in three related kindreds of Volga-German origin, and the Met239Val mutation in the FLO10 pedigree of Italian origin) previously reported in this data set (2 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Specific screening just for the Asn141Ile and Met239Val mutations in a supplemental set of genomic DNA samples from affected probands of 81 Swedish FAD pedigrees also failed to identify further instances of either mutation.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	22	 However, although no pathogenic nucleotide sequence differences were observed, four `silent' nucleotide substitutions were detected (T - >  C at 626 bp/codon 23; C - >  T at 806 bp/codon 147; C - >  T at 1571 bp/codon 402; and G - >  A at 1670 bp/codon 435-sequence numbering from Accession no.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	23	 All of these substitutions occurred at the third nucleotide position of a codon, and would therefore be predicted not to cause a change in the amino acid sequence.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	24	 A fifth sequence variant-the variable presence of nucleotides 1338-1340 encoding the Glu325 residuewas found in transcripts from most tissues.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Transcripts with and without nucleotides 1338-1340, which reflects the use of an alternate splice donor sequence, were of approximately equal abundance in brain, fibroblasts and leukocytes.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	26	During the investigation of the PS-2 gene in several newly ascertained members of the FLO10 pedigree segregating the Met239Val mutation in PS-2, we identified an additional carrier of this mutation (subject III-20 in Table 1 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Surprisingly, this subject was aged 87 years and had had no evidence for cognitive or memory impairment on serial follow-up over several years until age 84 years when she was noted to become mildly demented, and is now profoundly demented (Mini Mental Status Examination score 4/30) with clinical features that sustain a diagnosis of probable AD by the NINDS-ADRDA criteria.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	28	 A review of clinical data on additional members of the extended pedigree also uncovered two other subjects in the direct lineage of the family who had either historical evidence for late onset AD (subject I-2, the affected grandfather of III-20 who died at 75 years with dementia) or who currently have clinical features consistent with probable AD using the NINDS-ADRDA criteria (subject III-39 onset at 88 years).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	29	 We and others have previously reported that the genotype at the Apolipoprotein E gene can modulate the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with the Val717Ile mutation in [beta]APP (7 ,8 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, in the FLO10 family with the Met239Val mutation in PS-2, ApoE genotypes do not correlate with age of onset (Table 1 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Thus, the very elderly symptomatic subject III-20 (onset 84 years) has the same ApoE genotype ([epsilon]3/[epsilon]3) as three other affected carriers of the Met239Val mutation, all of whom developed symptoms at a younger age (onset 45-72 years).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Moreover, the affected carrier IV-21, with the ApoE genotype of [epsilon]3/[epsilon]4 developed symptoms at an age (48 years) similar to that of his affected sibling IV-18 with an ApoE genotype of [epsilon]3/[epsilon]3 (onset = 45 years) (Table 1 , Fig.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Our sample size is too small to draw reliable conclusions about the presence or absence of interactions between the ApoE genotype and the Asn141Ile mutation (Table 1 ).

0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	38	 With the exception of subject III-39, whose genotypes at PS-2 and ApoE are unknown because no biological samples are available, all affected subjects carried the PS-2 Met239Val mutation.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	39	Although the large cadre of FAD pedigrees reported here does not represent an unbiased survey, the paucity of missense mutations in the PS-2 gene amongst FAD pedigrees in our data set suggests that, in contrast to mutations in the ORF of PS-1, mutations in the ORF of this gene are a rare cause of FAD, at least in Caucasian populations.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	40	 We can confidently exclude mutations in intronic sequences associated with RNA splice sites [indeed only one such mutation which affects splicing of exon 10 of PS-1 has been found in FAD affected subjects (T.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	41	 However, until the 5' UTR and 3' UTR sequences have been searched for pathogenic mutations, we cannot exclude the formal possibility that mutations might exist in these sequences in some of our pedigrees.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Nevertheless, there are two corollaries to the conclusion that PS-2 ORF mutations are rare.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	43	 First, unless a phenotype uniquely associated with or at least enriched in subjects with PS-2 mutants can be found, screening programs for mutations in the ORF of PS-2 are likely to have a low yield.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Second, and more importantly, other as yet unidentified FAD susceptibility loci must exist.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	45	Table 1 Age of onset relative to the genotypes at the ApoE and PS-2 genes Subject.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	46	The age of symptom onset or current age of PS-2 mutation carriers are displayed along with each subject's ApoE genotype.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	47	The other conclusion to be drawn from our data is that the age of symptom onset in subjects with PS-2 mutations is generally older (45-88 years) than that observed for most PS-1 mutations (25-65 years), and is highly variable even amongst affected members of the same pedigree.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	48	 This contrasts sharply with the experience with PS-1 mutations, where the age of onset is generally quite similar amongst affected members of the same family, and often amongst members of different families with the same mutation (1 ,2 ,4 -6 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Because to date all subjects with AD in the FLO10 pedigree have inherited the Met239Val mutation, it is unlikely that the late onset cases represent phenocopies and/or that it represents a polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with a nearby pathogenic mutation.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Consequently, the most parsimonious explanation is that there is a single cause of the disease (the Met239Val mutation) and that the phenotype is modified by other genetic or environmental factors.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The limited number of subjects with the Asn141Ile mutation in our data set prevents rigorous conclusions about any interactions between the ApoE genotype and this mutation.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	52	 However, analysis of a larger data set by T.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Schellenberg also reveals no obvious interaction between the genotypes at ApoE and PS-2 Asn141Ile (manuscript in preparation).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	54	 This absence of a close correlation between the ApoE genotype and age of symptom onset in subjects with PS-2 mutation has two implications.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	55	 First, in view of parallel observations showing no apparent interaction between ApoE genotype and mutations in PS-1 (7 ,9 ,10 ), together with the structural and amino acid sequence similarities of the PS-1 and PS-2 proteins (1 -3 ), it is likely that the functional effect of PS-1 and PS-2 mutations are similar and are either remote from the functional effect of the ApoE [epsilon]4 allele, or affect a biochemical pathway leading to AD which is different from that influenced by ApoE [epsilon]4.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Second, the variation in age of onset in PS-2 mutation carriers argues that other modifying environmental or genetic factors (e.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	57	 other polymorphisms within the presenilin genes or differences in other genes) must exist.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The nature of these other factors remains to be determined.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	59	 However, if these modifying factors can be identified, they might be exploitable as a therapeutic tool.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	60	Subjects with familially clustered Alzheimer's disease (as defined by the occurrence of at least three first or second degree relatives with AD) were recruited from patients referred for the investigation of dementia at the University of Toronto, University of Florence, the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Centre, the Huddinge Hospital of the Karolinska Institute, and French University Hospitals.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	61	 All subjects provided informed consent using institutionally approved protocols.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The diagnosis of AD was made in affected pedigree members by direct clinical examination and standard laboratory procedures which met or exceeded the stringency of the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (11 ,12 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Evidence of AD in deceased family members was ascertained through the investigation of medical and family records as previously described (13 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Additional FAD pedigree samples were obtained from the Cornell Institute (Camden, NJ) (N = 4) and from the Indiana University Alzheimer's Disease DNA Bank (Indianapolis, IN) (N = 6).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	65	Mutations were sought in the ORF of the PS-1 gene (47/60 pedigrees) and in exon 16 and 17 of the [beta]APP gene (51/60 pedigrees) using the methods previously described (1 ,14 ,15 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	66	 The PS-2 gene ORF was investigated in the North American and Italian pedigrees by isolating complimentary DNA fragments by amplification using RT-PCR and the oligonucleotide primer sequences and reaction conditions as previously described (2 ).
