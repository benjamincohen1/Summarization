   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Several lines of evidence have indicated that the presenilin proteins function within macromolecular complexes and are necessary for the regulated intramembranous proteolysis of certain type 1 transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein, Notch, and p75. Data from multiple complementary experiments now suggest that there may be several distinct presenilin complexes. We show here that presenilin mutations and certain detergents affect the abundance and componentry of the presenilin complexes, and these structural effects correlate with their effects on -secretase activity. Our data suggest that there are at least three complexes, including a 150-kDa nicastrin-aph-1 complex (which is likely to be a precursor complex). There is a stable and abundant intermediate complex of 440 kDa, which contains aph-1, pen-2, nicastrin, and PS1. However, it is the very low abundance, high mass (670 kDa) heteromeric complexes that are associated with the highest -secretase-specific activity.
   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   After their initial cloning as the site of mutations causing familial Alzheimer disease (1 to 3), numerous functional studies have shown that the presenilin proteins are necessary for an unusual form of proteolytic cleavage in which selected type 1 transmembrane proteins are cleaved within their hydrophobic transmembrane domains. This form of regulated intramembranous proteolysis requires the presence of a complex of interacting membrane-bound proteins, including the presenilin proteins, aph-1 (4, 5), pen-2 (5), and nicastrin (6). Others and we have previously suggested that although these proteins clearly physically interact with each other, they may in fact form more than a single complex (7 to 11). We now report the results of several complementary experiments that directly support this notion and that show that functional -secretase activity mostly arises from a low-abundance, very high molecular weight complex (670 kDa). These data continue to raise the possibility that either additional proteins may be present in these functional complexes or the functional complex is a higher order multimer of the presenilin, aph-1, pen-2, and nicastrin proteins. These data also provide a partial structural explanation for the differential effects of detergents and certain mutations on -secretase activity.
   EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Immunocytochemistry KNS human glioma cells, mouse cerebellar glial cells (A3), and mouse cerebellar granule neurons were cultured and fixed as described previously (8, 12). The cells were permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS1 and 5% acetic acid in ethanol for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies used in this study were: rabbit polyclonal antibody to human aph-11 (O2C2) (8); guinea pig polyclonal antibody to nicastrin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA); mouse monoclonal antibody to PS1 (NT1; a gift from Paul M. Mathews). The secondary antibodies were: cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, cy3-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG, or cy2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Cells were examined with a Bio-Rad laser scanning confocal imaging system (Microradiance R2000/AG-2) equipped with the Lasersharp2000 software (Bio-Rad). Images were processed using the Lasersharp2000 postprocessing software.
Cell Culture and Sample Preparation Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum, supplemented with 200  microg/ml G418 (for cells stably expressing APP-C99, APP695 "Swedish" mutant, or PS1E9) and/or 120  microg/ml Zeocin (for cells stably expressing wild-type PS1 mutant or D385A presenilin 1), as described previously (6 to 8, 13 to 16).
Cells were harvested and homogenized in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The postnuclear supernatant was collected by centrifugation of the cell homogenates at 1000 x g for 5 min in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Membranous fractions were then pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 1 h.
Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting First-dimensional Blue Native (BN) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed essentially as described previously (17). In brief, microsomal membranes were prepared as described above and were then solubilized with ice-cold BN-lysis buffer containing 1% (w/v) detergent (either digitonin or CHAPSO), 500 mM 6-aminocaproic acid, 50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, plus Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysate (100  microl) was centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 20 min, and the supernatant was adjusted with 0.5 volumes of BN-sample buffer (containing 0.75% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 500 mM 6-aminocaproic acid, 50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, 30% glycerol, and 1% detergent). The samples were separated on a 6 to 13% Blue Native polyacrylamide gel poured 1 day before analysis, as described previously (17). Marker proteins used for BN-PAGE were thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; apoferritin, 443 kDa; -amylase, 200 kDa; and bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa (Sigma).
For the second-dimensional SDS-PAGE, the Blue Native gel was destained in 5% acetic acid/25% methanol. After thorough washing in 25% methanol, individual lanes were excised and equilibrated for 15 min in two-dimensional (2D) sample buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 M urea, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 1% dithiothreitol, and bromphenol blue). The gel strip was then loaded onto Nu-PAGE Bis-Tris 4 to 12% precast 2D gel (Invitrogen) for SDS-PAGE.
For Western blotting, the resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The target proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies were: mouse monoclonal anti-nicastrin clone 35 (BD Transduction Laboratories); rabbit polyclonal anti-nicastrin (PAI-758; Affinity Bioreagents); rabbit anti-aph-11 N-terminal antibody O2C2 (8); rabbit polyclonal antibody to pen-2 (gift from C. Haass); mouse monoclonal anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody NT1 (gift from P. Mathews); rabbit polyclonal antibody to PS1-NTF (Ab14; gift from S. Gandy). The intensity profiles of Western blotting signals were plotted using NIH Image software (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/).
Glycerol Velocity Gradients HEK293 cells stably expressing APP-C99 were washed with 4  degrees C cold PBS, resuspended in 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.25 M sucrose plus protease inhibitors, and homogenized, and the postnuclear supernatant was prepared as described previously (16). Microsomal membranes pelleted from the postnuclear supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 1 h at 4  degrees C and lysised in 1% CHAPSO in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, and 150 mM NaCl, plus protease inhibitors. The lysates were re-centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 30 min, and the supernatants were used for glycerol gradient centrifugation fractionation experiments as described previously (7). In brief, 1 ml of total protein extracts was applied to the top of an 11.0-ml 10 to 40% (w/v) linear glycerol gradient containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5% CHAPSO. Gradients were centrifuged for 15 h at 35,000 rpm and 4  degrees C using a Beckman SW41 rotor and were collected into 1.0-ml fractions from top of the centrifugation tube.
Cell-free -Secretase Assay CHAPSO-solubilized membranes that had been resolved by glycerol velocity gradient fractionation were precleared with preimmune serum linked to beads, and then incubated overnight at 4  degrees C with an antibody to PS1 N terminus (antibody 14) that had been cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose with dimethylpimelimidate (Sigma). The immunopurified, high molecular weight PS1 complexes were washed once with assay buffer, and resuspended in 0.25% detergent (CHAPSO or digitonin) containing assay buffer, pH 6.4 (10 mM KOAc, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 75 mM sodium citrate), containing protease inhibitors, and were then incubated at 37  degrees C for 4 h to generate -stubs. Control samples were kept on ice. At the end of the assay, the samples were resuspended in SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 450 mM Tris, 12% glycerol, 0.0025% Coomassie Blue G, and 0.0025% phenol red, pH 8.4) and were used for Western blotting to measure the appearance of -stubs as described previously (16).
   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   There is an apparent stoichiometric discrepancy between the predominant localization of some of the presenilin complex components within the early secretory pathway (e.g. PS1 and aph-1) versus the functional observation that -secretase cleavage of Notch and APP occur predominantly at, or near, the cell surface. To explore this, we undertook immunocytochemical studies of endogenous presenilin components in KNS glioma cells, mouse cerebellar granule neurons (not shown), and mouse cerebellar glial cells (Fig. 1). It was immediately apparent that although there is overlap between the distributions of these proteins, the degree of overlap is far from a perfect spatial co-registration (Fig. 1). These results hint either that there may be more than one type of complex formed by various different combinations of these proteins or that the complex components might be added to complexes in a spatially and temporally defined order. The conclusion that there may not be a single "presenilin complex" would be in good agreement with previously published biochemical experiments, which had have shown that aph-1 and immature forms of nicastrin co-fractionate separately from PS1 and pen-2 on glycerol velocity gradient and 2D gel electrophoretic fractionations (8, 9). If nicastrin, aph-1, pen-2, and the presenilins do indeed form more than a single type of complex, it immediately begs the question as to whether all of these complexes have -secretase activity.

Mouse cerebellar glial cells (A3) were investigated by confocal microscopy after being prepared, fixed, and co-stained with anti-aph-11 (red), anti-nicastrin (green), and anti-PS1 (blue) antibodies, as described under "Experimental Procedures" (A, top row). Any two components showed partial overlap (A, bottom row), but all three components showed only modest overlap (B).
  To begin to address these issues, we undertook detailed 2D gel electrophoresis studies using BN gel electrophoresis in the first dimension, followed by standard SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis in the second dimension. When the initial cell lysates of HEK293 cells expressing APPSwedish were prepared using 1% CHAPSO as the solubilizing detergent, at least two distinct PS1 immunoreactive spots were identified at 440 and 670 kDa, together with a smear pattern at even higher masses (Fig. 2, left). The 440- and 670-kDa complexes both contained maturely glycosylated nicastrin, aph-1, pen-2, PS1-NTF, and PS1-CTF. However, only the 670-kDa complex contained APP-CTFs. These observations are unlikely to simply represent idiosyncrasies of the gel electrophoresis methodology because a broad distribution of complexes ranging from 150 to 670 kDa were also seen when these lysates were resolved on glycerol velocity gradients (Fig. 3A, left). Because the resolution of individual complexes is less robust on unidimensional glycerol velocity gradients, and because the glycerol velocity gradients resolve proteins according to relative buoyancy rather than by charge and mass as in gel electrophoretic separations, the predicted mass measurements are not identical between the 2D gel studies and the velocity gradients. Nevertheless, in general agreement with the result of the 2D gels, immature nicastrin and one of two peaks of aph-1 are enriched in lower molecular weight fractions at 100 to 200 kDa (Fig. 3A, left, fractions 3 to 5). On the other hand, PS1, pen-2, and maturely glycosylated nicastrin are enriched in higher molecular weight fractions from 200 to  > 670 kDa, and there is a secondary peak of aph-1 at 440 kDa (Fig. 3A, left, fraction 8).
View larger version (73K):    FIG. 2. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of presenilin complexes from HEK293 cells expressing APPSwedish solubilized in 1% CHAPSO (left) or 1% digitonin (right) reveal the presence of several distinct complexes. In CHAPSO, which supports -secretase activity in cell-free assays, there are at least two heteromeric complexes (670 and 440 kDa) containing PS1, nicastrin (NCT), aph-1, and pen-2. In digitonin, which does not support -secretase activity in cell-free assays, the abundance of the 670-kDa complex is dramatically reduced.
 
View larger version (38K):    FIG. 3. A, glycerol velocity gradient analyses of membrane preparations containing presenilin complexes solubilized in 1% CHAPSO (left) or 1% digitonin (right). These studies confirm the existence of a low molecular mass (150 kDa) complex enriched in aph-1 and immature nicastrin (lanes 3 and 4) and one or more higher molecular weight complexes (200 to 670 kDa) containing PS1, and varying amounts of mature nicastrin (NCT), aph-1, and pen-2 (lanes 5 to 11). Like the 2D gel studies, the 670-kDa complexes (lanes 8 to 11) were essentially absent when membranes were solubilized in 1% digitonin. B, cell-free -secretase assays were performed on pooled fractions from the CHAPSO glycerol velocity gradients (left3) and from the digitonin glycerol velocity gradients (right). Compared with control fractions incubated at 0  degrees C (top left), -stubs were actively generated by CHAPSO-solubilized fractions 5 to 6, 7 to 8, 9 to 10, and 11 to 12 incubated at 37  degrees C for 4 h (middle left); the highest specific activity relative to starting amount of PS1 was in fractions 9 to 10 and 11 to 12 (lower left). PS1 complexes from digitonin-solubilized fractions failed to co-immunoprecipitate APP-CTFs and consequently failed to generate -stubs (right). The failure to generate -stubs by digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes could not be reversed by adding additional exogenous APP-CTFs (see Fig. 3D), and addition of digitonin to CHAPSO-solubilized PS1 complexes (with docked substrate) also resulted in loss of -secretase activity (data not shown), arguing that digitonin alters the conformation and/or componentry of PS1 complex, rendering it non-functional. C, histograms of the specific -secretase activity for pooled fractions from the glycerol velocity gradients. -Secretase activity was calculated as the quantity of -stubs produced/quantity of -stubs produced plus residual APP-CTFs relative to the amount of PS1 in that fraction. Pooled fractions containing proteins with molecular mass less than 600 kDa (fractions 3 to 6 or 3 to 8) had less -secretase activity than did fractions with proteins of molecular mass of greater than 600 kDa (fractions 9 to 12). D, addition of exogenous substrate (APP-C99) resulted in robust generation of -stubs in CHAPSO-solubilized PS1 complexes (CHP) incubated at 37  degrees C, but failed to induce -stub production at 4  degrees C (negative control) in digitonin-solubilized membranes (DIG) at any temperature. This result argues that the absence of -stub generation by digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes (B, right) is caused by the failure of digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes to dock -secretase substrates.
  The 150 kDa aph-1-nicastrin complex is unlikely to subserve catalytic activity because it is present in PS1 to / to  cells, which do not support -secretase activity. From these experiments alone, it is not possible to conclude which, if any, of the other higher mass complexes are associated with functional -secretase activity. Attempts to measure the activity of specific complexes isolated from the 2D gels were not successful, presumably because of the low abundance of properly folded complexes being recovered. To circumvent this problem, we elected to use three complementary strategies, which might, when taken together, indirectly infer which of these complexes were necessary for functional activity. These three approaches were: 1) direct ascertainment of functional -secretase activity from glycerol velocity gradient fractions; 2) analysis of the differential effects of detergents on -secretase activity, complex composition, and complex size; and 3) analysis of the differential effects on PS1 mutations on -secretase activity, complex composition, and complex size.
To estimate the -secretase activity of these complexes, we used a cell-free assay (16) to investigate the generation of -stubs by anti-PS1 immunopurified membranes that were solubilized in 1% CHAPSO and that had then been resolved by size on the glycerol velocity gradients. The highest specific -secretase activity relative to the amount of PS1-NTF in each fraction was found in the higher mass fractions ( > 500 kDa) of the glycerol velocity gradient (specific activity, 34.6  plus or minus  14.7 and 44.3  plus or minus  17.1 in fractions 9 to 10 and 11 to 12, respectively, compared with 12.1  plus or minus  9.7 and 23.5  plus or minus  10.63 in fractions 3 to 4 and 5 to 6, respectively, p  <  0.05) (Fig. 3, B, lower left, and C).
Previous in vitro studies have shown that CHAPSO is the optimum detergent for preserving -secretase activity in cell-free membrane preparations and that -secretase activity is significantly reduced by digitonin and completely abolished by Triton X-100, n-octyl glucoside, and many other detergents (18, 19). When the glycerol velocity and 2D gel electrophoretic experiments were repeated using digitonin, there was a significant (100-fold) reduction in the abundance of the high molecular weight presenilin complexes on both the 2D gel electrophoreses (Fig. 2, right) and on the glycerol velocity fractionation experiments (Fig. 3A, right). Furthermore, these fractions contain very little co-immunoprecipitating APP-CTFs and failed to generate significant quantities of -stubs in the cell-free -secretase assay (Fig. 3B, right). To confirm that the absence of -secretase activity in digitonin-solubilized fractions was caused by failure of docking and cleavage of APP-CTFs by the digitonin-solubilized complexes (as opposed to artifacts such as simple degradation of APP-CTFs during the assay), we performed two additional experiments. First, we immunopurified CHAPSO-solubilized PS1 complexes, and split the product into two aliquots. One aliquot was then submitted directly for -secretase assay, whereas digitonin was added to the other aliquot to a final concentration of 0.25%, and then submitted for -secretase assay. No -stubs were generated by the aliquot containing digitonin (data not shown). In the second experiment, we simply added additional purified APP-C99 to CHAPSO-solubilized and to digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes (Fig. 3D). Again, despite the abundant presence of substrate, the digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes failed to generate -stubs (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these experiments suggest that digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes have undergone either a conformational shift and/or have lost a substrated adaptor protein. When the presenilin complexes were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 or in 1% n-octyl glucoside (neither of which support -secretase activity), the very high molecular weight presenilin complex species were essentially abolished and only monomeric species were found (data not shown).
Functional -secretase activity is also modulated by selected mutations in the presenilin proteins. In particular, mutation of either or both of the two aspartyl residues within membrane-embedded hydrophobic domains (PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A) have been associated with loss of proteolytic activity (20 to 22). We therefore investigated the structure and relative abundance of presenilin complexes isolated from cells overexpressing either wild-type PS1 or the PS1 D385A loss-of-function mutant. We have shown previously that the PS1 D385A mutation causes a reduction in the abundance of higher MW species on glycerol velocity gradient fractionation (23). We have also shown that this reduction is not caused by the simple failure of endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 (23). Thus, high molecular weight complexes comparable in size with those of wild-type PS1-NTF/CTFs were observed in cells expressing the holoprotein of the PS1 Exon 9 deletion mutant (which causes increased 42-secretase activity but impaired PS1 endoproteolysis) (23). In agreement with these prior observations, in the current 2D gel analyses, the PS1 D385A mutation was again associated with an altered distribution of complexes and components (Fig. 4). Thus, the 670-kDa complex was absent in digitonin-solubilized lysates of PS1 D385A-expressing cells, which displayed only the 440-kDa complex, and monomeric bands for nicastrin (110 kDa) and the PS1 D385A holoprotein (65 kDa) were observed (Fig 4A, right). Similar but less profound changes in relative abundance of the 670- and 440-kDa complexes were also apparent after CHAPSO solubilization (Fig. 4, B to F). Thus, in cells expressing wild-type PS1 (Fig. 4, B, left, and C to F), there was greater abundance of the 670-kDa complex relative to the 440-kDa complexes (670 kDa/470 kDa ratio, 1.11  plus or minus  0.15, n = 4 replications). However, in PS1 D385A overexpressing cells (Fig. 4, B, right, and C to F), there was a significant loss of the 670-kDa complex and a corresponding overabundance of the 440-kDa complex (670 kDa/440 kDa ratio, 0.57  plus or minus  0.03; p  <  0.002).

A, 2D gel analyses of digitonin-solubilized membrane preparations from HEK293 cells overexpressing wild-type PS1 (left) or the PS1 D385A mutant (right). PS1 D385A cells show accumulation of the 440-kDa complex and loss of both the 670-kDa complex and the 150-kDa nicastrin/aph-1 complex. B, 2D gel analyses of CHAPSO-solubilized membranes preparations from HEK293 cells overexpressing wild-type PS1 (left) or PS1 D385A mutant (right). Wild-type PS1 cells show equal or greater abundance of the 670-kDa complex compared with the 440-kDa complexes. In contrast, the PS1D385A mutant cells show greater abundance of the 440-kDa complex and relative loss of the 670-kDa complex. C to F, to confirm the results of direct visual interpretations, the intensity profiles of Western blotting signals were plotted using NIH Image software (solid line, wild-type PS1; dotted line, PS1 D385A). Peak heights were then computed for the 440- and 670-kDa complexes, and these data were then used to compare the effects of detergents and PS1 mutations using the 670 kDa/440 kDa peak height ratio. In wild-type PS1-expressing cells, the 670-kDa complex predominated, whereas in PS1 D385A mutant cells, the 440-kDa complex predominated (p  <  0.002).
     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The immunocytochemical data, the data from glycerol velocity gradient and 2D gel electrophoretic separations, and the functional data arising from the differential effects of detergents and PS1 mutations cumulatively argue that there are several, authentic, independent complexes each with different molecular masses. Although each of the techniques differs in the observed sizes of the complexes, their results are congruent, and it therefore seems very unlikely that these apparently distinct complexes are artifacts. A more probable explanation is that the multiplicity of complexes relates to the maturation of the presenilin complex and to its functional regulation. Based upon the fact that aph-1 is relatively stable in the absence of PS1 and binds to immature nicastrin, we have previously suggested that aph-1 is an initial scaffolding molecule upon which the functional complex is built (8). This is supported by the fact that in PS1 to / to  cells, the 150 kDa aph-1-nicastrin complex is stable and contains immature nicastrin, whereas the 440- and 670-kDa complexes are destabilized. We now propose that the 440-kDa complex, which contains additional components (aph-1, PS1, nicastrin, and pen-2) but does not dock the APP-CTF substrate efficiently, is a relatively abundant but non-functional intermediary complex. In support of this, the 440-kDa complex is stably present under conditions that are not associated with functional -secretase activity (i.e. in the presence of digitonin or the PS1 D385A missense loss of function mutation). The prevalence (albeit at low levels of abundance) of the high molecular weight 670-kDa complex under conditions associated with functional -secretase activity suggests that these complexes are the species that contain full enzymatic activity. This is directly supported by the fact that the highest specific activity for -secretase activity is obtained in the glycerol velocity fractions containing complexes of  > 500 kDa.
There are two potential explanations for our results. The first and most straightforward explanation is that these complexes reflect the evolution of the presenilin complexes as they are assembled. The lower mass (150 and 440 kDa) complexes might then represent initial and intermediary complexes, whereas the low abundance, high mass complexes (670 kDa) could represent functional complexes that contain either additional components or contain the four known components in a higher order stoichiometry (e.g. 2:2:2:2). Direct experiments analyzing the composition of these complexes will be required to resolve this possibility. There are, however, two caveats to this hypothesis. First, small, but measurable amounts of the 670-kDa complexes are still present in CHAPSO lysates of PS1 D385A cells (although these complexes are considerably reduced in abundance relative to the 440-kDa complexes). This does not completely negate our hypothesis that the 670-kDa complexes are the functional conform because a substantial proportion of the PS1 D385A molecules are clearly in an aberrant conformational 440-kDa state in CHAPSO and nearly all of the PS1 D385A molecules are in the 400-kDa complex in digitonin. As a result, it is probable that the PS1 D385A molecules in the 670-kDa complexes in CHAPSO do not have an entirely normal conform. The second caveat concerning our postulated hierarchy of complexes arises from the observation that PS1 D385A-expressing cells do not assemble a robust nicastrin-aph-1 150-kDa complex. It could be argued that the 150 kDa nicastrin:aph-1 complex is not a precursor complex as we have postulated, but represents a downstream catabolic product of the 440- or 670-kDa complexes. The stable presence of the 150-kDa complex in PS1 to / to  cells makes this hypothesis unlikely. An alternate explanation for the disappearance of the 150-kDa complex in PS1 D385A cells, but not in PS1 to / to  cells, is that the 150-kDa complex could have a dual role. This complex could be involved in presenting new nicastrin molecules to the 440-kDa complexes, and involved in recovering and re-presenting used nicastrin molecules back to the 440-kDa complex. It is conceivable that in the presence of the PS1 D385A mutant, all available aph-1 might become locked-up in the PS1 D385A mutant 440-kDa complex, which fails to further mature, thereby causing disappearance of the 150 kDa nicastrin-aph-1 complex.
A second observation of note in our results is the fact that the C-terminal fragments of APP arising from - and -secretase cleavage of the APP holoprotein (which are the substrates for presenilin-dependent -secretase cleavage) are not uniformly present in all of the presenilin complexes (see Figs. 3 and 4). In fact, the APP C-terminal stubs are most abundant in complexes associated with functional -secretase activity. The increase in apparent molecular mass between the non-functional complexes and the functional complexes cannot be accounted for by the simple addition of one molecule of C-terminal APP stubs per complex (although we cannot exclude the possibility that multiple APP stubs are docked onto functional complexes). However, the differential presence of APP-CTFs raises the intriguing and more plausible possibility that detergents and mutants associated with loss of -secretase activity have either: 1) altered the conformation and/or complex stoichiometry in a way that precludes efficient docking of substrates or 2) perturbed the binding of adapter molecules that might be required to allow substrate docking. In keeping with this hypothesis, recent cross-competition assays with different classes of -secretase inhibitors has supported the notion that the substrate binding and catalytic sites of -secretase may be physically separate and that correct conformational shifts are required to bring bound-substrate into the catalytic site (24).
In conclusion, our experiments suggest that the maturation and functional deployment of the presenilin proteins is more complex than has previously been thought. Our data raise the possibility that additional components may exist in the high molecular mass functional complexes. Our results also require a more detailed assessment as to whether all of the substrates that undergo presenilin dependent proteolysis are dependent on the same set of presenilin complexes or whether there are specialized complexes subserving cleavage of specific proteins. For instance, it is conceivable that the complexes may differ in componentry according to their subcellular distribution (e.g. lipid-rich raft domains, plasma membrane, endosomal-lysosomal pathway, or autophagic vacuoles (25 to 29)). If this were the case, such site-specific composition of the complex might confer either substrate specificity or preferred proteolytic cleavage sites within transmembrane domains and might therefore be potentially exploited therapeutically.
