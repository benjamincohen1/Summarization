Presenilin (PS1 and PS2) holoproteins are transiently incorporated into low molecular weight (MW) complexes. During subsequent incorporation into a higher MW complex, they undergo endoproteolysis to generate stable N- and C-terminal fragments. Mutation of either of two conserved aspartate residues in transmembrane domains inhibits both presenilin-endoproteolysis and the proteolytic processing of -amyloid precursor protein and Notch. We show that although PS1/PS2 endoproteolysis is not required for inclusion into the higher MW N- and C-terminal fragment-containing complex, aspartate mutant holoprotein presenilins are not incorporated into the high MW complexes. Aspartate mutant presenilin holoproteins also preclude entry of endogenous wild type PS1/PS2 into the high MW complexes but do not affect the incorporation of wild type holoproteins into lower MW holoprotein complexes. These data suggest that the loss of function effects of the aspartate mutants result in altered PS complex maturation and argue that the functional presenilin moieties are contained in the high molecular weight complexes.     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES
Presenilin 1 (PS1)1 (1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) (2, 3) are homologous polytopic transmembrane proteins that are components of independent, high molecular weight, heteropolymeric protein complexes (4, 5). Inclusion of presenilins into these complexes follows a tightly regulated pathway in which full-length presenilin holoprotein monomers are either incorporated into an immature (~180 kDa) complex in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (4, 5) or are degraded through a proteasome-dependent mechanism (6-8). Maturation of these early complexes in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi is associated with an increase in apparent molecular mass (to ~250 kDa) (4, 5), and with an endoproteolytic cleavage of the presenilin holoprotein to render N- and C-terminal fragments (PS-NTF and PS-CTF, respectively) (9). Because the stoichiometry and abundance of the PS-NTF and PS-CTF are tightly regulated even when driven by exogenous transgenes, it has been speculated that the limited abundance of another unknown component of the presenilin complexes restrains the amount of presenilin that can be stabilized in complexes (10). As a result, when overexpressed, exogenous presenilins compete for this unknown limiting factor and displace endogenous presenilin moieties (10). This schema is depicted in Fig. 1.

PS holoprotein (full-length PS (fl-PS)), NTF and CTF, -catenin (-cat), and other uncharacterized proteins, one of which is a putative "unknown limiting factor" (ULF) present in both PS1 and PS2 complexes, are functional components of the presenilin complexes (27). Overexpression of PS1 or PS2 has previously been shown to displace endogenous presenilin, presumably by competing for the putative unknown limiting factor. Arrows depict the site of Notch cleavage and sites of - and -secretase cleavages of APP; shaded boxes represent the liberated products derived from these cleavages.
The presenilins play a role in proteolytic cleavage within the transmembrane domains of other proteins such as Notch (11-14), -amyloid precursor protein (APP) (15-20), and endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor/endoplasmic reticulum resident transmembrane kinase (Ire1p) (21, 22). The precise role of PS1 in this unusual form of proteolytic processing is unknown. Mutating either of the two conserved aspartate residues within transmembrane domains of PS1 (Asp257 and Asp385) or PS2 (Asp366) inhibits the endoproteolytic cleavage of the mutant presenilin and reduces the intramembranous cleavage of APP and Notch (23-25). It has been proposed that mutation of these aspartate residues has a dominant negative effect on a catalytic site and that the presenilins are aspartyl proteases (23). One observation possibly inconsistent with this hypothesis is that whereas PS1/, PS1 aspartate mutant, and PS2 aspartate mutant cells all have impaired -secretase activity, PS2/ cells have normal -secretase activity (24, 26). Consequently, PS aspartate mutations were investigated for their effects on the formation of presenilin complexes.
We used glycerol velocity fractionation to determine whether mutation of these aspartate residues affected the native state of the presenilins. We show that these mutations preclude inclusion of the aspartate mutant presenilins into higher molecular weight complexes, an effect that is independent of presenilin endoproteolysis. We also show that overexpression of aspartate mutant presenilins displaces endogenous PS1 and PS2 from the high MW PSI-NTF- and -CTF-containing complexes but does not alter their incorporation into the lower MW holoprotein-containing precursor complexes. Taken together, these structural effects on presenilin complex formation explain all previous observations without the need to postulate a novel catalytic activity for these residues. These results also argue that the low MW holoprotein complexes, regardless of whether they have wild type PS1/PS2 or aspartate mutant PS1/PS2, are nonfunctional intermediaries between PS monomers and PS-NTF CTF-containing higher MW functional complexes.

We generated HEK293 cells (using LipofectAMINE transfection) and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (using the CLONTECH replication-defective recombinant retroviral system) stably or transiently overexpressing cDNA constructs corresponding to: wild type human PS1 (PS1wt), a FAD-associated clinical mutation causing missplicing of residues 290-319 encoded by exon 10 (also termed exon 9) (PS1E10), aspartate mutant human PS1 (PS1D257A and PS1D385A), an exon 10 splicing mutant cDNA containing the PS1D385A mutation in cis (PS1E10  D385A), PS2wt, or the PS2D366A mutant (16, 23, 24, 27). We elected to investigate the Asp  Ala mutants because the change in both the size and charge of the amino acid would maximize our ability to detect structural effects, which we would predict to be subtle because the aspartate mutant PS1 molecules are not destabilized and degraded.
Expression of PS1, PS2, or one of their mutants was investigated by standard Western blots as described (16, 24, 27). Biochemical subcellular fractionation was performed on a step gradient consisting of 1 ml each of 30, 25, 20, 15, 12.5, 10, 7.5, 5, and 2.5% (v/v) iodixanol (Accurate, NY) in homogenization buffer (130 mM KCl, 25 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4) as described previously (20, 28). Discontinuous sucrose gradient fractionation was performed as described previously (4). Glycerol velocity gradient centrifugation was performed on cells lysed in 1.0% digitonin buffer as described previously (4). Fractions were collected, and the proteins in each fraction were separated on Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Novex), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore), and the Western blots were probed with appropriate antibodies and detected using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each fractionation experiment was performed multiple times on PS1D257A, PS1D385A, PS1wt, PS1E10, PS1E10  D385A, PS2wt, or PS2D366A cells in parallel experiments. Molecular mass marker proteins (cytochrome c, 12 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 69 kDa; -amylase, 200 kDa; apoferritin, 443 kDa; thyroglobulin, 669 kDa) were included in each gradient fractionation to allow direct comparison of fraction run in parallel as described previously (4). In studies using transiently transfected cells, the location of the endogenous presenilin complexes in the untransfected cells within the culture served as an additional internal control. Antibody Ab14 (rabbit polyclonal to PS1-NTF), antibody NT1 (mouse anti-human PS1-NTF monoclonal), rabbit polyclonal anti-PS1-CTF antibody, DT-2 (mouse anti-human monoclonal to PS2), and antibody 369 (to - and -C-terminal stubs of APP) have been reported elsewhere (9, 29).     RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES
Initial characterization of our cell lines overexpressing wild type human PS1 (PS1wt), wild type PS2 (PS2wt), aspartate mutant PS1 (PS1D257A and PS1D385A), or aspartate mutant PS2D366A confirmed previous reports of the effects of overexpression of aspartate mutant PS1/PS2 proteins (23, 24). Thus, overexpression of human PS1D257A or human PS1D385A in MEF lines resulted in the expected "displacement/replacement" of the endogenous mouse PS1, inhibition of the endoproteolysis of the aspartate mutant human PS1, and inhibition of -secretase cleavage of endogenous mouse APP to levels comparable to those in fibroblasts from homozygous PS1-null (PS1/) mice (Fig. 2) (23). However, note that the human specific PS1 antibody NT1 (29) did detect small amounts of the PS1D257A and PS1D385A proteins as processed fragments (Fig. 2). A levels were too low to measure in MEF cells. However, expression of PS1D257A and PS1D385A in HEK293 cells overexpressing APPSwedish drastically reduced both A40 and A42 (not shown). Similar effects were detected when the PS2D366A mutant was overexpressed in HEK293 cells (not shown) and have already been published (24).

Immunoblots of cell lysates (50  microg/lane) from vector-infected (mock, lane 2), wild type human PS1 (lane 1), PS1D257A (lane 3), PS1D385A (lane 4), and PS1/ (lane 5) fibroblasts. The upper panel was probed with a human-specific PS1 monoclonal antibody NT1. The middle panel was probed with anti-PS1 CTF, which detects both human and mouse PS1 C-terminal fragment (note that the endogenous murine PS1-CTF can be distinguished from the human PS1-CTF by its lower apparent molecular weight). The bottom panel was probed with Ab369 that detects the C-terminal - and - stubs of endogenous mouse APP.
Glycerol velocity gradient analysis revealed that both the PS1wt N- and C-terminal fragments (Fig. 3A), and the PS2wt N- and C-terminal fragments (Fig. 3F) were predominantly present in ~250-kDa complexes. The holoproteins of PS1wt (Fig. 3A) and PS2wt (Fig. 3F) were observed within lower molecular weight complexes. These results are in agreement with previously published data (4, 5). In contrast, the aspartate mutant presenilins were predominantly present as holoproteins located in the lower molecular weight fractions (PS1D257A, Fig. 3B; PS1D385A, not shown; PS2D366A, Fig. 3E). Longer exposures also revealed trace amounts of the aspartate mutant holoproteins distributed into fractions of much higher molecular mass (250 kDa) than the mature wild type presenilin NTF CTF complexes (not shown). Quantitative image analyses (Fig. 3, G and I) confirm these results.

The presenilins interact with -catenin and, in brain, with neuronal plakophilin-related armadillo protein (NPRAP)/-catenin, which are components of both the immature holoprotein PS1 complex and the mature NTF CTF PS1 complex (4, 30, 31). Immunoprecipitation studies showed no obvious alteration in the affinity of PS1 aspartate mutants for -catenin (Fig. 4). This result is not unexpected because the presenilin aspartate residues are in transmembrane domains, whereas -catenin interacts with the cytoplasmic hydrophilic domain between transmembranes 6 and 7 (31). The identity of proteins uniquely present in the high molecular weight complex has not yet been established. Consequently, we cannot directly test the possibility that the aspartate mutations might impede interactions with components putatively unique to the high MW complex.

Lower panel, anti--catenin IP products showing equivalent amounts of -catenin were precipitated from the lysates.
Biochemical fractionation studies using either discontinuous sucrose gradients or iodixanol gradients revealed that the aspartate mutant presenilin holoproteins were distributed in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, smooth endoplasmic reticulum/endoplasmic reticulum-like, and Golgi fractions (data not shown). Although this is slightly different from the distribution of wild type presenilin holoproteins (predominantly rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum/endoplasmic reticulum-like fractions) (4, 32), it overlaps that seen for the Alzheimer-associated PS1E10 mutant (5, 33) (which supports increased -secretase activity but which does not undergo endoproteolysis (9)).
The aberrant glycerol velocity gradient fractionation profile of aspartate mutant presenilins might be because of either of two distinct mechanisms. The aspartate mutant presenilins might be excluded from the mature, larger complexes (e.g. possibly because of failure to interact with components selectively present only in the mature complexes). Alternatively, it could be argued that it is their failure to undergo endoproteolysis, which inhibits their inclusion in the mature fragment containing complex. To discriminate between these possibilities, we compared the fractionation profiles of the Alzheimer-associated PS1E10 mutant with that of the same construct containing a PS1D385A mutation in cis (PS1E10  D385A) (which has already been shown to inhibit -secretase (23)). PS1E10  D385A and PS1E10 were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, and their distributions on glycerol gradients were analyzed using the endogenous PS1 complexes in untransfected cells within these cultures as internal controls. In agreement with previous reports (5), the uncleaved PS1E10 was detected in gradient fractions that overlapped that of the endogenous mature PS1 NTF CTF high molecular weight complex (Fig. 3C), indicating that the PS1E10 holoprotein is appropriately integrated into the mature higher molecular weight complex. In contrast, the PS1E10  D385A holoprotein predominantly exists in the lower MW fractions (Fig. 3D). As with the PS1D385A mutation, longer exposures detected trace amounts of the PS1E10  D385A holoprotein in fractions of much higher molecular mass (250 kDa) than those containing the mature PS1wt complex. Quantitative image analyses again confirm the distinct but overlapping distributions of holoprotein- and NTF CTF-containing complexes (compare Fig. 3, G, H, and I). Cumulatively, the present results suggest that the effect of the PS1D385A mutation on complex formation is independent of endoproteolysis.
Finally, to address the question of how aspartate mutants (and especially PS2 aspartate mutants) might suppress normal -secretase activity, we examined endogenous PS1 levels in cells overexpressing the PS2D366A mutation (Fig. 5A). Conversely, we also analyzed endogenous PS2 levels in cells overexpressing the PS1D385A mutation (Fig. 5A). In agreement with prior studies on overexpression of wild type presenilins (10), these experiments showed that overexpression of either wild type or aspartate mutant PS2 displaced and destabilized endogenous PS1 and vice versa. However, the displacement phenomenon induced by overexpression of either wild type or aspartate mutant presenilin proteins mainly affects the formation of NTF CTF fragment complexes. Thus the amounts of endogenous PS1 holoprotein detected upon overexpression of aspartate mutant PS2 is relatively unchanged despite nearly complete suppression of endogenous PS1 fragment formation (Fig. 5A). Similarly, overexpression of aspartate mutant PS1 shows persistence of endogenous PS2 holoprotein expression but suppression of endogenous PS2 NTF CTF formation (Fig. 5B).

Note suppression of PS1-NTF but not of full-length (FL) PS1. In both panels there is lesser suppression by wild type presenilins. B, long exposure blot showing that endogenous PS2 holoprotein expression is not significantly affected by PS1D385A overexpression. Note that the background in lane 2 is spillage from lane 1 and is not a consistent feature.
The persistent endogenous presenilin holoproteins detected in aspartate mutant expressing cells could exist either as monomers or be incorporated into the low MW holoprotein complexes. To resolve this, we examined the abundance and size distribution of endogenous PS1 holoprotein epitopes in PS2D366A cells and in control cells expressing endogenous PS1. These studies revealed that the abundance and size distribution of endogenous PS1 holoprotein epitopes were identical in PS2D366A cells and in wild type control cells (Fig. 6). In contrast, the abundance of PS1-NTF in the higher MW fractions was dramatically reduced compared with wild-type control cells (Fig. 6). This observation supports the argument that the aspartate mutant holoprotein blocks maturation of endogenous presenilin holoprotein complexes and that it is the loss of the higher molecular weight endogenous NTF CTF-containing complex that likely causes the loss of function effect.

CONCLUSIONS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES
Two lines of evidence from our data support the notion that mutation of conserved intramembrane aspartate residues of either PS1 or PS2 has structural effects on the normal presenilin protein complex formation. First, these mutations are associated with failed maturation of aspartate mutant presenilin protein complexes such that the majority of aspartate mutant presenilins remain in the smaller (immature) holoprotein-containing complex. This failure of aspartate mutant PS complexes to mature into the higher molecular weight forms cannot be ascribed simply to failure of presenilin endoproteolysis. Even when the PS1D385A mutant is placed within the PS1E10 protein, which does not require endoproteolysis for biological activity, the chimeric PS1E10  D385A protein does not mature and has impaired activity. The most parsimonious interpretation of these results is that the aspartate residues are important in the formation of intra- or intermolecular interactions in the mature presenilin complexes. For instance, the aspartate residues might be involved in the interaction of presenilins with as yet unidentified membrane-bound proteins specific to the higher molecular weight mature complex.
The second line of evidence, which supports a structural effect of these mutations, is our observation that a minor proportion of the aspartate mutant proteins are dispersed into fractions of much higher MW than the fractions containing the physiological wild type high MW presenilin complexes. The presence of trace amounts of the aspartate mutant presenilins in very high molecular weight fractions might reflect either altered interactions within the lipid bilayer (causing altered apparent buoyancy in the glycerol gradient) or more probably the retention and/or recruitment of additional proteins that are not normal components of the mature high molecular weight PSwt complexes.
Whereas inhibition of physiological complex formation would by itself be sufficient to explain the loss of function effects of these mutations, our observations also suggest a secondary effect that provides a simple and robust explanation for the disparity between the functional consequences of PS2/ and PS2D366A mutations. Overexpression of aspartate mutant PS2 massively suppresses formation of the endogenous PS1 fragment-containing complex, presumably therefore leaving cells expressing the PS2D366A mutation with no functional PS1 or PS2 activity. Although it is difficult to precisely compare expression levels of aspartate mutant presenilins (which are detectable mainly as holoproteins) with those of wild-type presenilins (which generate both holoprotein and NTF CTF), it also seems that aspartate mutant presenilins might be more efficient at displacing endogenous presenilins than are wild type presenilins.
The final implication of our results is that the functional presenilin moiety is most likely to be the higher molecular weight NTF CTF-containing complexes. This is derived from the observation that overexpression of aspartate mutant presenilins massively suppresses formation of the endogenous presenilin higher MW NTF CTF-containing complexes but does not affect the formation or abundance of endogenous lower molecular weight holoprotein complexes. Because cells expressing aspartate mutant presenilins have reduced presenilin biological activities, this argues that the endogenous holoprotein complexes (whose abundance and size are unaltered) are not the biologically active complex. The alternate possibility (that aspartate mutant PS2 is forming nonfunctional hetero-oligomers with endogenous PS1) can be dismissed, because PS1 and PS2 form independent complexes and cannot be co-immunoprecipitated even when co-expressed in the same cell (4, 5, 10, 34). Finally, because this "displacement" event occurs after the formation of stable holoprotein complexes, it implies that there is likely to be a low abundance or labile intermediary complex (which cannot be resolved on the glycerol velocity gradients) prior to the formation of the stable high MW functional complex (see Fig. 1). We hypothesize that the aspartate mutant proteins reach this intermediary, displace the endogenous presenilins, but are then unable to proceed further (see Fig. 1). The hypothesis that the functionally active form of the presenilins is in higher MW complexes is in agreement with the discovery that PS1 NTF CTF (but not PS1 holoproteins) and -secretase co-elute on size exclusion chromatography in high molecular weight fractions (35).
Defective maturation of the aspartate mutant presenilins together with efficient displacement of endogenous presenilins by aspartate mutant PS1/PS2 holoproteins, fully explain both the absence of biological activity of the aspartate mutant presenilins and their apparent dominant negative effect on endogenous wild type proteins. Our results thus provide a complete explanation for the previously discordant observation that cells overexpressing PS2 aspartate mutant have impaired -secretase, whereas -secretase activity is normal in PS2/ cells (24, 26). In contrast, it is less obvious how loss of a catalytic site would block presenilin complex maturation or why it would cause more efficient displacement effects. Further biochemical dissection of the presenilin complexes and especially the higher molecular weight NTF CTF-containing complexes will likely identify proteins that are directly involved in the processing of APP, Notch, and endoplasmic reticulum-stress sensor/endoplasmic reticulum-resident transmembrane kinase.
