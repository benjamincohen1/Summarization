   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   PRL-releasing peptide (PrRP) is a novel anorexigen that reduces food intake and body weight gain in rats. In common with other anorexigens, PrRP mRNA expression is reduced during states of negative energy balance, i.e. lactation and fasting in female rats. In this study, we examined the interaction between PrRP and the adiposity signal, leptin, which interacts with a number of peptidergic systems in the brain to regulate energy homeostasis. Intracerebroventricular coadministration of 4 nmol PrRP and 1  microg leptin in rats resulted in additive reductions in nocturnal food intake and body weight gain and an increase in core body temperature compared with each peptide alone. We show also, by quantitative in situ hybridization, that PrRP mRNA is reduced in fasted male rats and obese Zucker rats, indicating that PrRP mRNA expression, like that of other anorexigens, may be regulated by leptin. Finally we show, using immunohistochemistry, that greater than 90% of PrRP neurons in all regions where PrRP is expressed contain leptin receptors. Thus, we provide evidence for PrRP neurons forming part of the leptin-sensitive brain circuitry involved in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis.
   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   PRL-RELEASING PEPTIDE (PrRP) was identified in 1998 as the endogenous ligand for the orphan GPR10/hGR3 receptor (1). Although it was shown to cause PRL release from cultured pituitary cells (1), the lack of immunoreactive fibers in the external region of the median eminence suggested that it does not act as a typical hypophysiotrophic hormone (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). These findings have been reinforced by a number of studies, which question PrRP s role in the modulation of PRL release in vivo and in vitro (6, 7, 8, 9). PrRP neurons are located in the dorsal medial hypothalamus (DMH), nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS), and ventrolateral medulla (VLM) (2, 10, 11), regions that are known to be involved in the regulation of food intake (for reviews, see Refs. 12 and 13). This suggested to us an alternative role in the regulation of energy balance. This was confirmed when we showed that intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of PrRP reduces normal nocturnal and fast-induced feeding, accompanied by a reduction in body weight gain, without causing taste aversion or disrupting normal feeding behavior (14, 15). Furthermore, PrRP mRNA is down-regulated in two states of negative energy balance in female rats: fasting and lactation (14).
Leptin is an adiposity signal, encoded by the obesity (ob) gene (16). It is produced primarily by adipose tissue but is also expressed by gastric parietal (17), skeletal muscle (18), and placental cells ( 19, 20). Leptin regulates food intake and energy expenditure through interaction with its receptors in the brain (for review, see Ref. 21). There are six known isoforms of the leptin receptor, Ob-Ra-e, but only the long form of the receptor, Ob-Rb, possesses the necessary intracellular domain to enable signaling through transcriptional pathways. There are two rodent models of defective leptin signaling: the Zucker rat and the db/db mouse, both of which are obese due to defects in Ob-Rb, which severely reduces their ability to respond to leptin (22, 23, 24). Ob-R transcripts and immunoreactivity are widely distributed in the rodent brain. In the hypothalamus, strong expression of Ob-R is seen in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), DMH, ventromedial nucleus, premammillary nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), lateral hypothalamus, and periventricular nucleus (25, 26, 27). In the brainstem, Ob-R mRNA is found in the NTS, medullary reticular nucleus, and the lateral parabrachial nucleus (25, 28). Ob-R is expressed by neurons that contain peptides known to be involved in the regulation of food intake. In the hypothalamus Ob-R is coexpressed with NPY (29), agouti-related peptide ( 30), POMC (31), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (32), and orexin/hypocretin ( 33, 34), thus providing morphological evidence for an action of leptin on neurons containing these orexigenic and anorexigenic peptides. Leptin has also been shown to interact with a number of these peptides in vivo to modulate food intake or mRNA expression (32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39).
In this study, we have examined the interaction between PrRP and leptin in vivo through an examination of their effect on nocturnal food intake, body weight gain, and core body temperature following their coadministration. We have looked at the distribution of PrRP with Ob-R or tyrosine hydroxlase (TH) using double-fluorescence immunohistochemistry in the DMH, NTS, and VLM to ascertain whether there is the morphological basis for an interaction. Also, an acute and a chronic model of energy imbalance, the fasted rat and the obese Zucker rat, have been used to examine the regulation of PrRP gene expression.
   Materials and Methods Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   Animals and materials Unless stated otherwise, all experiments were performed on adult, male Sprague Dawley rats (250 to 300 g, Charles River Laboratories, Inc. Sandwich, UK). Adult, male, obese (fa/fa; 415 to 480 g) or lean (fa/+; 280 to 350 g) Zucker rats were a kind gift from AstraZeneca Plc (Alderley Park, UK). Animals were kept in a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle (lights on, 0800 to 2000 h) at 21 C  plus or minus  1 C with 45  plus or minus  10% humidity, with ad libitum access to food and water. All experiments were performed in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986). Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (Poole, UK).
Coadministration of leptin and PrRP Animals had lateral ventricular cannulae inserted [0.8 mm posterior and 1.5 mm lateral to bregma and 3.0 mm below dura (40)] under 2.5% halothane (AstraZeneca Plc, Macclesfield, UK) anesthesia. During anesthesia, precalibrated, remote radiotelemetry transmitters (TA10TA-F40, Data Sciences International, Minneapolis, MN) were implanted into the peritoneal cavity. The animals were allowed to recover and experiments were performed 1 wk later. They were then housed individually at 1000 h and left to acclimatize. During the hour before lights out (2000 h), the conscious, unrestrained animals received one of the following treatments icv, 4 nmol PrRP (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31) in 2  microl sterile water (Peptide Inc., Osaka, Japan) and 2  microl isotonic saline (leptin vehicle); 1  microg recombinant murine leptin (a kind gift from AstraZeneca Plc) in 2  microl isotonic saline and 2  microl sterile water (PrRP vehicle); 4 nmol PrRP (2  microl) and 1  microg leptin (2  microl) together; or 2  microl of each vehicle. Total injection volume was 4  microl (n = 5 to 6 per group). Core body temperature was measured continuously throughout the 12-h dark period. Food and water intake and body weights were measured 12 h after treatments.
In situ hybridization Animals were allowed free access to food, except for the fasted group, before they were killed by cervical dislocation and decapitation (n = 6 per group for the fed/fasted experiment and n = 8 per group for the lean/obese Zucker experiment). The fasted group first had food withheld for 48 h. Coronal brain sections (15  microm) through the DMH [bregma -3.60 mm to -4.16 mm (40)] and NTS/VLM [bregma -13.30 mm to -14.60 mm (40)] were collected onto Polysine slides (BDH, Poole, UK). Oligonucleotide probes against PrRP (a 1:1 mixture of 5'-tag cag cag caa gca cag aag cca cgt ctt cag ggc-3' and 5'-tta tcc acg ctg aga gaa ctt ggt gcg tcc atc cag-3') or NPY (5'-gga gta gta tct ggc cat gtc ctc tgc tgg-3') were labeled with 35S deoxy-ATP (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA). Following hybridization, slides were washed at a final stringency of 1x SSC at 55 C, and developed with photographic emulsion (Ilford Imaging Ltd., Knutsford, UK). The resulting silver grains were quantified using a computer based analysis system, Northern Eclipse (Empix Imaging Inc., Mississauga, Canada). A minimum of four sections per animal for the DMH, and four to six sections for the NTS/VLM, were analyzed. Cells were deemed to be PrRP positive if they contained greater than three times the background number of silver grains (determined from negative control slides hybridized with excess unlabeled probe).
Double-fluorescence immunohistochemistry Animals were deeply anesthetized using sodium pentabarbitone (Sagatal, 100 mg/kg; Rhone Merieux, Harlow, UK) before undergoing transcardial perfusion with heparinized (100 kU/liter) isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. The brains were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 2 h before cryoprotection in 30% sucrose. Twenty-micrometer coronal brain sections were incubated in a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the human PrRP sequence (1:1,000; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Belmont, CA), followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled donkey antirabbit IgG complex (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). The sections then underwent incubation in goat anti-leptin receptor antibody (1:500, M-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and a Texas Red-labeled donkey antigoat IgG complex (1:500; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) The primary antibody recognizes both the long and short forms of the leptin receptor. For TH and PrRP double immunohistochemistry the above procedure was repeated with the Ob-R antibody replaced by mouse anti-TH (1:4000, Mab 318; Chemicon International Inc., Harrow, UK), horse antimouse biotinylated IgG (1:200) and 2.6  microl/ml streptavidin-Texas Red complex (both from Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The specificities of each of the primary antibodies have been tested by their commercial producers and the cellular distributions of their staining in the brain correspond to in situ hybridization data. In addition, staining for the leptin receptor antibody was completely abolished following liquid-phase preabsorption with the peptide immunogen (sc1834P; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; results not shown). Double immunohistochemistry was assessed by scoring the number of cells per section that showed specific immunoreactivity for PrRP, with or without Ob-R or TH and the number of neurons that displayed immunoreactivity for both. Only sections in which PrRP neurons were found were included in this analysis.
Statistical analyses All data are expressed as mean  plus or minus  SEM. Food intake and body weight measurements were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey s post hoc test. Core body temperature data were analyzed using the area under the curve (AUC) from 2 h to 12 h [AUC, in degrees Celsius (C)/h] followed by a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett s multiple comparisons post hoc test. Analysis of core body temperature was performed from 2 h to avoid the transient hypothermia that occurs following administration of PrRP (14). In situ hybridization data were analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test.
   Results Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   The effect of coadministration of PrRP and leptin on nocturnal food intake and body weight Administration of PrRP (4 nmol; icv) alone caused a 24% reduction in food intake over the 12-h dark period (Fig. 1A; P  <  0.05 compared with vehicle). This reduction in food intake was accompanied by a 56% reduction in overnight body weight gain (Fig. 1B; P  <  0.05 compared with vehicle). Rats injected with leptin (1  microg; icv) ate 18% less food than the control group, but this did not quite reach statistical significance with the post hoc test. However, leptin did produce a significant 55% reduction in overnight body weight gain (Fig. 1B; P  <  0.05 compared with vehicle). Coadministration of PrRP and leptin caused a 54% reduction in food intake indicating an additive effect of the two peptides (Fig. 1A; P  <  0.001 compared with vehicle, P  <  0.01 compared with leptin alone and P  <  0.05 compared with PrRP alone). This was also reflected in the data for body weight gain because animals that received both PrRP and leptin showed a net loss in body weight over the same period (Fig. 1B; P  <  0.001 compared with vehicle and P  <  0.05 compared with leptin alone, but not significantly different when compared with PrRP alone).

Data are expressed as mean  plus or minus  SEM, n = 5 to 6.
  The effect of coadministration of PrRP and leptin on nocturnal core body temperature Remote radiotelemetry was used to measure the core body temperature continuously through the dark period of the animals used in the feeding study (values at 30-min intervals are plotted in Fig. 2). Injections were made just before lights out; thus, a normal, nocturnal rise in core body temperature is seen in both vehicle- and hormone-treated animals. Administration of leptin alone caused a slight hyperthermic response for the duration of the dark phase, compared with vehicle-treated controls, although this was not statistically significant in this experiment (Fig. 2A; AUC 2 to 12 h, vehicle 5.6  plus or minus  0.6 C/h; leptin 9.0  plus or minus  1.4 C/h, P  >  0.05). Administration of PrRP caused an initial rapid hypothermic response characteristic of PrRP (14), which reached a nadir at 30 min, after which time the animals displayed a small but significant hyperthermia (Fig. 2B; AUC 2 to 12 h, 9.6  plus or minus  0.5 C/h, P  <  0.05 compared with vehicle-treated animals). Animals that received PrRP and leptin showed the hypothermic response followed by an elevation in core body temperature compared with vehicle-treated animals, which was greater than for administration either PrRP or leptin alone (Fig. 2C; AUC 2 to 12 h, 10.9  plus or minus  1.3 C/h, P  <  0.05).

Core body temperature (C) was recorded continuously by remote radiotelemetry and the temperature change from basal values, calculated at 30 min intervals, were plotted over the 12-h dark phase. For ease of comparison, the trace for the control group has been included in each panel with one treatment group (mean  plus or minus  SEM, n = 5 to 6 in each group). See text for details of statistical analysis.
  The expression of PrRP mRNA in fasted and Zucker rats In the brain, PrRP mRNA was expressed exclusively in the DMH, NTS, and VLM of fed- and fasted-male rats. The negative control (excess unlabeled PrRP probe in addition to the radiolabeled probe) resulted in only background levels of silver grains, indicating that the signal was due to specific binding of the PrRP probe (results not shown). These data do not indicate absolute numbers of PrRP mRNA transcripts, but the number of silver grains does represent relative abundance. In each brain region where PrRP mRNA was detected, fasted animals showed a reduction in the number of silver grains per cell compared with ad libitum-fed controls (see Table 1A and Fig. 3. DMH; 32% reduction, NTS; 34% reduction and VLM; 55% reduction), though this reduction was statistically significant only in the case of the DMH (P  <  0.05). Fasted animals also showed a significantly reduced number of detectable cells per section expressing PrRP mRNA compared with ad libitum-fed control animals in each area (Table 1A, DMH 58% reduction, P  <  0.01; NTS 33% reduction, P  <  0.05; VLM 64% reduction, P  <  0.05). Expression of mRNA for the orexigen NPY in the ARC was used as a positive control. In agreement with the literature (41), fasted animals showed an increased level of NPY mRNA with respect to the number of grains per cell (fed 49  plus or minus  5 grains per cell; fasted 69  plus or minus  4 grains per cell; P  <  0.05) and the number of detectable cells per section (fed 61  plus or minus  5 cells per section; fasted 112  plus or minus  10 cells per section; P  <  0.01) compared with ad libitum-fed animals.

Insets are higher-magnification micrographs to show silver grains over individual cells. Scale bars, 300  microm.
  In obese Zucker rats, there was a reduction in the number of silver grains per cell in all regions examined (Table 1B and Fig. 3; DMH 43% reduction, P  <  0.01; NTS 82% reduction, P  <  0.001; VLM 68% reduction, P  <  0.001). There was also a reduction in the number of detectable PrRP cells per section in obese compared with lean animals (Table 1B; DMH 59% reduction, P  <  0.01, NTS 30% reduction, P  <  0.05; VLM 45% reduction, P  <  0.05). Expression of ARC NPY mRNA was used as a positive control again and, in agreement with the literature (42), showed an increased level of NPY mRNA with respect to the amount per cell (lean 35  plus or minus  3 grains per cell; obese 50  plus or minus  3 grains per cell; P  <  0.001) and the number of detectable cells per section (lean 39  plus or minus  3 cells per section; obese 56  plus or minus  6 cells per section; P  <  0.05) in obese compared with lean animals.
PrRP and leptin receptor (Ob-R) localization by double-fluorescence immunohistochemistry In agreement with our in situ hybridization studies, PrRP-immunoreactive neurons were identified exclusively in the DMH, NTS, and VLM. Figure 4 shows the localization of Ob-R visualized using a Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody and PrRP visualized using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody. In the DMH, there were a large number of cells expressing Ob-R and relatively few expressing PrRP. Almost all of the PrRP neurons in this region contained Ob-R, whereas the PrRP neurons accounted for less than one percent of the leptin-receptive neurons (see Table 2).

  In the brainstem, most PrRP neurons were found at the level of the area postrema or more caudally. No PrRP-immunopositive neurons were found rostral to the area postrema. Ob-R-expressing neurons were more abundant than PrRP-expressing neurons particularly around the level of the area postrema. Overall, the majority of PrRP-immunopositive neurons in the NTS contained Ob-R immunoreactivity (see Table 2 and Fig. 4). Conversely, just under a fifth of the Ob-R-containing neurons on these sections also contained PrRP immunoreactivity. In the VLM, nearly all of the PrRP neurons expressed Ob-R. In these sections, Ob-R expression was less widespread and approximately half of Ob-R-expressing neurons were found to contain PrRP immunoreactivity. Single immunocytochemsitry studies were performed for all regions and demonstrated that the colocalization seen was not due to antibody cross-reactivity (data not shown).
PrRP and TH localization by double-fluorescence immunohistochemistry PrRP neurons in the NTS and VLM also express TH immunoreactivity (3, 10, 43, 44, 45). In the present study, the majority of PrRP neurons in the NTS and VLM contained TH immunoreactivity (see Table 3 and Fig. 5). In sections of the NTS and VLM, at the same level as PrRP-immunoreactive neurons, approximately two-thirds of the TH-positive neurons also contained PrRP immunoreactivity.

     Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   The results of this study indicate a similarity in the actions of acutely administered PrRP and leptin and provides evidence for an interaction between the two peptides. Studies in vivo show that coadministration of PrRP and leptin caused an additive effect on reductions in food intake and body weight (Fig. 1). We have demonstrated previously, using pair-feeding experiments, that the reduction in body weight caused by PrRP cannot be explained solely by the reduction in food intake, and is likely to include an effect on energy expenditure (14). Here we show that the hyperthermic responses to PrRP and leptin, which are an indirect measure of increased energy expenditure, were also additive (Fig. 2). The interaction between these peptides appears to be additive rather than synergistic as the effect induced by coadministration of the two peptides was equivalent to the sum of the peptides administered alone. This additivity demonstrates that the effects of one peptide are not mediated by the other but does not define the level of interaction. At the present time, there are no known antagonists to the GPR10/hGR3 or leptin receptors, which would enable further clarification of this interaction.
The reduction in PrRP mRNA expression in fasted, male rats provides further evidence that PrRP is an anorexigen. This confirms our previous result in fasted female rats (14) and removes the complication of hormonal fluctuations because some studies report variations in PrRP mRNA levels according to the stage of the estrous cycle (46). We report also that PrRP mRNA is reduced in obese Zucker rats in each of the three areas of the brain where PrRP is expressed. This phenomenon has been reported for a number of other anorexigenic peptides including cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (32), POMC ( 47), and CRH (48). The reduction in PrRP mRNA in the models of energy imbalance used in this study may indicate that PrRP mRNA expression is regulated by leptin. We have localized leptin receptor immunoreactivity in PrRP neurons, which demonstrates that the regulation of PrRP mRNA could be achieved by a direct action of leptin on PrRP neurons.
In addition to containing Ob-R, PrRP neurons of the NTS and VLM also contain TH, as has been shown previously by others (3, 10, 43, 44, 45). The location of the PrRP neurons mainly in the caudal brainstem makes it likely that they are noradrenergic, rather than adrenergic, neurons. It has been reported recently that almost all TH-positive cells in the A1 and A2 regions express Ob-R immunoreactivity (49). This, combined with our findings indicating high levels of colocalization of PrRP with Ob-R and TH, suggests the presence of a subpopulation of noradrenergic neurons that express PrRP and Ob-R. Retrograde tracing studies have shown that the PrRP neurons of the NTS and VLM project to the hypothalamic PVN (44), where PrRP-immunoreactive fibers are detected (2). The PVN contains a major population of neurons containing the anorexigen, CRH, which has been reported to mediate some of the effects of leptin (50, 51). Thus, CRH neurons of the PVN may act as a point of convergence between various leptin-sensitive systems. We have shown that the peripheral satiety signal, cholecystokinin (CCK), activates PrRP neurons in the brainstem (15). Recent interest has focused on the ability of leptin to enhance the effects of CCK and vice versa (52, 53, 54). Although some of this cooperativity occurs at the level of the gut (55, 56), our results suggest that PrRP neurons in the brainstem may be another point of interaction of leptin on the CCK-mediated satiety pathway.
In summary, our studies suggest that PrRP interacts with leptin in the regulation of food intake and metabolism. The expression of PrRP mRNA is reduced in obese Zucker rats and fasted rats, indicating that leptin may be regulating PrRP s expression. In addition, leptin receptors are present on PrRP neurons in the DMH, NTS, and VLM, providing morphological evidence for a direct interaction. As with PrRP, a number of peptides that are coexpressed with Ob-R in hypothalamic neurons have been shown also to interact with leptin (29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34). Together, these data support the notion that leptin acts throughout the entire brain circuitry involved in appetite and body weight regulation.
